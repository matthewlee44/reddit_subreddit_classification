He’s a great guy, and we begin to get really close. 

At this time I was super done dating, I got out of a long term emotionally abusive relationship a year or so before and just wanted to be single and celibate for a bit so I could heal. 

He knew all about this, feelings seemed to keep growing for me but I was always afraid and pulled back. Just told him we are better as friends.  

Cut to a month ago, we hang out just the two of us for the first time in a while. Get drunk downtown, and then go back to my place. He finally kissed me, which he never tried before. We make out for a bit. 

Then suddenly he starts crying. I ask him what’s wrong, and he said “I’m still in love with someone else, my ex. I would die for her.” 

Then I decide to go to bed and he leaves. I tell him how confused I am and how I don’t understand that the first time we finally kiss and I open up, he says that. 

He did speak about her before every now and then about how she was borderline and suicidal. I also talked about my ex but when I asked forever ago if he still has feelings he said no. 

The next week, I tell him we probably wouldn’t work now after that because I don’t want to be a second option. He proceeds to say “I don’t love her anymore. I only think I do when I’m drunk sometimes. It’s rare that I feel that emotional drunk, it’s cause you were in my arms and the thought of falling for someone else, etc.”

I feel incredibly hurt right now. I really don’t think I can trust again. It’s always when I finally open up I’m not enough or I’m a placeholder.

So i’m a high schooler. freshman year. i’ve been talkin to this girl for about 3-4 weeks at school and over text. i’ve liked her for abt 2 weeks. she’s not super attractive or anything she just makes me feel good abt myself when i’m around her. She sends me soooo many mixed signals. for example last week it was cold and she asked for a hoodie. i didn’t have one on me. next day it’s no where near as cold like high 80s and she took the hoodie i had out of my backpack when i went to the bathroom. she kept it for 2 days then gave it back. another example is when we were talkin abt the homecoming dance she said she wasn’t planning on going with anyone but wanted to ask this boy out. after a bit of talking she said the kids name but said he doesn’t go to our school and she hasn’t talked to him for a while. so at that point i kinda gave up and jus said she should ask him out. she then said she never said she wanted to go with him. There are more examples i just don’t feel like re thinking abt them cuz it sucks. so anyways last night i asked her to the dance. she said she wanted to go as friends if she was allowed to go. i then said ok we’ll see and that i’m not even trying to do anything crazy with this jus go and have fun. i’m not the most attractive guy at school but i’m 6ft 150 lbs have a man bun ( she’s expressed that she loves the man bun) and am in better physical shape and looks then anyone in my grade ( honestly. i’m at a nerd school you have to apply to get in)

I think the reason why a lot of girls get boring messages like ""Hey"" or ""What's up?"" is because they're always the ones making the first move. Imagine being a waiter/waitress and you're asked to greet and impress tens of customers daily. Are you going to have the same enthusiasm and positive energy every time? Are you going to greet them with something unique every time that will impress them? The answer for most people is likely not and this is how it feels for guys on Tinder. Some women make the first move and I respect that, good on ya! But it becomes mentally exhausting after some time not to mention that you are expected to be unique and keep the conversation going.

Going back to the waiter/waitress situation, are you going to have the will to keep a positive conversation with a customer that replies with cold, single-word responses? Likely not too. But what about Bumble? Women are required to make the first move there. From my and other guys' experiences, we got lots of ""Hey"" ""What's up?"" opening lines.

Now, are there guys on Tinder that are holding their sosig and can't be bothered to be creative so they just send whatever first comes to mind even if it's utterly boring or even disgusting at times? Absolutely, there are a lot of guys like that. But there's always a few bad apples in the basket.

Now I'm a university student, and I'm attending the last year and yet, haven't made any friends there. there are some people I talk to, but I wouldn't consider them friends. sometimes I happen to say or do something stupid (or maybe only I think it's stupid), and then at home I'd think about how stupid that thing I said was and that I should've shut my mouth. before I go to bed, almost every night I think about things I said in the past, and how stupid they were.

As for my appearance, I'm pretty sure I'm somewhat good looking, even though sometimes I feel like I'm not attractive enough. Some girls even showed interest in me, but because my anxiety I didn't know what to do and I lost the chance. In my university there are lots of attractive girls, but the thing that holds me back, apart from my anxiety is that I'm afraid that she will find out about my virginity and reject me. The university I go to is small and we all know each other, so the thing I'm more afraid of is that she will tell other people about it and I don't want to be mocked. once I was talking with two female classmates and they were talking about a guy and how they discovered that he was a virgin. They started, laughing and I did the same, but deep inside I was dying.

This virginity situation of mine makes me feel very bad, the thing that makes me feel bad is not only the fact of not having sex, but also of not being able to have romantic relationships with girls, and not having the courage to ask out.

I'll start to say that the way apps work are not the only problem, and they reinforce some of the worst of US culture.

IMO, there are some things going on beyond the sheer number in the US app dating scene. Back in Brazil, I loved talking to other people (including my dates) about their app experience because I knew ours would be vastly different, I can confidently tell that women there also have the avalanche of likes, catfishes, raunchy, dick picks and everything. My last girlfriend showed me that I was the ""winner"" out of more than 300 matches in a few weeks and several dates.

But the very conservative culture in the US makes things so much worse. And this is pervasive, I relate to liberals here in the US and I'll tell you, this conservative way of seeing the world is very much internalized by even the most liberal women here. And this reinforces bad behavior in men and makes everything very exhausting to those who are willing to put the effort.

To give a two examples, one from the very beginning and other more advanced in the ""process"":

First, echoing the woman complaining about how exhausting the apps are for her, the sheer number reinforces bad behavior from men. I'm used to put a lot of effort in the messages. I read the profile, I send a first message trying to engage on what I found most interesting in her profile, I keep a nice, long profile, particularly on OkCupid.

This means I have to invest a lot at the first contact. And they mostly go ignored here. This is an incentive to not putting to much effort in each match or message and, of course, play with numbers. When I get some answer, than I start investing on that.

Of course, in a culture that womens are valued as ""prizes"" and men are ""conquerors"", this is the expected behavior from woman, and it is also the expected behavior from men. And the cycles go on.

To go out of the dating app scene let's talk about actual dating: from time to time I read some debate here or in other forums about kissing in the first date. And people who enjoyed the date but has a firm stance on not kissing on the first date. Or that they have to wait for the end of the date. I see people who are very liberal otherwise answering ""No"" to these things on OkCupid questions or writing about it on their profiles. And knowing how reddit (and particularly this subreddit) is liberal, seeing the comments to the posts also give me a sense that this is not some conservative or immature thing, it is just part of the culture here.

While I understand the insecurity of sharing intimacy and how in this different culture the meaning of kissing will be different, one most realize that this greatly shifts the full burden of keeping the dating dynamics to men. I have read the other person so much more, to understand if she is interested or not. I lack a firm confident way to understand that this person is not only enjoying my company, but is enjoying it as a date.

Even it the person is OK kissing on the first date, the culture around this meaning puts pressure on both people to make some pretty strong judgement calls too early. It's a kiss, to a couple this is as much part of the good time as laughing together, and people watching don't know if  you are in a first date.... and if they do, who cares?

When I arrived, I really hoped my extensive profile would signal I'm safe to talk to and at least give he a headstart in the conversation. Mind you, Brazilian culture is very conservative as well and woman there share much of the same problems as you do here, and I hoped a similar strategy would work here. Apparently not so much.

To put things in context, I'm male, between 35-40. Have had so far a very fulfilling emotional life, with long and short term relationships with some very different people, but all Brazilian like me. I'm very insecure, but not shy, so I usually rely on online date to get confidence that I'm not passing any boundaries.

I felt I genuinely was falling in love with her but through a series of poorly worded texts I ended up losing her forever... well I'm not sure, I do have one avenue for a follow-up (an e-mail she gave me when we were still on good terms). Should I do it? I honestly don't know...

Some background.

I met this woman (we'll  call her ""J"") two and a half months ago on OkCupid. She lives up state around 3.5/4 hours away so I thought that might be tricky but I messaged her anyway and she replied back. After 6 days of messaging on this platform I suggested I might be open to calls or texts, she let me know a few days later that she was ready. We had our first call and it was amazing (4 hours). She filled me in about just about everything her life, her interests, her family. There was a history of trauma, abuse and toxic people in her life that she was no longer on good terms with. We continued with this for the next month; daily texting starting first thing in the morning, and sharing about both of our lives. Phone calls also continued though not every day unless she needed support during rough times in her life. We had one dust up where she almost cut things off but this was because I was afraid of disclosing my herpes diagnosis. She completely understood and while she couldn't proceed  due to health concerns she agreed to be friends. Eventually we planned a visit at J's place and we had a great time. She complimented me on my intelligence and found me fascinating. She mentioned she didn't sense any red flags about me at all. While there I also fixed her computer and she was extremely happy with this. But something changed during the visit, I found her to be utterly attractive physically. In the following weeks I found myself falling for her beauty, intelligence (she could speak at length on almost any subject) and personality. So when I got back home I thought that since she was such a good host, it would only be polite to return the favor and invited her down to see me. This required arrangements due to her not driving (she was going to take a Greyhound Bus down). We started planning this long weekend and the fun an exciting things we were going to do (thrifting, going to an anime convention and visiting a local zoo). This was two weeks out and as each day passed I could sense she was getting more an more excited. We planned things out in more detail. On my end, I had work to do to make my place ready (as I was still in flux from moving in a few months ago). This required time, money, and effort on my part. Then (as J always has the habit of doing) she politely got me to disclose my romantic feeling for her on one of our calls. J admitted that if it wasn't for the herpes we'd be dating as the attraction was mutual. It was at this point I drew upon some workarounds to this issue that I had been brainstorming. Basically how to have safe sex with one partner being positive (mainly strategies to eliminate skin-to-skin contact). And to my shock she seemed intrigued by this, and stated we might  be able to make things work. Not only that but she'd disclose her decision on your visit. Things kept going smoothly over text and calls. I was there for her 3 days in a row over the phone when she was going through a rough point in her life; listening and lending an ear. 

What started the descent was her asking me to pose more questions about herself. I was a little worried about this because I felt like I knew everything about her and didn't want to tread the same ground. But ask I did, and things went okay at first and I felt she appreciated it. Then last Saturday I asked a question regarding cleanliness/messiness. I was a little confused because of the state of her apartment which I thought was due to chaos from her recent move as well. I could tell by the state of her bathroom that she probably pretty clean, but in my pressure to ask I went ahead with it. At first it seemed like we were having a dialogue on the subject on good terms. She mentioned that it triggered being disorganized triggered her OCD. Thinking I had a chance to relate to my own OCD traits, I shared with her on my own experiences. It was at that point J flatly replied that she thought the comparison was offensive. She felt my experiences were more paranoid than anything. When  she says things like this I take it to be a big deal. J then states she is having a bad day and may not text back in a timely manner. So I ask why she is not doing okay, and it turns out the cleanliness question did indeed ruin her day and her mood, she didn't tell me at the time. Eventually we both apologized and accepted each of our as we were both having a bad day (I was in an off mood as well). When she stated we should stop texting for the day and resume in the morning, I had a really bad feeling about it. To me it felt like this may be the end.

Next morning, I wanted to check in on how she was feeling and express contrition for the day before. So I added a sentence about being ""shaken up"" about hurting her. When she eventually texted back I got a ""sorry"" (thinking all is well), but no... She then abruptly took the relationship off the table because she wasn't in a good place to be with someone romantically that gets bent out of shape over something so minor and has to walk on eggshells around (though to me based on what she said on Saturday it was a big deal to her). At that point I made a mistake and tried to hedge/bargain for the relationship which she took as me manipulating her and not respecting her boundaries. She then starts rapid fire texting, giving me no time to think about what I want to say or collect my thoughts. What I could get in edgewise  seemed to trigger her even more and make things worse. I stated we should maybe step away from the conversation to cool down, but she had none of it.  Its at this point she takes the trip off the table, and starts calling me terrible things (""human filth"" was the mildest). She categorically devalues me as a person; attacking my self worth and suggests I give up on dating. She challenged me to show the texts to my therapist ""who'll call you out for being a POS"". Finally, she slams the door shut and blocked my number, leaving me no chance to make a final statement.

Since I was in love with her this felt like a true breakup, and I was shaken for days. I had to take time off work, and see my therapist. Like J said I showed them to her and was told I essentially did/said nothing wrong. Likewise all the friends I shared them with said the same thing. I'd really like to  get some unbiased feedback from the community on this and get called out if I did anything wrong so I can better learn from this experience. I've been slowly recovering from the breakup, later this week was better and I was back at work, but I'm still not 100%. Now I've been consumed by this almost obsession to send a final e-mail to J addressing some of the points after her texts upon reflection. I know she's cut me off so I worry she'll think this is stalking/harassment. I've been told just writing it out would be enough for closure but I think the act of sending would bring me peace, no matter what the response.  Sadly I'm not yet at the point where I'm at acceptance and have this  glimmer of hope that either she'll resume communication, or sending the e-mail would coax her back.

This week, there were times were I felt like another response from me wasn’t needed, I ran out of things to speak about. The last time I heard from him was Thursday, he is usually the first to see my Snapchat stories. I posted one yesterday morning and he didn’t view it until later in the day, I’m assuming he isn’t interested any longer. I don’t want to initiate going out today, when he asked about it last week he said he was going to sort out the reservation. I ended the plans conversation with “let’s aim for Saturday”. 

TL; DR: If it was still going to happen, I feel like a time to meet would have been sorted out now.

The entire time she’s been in a relationship with this guy and I always thought she was cute but I respected the relationship and we got along. She broke up with her bf bc she said she wants to live life and she just wasn’t happy anymore, and at first I was just kind of like why did you do that. What I didn’t get is how she could say that she was in love with her ex boyfriend but still wants to fuck around and just date around.

What also happened is that she was friends with this other guy while she was in a relationship and she was telling me how he was negging her, being touchy, and how she wasn’t into it at all and she had a bf at the time. Well she told me she ends up making out with this dude and I can’t believe that negging and just being persistent like that works. She has a lot of male friends for some reason but she’s not the type to sleep around and she’s only had sex with her one bf. 

Anyways, I told her all of this and she felt like I was judging her harshly (which maybe I was), so I apologized the next day. We were supposed to go out today as a group but I guess her ex came to see her and I texted her asking her if we were still on for today and she told me her ex came to see her and that all she said, so I replied that we didn’t have to go out today snd she didn’t reply to that for like an hour so I just went to chill with some other friends. She called me annoyed that I was doing something else and she ended up just staying home.

She’s been acting erratic, and like she said she wants new or more friends (little hurtful), she wants to do more things, but she’s the type of person who wants to be in charge and I’ve introduced her to a lot of people and she doesn’t value that. She was on her phone last time we went out with a group of people and I told her to put it away, but she was setting up plans for after when she could’ve just been in the moment. 

We went to a haunted house the other day and it was sort of weird. We interlocked arms and held hands while going through the rooms and I honestly liked it. I don’t really have a desire to have sex with her but I think I’m starting to care too much about her in a way. It’s all so weird and complicated and idk why her drama is affecting me, like I’m anxious rn bc I know she’s probably anxious and I don’t get why I’m like that. We’ve been friend for two years and I always felt like she was a bro but now all this drama and like it’s just weird.

I don’t know if I’d like it if I saw her with another dude which is why I wanted her to get back with her original bf to keep things the same in a way. This is a pretty close friend, we hangout like every week, I’m not going to reveal my feelings, but I’m thinking of distancing myself just for my sake.

I've gotten a few likes and matches, not too many tbh, but I think that's normal for a guy on these apps. I just can't do this for longer, matching with someone I'd actually be interested in could take months, and in just these few days I've felt my energy being drained swiping through countless girls, trying desperately to find a hint of compatibility in their bio's.

It's her first relationship (not even a casual fling or anything before) while I've had both casual and serious relationships before 

When we started off, I was a bit worried that I'll come off as a manipulator with great power imbalance because of it being her first. 

Frankly she does have certain instances where she blurted out ""I love you"" way before us knowing each other or crying badly on the first minor argument (not even a fight). I realized and understood the difference in maturity and we spoke and decided to work together on it.

Recently, however I've noticed she constantly gets bored. She's an introvert and doesn't talk much. She doesn't like watching movies which is like the best time pass if we don't wanna leave home. She doesn't have any hobbies apart from working (as a graphic designer) and sleeping.

She's not been out of home much so I tried to create special activities for us (like going to bowling, going for long drives) but it's like not very effective. I asked her directly what she enjoys which doesn't make her feel bored. Her response:- ""Sleeping""

Another short but unrelated thing is that she's been in a pretty conservative household. She's never been allowed to go out of home (except now since she works). So a lot of her firsts (like first outing, first theatre without parents etc have been with me). Though she keeps telling me she wants to do all kinds of stuff which she never really got the freedom for.

While I'm happy for her personal growth, I'm conflicted in 2 ways. At one point, advice suggests that I'm older and it's her first relationship so if anything, she'll be extra obsessed like the high school love.

The other getting bored and exploring makes me worried, the moment she tries new experiences, somehow I'll be a burden which stops her from exploring things.

For now, we both love each other. Our sexual and emotional chemistry is fantastic. I've met her parents and she's made me become a big part of her life.

On the date he kept on mentioning if i would consider moving to nearby cities instead of a few hours away, when he kept on bringing it up i didn’t understand why. So when we talked he said he didn’t want to be in a ldr which was understandable but i never cleared my side of the story, mostly because why would i tell a guy on a first date a complicated backstory. There’s a lot of layers to the moving story, but i still want to be close to where i live now, however on the date i spoke so passionately about a different city and he assumed thats where i plan to move to (its about 3 hours away)

So in general we both connected really well on many levels, i was super attracted to him and he said the same thing about me and he was so surprised at how alike we are. So the date wasn’t awkward at all and honestly he ticked so many of my boxes. I haven’t connected like this with anyone before. Since that night we haven’t spoken but we did say we are open to reconnecting again in the future. 

I am currently using dating apps and moving on but i still think about him. I do feel like we had such a good connection and related to each other in so many ways where we felt like we were the same person. I wish i cleared up my side of the story. 

I’ve been trying to move on but a part of me wants to reach out. There’s a huge what if playing in my head. If he had said to me i don’t feel connected to you or i don’t feel a spark, then I would have easily moved on, but i keep thinking because i never opened up to him (about my situation) and he got half the story, we could have been on a few more dates by now

so I met this lady at an event. She was always booked by a multitude of hungry followers, so I was not really into lining up as well. I find such situations really pathetic.

It just so happened though, that somebody else I had to talk to was next to her - and as she acknowledged me, she fully turned to me and from then on just talked to me. We fooled around, asked questions, whatnot. Finally the event had died down and we were ready to be going. As I did not want to come off as a creep, I did not ask to bring her home at first. I made some joke about a supermarket cart that stood around and said, that I could drive her home in that. She laughingly declined. I offered the car instead - and to my surprise, she said yes, although she was not very far from her place.

There was also a third person present. We were having a good time, laughing a lot, getting to know each other until finally, we arrived at her place. She made me stop some distance from her building. Although I felt it was kind of weird, I later assumed, she just didn't want me to know, where she lived. 

She thanked me for the time and the ride and I asked her, when I could see her again. She lit up and said, that she would really like that, but remained vague about the time. So I said, that it would probably make things easier, if we had each others contacts. To my surprise she cockily said something along the line, that that would make her boyfriend very unhappy and took of.

I guess she did not like me at all - but I still try to understand.

Why would she spend around 3 hours chatting and fooling around with me, unnecessarily making her way home a lot more inconvenient, when she was not interested in me?

I don't really believe, that she had a boyfirend (she had said things like 'I'm not behaving as badly as I'm talking' and similar) and if she actually had, that she could not care that much about him. 

It could also not have been about the attention - she left plenty of if just to chat and hang out with me.

I'm a rather social person  and I pride myself in reading signals correctly - I am pretty sure, we did exactly, what she wanted to do. So if she had wanted an earnest conversation, I would have immediately changed the style.

Keep reading it will get good lol.

I (26/F) have been on a dating site for about 2 weeks. One week in on Monday, I started chatting with a handsome guy (31/M) we exchanged numbers and planned a date for the weekend.  Since he lived over an hour away he agreed to meet me in the middle and offered to get me an Uber (I don't drive I live in NYC). We face timed right away to make sure each other were not catfishes. We texted and video chatted every day for the next 5 days. Some days when I took too long to reply he would double and triple text me. He seemed more into me than I was into him. Anywho, Friday comes and we confirmed the date. Didn't talk much because I went out with friends that evening. BOOM Saturday comes and he texts me first thing in the morning ""Good morning beautiful cant wait to see you tonight"" again, wanted to make sure we were still going to meet. He told me a time and I started to get ready. he then asked to facetime he wanted to see what I was wearing. (This is when I felt something wasn't right) I told him he would have to wait to meet me in person to see what I was wearing. I face timed him quick to tell/show him I was ready for him to call the uber. Mind you, he texted me many times that morning to make sure I was still coming, make sure I would be ready by 5 etc. He orders the uber and shares the ride with me. Made sure I was in the uber, we drove about 10 mins and he cancels the trip as we're on the highway. He texted me ""I just lost power Im sorry love, apologies for wasting your time."" Before I could reply he had me blocked on everything. Blocked number, blocked Instagram and dating profile. I have never felt physically ill from a situation but I instantly had a pit in my stomach. I was trying to breathe slow because I felt like I was going to throw up. I apologized to the uber driver and offered to give him cash to bring me back home.

I find that women (maybe men too?) put little to no effort into it. The trend seems to be that I have to keep the conversation going, be entertaining and witty at almost all times, or they stop responding. I think I'm a funny person but if you don't contribute to the conversion, I just end up asking questions which doesn't seem fun to anyone. And no one ever wants to meet up, even just 10-15 for coffee, girls never agree to go on a date which is exactly why I'm on a dating app. I'm not sexual or anything, we just talk for a couple days, I ask, they say no, and a couple days later they just stop

I don't live in a major city like LA, or New York, but one of the more populated areas in my state. I don't use tinder because that is like 10/1 men. I am on bumble, hinge, POF, ok cupid, and they all generally seem the same.

And he said he was on the same page and wanna grab a coffee with me.

I've never date or get intimate with anyone before. (I was hurt before from a tinder guy who I talked to for a year but he never make time to meet me). I'm still a virgin, but I know he is a lot more experienced than me. I was scared at first and wanted to take a rain check but I just went anyways. 

I didn't think it was a date. We met at a lunch place at 1pm. It was an opened place so I thought it was alright. I was going to sit opposite to him but he asked me to sit next to him. Soon, he started to wrap his arm around my shoulder and pulled me closer to him, I was a little shocked. He later touched my leg, pat my head etc. I could've said no, but I didn't wanna ruin it :( I didn't feel like him being so touchy in a place like that is good because I literally just came for a lunch and chit chat. Sometimes he was also quite disrespectful to me and make offensive jokes. I did find him attractive though but treated me like a baby... We only met for an hour and we part ways. 

He said next time let's meet at a bar, friday evening. I'm not sure if I should go. I do expect him to be more touchy. I do like it when it's just enough. But I do not want him to see me as an object/ touch inappropriately/ he just wants me for sex. I either want to make friends or get into relationships, but it seems that he was not on the same page and misinterpreted 'i'm not looking for anything' as I just wanted casual?

Anyways, I don't even know what I should do about this :( the fact I know that he's older and seems to know how to get a girl intimidated me especially when I have philophobia and scared of getting attached and getting hurt. I fall easily for a guy and only first meet? i can't stop thinking about him already. I know he followed lots of hot girls from tinder on his insta.. so it's not like he is only into me. I feel like if he just wants casual sex, any girl can give it to him. But I don't want to accidentally or being pushed into sex. I know I need to communicate this with him but What if he didn't even want sex and Im over think? I guess I do want to meet him but I can't let myself be in an alone place with him.

Just wanted to get y’all thoughts on this. I’m 20yo M in college and while I know some girls through a student org I wouldn’t really say im friends with them, more so just talk to them casually in the club meetings or social events. I don’t have any girls who I just hang out with as a friend. I have lots of friends in general, or male friends, and through them know some girls, but I don’t have any girls I like just meet up with as a friend. Is this a red flag or unattractive to women if they are looking at me for a potential relationship in the future? Is it a red flag that I only really hang out with guys/girls in big groups or only have guy friends, and no girl best friends? Just wondering cause I kinda got clowned for not having any “girls on speed dial” on my phone who I chat with.

Now with that been said a lot of what is attractive is universal.

That is to say the more attractive you the more option you have and the more you have to filter through to get the one you are attracted to.

He also warned me he’s super needy and attaches quickly so I was like ok. 

We talked about everything, he texted me every morning and pretty much all day, he kept telling me how he thought I was so special and he had a really good feeling about us, we even talked about the upcoming holidays and when it would be ok for him to meet my daughter, basically plans for the future. It was intense but I was here for it. 

It became physical after our first date (which was two weeks into talking) and we both talked about it and agreed we were ready for it. Then the next week I left town for lwork, he barely texted, had a bad day at work, didn’t feel good, he didn’t charge his phone, etc, of course I felt him being off w me so as most girls, I started freaking out, he was so into me and now all of a sudden he’s barely texting me. He said it was bc he was dealing w life and work issues so I tried to be supportive and told him I could give him space or talk to him about it whichever he needed. He’s a bit lost w his career and I know he was struggling w that, I’m the opposite I’m thriving in mine and had a really good high-paying job which he swore would never been an issue for him. 

We were supposed to have a date on Friday (he was even supposed to pick me up at the airport, his idea) and neither of those things happened so of course my insecure self finally opened up and I asked him if he was still into me etc and how I thought maybe sex ruined things… he didn’t respond so my neurotic self sent him like 5 more texts then finally he responded w the fact that “my freak out was turning him off” and how until I sent those messages he had every intention of dating me, so I didn’t text him anymore. 

Today I told him I felt hurt bc he made me feel like I could be myself (along w my anxiety and shitty love past which I told him al about) and now that I was being honest, it backfired on me. He apologized about making me feel bad but then went on to tell me that up until last night he did want to continue dating me but now he didn’t think he was ready to commit to someone like me. That he thought I was great, attractive, successful and another guy would be lucky to have me.

Of course I’m hurt, he’s the one that basically told me he thought I was the one for him and now suddenly he’s not ready for commitment or me. Did I fuck up bad? Will he come back if I give him space? Or am I better off.

Last time i went out with a group of old classmates (4boys,2girls) was around 4 years ago. After injurying my leg, i decided not to go out with them for 1-2 months, so they kicked me from the groupchat we had (one of the boys kicked me).

Before I begin, I’d like to preface this by saying this is mostly hypothetical, as the guy and I are NOT dating, nor have plans to, I just think I’m starting to feel that way. 

Hi, so I have been talking to this guy from work as a friend, and I think I might be starting to get romantic feelings for him as well. We’re going to make plans on hanging out soon ;as friends. However, I texted my friend (18nb/m) about it and he said that it’s kind of a big age gap for where I am in life rn. He said that if the guy happened to like me back, he would judge him because of my age. I’m wondering if he is correct. For context, this guy has only known me as an adult and he is also my sister’s age. I’ve also typically had older friends since starting to work, so it’s not really a big deal to me. I’m not the type to act like I’m such an adult just for being 19 years old, but I also don’t think I’m a child anymore.

TL:DR: girls who ghosted my tried to contact me to mess with my head to I use an alt account where she adds me and I annoy her and her mate so much to the point where I get the reason I was ghosted and make them both leave the group chat and block me. 

So, I was talking to this girls (let's call her, Bev) for around 5-6 months hat I had met on an app. It took me a while, but I was absolutely in LOVE with her, to the point where I was like ""yep, I really hope this is the one"".

So a few months go by and its going decently well (I didnt think much of her for the first 3 months or so), but by around June, I was practically mesmerised by her. 

Now, it's not like our chats were dead or anything, I thought they were going quite well (even if i did have to carry the convo sometimes). She even seemed to be decently interested! 

Now, fast forward to 1st of September 2021. I look at my phone. No reply. I just brush this off as her being busy or she wasn't awake yet. 

Now bare in mind that we had literally just met up for the first time in the 28th of August with her mate (who we will call Lucy), and I also personally think it went very well. We played mini golf and had sushi. It was just a very nice day! However, Bev and Lucy went to the toilet, and came back out with Lucy on the phone saying that she had to go back (I did notice this as a red flag at the time, but didn't want to believe it).

Anyway, back to September 1st. The day goes by and she hasn't messaged my for nearly a full day, so naturally I get quite worried. I then check the app that we were talking on originally (as we had moved to snapchat) to find that I had been supposedly blocked! 

Bow im not gonna lie here. This was the scariest moment of my life since my mom broke her back (first true panic attack I'd had in years). I ask my mate what to do as I'm literally shaking (opportunities like this don't come round often for me). He advises that I message her again, so I do, asking if she's OK.

A few more hours go by and she actuslly DOES reply! She basically says that, and I quote, ""im so sorry, im not in a very good place right now and I'm taking a break off social media which is why I deleted almost everything"" (but saying that doesn't excuse the blocking, though I let it slide).

A few more days pass and then I find she blocks me on snapchat too. Now obviously I'm here like what on earth is going on?

So, I message Lucy (the mate she brought with her) basically asking her whats up with Bev. Now this bit is what truely irked me was that her excuse was that Bev got hit by a tesco van and is in a coma... yeah no, im NOT believing that, so I bring her up on it. She basically carries on like ""I knew her for longer than you, how could you say I'm lying, etc, etc. I eventually just end up leaving it.

I do one last check on an alternate account to see if she's still alive and active, and ofc she is (but I already knew that).

A few more weeks go by and and im not gonna lie, I feel depressed as hell. I cant go a day without thinking about what happened and it feels like its getting worse.

But then at around mid-late August, I get a message from a lad on that app, who mustve added me by search, because I had female only swipes on (let's call him Jake). He pops up to me asking me if I was to go up the city centre to play mini golf (red flag), but naturally, I ignore it.

A few days later, Jake pops up again apologising for not introducing himself first (which is fair, so I just start speaking to him normally). However, as we were speaking, he kept on bringing things up in passing which were very similar to Bev's bio on the app (such as ""gimme fun facts"" or ""I'll rate your tesco meal deal""). Once again, huge red flag, but I play along.

But then, one day he asks for advice. He says to me that his friend had died after getting hit by a tesco van outside of school and that his mate has to prepare a speech and she needs Jack's help. Now, Jack also states that she is ginger... Lucy is also ginger, and her being ginger was almost like a little inside joke.

So naturally at this point I stop playing along and confront him about all this what he's saying, but he denies every claim and calls me a weird stalker... eventhough he messaged me first. I knew it was someone in close connection to Bev, but I didnt know if it was Bev herself. 

So another couple weeks go by and nothing really happens until today (or rather yesterday as I'm writing this is 1:47am). For a little bit more context, I made an alt account ages ago when I was trying to still get back into contact with Bev to get answers about why she ghosted me. It turns out that she added this account back today, and messaged me. She was joking around at first and I played along. But then all of a sudden, she messages me saying ""Fuck off (my name), I dont wanna talk to you anymore"".

This was a suprise to be sure, but expected to be honest, even though she messaged me first.

Ok, what im about to do next might be a little bit of a dick move, but hear me out. I knew this was the PERFECT opportunity to get answers about what happened, so I pretended to be one of my mates and called myself Connor.

*IMPORTANT: please note that everything i say to them from now on is not through my normal account, but the account where I pretend to be my mate*

So, now that Bev thinks I'm Connor, I basically explain to her how I feel right now, but in 3rd person as if I were actually my friend. I write a decently long paragraph explaining myself, and all she can reply with is ""k... isn't my fault, lol"".

All of a sudden, I get a friend request from a new person who I'll call Jessie. Jessie messages me and keeps telling me to go away and to stop harassing Bev (which in reality, it was the other way round). We argue back and forth about this.

Then I see that I've been added to a group chat, and who do I see in there too? None other than Jake and Lucy. So its basically a 1v4 at this point. But I dont look at it for 40 minutes.

Now I'm not proud of this next bit, but im happy about it.  I now realise that I'm not gonna get any answers out of Bev without forcing it out of her through anger. So u made it my mission to rub them the wrong way them as much as possible.

This process of just absolute trahstalking would make a halo 3 lobby proud. But eventually I ask Bev directly what was wrong with me, and after 1 and a half months, I get my answer... apparently I was creepy and smelled like piss(?) Well no, what actually happened was that it was almost 30°C out and that i was extremely nervous... oh, and I also sweat easily (but its not like I didn't even shower, I put deodorant, after shave and antiperspirant on too, and I thought I smelled fine). 

In this chat, Be said ""you know whats pathetic? Him having Depression 😢💔⛓"". I never said I HAD depression, just that I was in a depressive state because of the whole situation. 

Oh and theres that I apparently had dead texts, even though I was carrying the convo most of the time. 

Eventually it got to the point where I had made them so annoyed after ripping into them both (Bev and Jessie who were the main ones speaking at that time) to the point that they blocked me and left the group chat. Mission accomplished :).
