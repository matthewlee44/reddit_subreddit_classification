Even so, after emailing for a week or so, if a guy wants to meet, I usually suggest a Zoom or Facetime for the first meeting. I figure this is a safe way to see if we have an initial face to face connection before meeting in person. Then if we both agree we do, I usually suggest we meet outside…like outdoor dining, walk, etc. Obviously if we start seeing each other, we can expand, but even with being vaccinated, I’m remaining vigilant during such early stages. I wondered how others are navigating dating during this time and some of your experiences.

On a related note, has anyone found that Covid actually helps you weed people out? I do express to dates that even though I’ve had the vacccine, I have a vulnerable immune compromised family member, and a good friend who is vaccinated yet got very sick with a breakthrough Delta infection. Despite this, I had one guy pretty much tell me he was vaccinated and not afraid of covid, so I could screw my zoom dates because he wanted in person companionship. I had another say we would not match because he wasn’t vaccinated and didn’t plan to be. I was shocked at the bluntness, but I guess it avoided wasted time with either of them.

I just don’t know what it means!! I (43F) am a casual OLD user. Once in awhile I browse, but really am not impressed &amp; frankly I’m very focused on my career. So I logged into Hinge to show my boss what’s out there and saw that one of my FB friends (41M) liked my pic on there. What?! Why?! Like I said, we’re connected on FB &amp; Messenger, so it’s not like he didn’t have a way to reach out/like my same pics on FB. I sat with it for more than a week. Finally I sent him a light hearted message (via Messenger) and we chatted a bit. Did I mention HE LIVES IN MY APT BUILDING?!! He’s literally just downstairs. We’ve said hi in passing, but nothing more. He seems cool, I suggested drinks &amp; neighbor gossip (our other neighbor is insane-), he said “Sounds like a plan.” Then, nothing. I left it in his hands. I’m old enough to not chase men around. And I’m not really looking right now. To add to that, I would NEVER think I was his type. I’ve seen girls come &amp; go (he gives them the obligatory morning-after half hug, which I find hilarious). I’m not similar in body type, style, or age. I have tattoos, prefer vintage dress, am larger plus size (but working on it!) &amp; at least 10-15 years older than these girls. And he is ridiculously handsome &amp; (I think-) out of my league. We do like some of the same things. So bottom line—I’m confused (and apprehensive-he’s my damn neighbor!) as to what his deal is…What do y’all think about him liking my pic on Hinge when he could’ve just reached out on FB (and liked the same pic-) or Messenger?? Is that a signal he wants a date or—?? Should I leave it alone bc he’s my neighbor?? OR is it cuffing season &amp; he’s picking his lineup?? Any other guy I’d just ask about it, but again, he’s my neighbor &amp; I don’t want it to be awkward for either of us!!!

Exclusive from date 1.  We spend the majority of our nights together and get along well. Enthusiastically introduces me to everyone as his GF.  He lives in a very nice house — where we spend a lot of time because our social activities are mostly in his community (nearly an hour from my house) and so I stay with him a lot.  He uses lots of we / us language in referring to his house (telling friends “we” are redoing his back patio, “we” are throwing a party, etc.).  I own my own home (brand new),  and there’s been no talk of moving in together (way too early for that).  

So what’s the problem?  Well maybe minor but it still dings me…
Although he has a great house, he plans to sell it in the next few years and build his “retirement house.”   He brings this up often — to me (“I need to add that idea to my retirement house list”) or to friends in front of me (where he plans to live, what kind of house, etc). But he doesn’t do this in an inclusive way (“What do you think of that idea?”).  So I usually say little; if it sounds like a good idea, I will volunteer that feeling.   But otherwise I mostly smile and nod.  

Of course it’s waaaayyyy too early to talk about building a house together.   We don’t live together now and haven’t even said “I love you” (well he did a month ago but was pretty drunk at the time so I let it pass by).  It still just feels a little dismissive to talk so often in front of me about definite plans that don’t seem to leave room for partner input IF / when that would be appropriate.   

So for now I say nothing bc it isn’t my business yet.  But I cringe every time and it pushes me away a little because it feels like he’s planning a future without me and I don’t want to get too attached.  On the other hand, he treats me in the present like I’m at the center of his world.  

Should I just tell him I feel awkward and why?   I don’t want the message to be that he should include me now in his future plans, but I haven’t figured out how to raise this without it sounding like that.  This comes up 2-3 times per week so it’s not rare.  

TL/DR:  BF of 3 months talks often about future retirement plans and making decisions without any partner input, and I feel awkward, even though it’s way too soon for us to make future plans together.

OLD has helped me figure out what I want and do not want in a LTR. I have been married twice. My first marriage was at 19 and lasted 12 years. I didn't have any established boundaries to weed someone outout. I met him. We both liked sex. We fell in love, and figured we would figure out the rest as we went. Well obviously since it ended in divorce there were lots of incompatibilities. Second marriage  I looked for same interests. I forgot to check his closet though, and 4 years later he told me he had been hiding in it. So, that ended in divorce. 
I have been doing OLD for about 5 months now and have gone on 7 first dates. 3 turned into second dates. 1 turned into 4, no longer seeing eachother. The other 1 we have plans for a third date. 
How OLD has helped me? 
I learned to look at the actions of a guy not his words. Lovebombing it's real, lol. 
I learned that if I vibed well enough to go on a date with someone and then they show up not being what they were representing. I don't get upset. They could be my next friend. 
I learned I have boundaries. I can't stand smoking. I don't date smokers. I can weed those individuals out immediately.  I have other boundaries but I'm not going to go into all those, lol.
So I just wanted to say that even though OLD can suck, and instead of looking at all the negatives we should acknowledge some of its positives.",True,False,False,datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,59294,public,self,How OLD has helped me,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/pzls9f/how_old_has_helped_me/,some_ads,7,,,,,,e06d24a4-275e-11e9-9b74-0e6a6c05416c,Casual Conversation,,,,,,

So, I (54M) played a local gig last night. We play hard rock, party rock, and 80's hair metal. The entire first set was flawless on all of our parts. We had a killer groove that flowed the entire time. It was SO MUCH FUN! You couldn't have paid us to miss a beat, or send an errant note. The crowd was incredible! Dancing, drinking, and singing out loud! The stage was seriously hot, so I went outside after the set to cool off with a drink. There was a mixed group of people at one table on the patio that were all very kind in their congratulations and appreciation for the music. ""Barbara"" was one of them. She quickly disengaged from the conversation she was having with her friends, turned her chair to me a bit, and we proceeded making small talk for the few minutes I had available before starting the second set. I dragged out the banter as long as I could, but I had to get back on stage. She was leaving with her friends soon, so we exchanged phone numbers.... then she gave me a wholly unexpected hug and a little kiss on my (still sweaty) cheek. 

Holy CRAP! This doesnt happen to me! I don't meet kind, jovial, well dressed, well spoken women, do I? I mean, maybe she had ""wine goggles"" on or something? Who knows. Either way I was on cloud 9 and ready to be ""Jonny Q Rockstar"" for the next set!!

We finally started the second set with a swing-rock instrumental to get the crowd back in the mood again. Sadly, I accidently grabbed the wrong guitar for this song. It was set in a completely different tuning from the one I needed. I got through the song, but not without a ton of bad notes. I was so messed up, the rest of the band was looking at me like I'd grown an extra nose! First song done, I scramble to get the correct guitar. An OLD Ibanez RG that I've had since I graduated high school. I couldn't find it.......it was gone. I figured out later that it had been stolen between sets! Anyway, the rest of the set went ok, but it never caught up to the fever of the first set. The police took my report for the guitar when we were wrapping up. I went home sad about my RG, but ELATED about meeting ""Barbara"".

She called me about 11a.m. this morning. We had a great conversation, albeit kind of light. Just getting to know you kind of stuff. We made plans to talk during the week, but no dates or anything like that. After hanging up, I started working on a few new song that the band wants to do. Most of them easy to play, but today? I couldn't carry a note if it had a handle attached to it! Everthing I played was off time and my technique was non-existent. Imagine a toddler the first time they try to feed themselves...... it was THAT messy! Ok, forget it. Music just isn't giing to happen today. I had to get to work soon anyway.

Work turned out to be a shit-show. I deliver pizza on the weekends. Yes, I'm THAT guy. I really do enjoy it though, and the extra $400/week doesn't hurt anything. Tonight? I couldn't get anything right! I brought pizzas to wrong houses, I forgot salads, I couldnt make change for customers when I needed to, and the tips were terrible! It was one of the worst nights I've had delivering in years! I drove home very carefully, not knowing if I still had the ability to drive, and sat my ass down to start typing this. I'm afraid to do or touch anything!

Sometimes, I am leaving as he empties the trash. He is good at being in the same proximity as me. He could avoid me and start at another area of the building to do work. 

One time he offered to give me his phone number in case I got locked out of the building and didn't have a key. I was hesitant and said I would think about it because I rarely give my phone number out. This isn't something a janitor usually says either.

A week later he said he was being transfered soon to another department. He said he would miss seeing me and to keep in touch. In my mind I wondered just how I would keep in touch? Again, I didn't say anything other than I was sorry he was leaving and that I would miss him. Was he trying to say he liked me? Or is this his way of making conversation?

He seems to be very sweet yet awkward and clueless, so I am getting mixed signals.

It just keeps obsessing and obsessing and it’s killing all passion and joy in life. As I said in my previous posts, his entire family basically see life as one problem after another (yesterday his sister wouldn’t come to us for lunch because she couldn’t be bothered getting ready and walking here – a 15 min walk). He also keeps saying how I’m complicating his life by encouraging him to move to the UK, and that his life was so simple before meeting me (yes – at 42 he’d never had a partner and his mum did his cooking, cleaning, ironing, etc., so it was definitely a simple life for him).

Is there literally any way of doing something positive here for the relationship?

We met during quarantine and spent nearly 100% of our time together for 12months- including major holidays since we couldn’t be w our families during that time. We became very close and our relationship became quite serious quickly by anyones standards. He was out of work (because of COVID restrictions) and I was working remotely and that’s all we knew for a long time during the beginning of our relationship. Then the world started to open up again and things changed a bit. He has a job in entertainment (that despite his talent, barely pays) and his work hours are exclusively at night- that is, when the seldom work opportunities do actually arise. He bartends on the side occasionally for extra income. I have a community based public service job that occurs during regular daily business hours and is salaried. He’s a really smart man, and capable of so much, but he lacks motivation. He admittedly loves not working. He also is fiercely independent in his lifestyle  and does not like to answer to anyone. He doesn’t like to feel as though he needs to ‘check in’ or ask if it works w anything I may have planned before making social plans. While it hasn’t always been the case, we were able to move beyond some early transgressions in our relationship and things have developed to a point where I can safely say that I do trust him to be faithful romantically. Thing is, while I love his companionship, I am sometimes made to feel as though I’m an afterthought- he does what he wants and expects that I’ll be there when he’s available. My fault for so often acquiescing. But now that the holidays creeping up are around the corner, and I have a friends wedding that we’ve been invited to the day after Thanksgiving, I brought up the topic of how he’d like to spend the holiday this year.  His family lives about 8hrs by car away, mine family is all within 2.5. That being said, I’ve spent a lot of my vacation time with his family and -very much enjoy, appreciate, and truly care for them. Still, in asking about his thoughts on thanksgiving so I could RSVP to the wedding invite, he was quick to say that he was planning to go be with his mom. I felt let down that he wasn’t even in the frame of mind, after dating for a year, to have a conversation about what we’d each like to see happen and find a way to try to work both of our interests into the equation. I asked if he would consider inviting his mother to spend the holiday here with us so we could accommodate both our families and also be able to attend my friends wedding. He snapped at me saying that money isn’t a nonissue for everyone like it is for me. To be clear, I do not make that much money. Enough to get by, and I saved until I was able to buy a small 1bdrm place (which I make mortgage payments on and will for another 25 years), but I’m not rich at all and live paycheck to paycheck with other debts I do my best to juggle too. I try to be forward thinking and am want to make a good life for myself down the road. I get frustrated because as much as I like to sleep in, not working isn’t an option for me at this point. I don’t want to be made to feel as though I’m being unfair by wanting to be considered when making holiday plans with our families. It feels really crappy to know that he could easily take or leave me being a part of big celebrations with our loved ones. I have started seeing a therapist because there’s a part of me that knows I deserve to be treated with more respect than I am, but I struggle with having the courage to leave because I do truly love him for all of the amazing qualities he has and adore his companionship. When he is present, he’s wonderful. But when it’s a matter of his interests or mine at stake, I’m usually quickly reminded that mine are unimportant and second tier. Recently, he said that he is going through a midlife crisis. It makes me feel sad to know he is struggling. I have tried to encourage and support him in offering ideas and willing to seek out resources to get the ball rolling, but there hasn’t been any real action on his end. In writing this, I hear myself and know the advice I’d prob give myself if I were my friend. But how, if you love someone and enjoy someone’s company so much, do you find the strength to walk away? He’s not a bad guy, I love being around him, most days he makes me very happy, and I believe I can trust him.  So I guess my question is, all of this in consideration, am I being greedy to want for more? Or how do you end a relationship that isn’t bad, but also probably isn’t going anywhere?",True,False,False,datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,59446,public,self,"Love, but not on the same page.

My divorce was pretty amicable and drama free, so I’m not feeling any real trauma from that.

I’ve been pretty fortunate since I started dating and that I’ve met some really awesome people and have had a really good time with some of them. But, I’m finding a recurring pattern and it’s happening to me today, again. When I’m about to see somebody that I’m dating, I dread it. I spend the entire day leading up to it thinking about all the other things I can do with that time and how much I’d rather just be by myself.
 
I think part of it is that I have majority custody so I only have two nights free to myself most weeks. (I am pretty militant about keeping one to myself- which is actually the reason that my first short term relationship ended. He wanted more time than I would give him.) But, the man that I’ve been seeing for about a month is coming over this afternoon for a few hours and all I can think about is how much I would rather he just didn’t come. I keep thinking about calling him and breaking it off with him just so I can have my afternoon to myself. 
 
To be clear, he’s delightful. It might be the best sex I’ve ever had in my life. When we spend time together, I really enjoy his company. He kind, sweet, and really likes me. I have no interest in hurting this person. But, I’m wondering if this feeling that I constantly have that I really just cannot be bothered spending time with dating partners is indicative of not being ready to date at all? Or, if there’s something just wrong with me?

I almost always ask for a second date if I’m at least somewhat attracted to her and there’s no massive deal breaker. Usually my mindset is “yeah she’s cute and seems nice. I’m down to go out again!” I’m super aware that most people are nervous on the first date, so it usually takes awhile to get to know them anyways.


It would be unfair for me to judge anyones personality just chatting with them for an hour over a beer.

But most of the time when I ask if they want to go out again, I get ghosted or a cliche “no spark / chemistry.” It’s like if they don’t immediately have fireworks with a stranger, it’s a next from them.

I get the impression that people are super excited going into a first date thinking “well maybe he’s handsome, rich, our personalities will perfectly match,” but then when the day of the date gets here, they quickly realize that it’s just a human in front of them and not a greek God, so they next and go back to swipping.

I’ve seen the same faces on dating apps in my area for about a year now. I’ve went out once with some of them.

So my question is: why don’t people give each other more time to mesh? Like what’s the point of a lot of first dates?

It’s weirdly frustrating. I went out with a woman last weekend who didn’t want a second date. The weird thing is, I’m willing to bet we could have been a potential compatible couple if she would have just gave it a go.

Lauderdale for a family cruise. As the sun was setting the night before we sailed away, I took a walk along the beach. Suddenly, an attractive woman approached me and asked me a question about an interesting looking ship in the distance. 

“I don’t know,” I said to her question. “I’m not from here.”

“Me either!” She said. “I’m from Alabama! But I was so curious about that ship!”

She walked and talked with me for a bit, and I learned that she was an insurance agent (she owned an agency), recently divorced, had grown kids and was my age (almost 50). She liked that I knew something about Alabama football, was very charming, and to be honest very attractive in every way. 

“Well, it has been great talking with you, but I need to get back to my family,” I said.  

“Oh,” she said. “So what’s your story? Are you single? Would you be interested in sharing information?”

I was in fact married, and unfailingly monogamous, and so not available, and even if I had suspeted (I didn’t) at the time that my wife would leave me in less than a year (as she did), I still wouldn’t have exchanged information since I wouldn’t have thought it appropriate while still married. (not separated).

“Oh,” she said when I told her I was married, and I could tell she felt a little awkward/embarrassed. Which is sad, because if I had been single I would have definitely gone on a date with her that night and have been interested in staying in touch, and plus I was honored/flattered that she was interested in me. As I said, she was both charming and nice (most important) and beautiful (less important). 

I am posting all this here because I’ve noticed posts over the past month or two where women ask about asking men out, including random strangers. And I just think it is so great when people put themselves on the line and take a chance. And for whatever reason I thought about that 50-something woman from Alabama who took a chance but then felt rejected — I hope she continued to put herself out there and met someone wonderful. 

I always encourage other people to take chances. But if I am honest with myself I think the last time I asked a someone out on a date (other than on OLD) was when I was 21 years old since I hate to risk rejection and also worry about being a male creep. So I really admire the people who make themselves vulnerable, and who don’t let rejection stop them.
