So I’m really picky about people I see out in public and have crushes on. I can’t control it. I’ve only really seen maybe 3 guys in my life in person where I was really smitten with their energy/look immediately. Lol 

So there was this guy at the gym I saw last Sunday. I could tell he noticed me looking at him. When I walked out the gym he turned around and looked at me but I didn’t look at him back. 

Today (Sunday again) he walked right in front of me and looked right at me but I just stared ahead/down and ignored him. 

Why do I do this. Am I so stuck up/scared of rejection that I don’t even want to give him the chance? Even though he’s literally only 1/3 guys I’ve crushed on hard from first seeing him. 

Anyways is anyone else like this? How do I stop? I’m not sure what’s going on in my head exactly. But I’m never gonna get a SO when I’m avoiding people I find attractive lol

8,rk169a,1639934342,"19M, quite introvert: How to approach dating? What is expected regarding expressing feelings, making moves, reading signals?","Hi all!

I'm 19 y.o. (in final year of high school) male, quite introverted (using mainly the people skills + few but close friends definitions) and possibly have a light social anxiety (fear of being seen as weird/awkward, not particularly looking to meet new people). I get very nervous, lose courage and tend to just say nothing or get awkward in new situations, when stepping out of known territories in personal conversations etc. This particularly applies to talking to girls I like when other people are around. Alcohol at parties helps me overcome this quite well (and not in the way that I do things I later regret), but, well, can't be drunk 24/7 (:

Recently I started discovering the complicated world of dating. And it's all these social norms and expectations what makes me anxious to take any steps that don't come 100% naturally. **Here's some questions that are running through my head, I don't expect specific answers for each of them**, it's just the best way to outline the confusion that I feel now. **I'll be happy for any kind of (even short) advice, even if you just point me to a good thread/different link with advice for similar people**.

*Are things meant to come naturally? Or do I need to consiously make moves to take things to the ""next level""? How clearly should I express my affection after we meet up a few times, when I'm not sure about her feelings? Often mentioned is excessive fear of rejection - is that meant here, or is it more about asking out? Any 'rule of thumb' when I should be more courageous, and when one really should be more careful?*

*Should the conversation simply flow and it will naturally get a bit of spice if it's right, or does one have to initiate it with 'ok, can I be upfront about something now' or something? Or how does one initiate these kinds of conversations?*

*How the previous applies in reverse - should I read signals and move on if it's a soft 'no' (doesn't text first, no moves either), or are men really expected to be 'hunting'?*

*This modern dating thing - it almost seems to me (from reading various places, not personal exp.) that people go on dates with 'hmm, let me meet this person and maybe something comes out' more often than not. Is that a common mindset, or do people more usually just meet somebody they 'click' with and it goes from there? To me, it happens that I fall head over heels for someone after seeing them once or twice, but I'm very much not sure about their feelings and it doesn't feel appropriate to just openly tell them...*

*Is it common that people make out, cuddle all night at a party with a bit of alcohol in blood, and next day just go on like nothing happened? Is the connection lost when reaching out after I got home feels like starting from scratch again?*

*How far is it 'healthy' to try to take it with friends from school, work or similar setting when I'm not sure about the signals from their side? Should I just observe if they also initiate conversation and show interest or else eventually let it go, or is it ok to invite her for yet another date and be bit more upfront? I'm quite overthinker, so I feel like I'm more anxious about the awkwardness that follows than the rejection itself...*

i had my first kiss freshman year of college (lol) and basically it went bad because the guy just wanted to hookup. im already super reserved around guys but i think that incident made me put my walls up even more because i don’t wanna go through that hurt again. i haven’t done anything with a guy since but the older ive gotten the more i think there’s something wrong with me. i wish i wasn’t so reserved with guys but it’s really just the way i am. i don’t think ill ever find a guy who will be patient enough for me to get comfortable. i think im just scared of getting close to guys because i don’t wanna get hurt. im someone who loves deeply and i just know a breakup would completely ruin me. 

i understand and well aware that a lot of not being able to find a bf is my fault. im always too shy to start the conversation or anything like that. im honestly trying to get better at it but at this point i don’t even have anyone interested in me. im also not a fan of dating apps and hope to meet someone organically like through mutual friends.

So I(21M) know this girl(20M) since school days (known who she was for a long time but was never friends with her). Last summer I met her through a mutual friend, and had a really really nice conversation with her, and me being the dumb idiot I am, immediately fell for her. She might not have been outright flirty, but she was hinting it (kept touching my bracelet/hand, gave me compliments about my muscles/working out). A few days later our mutual friend out of nowhere asked me to go out us 3 for a drink in the pub (which I took as her telling our friend she wanted to see me again). Keep in mind this is a very catholic and conservative environment. Long story short, I ask her out on a date, she agrees, then proceeds to give me the most mixed signaled date ever: First she says she appreciated that a guy like me was interested in her, then tells me that she can't because it would be long distance (I study abroad), and then tells me maybe? but the kind of maybe with a period (.) at the end of the sentence (Like Jesus Christ why do we guys have to get tortured like this why tf can't she be direct. On a separate day her friend told me that she ""would've agreed if the circumstances were different"". Anyway after this I pretty much was pissed off and didn't talk to her.

The day I left home to go back to uni, she texts me telling me to have a safe flight, which I never mentioned when I'm leaving (so she must've asked her friend. why? God knows.) I say thanks and again don't talk to her any further.

We had one conversation whilst I was away, which was initiate by me. All I can say is that she was very enthusiastic about the convo, but that's how she usually is in general.

Fast forward to a couple days ago, my plane just landed home, and I receive a message from her on the whatsapp group between me, her and our friend ( so not even privately), an old video of me in school. I laugh it off and again, don't go any further. I then get invited to a nye party, where she explicitly tells me to bring my friends with me(which I took as it's nothing intimate but friendly). Now i'm thinking ok so what the hell is up. My theory is she wants to keep me as a friend, and as a fail safe option. I am really patient with these types of girls because they truly are inexperienced as shit and extremely innocent, and this specific girl seems to have a bit of an inflated ego so I can seen why she would not be direct, but there's a point where even the toughest of nuts can make it clear that they're interested, and I'm just not getting a 100% answer from this one. You might ask why not just move on. 1) because this specific type of girl is really really hard to come by+ the chance where she actually might be interested, 2) I am insanely crushing over her. Like seriously everyday I was away I have thought about her. Every. Fucking. Day. And I don't even know if we're compatible, like we haven't even gone on more than 3-4 social gatherings. It's staring to really piss me off. I don't know whether I should start talking with other girls or wait a bit longer for this one.

I’m trying to get some advice on choosing to pursue a relationship with one person over another based on, to some extent, what they do for work - not solely based on this of course. But as a factor

For context I’ve gotten to know both of these ppl and am interested in both of them. So pretty even in my mind aside from the below. And maybe a few more minor things

One works in same industry as me, think a corporate job. She has career ambition and works really hard.

The other works in food &amp; bev. She works long hours and works really hard too, two jobs actually. But don’t think she really cares about the corporate world haha. Doesn’t seem to have career ambitions to the same degree, but she’s super cognizant of mental well-being which is awesome.

I think the dilemma is the first chick and I constantly talk about the industry and work related ideas which is productive, but it makes it difficult to cut off work after work. While with the second chick, work won’t come up unless I bring it up, this could be a good thing cause I struggle putting work away.

But I also feel like the first chick will push me more in my career just by being herself. Whereas the second chick is probably going to support me regardless of my career, so I might not be pushed much by her. I think it’s important to be motivated by your SO

I’m very ambitious myself in my career, might need to take a break for more school, but otherwise want to work my way up and build creative and useful things that make people’s lives better. The thing is, I’m still pretty bad at setting boundaries. But I also believe that’s something I need to address myself and not by another person’s actions indirectly doing it for me.

Am I wrong to give the other person’s career that much weight in my choices of who I pursue? Am I being ridiculous?

Also I just want to make clear I don’t think more / less of anyone in jobs whether it’s being a line cook, server or a lawyer.

She was even cuter in person and I found her to be very engaging. The best for me though was that we both shared a strong interest in history and traveling. Just listening to her excitingly recount her archival discoveries was the sexiest thing ever. We hit it off well and after some light flirting we embraced and she went in for a kiss. She mentioned having a great time and wanting to meet up again and then we went our separate ways (this was in the afternoon and we had other plans for the evening). 

I sent her a brief text later in the day saying I had fun and that I would follow up with plans for a second date. Next day I called and left a short voicemail inviting her out for a second date. I didn't get any response and hadn't heard anything since we ended the date. Then late that night she sent a long text explaining how after some consideration she was not emotionally ready for dating anyone and that it had nothing to do with me. and she apologized if I felt let down.

I have had a fair amount of disappointments in my dating life but this one really hurt. Feeling that connection and then having the spark get extinguished so quick has me bummed out. I'm sure I'm not the only one to experience this though and I guess on the upside I have a better idea of what I want in a partner.

I was dragged out by friends to a smaller dance club. This is definitely not my scene but I'm happy to be with friends. When we were there I noticed a crazy cute and sweet looking girl sitting alone. When she went to the bar a few minutes later I went over and ordered a drink too, and started a conversation. Figured out her personality was as adorable as she looked and we talked for a while, laughed at how we were both dragged out by friends and how we're both too introverted for this club, ect. She told me about her favorite tea shops, her hobbies, her Animal Crossing island, ect, and she seemed to like talking to me. Her friends did come over eventually and we talked as a group about things to do in the city, ect for a few minutes. At one the cute girl said 'there are people coming watch out!' and pulled me by the arm close to her. The friends left and we continued talking about things she likes to do in the city, until her friends said they were leaving and heading out the door. She threw on her coat and said she hopes I have a good night. Well it was now or never, so I asked if she had a Snapchat and that maybe she could show me that coffee shop. She said 'i don't have a Snapchat, but I have a Facebook, it's (first name last name)'. After she said that she said 'See you later (my name)' and headed out. 
However, I somewhat unsurprisingly could not find the name she gave me, seeing as we're in a big city and I didn't really hear her last name. I considered running after her after I couldn't find it but I decided that might certainly be uncomfortable. Was this just a subtle rejection or did she actually want to see me again? She seemed to enjoy talking to me and I would've loved to see her again. However, I can't help thinking that if she did want to see me again she would have taken a minute to find herself on my phone to make sure. But, also, her friends were already out the door and maybe she just didn't want to get left behind, and she said 'see you later' in a cheery voice. I don't know. Nonetheless I don't think I'll get to see her again.
But, was that a rejection or not? I'm not sure if she was glad to get away from me or is wondering why I haven't added her yet.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rk2wj9/cannot_tell_for_the_life_of_me_if_this_was_a/

Hello everyone, first and foremost I am wishing you all a great holiday season.

So, I (21 M) have been dating my girlfriend (20 F) for about 3.5 months. I would say, that the relationship is great,  albeit one thing. I have noticed, throughout the relationship, that I am often the one who initiates texts after seeing each other “hey it was great to see you,” or “I miss you,” or if in person “you look so cute/ gorgeous today.” Although, these sentiments will be reciprocated after being said, she rarely, if ever, is the first to state sentiments like this. I have even noticed, despite this being an especially small point, that if I were to send a goodnight text such as “goodnightttt &lt;3,” she would reply without any hearts.

I think that this just frustrates me a tad, as it feels like sometimes feelings that I share aren’t being given the same attention back towards me. So, am I within reason to bring this up to her? Or would this come across as overwhelming/ clingy!

1 week goes by we still talking daily, I read things like ""you are kinda perfect"" and all that to which I reply along the same lines, if a bit scared but hopefull because we shared a few interests and had the same ideals.

Fast forward to the second date and I am a nervous mess to be honest, my self esteem isn't the highest and I really didn't want to mess things up, however , I did and in the end after a few days things go sower, she goes on saying she didn't feel any chemistry on either date but wanted to be friends because I am a nice guy and whatnot, I figured she was just being nice and I declined to be her friend because I would probably get hurt and she had no interest regardless. She just ends with some pity saying I can talk with her whenever I feel like.

I just unfollowed her and stopped her for following me, deleted her number and stuff and went no contact after about 1 1/5 months and 2 dates

Three and a half years ago, I found someone who blew my socks off. We never dated, but I was deeply infatuated with him. I actually confessed to liking him and he turned me down. He was a few years older than I was, half Jewish and half Chinese, incredibly smart and competitive, and very sweet. He had beautiful skin and hair and full lips.

I am frustrated because in the last three and a half years, many men have shown romantic interest in me, online and in person. But I can't find anyone who is both attractive to me and into me as well.

- she's really into poetry and books and recently has been sending increasingly lovey poems and quotes over the last month

The waitress however, was super tan, kind of a thick waste and butt, with a pretty face and big glasses and her hair was dyed blonde.

But the waitress kept giving me this look like she was ready and willing to do anything I wanted her to do. 
She kept coming over to see if i needed anything,  soy sauce, ketchup, what have you...
I can honestly say that I got way stronger vibes from the waitress then I did my actual date.
She gave the vibe that I could pretty much have my way with her however I pleased, whenever I wanted.
I must admit, i liked how she made me feel.

But im still interested in him. I’m still open to us possibly being more in the future but im not sure if still is because in us talking more now we haven’t really discussed that. I asked if he was talking to anyone and he said no. He said he’s not starting anything with anyone and he’s just going to let love come to him. Yesterday he did flirt with me a little. 

Idk if I should ask if he could still see us being more in the future or not or if I should just let it be.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rk4q2t/i_dont_know_if_i_should_ask_him_or_not/
58,rk4s9n,1639945113,Are my expectations too much?,"I’ve been going on dates lately and trying to get back out there and find someone that is potentially a match for me and me a match for them. There are some things that bother me with some of the guys that I have gone on dates with and when I mention it to my friends they see it as no big deal and that I should go on another date with the guy because I found him attractive. I recently went on a date with a guy who I found attractive and during our lunch date the conversation went well. We went back to his place to watch a movie and I noticed a couple of things that I did not like. A pile of stuff in a box in the corner of his living room (he did not recently move in), heavy dust on his TV stand, his sink in his bathroom looked like he had not cleaned in a long time (toothpaste and dust all over), his white shower curtain was very orange at the bottom showing me that he does not clean his shower so I can only imagine what it looked like behind the curtain. At 28 I expect someone to know how to clean to basic standards. While he was nice, good looking, and was good with conversation these are big turn offs for me as I don’t want to be the girl who has to clean for him. My friends says “Well some guys are just like that, you did have a good time with him before going over there.”Most other guys want to grope me on the first date. Like I just met them, I don’t know them very well, it’s very off-putting when someone wants to be very grabby or make out with me right away. I’m still feeling someone out to see if I even like them yet before I decide I want any of that kind of stuff to happen. Am I expecting too much? Is it normal to not want to make out with someone on the first date or am I just being weird? I don’t need to move at an extremely slow pace, but I’m also not wanting to make out with someone or have sex with someone the first day I meet them but that’s all I seem to be running into.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rk4s9n/are_my_expectations_too_much/

We were best friends in the beggining (for 1 year), even if I knew that he liked me and he knew that I liked him. We were not dating...but we were spending hours talking in the phone to each other. This year we started to hang out with other friends after our common class and everytime we kissed and once we had a discussion and I was not talking to him. One day after we went to a party, he was drunk and he came and we kissed again. But he told me that he cannont make me happy. We are too different, we want different things in life, I want a relationship, he wants sth without pressure. And then, he was unconfortable after that day, trying to avoid me all the time. He does not accept to talk to me in private, he talked to me only when there are other people. One day in the bar, we were sitting next to each other he told me that he adores me but we cannot be together because we need different things in life. I asked him to talk a little bit after the bar. He did not accept. We were in the table with other friends and in the end we were only 4 people. He started flirting in front of me. We had eye contact for 3 seconds and he continued to talk to the girl. I was feeling bad. He asked her to add him in Instagram and if she was in couple or single. I was feeling very bad and I went in another bar with another friend (as we were 4 in the table in the end) . I left him and the girl alone and I went with the guy.

63,rk55ba,1639946185,My sea is empty...,"So basically I'm male, 22, average/good looking, a bit androgynous 6'10/180cm and I live in a small city. 

I'm here because I want to ask, how do you get to know/make friends with new girls/strangers ? 
My issue is that I am very romantic and I look for long term relationship only because I don't enjoy casual sex.

-I tried to go into some bars, but I'm kinda too shy to act in a place like a tavern/bar or whatever. 

-There is a disco with shitty music, I should gather some friends to spend a couple of nights with to catch a random fish but at the risk of feeling deeply delusional and ashamed even if I hook up successfully.

-I am terrible at making social profiles or taking selfies, I could try to text random girls on Ig but I should make a nice profile first.
Instead in Tinder I won't get a single like, or if I get one it's usually a lot of miles away. 

I don't know what to do, I feel painfully lonely even with male friends, I miss cuddling and having deep conversations about whatever comes in my mind.

I'll take any advice, if you have links, yt vids, tutorials, opinions, ideas, literally anything.

64,rk58hq,1639946447,Not sure how to feel about a coworker/best friend,"So there's a lot of background information on both of us that honestly would just take too long to read, so I'll condense this as much as possible. For me, I am a little fragile atm as last year I was rejected by someone who I thought was the woman of my dreams and now think that my read on women is broken (that's a long story that I'm open to answering about). I've also been ""talking"" to some girl in my hometown the last few months that honestly feels like a waste of my time because I have to initiate every damn conversation even though she was the one who wanted to date in the first place (again, can answer if needed) and it would be long distance. Now my coworker/best friend has been in four relationships in the last two years and three of the four were shitty relationships (one of the guys was a really nice dude but just was not emotionally invested and another was some guy who was infatuated with her since high school, finally started dating, and then it became sexless) including one that lasted for 6 years where she was physically and mentally abused while the fourth was barely a relationship.

Now the extent of the relationship between she and I, for at least what I felt like it was for the last year or so, was best friend behavior. We were there for each others personal life drama, we'd hang out after we got off work everyday, she'd give me rides to my apartment after hanging out/getting off work, and we constantly send each other memes/videos over Instagram. I also would categorize that our relationship is that we are more than friends, but neither in a romantic way or as a sibling-like as maybe potentially might date in the future. We always tell each other ""love you"" when I leave work to go to my other job. I think we both realize that being coworkers (especially when we both were single) that it wasn't a good idea to look at each other in a romantic way, but at the same time we were into other people anyways. Now, she's become only a part time coworker as she has another job elsewhere and comes to work at my place only once or twice a week. That clearly changes the situation. 

That being said, I'm not sure what to feel now considering the situation. I've had friends essentially tell me that I should pursue her now that we are both single. I've tried to look at her in a romantic way before and I honestly just didn't feel it and think still feel the same. But on the other hand, a part of my brain keeps telling me that I'm an idiot for not feeling that way and I recognize the fact that she's just an amazing person while also finding her to be very attractive. And while I don't trust my judgment anymore, I feel like how she dealt with her most recent breakup (only like a week and a half ago) as every day she has been sending me those Instagram memes (didn't used to be everyday) and talks with me at greater lengths than normal that maybe she might see me as a potential relationship (even the hugs are seemingly getting more intimate). Heck, she essentially invited herself to go see the new Spider Man film (which I'm super excited to see!!!) with me after she asked me who I was going with and had said by myself (I normally go to movies by myself as I'm pretty extroverted and it's just a relaxing activity for me to do). I could see that as friend behavior and it might be, but a lot of what she is doing is new in our dynamic so I'm just not sure and, again, my read is broken. One of my friends keeps saying I'm her go-to guy which I'm not sure what they mean, but it seems to be a thing. There's also the other part of me that makes me think that she sees me as a go to for comfort which I have been to her in the past. We're both damaged goods. While I find her to be very attractive and just to be an amazing person, I just don't feel like I'm getting that romantic feeling despite knowing all the factors.

So what do y'all think? I know it's hard to get a gauge on the situation from not knowing us, but it might be something that you guys get a rough idea about.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rk58hq/not_sure_how_to_feel_about_a_coworkerbest_friend/

68,rk5ex8,1639946978,What does she mean by all this?," 

A girl (18F) I've (20M) been talking to for about a month canceled our date this weekend and the reason behind that was that she didn't want to risk any of us catching feelings for one another, since we live 2 hours apart and she doesn't feel comfortable getting into a long-distance relationship at this moment of her life.

First off, that excuse is pretty weird since I only asked her out for a casual cup of coffee just to talk and get to know her better and she assumes we are gonna fall in love? Like what does she mean by that? And today (the day after she canceled) she left my snap-on read and I thought I had nothing to lose so I sent her a text explaining that I like her and that if she change her mind, later on, she knows where I stand in all of this. the way she responded gives me a major headache. ""Hahahaha so sweet of you, your number is still in my contacts you know :)"" Like what does she mean by that?! I just confessed that I like her and she has been giving me the same vibe just last week and now she is laughing it off? Does her response imply that she will contact me later on or how do I interpret that?

Btw she had on multiple occasions expressed her interest and that she genuinely thinks I'm a very sweet and wonderful guy. So her just cutting the contact after a month of talking just because she is afraid to catch feelings is very strange in my book, especially when I have never implied that I want a relationship with her except today when I told her I liked her.

long story short I've had crush on this girl for a while and decided to text her around a week ago (we've known before from school but never really talked much etc.). Things have been going good besides the topic of this post - I can't tell if she's not interested or if she's just a bad texter.

It takes her over a day to reply to my message, but when she does she always apologizes, really seems excited, she leaves me heart reactions all over the place, asks questions and answers those I ask. Then we end our conversation and when I reach out to her the next day - I need to wait over a day for her to appear online and read the message.

Well, it seems really weird to me because for me it's so exciting - every time my mobile vibrates I hope it's her text, while she just seems not to check messenger at all for several hours? If I were her I would check it few times a day to see...

I wanted to ask her out on a date in a coffee shop for this weekend. So I texted her on Thursday and thought that when she would have replied we'd talk for a while and then I'd ask if she wanted to go out on the weekend. But - you guessed it - she read the text on Saturday...

Fortunately I have enough self-confidence to honestly state my feelings and not be awkward about it. And I'm not a 10/10 but get second looks from girls time to time.

So what would you think if I did that and what is the best way to do that or best thing to say in this situation?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rk6y6c/what_would_you_think_if_a_guy_approached_you_and/
85,rk701f,1639951458,Approaching a girl at work,"There is a girl at work and I have a crush on her. Her office is only a few doors from mine, and we work in the same department, but not in the same team. We never really got in touch directly for work-related purposes and have never spoken to each other, even though we have shared a corridor for more than a year! 

This might sound strange to some people, but in my current country and in my occupation people are not very keen on small-talk and greeting anyone you don't know personally. In addition, we're both also really shy and introverted. So as a result, we have been running into each other for months but have never even said hi. For the record, I'm 28M, she is probably in her mid-twenties and we're both expats in this country. 

Now I'm feeling that she also has some interest in me just based on the way she looks at me, but I don't know how to approach her. I feel like starting any conversation out of the blue would be awkward after so many months of not talking to each other. 

There was a Christmas event last Friday where we both were, which turned out to be another a missed opportunity. It was outside and super cold, I felt tired and not confident enough that day. After all, there's only one first impression one can make, so I'd rather not make a bad impression the first time I talk to her. 

Now I can't think of any other non-awkward ways to suddenly start talking to her, feel like I've already missed the boat and should have introduced myself soon after she joined.

86,rk78ms,1639952135,Life officially hates me and it proved it today :D,"Well well how to start. I have this beautiful, amazing girl friend with who I've been in love for like 6 years. Two days ago I told her that I can't do this anymore and that I would like to cut conversations and going outside while she is in relationship with her present boyfriend ( pretty toxic relationship tbh, they've broked up for like 5-6 times in the last 2 years). Things with her are REALLY complicated.

Anyway, after telling her how I felt and what I need, her eyes literally were like a strong waterfall. She hugged me and told me that as much as she wouldn't like to do this - she will do it for me cause she is one of the few people that she deeply care about. Also, a phrase that stucked in my head was "" at the moment I can't do anything about US since I am in relationship with him , maybe if I wasn't things could've been different for us"". With tears she left my car and we said goodbye FOR NOW.

Well life is a b\*\*ch. Today, while going to the nearest shop - I've parked my car, went into the shop and guess who I saw - her and her boyfriend. I swear life hates me. The situation was mega awkward for me and her since she said she wouldn't share our talk with her boyfriend cause it's personal.

88,rk7d6d,1639952480,I know the right answer but I was wondering how to win a girls heart after she says no,"I know the right thing to do is just leave her alone. I'm not quitter though, I keep trying. I really like this girl and we get along great. She says I'm too young for her and because of that I've done a lot of stupid stuff that pushed her away and made her angry because I was more worried about the fact I'm younger than her that I didn't really understand what to do.

Her and I are friends again and she acts weird around me all the time, like she makes me think she likes me then gets weird all of the sudden. It's strange and I don't know what to think.

I've decided that instead of trying to prove to her that I'm mentally older than I look to be the dumb 20 year old that I am (it's extremely out of character for me to do this btw), I want to show her what young, passionate, and dumb can really do.

I was thinking about singing a song to her, a song that's extremely special to me and important to me. I want to connect with her and show her who I really am, she didn't really know me and claims to but she doesn't. I really like this girl and I know this a stupid thing to do and disrespectful. I'm a determined person and want to try with this girl though, it's probably going to be my last try because I know it's wrong of me to do.

89,rk7ge5,1639952728,Am I doing something wrong?,"Hey guys I'm back, i can't figure out if it's my luck or I'm doing something wrong. This is pretty embarrassing, but I'll list out all my failed attempts. I have never tried hitting on women in public before.

I've had mixed results online dating. I move around a lot and some places I get 10+ attractive matches a week, some places like where I am, I get maybe one match a week or less.

My one match I went out with said she recently got out of a relationship and I was giving her relationship vibes. Another match was leaving town, so didn't go out. Third match was weird, then unresponsive.

Since I didn't have any other matches, I decided to go out and meet women. I'm by myself in a new town and going out to bars. One gave me her number and flirted all night but didn't respond to my text.

Another one I talked to said she was doing ladies night, but hung out with me until her friend got mad at her.

Then I met one woman and we spent most of the night dancing and talking, then when I go in for a kiss, she tells me she's in a relationship. She then tells me she wants to end it with him and would like to do it right and could see something long term with me. Then she gives me her number, but doesn't respond.

The other night I was trying to talk to a girl who was barely responsive. Then after her I talked to another girl who seemed super excited to talk, but then when I left for the bathroom she was dancing with a guy, not sure if they came together, because she came with a group.

I get a lot of compliments on my looks, get hit on by guys (by women too in my younger days). Any ideas what I'm doing wrong? Am I approaching the wrong women? I'm super shy, so this is the hardest thing ever for me.

90,rk7hdl,1639952809,"While Her Sister Visits from College, She’s Off Limits (Even Phone Calls)","I’ve (30M) been seeing her a few months now and recently asked her (23F) to be my gf. Everything was going amazing until her sister entered the picture. We used to hang out often and enjoy every hangout. We never argued. We always had fun. We had our first ever argument about us not hanging out anymore as much and it’s clearly because her sister (20F). 

I first met her sister for the first time one day over Thanksgiving break. I hardly saw my gf at all then. Now, she’s back here for three weeks for the holidays and it’s really become clear where I stand. We’ve hung out even less and every hangout we have is shorter and is with her sister going everywhere we go. We get a few hours alone in the bedroom and shower. But, you guessed it. Her sister is right outside the door watching TV and we have to be super quiet.

So, this came to a head last night when I wanted her support after a rough week and our usual Saturday night hangout got canceled (no surprise). 

So, I asked her to call me. We spoke for a good 1-2 hours and it was all serious content (no small talk) about stuff I’ve been going through and she really helped me through it. We usually hang out Saturday nights, the only night I sleep over and hang out the whole day.

So, Sunday (today) comes around and no text from her and it’s already like 3 PM and no text. This happened last Sunday. I got a text at 6 PM that she couldn’t hang out. So, at this point I realize my expectations are the source of my pain and I need to lower them, so I text her that I want to give her space with her sister since she doesn’t see her often. So, let’s hang out Christmas. She tells me that she’s actually relieved because she wanted to give her sister the entire day because her SISTER WAS UPSET THAT SHE WAS ON YHE PJONE WITH ME LAST NIGHT AND THEY DIDN’T GET TO EAT DINNER TOGETHER. I’m like wtf. I didn’t expect that, but I had a feeling her sister was behind our drastic decrease in hangouts (she still hangs out with her friends just as much if not more, however). She asks for Tuesday (another usual hangout day), but I tell her honestly that I think we need space and let’s make it Christmas. She agrees and even thanks me for considering her sister and that she’ll miss me which I found a surprising response because it almost seemed to validate that her sister needs that much time apart from me (1.5 weeks of us not hanging out, the longest time we’ve been apart. The longest being when I was on a work trip for a week).

My honest opinion of the sister: She’s been rude to both me and my gf and has noticeable mood swings. She smokes a lot of pot every day. She’s really immature and selfish, kind of like how I was when I was younger, so I get it. Nevertheless, I went out of my way to help get her a volunteer research position for psychology career, making calls to a contact I knew, taking notes, and putting in a good word for her. She was somewhat grateful (but not really), but obviously it doesn’t really change how much time she apparently needs with her sister. 

I don’t know what do do here except what I’ve done which is step away and lower my expectations until this sister finally leaves and I can rejoice. Also, because they lost both of their parents, so I definitely don’t want to get in between them no matter how unhealthy her sister is. 

But, I wonder if I want to keep seeing this girl, what will I do if my relationship with her sister becomes unsustainable or even bitter? I thought about getting her a gift a couple weeks ago for Christmas, but now I’m like fuck that because she probably won’t even be grateful. I guess ride it out every time she comes to visit or just stay away like I’ve learned to do now?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rk7hdl/while_her_sister_visits_from_college_shes_off/
91,rk7k27,1639953020,A guy didn’t text me after sex,"I(f,24) have been in long relationships (4years), was engaged but recently broke up. 

My ex was in some university program and there was a big group of people that would hang out with each other. Some of these people were his (my exes) friends, some just acquaintances. After I broke up, It turned out that one guy from this group liked me, we coincidentally matched on tinder and went out. Then we got into passion mode and slept with each other (2nd date). Overall, I’m single, it wasn’t ever a friend of my fiancé. However, I still feel extremely weird but I like the guy at the same time. He treated me extremely respectfully and nicely. After sleeping with each other I stayed a night, we had cute breakfast, kisses, and then he took me on his car to my house (around 40 min drive, he could send me a taxi). 
We kissed goodbye and it’s been 1.5 days since we spoke, he didn’t message me anything. 

We discussed the ex fiancé situation and he was totally fine about it as they never were friends and he liked me a lot. our dates were romantic, not hookup mode. But I’ve gotten out of relationships 2 months ago, so maybe after sex it hit him harder?

I love my parents but they want to know everything I do. I know it’s a habit because they still think of me as a young teenager, but I can’t leave the house without informing them. 

I tried to go on a date off bumble a few weeks ago and I had to tell my mum and she made such a big deal about it, like how scary it is to meet up with someone and how ‘she just couldn’t tell my dad’ that I was doing it because he’d be worried - I was already a bit jittery being the first time I’d met up with someone online and I bailed. I just couldn’t stand the awkwardness of my mum knowing where I was going and what I was doing and quizzing me over how it went when I got home.

This is doing my head in. I really want to meet someone but (a) my parents live in the middle of nowhere so there’s nowhere in town. I’m currently travelling over an hour to work and 2.5 hours to uni and (b) using online dating seems hopeless living at home. Even if I wanted to try something casual, it seems impossible because mum would want to know EVERYTHING. 

One year and I’ll have finished uni and maybe be in a position to buy a house. My savings are slowly climbing. But how am I going to make it through this last year?
