I kept denying seeing him when he asked because we had an actual date lined up later in the week. 

I even called him out &amp; said he was just trying to hook up and cancel the “actual” date. He denied this and said he was ADDING plans &amp; still seeing each other for the beach date. 

Anyway, I finally gave in and just went over to his place , thinking we’d still go through with the beach date.

I went on one date with a guy that I met over a dating app, and before we met up, I had a feeling he wasn't over his ex. They were in a long term relationship and just broke up a few months ago. But even with this in mind, we talked and he said he felt like he was ready to get back into the dating world.

We went out, and overall, we had a good time. He did seem a lot more shy than I had anticipated, and I had moments where I thought this meant he wasn't attracted to me because he wasn't very touchy, but overall, he asked a lot of questions and maintained good eye contact and we talked for a couple hours. Later in the night, he asked if he could kiss me, and I was really surprised because it didn't seem like he was into me. The shyness plus the asking really made me want to see him more, because he was so respectful. We kissed goodbye and parted ways.

Two days later, I hadn't heard from him so I sent a follow up text saying I had a great time and would be happy to meet up later in the week. He agreed and said he'd let me know. A few days later though, he sent me a text and was very open about how after we met, he experienced a lot of emotions from his breakup and was thinking he wasn't ready to date just yet. My heart sank. He was planning to go home and think about things, and said we could maybe hang out when he got back. But I told him I understood and said we didn't have to meet up even when he got back. I felt for him, I can't imagine what hurt he's going through, so I wanted to give him time.

On the day he was going to travel back, I sent a text to which he said ""Thanks!"". Maybe I'm a little bit more on the sensitive side, but this curtness compared to our previous texts made me really sad. I feel the distance, and I think more than anything, I feel a little rejected. Part of me also wonders whether this was an excuse to not see me again?

I was really looking forward to getting to know him more because he seems like a good guy.

We get along great and share a number of things in common.  She’s my first girlfriend and first sexual partner I’ve ever had.  I never really put forth much effort into dating because of constant rejection and poor self-esteem.  As a result, I started dating much later than the average person.  After becoming more self-aware, I decided to start making changes in my life to better myself and my circumstances.  I started eating healthier, exercising 6 days a week and started CBT therapy.  I consider myself a much improved person mentally, socially, physically and spiritually.  

However, I recently learned something about my girlfriend’s past that has me seriously reconsidering our relationship.  I recently discovered how many guys she’s been with previously.  I know it’s foolish to let something of the past mess up the present but it’s really bothering me for some reason.   I find myself becoming less invested in the relationship as a result.  


I’m doing my best not to judge because I know I don’t have a right to but this particular scenario is really putting a strain on my mind.  After sitting and thinking about it for a week, I still don’t have an idea of why I feel retroactively jealous and upset by this.

You can totally drool over the Kardashian curves. You set your standards up as high as you like, and discredit guys for being below 6ft in height and judge women based on cup size. Don't get me wrong, I'm not endorsing any of it, but who am I to judge? You like what you like.

But there will come a time in your life when you'll be flabbergasted at the being that stands before you who will fail at having any or most of the qualifications you have ever put place in your mind, and you'll still find yourself hopelessly falling for him/her.

The girl you'll fall for will not necessarily be the ideal height, and may not have the flawless skin you may have imagined. She might be 5 years older than you are, and perhaps her teeth may not be perfectly aligned, and yet you'll find her smile to be the most beautiful thing ever. It won't make sense at all. 

The guy you'll fall for may not be your ideal weight, and his beard game may not be completely on point. He might not even be from the same age group as you are, nor will he have nicest car. He may not be as tall as you imagined prince charming to be and yet his charm will be irresistible. 

That's what love is. It's blind. It's blind to physical imperfections because as long as two hearts align, crooked teeth, varied complexions and extra weight don't matter.

Love goes beyond all that. Love is based on the warmth that someone makes you feel when you're around them, the comfort you experience in being yourself without fear of being judged. Love is admiring someone's character and what they stand for and respecting what they're sensitive to. Love is based on understanding and being understood. The person who makes you feel the most like yourself wont necessarily be the ideal you had in mind, and yet you won't be able to see yourself without them. 
They'll believe in you the way you deserve to be believed in, and they'll love you back the way you craved to be loved.

People might deter you, and they might even tell you that you're settling for less. They'll say you can do better... but what exactly are they placing a value on? Look around you, and judge people for how they make you feel and not so much on how they look. They've lied to you when they said love is beautiful. Love is beauty-filled.

But I understand why I can’t now.

I learned the hard way that she can’t just be attracted to me even if she wanted to. What’s *even worse* is that someone else who a lot around me would consider to be *’in my league’* I completely dislike. I always had two rules in dating for many many years now. They were 1) home life doesn’t impact my life negatively for mental health. 2) reasonably attempt to take care of themselves. This person who is interested in me doesn’t meet either of them. I now feel even more angry and almost punished for feeling like I was interested in what I felt to be a normal league standard of women, still being too attractive for me; only being forced to settle with someone I completely dislike. **No one is forcing me to date the person** but I **feel** that way because I feel like girls like her can be my only option. Which is totally unfair to me because I’ve worked really hard for 10 years to better myself. I eat almost completely clean, train 7 days a week and push myself to be brave and ask women out I do like. I put effort in my style; my attitude, my body language, my conversation, how I engage at work. I feel I’m allowed to uphold a certain amount of standard to myself as much as conventionally attractive people are.. also being conventionally attractive means you don’t have to deal with the hypocrisy in the first place. Only ugly people do which makes their situation like mine even worse (or less conventionally  attractive shall we at least say)

This then makes me feel guilty for my heartbreak and almost makes it feel invalidated. I feel like men get so much bad treatment from women that if they go through any kind of heartbreak they get told they are immature or to suck it up. When in reality the situation can be as difficult if not worse than with women because women always have more options in the pool of dating *(for as long as they are actively seeking)* bottom line is men always want sex and women don’t. (Not as desperately anyway because they know they have the access to such).

So what can I do to get through this) not choosing this other girl has helped me a lot in respecting the girl I am interested in’s lack of attraction; however like I said it makes me feel guilty for my heartbreak because I don’t feel interested in another girl who may well be.

This may all just be in my head, but I’m allowed standards and morals for dating just like anyone else. My question  is how do I get over this and give myself enough self esteem to say *no I’m worth more than this*

Original plans came to a natural end so we decided to start another activity to continue the date. It ended up being like a 5 hour first date.

Despite this, I think we got on pretty well, conversation lulled a couple of times but again it was a long time to spend with another person. Due to the duration, I wasn't miffed when he checked his phone a couple of times later on, and I asked him the time a couple of times because I had plans after and wanted to make sure I wasn't running late. When we were close to parting ways he asked me if I wanted to come hang out inside but I let him know I had dinner plans and couldn't. So when it came time to part, we hugged and he told me that I ""have his number"", and basically (I don't remember exactly the words) I should reach out if I want.

Now that post really got me thinking is being black that big of a disadvantage in dating cause so many of the comments were agreeing with him. I don’t feel that way at all I’m black and have dated pretty much every race of a girl(except Asians they never seem to like me) and have never had a problem. 

I’m not a perfect match either. I’m 5’7 and atleast when I look on here apparently that’s too short. It just doesn’t make sense to me being black and having curly hair have been some of my most attractive physical qualities. Most compliments I’ve gotten from women have been about my”beautiful skin”(lol weird Ik) and my hair which are two things that for sure come from me being black. If I’m being honest I feel like a lot of black people blame more things than they should on being black and are secretly insecure about it. I’m not saying that trying to be racist I’m saying that trying to be honest. I’m super proud of being black it’s a part the awesomeness that is me maybe it’s just my natural confidence in myself that makes me think different but I just don’t get it.

I live in Hawaii and have plenty of guy friends, and love saying yes to people who want to hang out. But recently a few guys have wanted to hang out and I’ve thought it was as friends, but then made really suggestive comments as though we’re dating or something when I’ve had no romantic interest from the beginning. 

For instance, I made a friend online to play tennis with the other day and we played, went for coffee after and he suggested we hang in Waikiki sometime this week. I said sure! He started texting me as soon as I got home and is now suggesting a place which I googled and turns out to be fancy four course dinner restaurant at the opposite side of the island. Because these guys never use the word “date” or make it seem casual at the beginning I feel like I’m getting the bait and switch where I’ve said yes to hanging, but I didn’t mean for it to be romantic, so I can’t make up an excuse or decline in the moment. I’m not sure how to politely ask someone if they’re looking for something more than just a hangout without making it awkward, and I’ve had it before where I’ve pointed it out and a guy has made it seem like I was crazy for reading that. 

Guys; do you use this particular tactic or do you prefer to be forthright? What’s the most polite way to stop these sort of things in their tracks? I’m also concerned that they think they’re being clear it’s a date by asking to hang, and I look stupid for seeing it as platonic. I don’t want to let it go unsaid and lead someone on.

The other one is the shit test- where I say I don’t like something and they still insist on taking me there. I said I didn’t like hookah lounges, he took me there and I had to sit enduring smoke. I faked my parents calling me telling me to get home immediately (I’m in a different state.) Now it’s been one year, his family is messaging everyone they know asking for someone to marry him, and he’s still on the apps. He is complaining to the mutual friend he’s had zero luck with women, and we are all superficial and it’s his looks and height that’s holding him back.

I thought he was just a weird guy or a creep but my guy friends say some do this all the time and it’s universally known among guys.

Basically, I have severe ADHD - I talk a fucking lot, and often without thinking. It doesn't matter how sincere my intentions are when I say something, I just communicate it terribly.

I've been chatting to a girl who has been out of the area and is coming back in a couple weeks, and we've made plans to meet. It's been incredibly exciting - like we've already breached every boundary that doesn't involve either commitment or physical contact.

Obviously I'm excited to meet her, but even with DMs - sometimes I sound like such a fucking moron.

For example, today we were flirting around and she asked about types - bear in mind that at this point, we've already seen pictures of each other and are fully aware that we fancy the fuck out of each other. Anyway, I said I don't really have a type and I like what I see when I see it etc and then started saying that my type atm is - and started describing her, with full intention of complimenting her, but described her (pray for me) tits as small. Which one, isn't true, and two, is a stupid fucking way to put it anyway.

Anyway, I'm maybe being a little down on myself about it - we joked later on about me having massive tits, hugging etc, but she did communicate that she felt a little set off by using the word small. I really like her and one of the reasons I do is because she calls shit out, but I don't want to be the dude who hurts her ykno.

I am genuinely quite insecure about how my ADHD has affected relationships in the past - people telling me it's like I never listen to them, saying the wrong thing without even thinking about it. Talking too much, as well, being too 'extra'.

For one thing, I want to feel confident - I know I can't 'cure' ADHD, but I'm posting here because I want to learn how I can be a really effective listener on a date.

Of course I'm paying attention, but I'm awful at showing it and communicating that I'm listening

Basically - how can I actually express that I'm interested, without having to talk so over the top about the subject. How can I pull back, and let the other person just speak, and communicate to them that I care about what they're saying and want to listen to them

I so badly want to be a good listener, and I really don't want to fuck it up with this girl haha

It’s interesting how when we left each other yesterday my mind seemed to lift out of the clouds and so many things conceptualized. 

I’m not a martyr for love, nor am I the dumb girl who just didn’t get it despite not having the experiences you have had. The reality is, I’m half of an amazing connection, one that was unexpected and where hearts have flowed free from judgement since day one. 

Somehow, without intending it, we’ve stumbled into the kind of bond that most people only dream of finding in this life. An immediate connection of genuine values and comfort rather than lust and infatuation. I want to make that clear - this divide we’re currently in has never been about compatibility for me. If anything, it’s about exactly what your Mom said. Your aversion to allowing yourself to be happy. 

It’s funny I suppose, the ease that is now between us somehow feels better than I even expected it to. The quiet way I come to lean on your back or trace the muscles beneath your t-shirt while I’m curled around you, always just happy enough to be touching, and satisfied by the fleeting moments we share.

But I guess, that’s what happens when all we need is someone’s presence; where it’s just time that becomes the greatest commodity. After all, time fossilizes into memories, which will last forever even if we don’t. 

The thing is that I do want you, more or perhaps in a way different than I have ever felt with a man before. 

I know we are early on. I know there is seemingly “forever” to figure this out. But right now, to me, It seems that you are the true compliment to my soul: Where you leave, I begin. Where I fall short, you’re there—carrying on our unique rhythm. The man I met two months ago was vulnerable and excited. The man I’ve known for most of this relationship has been eager and communicative. I've consistently been amazed by you. But the man that has surfaced as of late isn’t you. 

Life is too short to throttle something because of a socially constructed version of normal. And it’s certainly too precious to throw away. We’ve both learned those lessons. I know you’ve spent time drawing comparisons to easier relationships in the past, but the only conclusion I can see is that even though they were easy, they didn’t work. 

Compatibility doesn’t take work. Love does. It takes work to expose and resolve conflicting beliefs and expectations. It takes work to communicate effectively, and we’re doing that early on. It also takes work not to succumb to preconceived fears and give in when those things are difficult. Which I believe, gets easier over time if you allow it. 

If there’s one thing I know for sure, I won’t be arriving on my death-bead wishing I had lived a different life. I’m choosing to live the life my soul has called for. I hope you do the same. I hope you have the courage to share your voice, allow yourself to be happier. I hope you give yourself the life you want and deserve. 

In truth, I knew from the beginning you were going to be different. It was something about your eyes. The kind way you smile made me want those eyes staring into mine as life ages me. At Raya, I watched you look at me with the same eyes as the day we met. You smiled and I could see how it came from deep inside to light your entire face. I know what’s between us is just as real for you, but I also know your jaded heart is afraid. 

In recent years, I’ve realized everything about living life to the fullest is risky. If you’re not at least a little scared from time to time, then maybe you’ve been lulled into taking the ride as a passenger rather than steering your course as the driver on the journey. Life is all about taking risks.
It’s a risk to express an honest opinion, to try something new or give your all to a job or project. Everything about opening yourself to love is risky, and yet many would argue extending unconditional trust is the greatest risk of all. It takes courage to risk and, consciously or not, most people make choices that allow them to stay well within their comfort zone. They hesitate to take action until things feel “right,” or there is some guarantee of an acceptable “safe” outcome. I see this in you. 

There is no question that to risk means taking the chance that we may end up appearing foolish or vulnerable, and yes, maybe even fail or experience the pain of a broken heart.

But avoiding risk means missing out on the thrill of feeling fully alive and becoming all that we are meant to be. The truth is there is just so much more to life than most people are living.

With you - I have no doubts, no questions, no lingering possibilities. I’m risking it all to throw everything on the page for you — but I am only one side of this union, only one part of this unfounded connection, and so the rest lies in your lap. 

Because the reality is that you may choose another, not because she kisses you so deeply, or touches your soul in a way that makes it dance, but because of convenience and ease, two qualities I will never be able to compete with, not that I’d want to anyway. 

I may be a lot of things: But I know I’m not the easy or safe choice right now. And you’ll never be able to find an answer in black and white that supports the argument that us being together is the divine plan.

But, I don’t really want to be that anyway.

I want to be the one who makes you believe in the kind of love you could only dream of. I want to show you what it truly feels like to connect with a woman so deeply that secrets aren’t needed in order to guarantee love. I want to show you what it feels like to have a supporter that helps you climb to the stars. And maybe, I want to show you the moon and all of the secrets she holds. 

Yet, perhaps it’s all too much for you even as wonderful as it is. Maybe I’m not what makes you truly happy, or maybe I am, but you’ll still decide to cage your heart in elsewhere because of the “shoulds” and the reasons that really only echo of a lock and key to a sentence that you never did anything to deserve. 

You’ve submitted to the cultural and social expectations to prove what it means to be happy before. I hope that now you see real care and connection can exist even if it doesn’t conform to what the rest of the world says is right. 

Regardless though, if my perceptions are accurate, or if they are only the rumblings of a heart that misses you, I hope you end up happy.
I hope that whichever way you choose to walk in this life, you are met with every happiness and every ounce of love that you deserve—and I hope to be the one walking by your side. If you do decide this is not what you hoped for, I pray that within the chaos of falling stars, I won’t be your last time experiencing unconditional love. It breaks my heart to think of that, because you’ve never deserved anything less. But, this is your journey to walk, as I’ve already done mine and found that it led straight to you.

So, I hope you are happy.

Not just the kind of happy that turns our mouth into smiles, but the kind that feels like home, the kind that makes you feel at peace and that inspires you to be the man that deep down you know you were born to be. I want to see you do big things for the world. I know you will. 
If it’s not me, I hope she shows you the moon, and that you’ll still get to travel to far-off shores and be led blindfolded across banana leaves and soft sand just so that your senses could come alive within the mystery of discovering a new place.

I hope she wakes you up in the middle of the night worshiping you and your delicious body in the way that you deserve. In my heart, I even hope that she looks at you like the leader and the warrior you are and that she never mistakes who you were with who you are now.
But perhaps most of all, I hope she sees you.

The only thing I’ve wanted was for you to be happy, and to awaken you to your own greatness. In my heart, the way I feel for you flows so effortlessly. But I also know that just because I’m offering it, doesn’t mean you’ll accept it.

Maybe it’s fate, or rather it’s free will—I’m not quite sure of the difference, or if there even is one at this point.

But I care for you, and that means the only thing I want is for you to be truly, earth-shatteringly happy—even if that ends up being found in the arms of someone else, because the only way that I know how to love you is with wings.

Not because I want you to leave, but because I know that some of us are simply meant to stay free.
The trip to Puerto Rico is not what we needed, and yes, I’m speaking for both of us. I went into it fully expecting you to work. What I did not expect was the cold, pressing anxiety that came along with that work. I needed time to talk to you. To really be heard and hear you.

There are things, which I will get to, that we have to figure out. Or at the very least I do. To go on a vacation and work the entire time, wake up on Saturday morning and essentially sacrifice two hours of our time together to sit alone and then decide on leaving…it just doesn’t add up to me. This is why I’m so confused and quickly slipping away from you. You say you want me, and your actions show it most of the time. I know you care for me, but I also know that there’s a lot going on in your mind that I simply cannot understand without being let in. 
I took a risk telling you I was falling in love with you, and I meant it. I took a risk waiting to see you in person to tell you what I’m about to, and I’m taking a risk telling you this way now. I am pregnant. I wanted so badly to talk to you about it in Puerto Rico and even try to see a doctor with you at home, but I never imagined you’d arrive and shut me out so much the way you did. 

I meant it when I told you I wanted to be secure in a decision even on my own in case you decided this was too much. I still stand by that. I am secure in the choice to keep going with this. This letter is not an attempt to make you involved, but after failing to bring this up amidst everything else I have to tell you somehow. To be really real - I don't know if this can work between us. Not because we don't work together, but because I'm truly starting to believe you're incapable of letting it work. That's disappointing to me, but I can't change it. 

So here’s what I want - I want you to know I am here. I’m ready to be a supportive, and patient partner. I'm ready to be strong with you and for you. But only if you allow it. If you don't want it, that's fine too. 

I don't want you to call me after reading this. I don't want to facetime. Not until you know you can have a conversation with me that doesn't involve this cold distant energy you've been putting off. I know I don't deserve that. While you mean so much to me, I am not pressuring you, nor have I been. I am not moving too quickly or assuming feelings for you. I would prefer to wait until you've had time to process and accept that. I'm not asking anything of you but to be logical. I'm just done dwelling on the complexities of this and I'm moving forward accepting the reality. 

The drama associated with how busy you are and how afraid of this you are is too much for me. Especially when we're both high functioning adults and I feel It could be so easy. I know this was long, but I needed to get it out. I have an OB appointment tomorrow, and I have a lot of decisions to make. You were right about a saturation point. I never expected last week to go the way it did and for us to drift apart because of outside stresses, but I simply don't have the time to let it get me down and entrenched in short term visuals of life.

I’ve been dating this girl exclusively for a few months now and we’ve been seeing each other quite a lot. 

Recently via texts, she has been acting cold and responding bluntly, and seems like she has lost all interest in me. Not showing any affection or signs she’s into me like previously and not wanting to see me in person.

I decided to stop messaging her to see if she would send a message and a few days later she did asking what I’d been doing and why I wasn’t texting her.

But the same thing again, blunt convos and seems uninterested in me.

I'm getting the feeling I’m a backup solution and she has met someone else and she’s just keeping me on the side but wants me there if something goes wrong.

My sister is 5 years older than me and girls I date always get way too attached to my sister.
My sis is very feminine, and very ambitious and accomplished and a girl's tend to always look at her like some sort of a role model.
It's to the point, where I've been in situations where their friendships are almost too good and gets in the way of the relationship.
I have this ex for example who did me wrong, and atm she's still close with my sis.
It's to the point where I feel it's borderline disrespectful because I would never be close with an ex if my sister's.

Everytime I bring a girl home, these girls always make a connection with my sis and somehow end up making plans.
And even the girls start flaking on plans we have so they can go do girl stuff with my sis.

I'm at the point where in worried of future relationships.
I have no issue with girls becoming cool with my sis, but unless I'm gonna marry this girl, I really don't want them to be hanging out as much as I hangout with the gf.

I rmr this one time I brought a girl over just to Netflix and chill, thinking I was gonna be the only one home.
Sis was there and I had to introduce them.
I went to the bathroom and when I came out, the girl and my sis were already planning a vacation to the carribean.

Free love was on a rampage. But free love was exactly that. Love and respect and experimentation outside of the confines of a serious relationship. Birth control, abortions, and penicillins are all wonderful things that have begun to remove the stigma associated with premarital sex in our culture... but sometimes I wish we’d bring a little of that back. Or at least pretend that we’re not animals. Let me explain. Hookup culture is not free love. It’s the new wave of the century and hookup culture involves not only fucking, but fucking people over. Both sides withhold love and respect and the first person to ghost the other is the winner. The person who withholds the most is the winner. They’re “strong”. “Untouchable”   And “un-phased”. But why are those positive attributes when it comes to such a vulnerable activity such as sex? You’re literally exposing yourself and some of the time opening yourself up to the potential of disease if a condom breaks. And most of the time when it comes to hook up culture, you’re engaging in this vulnerable activity with someone that doesn’t even respect you or your emotions. My point is that you don’t have to want to marry someone or even be dating to still have a mutual respect for each other. You don’t need to be exclusive. You don’t need be afraid of “catching feelings”. You just need to be communicative and respect each other. In my opinion sex should never be engaged in between parties that have no respect for each other. Sex outside of the confines of a relationship should be free love. You can still have a hookup buddy and not treat them as if they’re not human. You can still be upfront with your intentions. No need to lie, deceive, disregard and disrespect. Go have sex.

I was a very shy around 10 and still am to this day, but when I was a kid I really liked this girl at my classrom.
She had the most beautiful blue eyes and pale skin, she was also kind of popular and I was not the most weird guy but nowehere close to being at her position hahah. One day I just decided to tell her how I felt, it was a very bold move and the way I said it was quite forward too. Just told her I would love to eat lunch with her sometime at school. After that I ran away and cried in a corner far from the playground for 20 mins. She did answered via a friend and a piece of paper. She gave me her number and I couldnt believe it. I was too naive though. While I was all over her writing poems and telling her how beautiful she was every day and not knowing how to put boundries in myself as any respectable 14-15 y/o would. She was taking pics of the chats and showing them to all the class. 

It for sure was rough but I learnt how to be forward at least. I did felt she was interested in me and my confidence and lack of self counciousness. But her social status was stronger than that. Don't blame her.

She did told me that being direct and honest was quite a good trait to have so go on and take her word for it haha. Also have learnt by the most beautiful reltionship i have had. There is nothing better than to love and be loved without feeling judged and chained or smthng. If you ever feel that you are limited and not fully loved by your partner, please talk with them right fkn now, for true peace its the best feeling ever. 

I hsve also had toxic relationships with women but mostly with drugs, not too proud of it but i did learnt alot regarding coitous during my wild days which is nice to bring into any relationship.

Okay so, Before the Last day of school, I had a project to turn in. So i went to my teacher's 1st period class. Then I saw him, He looked so adorable 📷.  (I almost couldn't keep my eyes off him)

Apparently, My teacher brought cupcakes for her 1st period and asked me to stay and so i did. Suddenly, My Best friend, walked inside the classroom. Apparently, she has the same teacher for 1st period. And I whispered in her and say that, That guy was kind pretty cute.

And she was like go be friends.

He looked so much older so i thought he was Senior at first glance. when i walked up and asked If he was he senior. he smiled and told me he was freshman. his 15 same age as me.

Moving on...

I went back to my friend and she told me his name. and where sits at.

Etc..

While, we are walking in the hallway i asked him if he liked anime and he say yeah. After that i went back to my friend.

(I get so nervous around guys especially the ones I secretly Like)

Then Second period, I was texting my friends and was and i was talking about him. My best friend said that she has him for her 4th period and asked if i wanted to come so i can get his number.I said Yeah, ""If it was destiny""

My 4th period teacher said i could go to my friend's 4th period, and then he said ""No"". So I thought maybe it wasn't destiny. and was sitting here accepting that it was never meant to be. And then i asked my 4th period teacher again, And He said ""yes"" The final time. So i went to my friend's 4th period. I saw him there, Playing games. But i didn't do anything. Cause we barely know each other and i am shy. So my friend said we will asked him in the hallway. And we missed the chance. So i was like no worries, it probably wasn't meant to be.

Then I moved on with my life, I wasn't planning to go to on the last day of school. But it was my other friend's birthday and she was going to bring cupcakes for everyone. and she really wanted me to come. So, I came on the last day of school. He wasn't there (cuz its the last day)

Then I spent several periods with my best friend, I remember in her 1st period (My teacher let me stay) We were doing things on snap chat. And then

I saw him on Quick add.

Probably because my friend has his Snapchat. But he was in my Quick add, So i added him. and Said Hi.

He added me back later respond.

I want to get to know him, But i don't want to come off Annoying. Sometimes when i'm texting someone i feel like i'm bothering them. Any Advice? Plus, he barely knows who i am and i barely know him. But i have the opportunity to get to know him. Please help any advice.?

I (24F) have been seeing this guy (26M) for four months or so now. We haven’t really had the “what are we” discussion, but last night I was borderline blackout drunk and I remember kind of bringing it up. I told him I wasn’t seeing anyone else and asked him if he was, to which he said no. 

The thing is, this is about all I remember of the conversation. But I think I went on in a similar vein for a little. From what I can recall things were pretty normal afterwards and this morning everything was normal, though. But, he’s been kind of quiet over text today, so I’m worried I said something that may have gotten him freaked. 

I told him I appreciated his patience with me being “drunk and messy” and told him I didn’t remember much, he didn’t answer that text yet but I’m hoping that serves to speak to the fact that my filter was totally gone and I may have steered the conversation in a way in my drunken state that I wouldn’t have in a sober state.

But I still can’t tell if it’s worth addressing this conversation, and see if there was something I said to freak him, and if so, how would I even do that?

He is such a gentleman and polite. We went to a cafe since we had to wait 1hr for our table. We spoke about our academic/work past, current and future and overall chit chat nothing too deep but interesting nonetheless. He was attentive and listened all my blabbering as well asking questions. I would say that is some kind of interest even tho some ppl can be extremely polite and avoid awkward silences. We got our table, and he asked me if I wanted to try his plate, I said yes and offer some of mine. I found this very interesting and somewhat relaxing. 

Afterwards we walked around the neighborhood admiring the street art and looking into window panes while chit chatting. We went into an antique store and reminisced on oldschool times and our tastes. We stopped by an art gallery and bantered with the gallery owner while giving us a tour of the collection. After plenty of walking, then we decided to go into this low key bar and had some drafts while getting into subjects like our relationships with our parents and dating life. He mentioned he had a girlfriend a lil over year ago before the pandemic. I didn't pry for more, nor he asked about my love life. My last and only serious relationship was over a decade ago (sad I know).

One thing I noticed was that his body language was more open, before was gave me the feels of super proper but still friendly (I'm used to guys being all over me so I was not able gauge him). At one point our knees touched and he didn't moved it away. Mood felt more relaxed, but I think what if the alcohol had an influence. We were not drunk or even tipsy, but we did have 2 6oz belgians.

Afterwards he offered to give me a ride home, it was still daylight around 6:30 PM. Then he also offered to give me a ride to work Today and go to a cafe before hand. I agreed. We rode to my place. He brought his film camera, we took a selfie together... by his request. We hugged and I went home. I texted the usual ""had a great time, got home safe? text"". He responded and also said he had a nice afternoon.

Today rolls in, I texted him when I woke up, saying I looked forward to our morning date. He responds see you at 8. He was early, I was ready, we took off. By his request, we stopped by a landmark referencing a city we lived in before the pandemic and we took 2 selfies with my phone. We rode to the cafe and had our coffees. We were talking about our Sunday date, then he holds my hand, for a while, like my hand was sweating, he still held it tho. Thenwe rode to work. I work for a fine art printer and he used to work in photography so I invited him to see the shop and he agreed. I spoke about our products and services and then he left. We hugged goodbye, kiss on the cheek.

  
I know this is super early but I realized I have a history of sabotaging the good for myself. I'm so not cool with being hurt that I seriously have conformed with having fleeting/short meaningless relationships in an attempt to avoid any closeness, but then at the same time I want to pursue or ""catch"" if you will, the dudes that may not be looking for a relationship, or a relationship with ME. If it doesn't work out I  usually recover quite quickly. I seldom date, but I'm getting older and I feel I may go so deep into relationship apathy, I may end up alone... by choice. I feel I have love to give, I want to be loved too and when guys like this show up \[once in a blue moon\] I see myself looking for any flaw and run away.  


At his age, he's going back to school and he may have to move to a different place, not sure yet. For some reason I feel anxious about a future, even tho we only been out twice. I'm having a hard time accepting I may get hurt, it may not workout and If should even give it a try. When I'm pursuing the guy that's not good for me is like I already know how it will end and I don't care, I'll find another one. I'm anxious thinking about being in love again \[over a decade\], like for real real and not just a fleeting physical/sexual attraction. I feel confused and somewhat afraid.  


Not sure if I'm asking anything here but wanted to share my insecurity.

I’m coming here for some advice or to see if I’m just overthinking this.

We started seeing each other in early April this year having met through a dating app. The first date was full of the usual awkwardness from both sides but honestly it was mostly me. The second date she was much more comfortable and the setting we were in was very intimate/close, but I denied anything from happening. I felt that it was too soon and any relationship I’ve had in the past that’s started like that has ended horribly. I was trying to avoid that and take things slow.

The next time we met she came to my apartment and we watched a couple movies on my couch. She made it obvious what she was expecting and a younger me would have gone for it, but I still stopped it from escalating. This has actually happened a few times now, and it’s to the point that I’m turned off by her oddly enough. Like, in the sense that she so easily was ready for an intimate encounter. I know that sounds awful on my part.

Other things I’ve noticed are that she has a lot of emotional issues that I’m not equipped to handle currently, she’s quick to snap on me and apologize later, she’s into certain sexual things I’m not comfortable doing, is a kind of girly girl hippie type it turns out which I don’t seem attracted to, and the worst part is that she depends on her ex for money. An assumption I have made to myself is that she still loves him, just based on how she usually brings him up.

However she’s been patient with me, any issue I have she’s been understanding. She’s so sweet and caring usually and we both generally have the same likes.

I initially did a little digging and found her on social media and from what I could find, she appeared to be a girl who's never dated before who looked like a Plain Jane/ Ugly Duckling growing up. When I saw her folks, the mom was a total MILF and I assumed she'd take after her (old saying of look at the mom and that's what the girl you like would look like older). I used to help her while we worked remotely, and we hit it off. She was exceedingly friendly and made it easy to flirt, though she didn't flirt back. We immediately had a date planned, and it went mixed. Turns out she has dated, though she tries to act confident, she isn't and let's the littlest things bug her (she complimented a kid on an Anime shirt and almost cried because they didn't acknowledge her compliment), also the day after she PMs me and immediately goes from clingy to distant when I told her I was currently busy for a work training. We started to pick up the momentum again and was about to do a 2nd date, but she suggested a pricey restaurant and since I paid the 1st time,  I merely suggested she cover me for the 2nd since she planned that when I wanted to either hike at a trail or walk at the park. She laughs at the idea, then becomes flakey. Eventually I stopped chatting with her, gave it some time and started to reconnect, but it was never the same. Lastly her folks tagged her on their anniversary post on social media in which I get to see what they looked like in their 20s, and my coworker crush takes after her dad (looked almost like they were sibblings!). She was also hesitant in sending pics during the whole time I've gotten to know her and the times she's sent stuff, they were exceedingly blurry.

My problem was this.. before I got to know the actual them, I fell hard for what I thought she was. I know it's just fantasy, but it's hard to move on and just see them as a friend and for who they really are and disassociate fantasy from reality. I know the issue, but I don't know the solution.

I ended up in toxic ""relationships"" in between - as in I tried dating in between again, but it is like the guys I ended up with all seemed to know I was in a vulnerable state. 

This year as soon as I started focusing on myself, deleted dating apps, I ended up with someone who just came into my life by chance. Everything was going great and I was able to be calm and not have thoughts go into overdrive and trust him.

But then I found out he has actually hooked up with a coworker of mine and I have ended up in a bit of a tailspin. I see her a her desk and then days when she isn't in the office my mind tells me she is with him. 

He told me she was just a drunk booty call twice, he was honest but I worry that maybe there was more.

How do you get over your trust issues?

So if a girl you talked to once, a while ago, messaged you ""would you be interested in grabbing a coffee sometime?"" Would you assume it was a date or not? Because he responded with ""Sure, would love to"" i'm just not sure if i need to clarify with him or not and i'm overthinking it.
