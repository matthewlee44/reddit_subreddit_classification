41,oewo87,1625583652,Mod PSA: Be careful what information you put out there,"Hi everyone. Stepping in with a PSA.

TL;DR: The internet is not private. Ever.

One of the things us mods do behind the scenes is to sweep for suspicious behavior on the sub. While most of the time you never even see it, we've heard some heartbreaking stories of our members being harassed offline or their information posted on Reddit or other social media and used against them. We can’t stop this, but we can offer some tips on how to keep yourselves safer. We want you all to feel comfortable sharing what you can as we support each other.

Some may have seen this already: 

https://www.insidehook.com/article/sex-and-dating/strangers-critique-dating-profile-reddit-key-online-dating-success

We're using this as an opportunity to remind everyone to be careful what information they put out there. This is one of the reasons we welcome throwaways (with post history/karma, but message us [via modmail](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdatingoverthirty) with questions on that policy). Many people are able to be more forthcoming online behind a veneer of anonymity. We cannot stop people from scraping this site, even if the users who do so get banned immediately. The writer in question asked to post here to survey users and we said no. They at least asked - many do not. 

You're fooling yourself if you think social networking (or making any post online) is 100% safe — all it takes is an ""approved follower"" to take a screen-capture of something you say and share it with the world. We forget that the words of those who live in our browsers belong to other people, just as real as we are. By bringing the names of these people to light, real life identities have been comprised and people’s lives have been altered for the worse. It has happened on this sub before. Doxxing on Reddit is against the TOS and WILL get you banned by the admins. 

I was a teenager when IRC and early search engines came out. Before that dial-up text-only bulletin boards were the closest thing we had to a sub like this. I nerded out so hard there. My mother, for all that she's batshit crazy, did have a point with her paranoia - ""Don’t share your name, don't tell them your gender, your age, where you live or what school you go to. Don’t meet anyone online without checking them out first, and don’t tell them anything private about you.""  

Anyone on the Internet can see our posts here. But only users with a Reddit account can comment, vote or reply. Anyone can grab a screengrab and share it on their own social media. They do not need to be on Reddit to do that.

This isn’t news to anyone here I hope. Some people use the anonymity of the Internet to harass and stalk. Sometimes people offer fake opinions along with their fake names to solicit information from you. (My mother loved this game in RL - she'd pretend she knew nothing to encourage someone to talk so she could get the dirt on them.) Not cool there and not cool here. We might have the right to anonymity, but if anyone can put the pieces together and figure out who we are, does it matter?

Always, always, always ask yourself, when you are tempted to post something that might help people find you - ""who am I talking to?""

Make sure if you post personal content you are either okay with it being out of your control, or do what I do, which is change identifying details in my posts to make it harder for me to be identified. I might (and have) done things like change the gender of someone, adjust identifying details, list myself in a different state from where I've lived, change the order of events (if something happened with a friend I might say it happened with a coworker), or tweak the age when something happened. I'm not lying, as everything I talk about here is my own experience. Instead I change it slightly so if anyone knew me and read this, they'd not know for sure it was me. When in doubt, if you don’t think you can adjust the detail and keep the thread of your story, don’t post. This *doesn't* mean don't post. It means be careful with what you say. Instead, as my lawyer friend likes to say it's ""plausible deniability."" 

This is not meant to be a post on how to stay safe online. There are plenty of those out there. We will leave that up to each of you to decide how little or how much you want to guard your privacy. We're just reminding you all that we have close to half a million users as of this morning, and likely many more who read just for the fun of it. Make sure whatever you put out there you are content having all those people know.",datingoverthirty,t5_34cyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/oewo87/mod_psa_be_careful_what_information_you_put_out/
