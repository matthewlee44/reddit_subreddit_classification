0,o21ofj,1623948327,Yikes,"So a couple of days ago I posted a thing about me meeting up with a man I matched with on Tinder. The messages have been very spicy to say the least and this afternoon we made plans to meet for a walk this evening. 
I did however feel the need to make it clear that there were no promise of sex or anything else and he seemed fine with that. 
Then we were supposed to arrange where to meet and he started asking if I was sure I wanted to meet up and I said that I already said yes and that I was getting vibes from him that he was hesitant. 

Anyway we did make the plans and 20 minutes before we were supposed to meet he texted me saying that he had a ‚Äúfriend‚Äù coming over because he really ‚Äúwanted to go down on someone tonight‚Äù and that I seemed hesitant to let him do that (yes that‚Äôs exactly what I wrote to him). He apparently didn‚Äôt take that cue from me. 
I‚Äôm not saying it would never happen on a first date but jeez, can we at least have a chat first?

So I wrote back somewhere along the lines of ‚ÄúWow while I do appreciate honesty this was obviously just for sex (not that I didn‚Äôt notice) so maybe let‚Äôs just not meet up‚Äù 
He then replied that I seem to be a very cool person but that he got feelings of control from me and ‚Äúgirlfriend demands‚Äù and that kills all the fun and playfulness. 
I guess speaking your mind and not promising to put out the first time we meet is controlling as far as he‚Äôs concerned. And the ‚Äúgirlfriend demands‚Äù I have no idea where he got that from. 

My first initial thought was that I had been leading him on but I scrapped that thought, we are both adults and not teenagers (at least I am)

I didn‚Äôt reply to his last message so now I‚Äôm drinking wine and watching the Euro 2020 instead üòÇ",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/o21ofj/yikes/

5,o2c8ti,1623976400,Need some insight on online dating,"Hey folks,

Y'all always seem to be a fount of knowledge, so hopefully you can lend me some insight.  I took the plunge and downloaded Tinder, Bumble, and Hinge two days ago.  I took some photos and made a basic but honest profile.

I ended up matching and chatting with about 30 women since then in the different platforms and have scheduled 3 dates.  This is good but I'm still getting matches and I don't have the time during the day to talk to all these folks.  I'm also not sure how many dates I can and realistically should schedule.

And yes before someone flexes on me, I'm sure lots of folks get more and this is not really a big deal.  Its just something to which I'm learning to adjust.

I've seen some women talking about how they filter but I haven't read much about how men filter their matches and figure out which women to focus their time on.  

This is just such a different way to do things than when I last dated in the 90s.  I'm not sure I'm handling this right.  I don't want to be a jerk to anyone and I've had some good and genuine conversations that I've really enjoyed.  I don't necessarily want to ignore new matches or miss out on interesting people but I have a realistic limit as I work and focus on my responsibilities as well.

What is the right and respectful way to manage? How do y'all do it? Maybe I should delete one of the apps? It seems tinder has the least information about each woman and the chats there seem to have the least depth.  Maybe I should delete that and focus on the more meaningful engagement on the other two apps? Maybe that'd give a better signal to noise ratio.

I hate to curtail it too much though.  What if all these initial dates ghost or flake?

Also, its weird that I get so many matches from tinder as I mostly swipe left there. I'm guessing it has to do with their algorithm maybe? or maybe just more people on there in my city?

Anyway, if I'm crazy or off base or if this is just how it is and I need to suck it up and figure it out, then please let me know that.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/o2c8ti/need_some_insight_on_online_dating/

I had a string of men be abusive to me, even though I was nice to them. I didn't really like them, I just wanted a boyfriend. Meanwhile the guys I liked never liked me, no matter how hard I tried, including buying presents. I wasn't ugly yet struggled to meet good guys. In my 20's I was a model yet once again the guys I liked didn't like me so I took what I could. That was horrific because not only didn't I like them, they were mean. I had guys be verbally abusive and steal from me. One guy was a pimp and tried to sell me and when I said no he dumped me (and drained my bank account).

I stopped dating these guys in my 20's and figured I preferred being alone to them and hoped God would send me my husband. I went to every single group I could, tried phone dating, and tried to find men where I worked and at school with no luck. Meanwhile, I start seeing my friends all get married. I figured I was a late bloomer and eventually I would meet the one. At 39 a guy from my past came back into my life and figured it was about time but he dumped me again.  Just try dating at 39 when you don't want kids or guys with kids and see what's out there. I know bad people who steal and cheat who found the one yet I never did. I would have bent over backward and done anything for a good guy yet rarely met good guys.  When I was younger I stupidly slept with men thinking I was their girlfriend and so excited I finally had a boyfriend then they dumped me. I tried online dating on and off for close to 20 years and no luck.

We're not in our twenties and the pool of potential life partners who don't already have kids is steadily shrinking. I imagine a single mother would be splitting time and attention between her children, and possibly co-parenting with the father, and dating, in addition to her job and general life stuff. This sounds like there'd be more stress and less quantity of hours to give to someone.  Of course, if she's a stellar human being then it's worth the extra effort on my part. But with less time together I fear we're less likely to see each other as great... so that's a Catch-22. I stopped multi-dating a long time ago because I discover and care about each woman less... to the point I forget to contact some for a couple weeks and hurt their feelings. Relationships don't move forward. I don't want to be that guy.

To the childfree men seeking a long-term relationship, are you still dating only childfree women? Or you are just like ""whoever, whenever"" like a zen master?

Which immediately turned me off.

How do you make conversation flow better and increase interest?","I started using dating apps again about a week and a half ago.  I've installed Bumble, Match, Hinge, and WooPlus.  Fairly soon (almost immediately) after I signed up on Match, I had a match on there with someone who was fairly open and talkative and flirty who really liked me, and after about a week of talking, I met up with her twice last weekend.  We were starting to like each other and saw we could develop feelings, but this past Tuesday, she decided not to continue with me due to religious differences (I've been feeling disappointed about that).

Other than that person, I currently have 8 conversations going across the various dating apps. The conversations don't seem to be flowing nearly as easily, and I haven't met any of them in person yet.  Some profiles say they aren't in a hurry or just want to see where things go etc., but I feel like it's really hard to keep a conversation going much of the time.  I'll ask about things in their profile, things they like to do for fun etc., and sometimes comment on stuff.  But often it has been feeling like a bit of a chore.  It's like many people don't really want to open up.   Maybe I should try to open up a bit more and bring up something random?  Also, as a guy, is it creepy for a guy to flirt?  Admittedly I tend not to flirt, but usually just try to converse about various things.

I used some dating sites in my 20s, and it seemed conversation was easier then.

Another thing I've noticed is that on a couple of the dating apps, it seems my matches based on my filters are running out or have run out already.  One of the apps (WooPlus) started to say ""come back tomorrow for more matches"", and since then, it has started giving me matches that are a lot further away (honestly, farther than I'd want to drive).  Match has been showing me profiles multiple times occasionally.  I've wondered if my search parameters are too narrow.  I've been looking for women who don't smoke (dealbreaker for me), and have unchecked many of the religion checkboxes (religion could be a major factor), and I'm looking for women who don't want (or don't want more) children.  Also, I've been setting my distance to about 25 miles from me.

Yesterday I set up an account on eHarmony to see who I might match with there.  I noticed one profile on eHarmony that I've matched with on Match (one of the slow conversations).  I'm hoping to match with more people there though.

I finally felt ready to pursue a LTR, was interested where this could go (as in dating, friendship or LTR), and wanted to go very slowly which I communicated. We didn't do anything physical except hugs. 

In a conversation about concerns, she told me tonight that she didn't think I felt sexual attraction to her through my body language and that sex is more important to her in bonding than me it seemed like. I told her sex is important to me but when I go too quickly it doesn't work and in the past, she told me that when she has moved too quickly it didn't work for her either. We will not be going on dates anymore.
 
Frankly I thought she was happy or OK with the pace, she said she was happy but couldn't read a sexual pull. I do admit I wondered if we had chemistry. To me though, sexuality and that pull was something I wanted to explore or it could have been explored in a less fluid way. I thought it was kind of cool that not everything was overt and yes it was romantic. She even had demisexual in her profile and even though I am not, I guess I was acting like one üòÇ. I don't trust that spark or that wild desire which I have had in the past. 

A quick breakdown: We're both women - I am 40 and bi, she is mid 30s. I am more outgoing, she is introverted. I have avoided relationships most of my life. She still lives in the joint-owned house with the person who she had a long-term relationship with. I am confident she doesnt like him anymore and it is hard to sell up etc. We had also really weird things in common and the conversation flowed. She is a very kind and empathic person but not very assertive. She was so great around consent. I felt attracted to her, she said she felt attracted to me tonight when we said we wouldn't date anymore but who knows. I started to have feelings for her a couple of weeks ago. 

With my history of sexual assault and trauma in my early 20s, I have also never had a good romantic encounter with a man plus I have body image issues. I have been avoidant around sexuality and last had casual sex with an addict around 3 years ago which turned out to be awful, the aftermath mainly. 

(Please be kind around this. I will not be defined around it and was excited to explore like I said.)

Do you think it's just two people who collided with different needs and some miscommunication? I don't want to be held back from a LTR because I'm not moving at the ""normal"" pace. I opened up a lot and think I can meet someone but mate they have to be patient. 

Thoughts?

43,o3nq6o,1624130443,Can I vent a little here?,"TLDR: I got dumped over text by a guy in his 50‚Äôs who is unemployed, doesn‚Äôt have a drivers license and smokes way too much weed. The reason: I didn‚Äôt reflect his ‚Äúvalue‚Äù. 

First date: 
Since I‚Äôm new to the area my date (M50‚Äôs) picks a great place and tells me he‚Äôs happy to take care of the dinner order. He orders a strawberry lemonade, a pretzel and a cookie ‚Äî to share!!! I find out during dinner that he‚Äôs been on unemployment for a few years because he hurt his back a while back. So I figure his frugal ordering is.... understandable. He‚Äôs been using this time for mindfulness, self care, healthy living, etc. etc. I can respect that. I also find out over dinner that he‚Äôs been on a strict Keto diet. I asked how long he‚Äôs been off the diet (refer to dinner order) and he says he‚Äôs still on it. No elaborating on the cookie he‚Äôs shoving in his face. Anyhoooo.....

Surprisingly the conversation was good enough for me to join him on a walk after dinner ‚Äî he‚Äôs smart, funny and nice. His belly started hurting a bit apparently (I wonder why!).  When it was time to call it a night he asks if I can drop him off at his apartment. I offered to let him drive my car so he doesn‚Äôt have to navigate me and he said he can‚Äôt because he doesn‚Äôt have a drivers license. He just hasn‚Äôt renewed it (reminder: this man is in his 50‚Äôs). I drive up to his apartment building and he asks if I want to come up to smoke a little weed (from our conversation it became clear he smokes weed abundantly and often). I tell him I need to drive, so not a good idea. We say bye. 

The next couple of days he sends light, witty, funny texts. Super casual and brief. I respond in kind.

He asks me out again. I reflect on the first date. Clearly we will never have a future, but overall I had a nice time and I‚Äôm really trying to get more comfortable with the whole dating thing. I figure... it‚Äôs not like I need someone‚Äôs money or transportation. I myself smoke every so often. If he doesn‚Äôt have the same life constraints and obligations as I do, who am I to judge? If it‚Äôs not serious, why not have fun like everyone advises for those of us trying to get back out there? 

Second date: 
I tell him upfront I‚Äôd like to split the bill (I wanted to actually have dinner!). I had a great time without the pressure to overanalyze the potential. He asked if I wanted to hang out at his place after, just to continue enjoying each other‚Äôs company. I told him I wouldn‚Äôt mind as long as it was ‚Äúgood clean fun‚Äù. He got the message and was very positive about it and an absolute gentleman. Great second date. 

The texts proceed as they had before. Just fun and light. I had A LOT going on on the work and parenting front so maybe my responses took a little longer but generally I would reply the same day. I was getting more and more enthusiastic about what seemed to be a really cool budding friendship above and beyond the dating thing. I kept my work and ‚Äúmama drama‚Äù out of the picture. He‚Äôs super complimentary the whole time. In one of my responses, I say ‚Äúyou‚Äôre awesome‚Äù ‚Äî totally sincere and within appropriate context.....I think??? 

Apparently he found my compliment patronizing or insulting somehow. Next thing I know I get a looong text about how he doesn‚Äôt need anyone or anything to show him his value. That when his environment doesn‚Äôt reflect it then it concerns him that he isn‚Äôt being seen or heard in a truly intimate way. That when he‚Äôs being the paragon of gentlemanliness and it isn‚Äôt reciprocated he must accept that lest it poison and turn his good intentions against him. (That‚Äôs literally how he communicates). And that my waiting 1-3 days virtually every time to respond to his texts in no way conveys my desire, and he wanted more. (I went back on our texts and confirmed to myself that I replied 1 day later exactly two times‚Äî the last time being after 3 AM because I was working until after 2 AM - maybe all that weed makes it hard for him to track time idk). That‚Äôs only a fraction of his text but you get the gist. He ends with saying my company has been a great pleasure and ‚Äúthank you for your time‚Äù.

What the actual F$&amp;K ??? My friends warned me about the instant gratification often expected in modern dating but this guy literally switched on a dime! I just responded, ‚Äúlikewise it has been a pleasure. I wish you the best.‚Äù  But I am beyond confused.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/o3nq6o/can_i_vent_a_little_here/
44,o3ogs7,1624132640,How hard is putting yourself out there again?,"Hi there!

First post on Reddit... Ever.  In the last 24 years I've been in only two relationships.  Both ended because the other half didn't understand what marriage loyalty was.  I just found out in April that her 'friend' has been her on again off again lover for the last 3 years.  Blah blah.  Anyway, I'm not even close to dating, but I'm realizing that a precursor to dating is just putting myself out there and trying to be social, meet new friends, and settle into a 'social confidence' if you will.  Since this channel is all about that, I'd love to hear from some of you about your experience, how you took the first steps, and for the love of God, someone please tell me it's gets easier.

48,o3rtil,1624142984,Is it only about sex?,"This is a story with some self discovery and learning, not a vent.  I (F) am done with OLD and hoping to meet someone in person.  So I know a guy in person who reached out to me and we got to know each other through texting.  He is extremely attractive, objectively a 10 and completely my type.  He mentioned he likes the FWB arrangement and I said I can't do it without getting attached, and it's not what I'm looking for anyway.  But we've maintained a pen pals type of connection and we made out once.  

I decided I want to have sex with him, and we tried to make arrangements to meet up this week, but his roommates were going to be home all the time so we couldn't go to his place.  And I live further away and he doesn't want to drive it. (I work in his town, so I'm there anyway.)  I asked if we could hang out in public even if it means sex is not going to happen, and he just never texted back.  

And it just hurts.  I feel like I'm not worth his time unless I'm in his bed.  This feeling kinda is a surprise to me.  I am actually ok with an undefined relationship.  I can be curious just to see what happens.  I already know it's unwise to control/force a relationship to fit into cookie cutter expectations.  Just let it be what it is; life's messy and beautiful.  

This is probably a FWB rule.  I've never done a FWB thing, so IDK, but I guess it's logical for people avoiding attachment.  In my heart, I do not understand it though.  It's so cold.  

This has seriously cut into my self worth.  My last BF dumped me because I'm not sexual enough, even though I massively opened up and tried new things, it wasn't enough for him.  Is my ONLY value to men sexual?  

I DO want sex.  AND I AM interesting and fun outside of the bedroom too.  Do men think I'm not interesting or fun or loving?  Am I not worth their time?  

I do know my own worth, so you don't need to tell me that.  But let's not pretend that humans aren't social animals. We do read our value in other's eyes too.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/o3rtil/is_it_only_about_sex/

I later text asking for clarification, and she says we just don't mesh well. I wished her the best, but I've been stuck on her for literal weeks.

I don't know why. Brains are weird. I kept thinking there was insane potential there that just didn't turn into actuality. I think I said / done a few things that painted me with ick I'm sure. My footing just got all screwed up. I think we were both just awkwardly nervous.

Those dates would give anyone a headache of nervous chatter. I know enough facts about her to write a novel to be honest. It's just so weird learning that much about someone just to have them end it.

So I keep waking up every morning hoping to not miss her anymore, but I do. I've went on other dates, where I didn't care one way or another.

Everyone says to never contact her again and respect boundaries and not be weird and all of that stuff, so I don't. But then weeks go by and I still hurt.

Every day I'm just tempted. Just tempted to ask for clarification and a 2nd chance.

I know how bad this sounds, but yeah. I've been in year long relationships that didn't hurt when they ended. What tf do I do. Everything seemed like it was going well, but the last time we met she was in a horrible mood. I just saw her bumble act come across as I was swiping.

Important edit: 1st date I was so concerned with putting my best foot forwards I was leaving out a lot of stuff about my life.  I was very vague about my circumstances. On the 2nd date I came clean which painted me with ick.  I think she looked at me as a liar or something.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/o3v17k/what_do_i_do_if_i_authentically_just_cant_get/

I don‚Äôt want to move to the burbs, but am constantly matched with people whose location says my city, but they are actually in the suburbs. Wondering how others in this situation handle this. 

Asking someone to come downtown and find parking is a hassle. And I have no need to maintain a car living where I do. I walk to work or hop on public transportation. I‚Äôd be willing to take a train to the suburbs for a date. But not sure that is a realistic way to pursue someone when I wouldn‚Äôt be interested in living out there.

Does anyone have success stories about dating someone this way? Or is more realistic to stick to my location boundaries and deal with the smaller dating pool?

56,o3vobt,1624156484,Profile Review and Update,"Hey folks,

So in this thread I got some good advice, a suggestion to post my profile for feedback, and a request for an update: [https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/o2c8ti/need\_some\_insight\_on\_online\_dating/](https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/o2c8ti/need_some_insight_on_online_dating/)

My profile is here: [https://imgur.com/gallery/3FVgQp8](https://imgur.com/gallery/3FVgQp8)

So I had tinder, bumble, and Hinge active for approximately three days before I took the advice to pause or hide myself and work through my matches.

I had 30+ matches, not sure how many.  Some of those on bumble never made the first move and expired.  Some of those turned into chats where the women stopped responding/fizzled out.

Two of them sent me messages in the middle of the night inviting me over.  I was asleep both times.  Both times, I could figure out how to properly say I wasn't interested in that kind of interaction.  Both times they disappeared somehow before I could answer them.  I'm not sure why that happened but its probably for the best.

Also, I want to be clear that in the description below these women are very nice people and I respect and appreciate them.  I also recognize their have their own thoughts and feelings about these events and you are only getting my side of it.  Out of respect for them, I am giving them nicknames.

I went on a date with RollerGirl today.  She was awesome.  She is the first date I have had in a very long time.  We met at a Palateria that had mangonadas and talked for a long time.  She was very attractive, more in person than even her profile, very nice.  She seems a bit jaded by the dating process, which, I gather from here, seems normal and probably a healthy response.  She gave me good advice, told me about herself, and we had good conversation.  We laughed and just generally had a good time.  She sent me a message after that she'd like to see me again.  I would also enjoy her company again.  She seems to be a nice and genuine person.

My concerns are that she moves every so many years.  Her current position is as permanent as she likes but she is already contemplating future moves.  She also let me know she doesn't usually date men with children and has some hesitancy about that as she is child free.  I truthfully told her my position on that is that my ex-wife and I co-parent well and amicably.  My children already have a mother and, while I would certainly want any girlfriend of mine to get along with my kids, I don't expect or want anyone else to parent them.  I want a girlfriend to spend time with ME and I want to spend my free time with and on her.

RollerGirl told me during the date that it was important that I experience the dating apps and date other people. I believe she said this as a genuine attempt to help and because she is a sweet person.  It did make me wonder if she was having a good time though.  But as the date went on I was sure she was and I feel like her expression of a desire to see me again is a confirmation of that.  At least I hope so because I really like her.

I do have other matches and conversations though.  But I feel like RollerGirl set the bar really high out of the gate.  My only worry if we do hit it off is how long she will stay in town.  A year or two probably but beyond that? I don't know.

Buddhist and I chatted on the apps and then moved to texting.  We have a date set up for the 29th at a local restaurant known for casual and fast dining but still a step up from a Mcdonalds.  I know the advice is not to do that but I figured since we've been chatting a bit we could probably converse well.  We have had some pretty deep conversations about life and rough past experiences and some fun philosophical conversations on a wide variety of topics.  She is fun to text with.  I'm not sure how that will translate in person but I guess I'll find out then.  Buddhist has tried to get to know who I am and what my beliefs are. She liked the answers thus far.  She has texted me very sweet things and nice well wishes more regularly.  I respond in kind.

Systems Analyst and I matched and chatted in the app over the span of a couple days and agreed on a dinner date on July 1st.  I need to pick a place and message her with the details. She and I have also had some deep conversations, covering some of the same topics as above and some different ones.  She is smart and interesting and engaging.  Again I'm not sure how that will translate in person but we'll see.  Systems Analyst has tried to understand what I'm about, what I want in a relationship, and where I'm headed in life.  After a wonderful and deep set of conversations we haven't messaged in a bit but I will follow up with her soon to plan the date.

Librarian and I chatted in app and then she aske me to call her. I did and we've had several phone conversations but haven't set up a date yet.  She is more interested in understanding and connecting with me as a busy parent and professional as that is her struggle too and she identifies.  I haven't tried to pin down a date yet, although I feel like I should.  Its just that conversation with her is so easy.  The trouble is its very amicable and nice and I really enjoy it. But it doesn't feel romantic.  Even though she says she is seeking a partner, and I believe her, and her profile is nice and attractive, I fear if I go to long without setting up some kind of romantic interaction I'll come to view her primarily as a friend. 

The rest I have not set up dates yet because I need to figure out my schedule as I don't want to date the weeks I have my kids.  My ex and I do a 50-50 week on week off sort of schedule. so I have just messaged them.

Nurse and I have only messaged in the app but have had on ongoing conversation for awhile.  That while not super lengthy is nice and could lead somewhere.

Disney girl and I have talked alot about...wait for it...Disney.  I think she really likes talking to me and messaging me but I'm not sure if there is more than that here.  I suppose when I try to set up a date we'll see.

Assistant Principal and I have been chatting about movies.  She takes a while to respond so just when I think the conversation is going to fade she ups the ante with more about herself and a question.  We'll see if I can keep this going or if it fades.

Runner and I chatted a bit and seemed to connect but she's been silent long enough that I think this one will probably be a fade.  Honestly, I probably didn't give her enough attention in the beginning because my mind was on other matches.  She seemed nice.  I hope I didn't hurt her feelings.

Distance Learning Teacher was super into me at first and then got real quiet.  I think this may be another fade at this point.

Traveler is sexy and interesting and we've been messaging back and forth for awhile.  But she is totally remote and can work from anywhere and moves regularly. She has told me about all the cities she's been to and the ones she wants to go next. Ultimately though, I want a long term relationship.  I recognize you cant rush that or place expectations but it feels like even if she and I hit it off she would be gone eventually and that's not my goal.  I'm going to keep chatting with her and maybe set up an actual date but on that date I intend to ask that question and accept and understand her honest answer.

Goth Girl is very hot but messages sporadically in volume and intensity and is all about heavy metal concerts.  I would very much like to hang out with her and see what she's like but I suspect that while she enjoys the attention from the messaging that she may not ever want to meet up as she seems to be avoiding the topic.

Homeschooler and I messaged and she seems really interested in meeting with me but he is a self-described free spirit.  I proposed meeting up a couple weeks out and she said she doesn't know her schedule that far out.  I told her I would get back to her as we got closer to set something up. I guess will see but I have some concerns about how that kind of loose calendaring (no judgment intended) will mesh with my work &amp; parenting schedules.

Kinkgirl also seems very interesting and was interested in me at first but has gone silent.  I suspect she may have found someone more attentive than I while I sorted through these matches and has moved on.

Reader and Physical Therapist seem to have gone the way of Kinkgirl.  I think I should have paused the apps sooner and limited my matches more.  Both seemed very eager to talk to me at first but have really dialed back their messaging.

If you made it through all that, I'd love some feedback/advice about my profile or the best way to respectfully and honestly handle these matches to hopefully find what I'm looking for and still treat these women with the respect they deserve.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/o3vobt/profile_review_and_update/

I have a great career and have done well for myself but its a dating wasteland for me here. Being that I‚Äôm relatively un attached, not married to this area and I have the means, I‚Äôm willing to look beyond my local area for matches. Airport to airport is good for me.   

  I realize that this isn‚Äôt everyone‚Äôs ideal situation, but it might be for some. Especially those I‚Äôm generally attracted to (single, child free, career driven etc). Does any one have any advice on how to out my self ‚Äúout there‚Äù so I can be found at a distance? Most folks seem to use GPS related apps, so I don‚Äôt think that would work. 

I hope this post doesnt wake up the angry Sunday post stompers, as I‚Äôm not talking about lying about my location nor am I trying to scam people. I‚Äôm just someone taht feels if I met a really awesome woman in say DC, I could easily make it work for at least awhile untill bigger decisions need to be made.

68,o4fdu1,1624224022,I caught her... But still love her," 

So‚Ä¶ I (50 M) and her (51 F) have a complicated past to say the least. Short version we started dating 5 years ago‚Ä¶ After about a year (4 years ago today, actually), I caught her in bed with her ex-boyfriend. I take a lot of the blame for that. I wasn‚Äôt 100% emotionally and physically available to her and although I was taking steps to rectify that behind the scenes, she, quite reasonably got tired of waiting. Literally weeks later she got married to a different man she had just met. They moved out of state and were married for several years. They moved back here and he unceremoniously divorced her after spending all of her savings and running up her credit cards. I also partially blame myself for THAT. Had I been a better partner she wouldn‚Äôt have been driven into a conman‚Äôs arms. We started talking again and it seemed like she was a completely different person for the better. I obviously loved her and before long we were exclusive within a few months. We continued like this for about 8 months at which point we got into an argument over a situation that I probably overreacted to‚Ä¶ And we separated again for about 8 months. At which point, we started talking as friends again. That was around the beginning of the year. Both of us had had a pretty awful time dating, and we were both taking a break from it because it had been such a shit show‚Ä¶ So, we weren‚Äôt ""dating"" each other, but we weren‚Äôt seeing other people either (or so I thought). But because of our history, I was reluctant to do anything more than friends, despite the fact my feelings for her were as strong as ever. It also felt like she had zero interest in anything more than friendship. So, I protected myself. Guarded. Didn‚Äôt get any expectations up. And then suddenly, one day in April (a year from the LAST time we broke up) she texts me, almost angrily, asking why don‚Äôt I love her? She‚Äôd gone on some dates and :nobody compares to me"". The chain of texts were very confusing, and she finally says that ‚Äúshe‚Äôs relieved she told me‚Äù. I‚Äôm like ‚Äúwhat did you tell me, cause I‚Äôm totally confused here?‚Äù She told me that she told me ‚Äúshe loves me and wants to be with me‚Äù. I explain to her that I‚Äôm surprised by this sudden revelation. And start listing off all the little shit I do for her that I sure as hell wouldn‚Äôt do for somebody I didn‚Äôt fucking love. My time is limited and giving it to somebody else is one of the most significant ways I can show my feelings for someone, (But, Im also extremely affectionate in traditional ways as well- flirting, physical affection, compliments, etc). And I add, I‚Äôve always loved her, even when I was pissed off at her. I tell her I want this time to be different. No secrets. No stupid impulsive decisions. Pure transparency‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs my condition of entry. She agrees. She could have looked at my phone at any time and I would have given it to her (all she‚Äôd see is my stupid comments on Bitcoin and Gamestop). I never asked her to look at hers. I‚Äôm not sure what she would have said‚Ä¶ I was always afraid shed get offended by it. Regardless, we make it official and we continue on right where we left off‚Ä¶

WE start making plans‚Ä¶ Things WE BOTH love‚Ä¶ Concerts. Trips. (Some of the absolute best times of my life have been at both with her). I tell her I‚Äôm buying tickets for a concert in late 2022 and will she go? ‚ÄúOf course!‚Äù And I‚Äôm making longer term plans. I bought a diamond ring. Nothing huge. Just something to show her I‚Äôm serious and not fucking around. But I hadn‚Äôt given it to her yet when I got wind of some red flags. I found out that when we started talking again (but before she decided to make us official) she was seeing someone else. And he was cheating with her. I then found out that the boyfriend I caught her in bed with way back when, had gotten married the same week (maybe the same day?) that she decided ‚ÄúI was the one‚Äù. More red flags. I confronted her and asked if the married guy she had been seeing was the same ex bf from before, and was it all really over? She swore up and down it wasn‚Äôt the same person and that it was over and that I shouldn‚Äôt be worried about the past. And turns it around with why am I throwing him in her face? She has ‚Äúnothing to hide‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm her first choice‚Ä¶ She loves ME!‚Äù

I believe her. I WANT to believe her. I‚Äôm nuts about this woman, and anyways. It makes no sense for her to cheat on me with someone WHO JUST CHOSE TO MARRY A DIFFERENT WOMAN!!! One of the things I love about her is she‚Äôs smart as hell. She‚Äôs got to see this guy, if it was him, that he just wants a piece of ass on the side and has no respect for her‚Ä¶ There‚Äôs no future there, which I‚Äôm sure she wants with SOMEBODY. I‚Äôm doing everything to show her I‚Äôm in for the long haul. I go to family dinner with her adult children, their SOs and her ex-husband (even though it makes me nervous as hell, I do it, because they‚Äôre my future). I hang out with her friends because they‚Äôre my future. I beg her to take me to the places she goes with her friends, but she seems reluctant‚Ä¶ Like I‚Äôm a secret? And the more I do to show I‚Äôm in, the more I feel her getting distant.

And then, Friday I found out the ex-bf went to her house the day before‚Ä¶ and they cheated. Him on his new wife. Her on me.

So. I confronted her. I started by asking if she loved me. ‚ÄúYes!!!‚Äù I asked again if she was sure. ‚ÄúYes!!!‚Äù If she had any protests about our relationship, I wanted her to have a chance to tell me. Then I asked her if anything had happened the last few days that she regretted? ‚ÄúNope?‚Äù I then told her ‚ÄúI knew everything‚Äù and if she had done anything she regretted now? I wanted to give her a chance to explain if something happened that went too far, to say so, apologize, and we could work through it, whatever result that means. Nothing can be fixed if one person doesn‚Äôt acknowledge a problem. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about!‚Äù Then I started telling her what I knew.

At first, she denied anything happened. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just crazy‚Äù. Then She tried to minimize- It was just lunch- ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt tell me you had lunch with him.‚Äù ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know I was‚Ä¶ he just showed up unannounced.‚Äù I knew it was much more than lunch and gave her some details‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúOk, we hugged‚Äù. I told her it was more than hugs. She almost accused me of stalking her, that I must have been outside her window (which she knows isn‚Äôt true‚Ä¶ She has two dogs who go insane the second I get out of the car, let alone near the house‚Ä¶ Plus I don‚Äôt have that kind of time‚Ä¶) It took a while but I think she finally realized I had enough details that WE BOTH KNOW she cheated, regardless of her protests. I know the truth. And she knows I know. At which point she starts telling me that she‚Äôs been having second thoughts about us. Second thoughts she had every opportunity to talk to me about prior to getting caught.

So‚Ä¶ I gathered up the stuff I had at her house (again, another sign I was serious, I was keeping the things I needed to stay with her more, and have about a half-dozen amazon orders of crap for her house, still on the way) and left. Before I left, she said something very weird‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt hate you‚Äù. Which seemed like an odd declaration. First of all, I‚Äôm the one who has the right to feel emotions like hatred in this situation‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm wondering if there wasn‚Äôt some strange Freudian admission wrapped in that statement? Or, maybe she was just reeling from having so much dropped on her so fast‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôll leave it for the armchair Psychiatrists of Reddit to unravel that statement. She also said she ""never meant to hurt me"", but I hear that as ""I didn't care if I hurt you, until I did."" Which is a real lack of empathy. It seems to me if you ""never want to hurt someone"" you tell the married ex-boyfrend (who, btw, fucks up your life every time he comes around), to piss off before you do.

My dilemma. I‚Äôm mad. I‚Äôm hurt (again). But I do love her. I don‚Äôt know right now if there‚Äôs any future with her‚Ä¶ Again, this is all raw right now. She has the worst self esteem of anyone I‚Äôve ever met. And the last few years since the disaster-marriage have not been good to her, emotionally or physically. But I‚Äôve tried to show her it‚Äôs the other stuff I‚Äôm attracted to about her and that I would help her in any way I can. But its almost like her self- esteem is so low that if somebody REALLY wants to commit to her (as opposed to just use her for respect-less, sex on the side) she thinks there‚Äôs something wrong with THEM for picking her in the first place. Like the old Groucho Marx line-"" I would never join a club that would have ME as a member..."" Yesterday she promised she was going to ‚Äúwork on herself‚Äù for a bit. But I‚Äôve heard that every time we split, and from what I can see she doesn‚Äôt. Or doesn‚Äôt have the tools or resources to really do it. I know if I try to help her, she‚Äôll just retreat (she already has, not sure I‚Äôll hear from her again, because she knows I love her and it scares her to death).

And I'm sure people will read this and think I must be some sort of loser to put up with all this... But... I'm really not. I'm a tall, decent looking guy, in good shape... And to say I've got my shit together is an understatement. The last few months I've had more women than usual approaching me. Its just a coincidence really, I started teaching and other teachers, and even my student's mom's have blatantly flirted and even asked ME out. A lot of them were very attractive and if I was single would have been very interesting... But I was committed... And ignored the attention, or politely but firmly declined when that didn't work... I've missed a lot of opportunities... And I feel used... Hurt... And like I've wasted a lot my time... But I still love HER....

I've been divorced for two years and separated for 4. I have my daughter half of the time and I just turned 50 this year. I've got a cute small place and my own hobbies. And yes sometimes late at night I lie awake feeling a bit scared that I'll be alone forever now but other than that time (and it's always late at night right?) I'm pretty happy being able to do my own thing when I want.

Like on a Saturday when my daughter isn't around I can wake up and watch 3 games of English Premier League if I want. And eat whatever I want for breakfast. And I can watch films late at night or hop on Warzone until 3. And when the pandemic ends I can go out dancing again or to live music or shows. And get back to playing sports and going to watch sports. And travel of course too! 

My point is that while I miss some things (kissing and whatnot) and sometimes I feel a bit sad/worried that I'll be alone forever most of the time I love the freedom I have and can't imagine giving it up.

81,o4ttya,1624278082,Can a 'love spark' grow with time for avoidant attached persons? How did you as an avoidant attachment style finally decide to take the plunge and start a life with someone you love?,"I mostly want to hear from avoidant personality types or people who have dated such types. I'm sorry if you don't believe in 'types' and I know I am using stereotypes but for the sake of expediency..

Me (36F) and my partner (44M) have been dating since Sep 2020, exclusive since Dec 2020. When we are together things move mostly harmoniously, and we do all manner of things together.

I had been deluding myself that my partner was mostly secure. We had a deep conversation last night, and he finally revealed to me what the problem was. He says that he finds it very difficult to make long term commitments - would think very far ahead and try and control how things can turn out. He wants to be absolutely sure that things would work out before taking any next steps. He tends to return to his default state of being single as he is mostly happy with life this way and is afraid to change things. He gets scared when it feels like it is time to make a major decision and when we were getting more close and connecting more deeply, he panicked and pulled away.

More importantly - he told me that he did not yet feel a 'love spark'. He admitted his emotions were mostly grey.. and he's never fallen head over heels for anyone before. He had a similar period with his ex wife where he questioned whether what they had was enough - but once he got through that he claims he never looked back. He says he didn't know if it would take time with me or if it would ever come. He thinks that is why he \*sometimes\* feels less than 100% sure with me. He's tried looking within for answers - could it be that I am so different from all of his previous relationships (he's really never had many long term serious relationships in life) - but those that he had, were with  'girly girls', whereas he says i'm more of a tomboy. But he was upset at himself that this could be the case because he feels shallow. He also questioned whether this was on the flip side also the reason why he felt so comfortable and natural whenever he is with me. Like he can really be himself. He also said that it was rare for him to connect so deeply with someone and that he knows that I am special. By telling me all of his most honest thoughts, he's afraid he is destroying something good and that he may not be making the right decision now by doing so. I was the one who started the conversation yesterday that led to this revelation. 

Furthermore, he does not know if a love spark can grow with time - in his past he claims it always took time. And so he can't give me any promises and told me he knows it isn't fair to me to drag things out while he is figuring things out for himself. He wants to get married and have kids, but on the other hand, is afraid of making a wrong decision. He wondered whether this could be influenced also by his previous marriage.

TLDR:

I want to hear  from others if there have been any success stories out there where a 'love spark' took say up to a year to develop (we are now at 6+ months official and exclusive), and how, for those with avoidant attachment styles, did you finally decide to take the plunge with someone and start a life together?

I was married for twenty years and I don‚Äôt want to date just to date. I want to settle down with someone. 

I have an acquaintance who has been dating for the past thirty years. 
None of her relationships lasted more than a year. I don‚Äôt know how she mentally does it. 

When I read posts here and there some people state that they just date and want to do so in the future. 

I often wonder how is it possible to be dating for twenty years and not meet someone you want to spend the rest of your life with. 

Shortly after my divorce I was with someone. He had to leave the country so we broke up. I was ready to spend my life with him. 
It‚Äôs been over a year and I can‚Äôt even think of meeting men let alone date.

The other conversations I've been having on the dating apps don't seem to be flowing as easily, and I haven't seen the same level of interest yet.

I'm a 42-year-old man.

I'm been separated for nearly a year and I am getting divorced.

I think girls in their 20's are hot and I want to sleep with a whole load of them.

I don't want a long-term relationship, just a bunch of one-night stands and some FWB action.

So, am I creep because I just want to entice girls who are maybe 15 or 20 years younger than me back to my lair for sex?

If it makes any difference, I'm quite keen that the whole thing would be a positive, fun, and enjoyable experience for the young ladies in question.

And to reassure anyone who might be concerned for their welfare, I've been very unsuccessful so far and clearly have zero talent as a casanova.

88,o52nfc,1624302047,A bit of advice needed,"Situation:

(sorry in advance is this is rambling all over)

At start of pandemic I (48/m) met someone (41/f) online--we persevered through the not being able to see each other part of if, and as things loosened up we started getting together. And everything was awesome. No arguments, spending the night, seeing each others kids, etc.

As we progressed she had explained that she had recently gotten out of a 10 year relationship, most of that time they had lived together. Then she moved out, they dated a bit more, then that ended. Then, within a month or so, she met me-and because of the pandemic it was phone calls, video chats, etc. We couldn't really get together--so it didn't seem overly serious. At the same time, because of the pandemic there wasn't a lot of time for her to get out, see her friends, and all that kind of stuff.

We eventually, as restrictions loosened, did some of that as a couple--but it was also the first time she was getting to see many of her friends in months. We also spent a weekend away. Then, her ex saw pics of that weekend and contacted her and we had a slight tremor in our relationship, but quickly got back to where we were.

He texted and called her from time to time, and then finally, in late Feb this year, told him that she was 100% done with him, that she couldn't give him what he wanted.

However, instead of that launching us higher, it caused her to realize that with her previous relationship finally, 100% over, she was never really alone at all to deal with that. She essentially went from that relationship to already being serious with me. And she pulled back, saying she wasn't really sure what she wanted.

On some levels, I completely get that. Not that I want her to be single and ""out there"" but I get her realizing she never had time to herself. That said, we were happy. And to me, that's the point. But she ""needs space"".

This happened 3 months ago--in that time we have seen each other a few times. A lunch. Met up for a walk. But nothing physical beyond a hug, although there are clearly still feelings on both sides. We still text a lot, although obviously not as much. I have never pressured her to change her mind. And I have told her that I can't wait for her, but she knows, at least right now, that I still want to be with her.

I guess I just want to hear from others, especially women--does that make sense to you? That, even if you are crazy about someone, that you might need some time to decompress before starting anew, especially something serious?

And re: neediness, if I start texting too much, or pushing for a ""friendly lunch"", is my neediness just going to push her away? Should I let her lead on those things?",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/o52nfc/a_bit_of_advice_needed/
89,o52plv,1624302198,Friends who aren't really and letting women down easy,"As some of you know I just started dating after lurking here for a good while and working on myself.  As part of that I have let my friends know I'm open to dating and sought some advice.  And now I'm a bit disheartened.

I have always appreciated having female friends.  Women have given my perspective and insight I might not have gotten from male friends.  Naturally, through conversation, they helped me improve my communication and listening skills because they interact with me differently than my male friends.

I was already a bit sad when many of our friends became her friends after the separation and divorce.  

But now, some of the ladies I thought were my friends have expressed an interest in dating me.  The first one I thought I could just nicely say no and we could still be friends.  Didn't turn out that way.

Now another friend has texted me the, ""I love you"" text and a third has told me I should have been considering her all this time.

I don't want to hurt either of them or lose their friendship, but I'm not interested in them.  I just want to enjoy their friendship.  I love their personalities but I'm not attracted to them that way.

And it kind of sucks that maybe they only wanted to be my friends because of their interest in me?  And at least one of them didn't express any interest a few years back when I was very out of shape and less healthy.  That makes me wonder too, although in fairness to her I was still married then, so maybe that's just me overthinking it.

Ladies, how would you want to be let down gently and in a way that could maybe salvage the friendship?",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/o52plv/friends_who_arent_really_and_letting_women_down/

91,o559bs,1624308799,OLD compared to team sports,"I‚Äôm in a recreational kickball league here in Chicago. Participants range from 25-50 years old. We play every Sunday mid morning. There are 6 teams, and every week, every team must have at least 8 players present to play.

So this many people - many of whom have other obligations ranging from work and family to travel and other hobbies - are able to commit to showing up regularly.

Compare this to online dating, where it seems like everyone flakes at the drop of a hat. In the last two weeks, I had one online or offline meetup happened as planned. The rest:

-2 men didn‚Äôt show up for scheduled video dates
-2 men didn‚Äôt show up for scheduled phone calls
-1 man canceled a scheduled in person date

Is it me, or when you put something in your calendar (like a kickball game or a date), do you make it happen excepting an emergency?
