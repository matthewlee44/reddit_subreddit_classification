After a rough break up, I decided to get back out into the dating world going through the chaos that is online dating which im not unfamiliar with. My problem has been with a lack of reciprocation in communication after I have a match that successfully leads to a first date. 

The dates are pretty standard: meeting for a meal and drinks or sometimes just drinks. We talk about our hobbies and interests, schooling that we have or havent done. and overall have nice and intelligent conversations.  At the end we leave and I usually have a good feeling that maybe a few more dates will come out of it.

When I text  back the next day for two after, i dont get the usual ghosting that you read about on here. Its selective or unresponsive unless I prompt woth solid question behind 'hows your day?'. No inquiry as to me yet the person meetings I've had have been nothing but talking for what seemed like hours. 

Is this just how everyone responds now a daya because of covid? Maybe it's because people just got super bad at communication and forget that other people have feelings too? Whatever the reason is, it's unfortunate when you both say you felt a connection and nothing ever comes of it. Its disheartening when you're trying to connect and get disconnected.

I decided to give the dating scene a shot for the first time though and within these past two months I've been seeing another person and been enjoying it a lot. 

That being said, I've also been kind of on edge about commitment. Life, schedules, and maintaining a life outside of a relationship are all still things I'm trying to keep stable, and soon I'm heading off to college. The future is always subject to change and I've kept that in mind with how it corelates to my relationship.

I'm not great at communicating my emotions, but the first date went smoothly. We were somewhat close friends before this before there was a possible romantic interest, so chemistry was already there and we both had a ton of fun. I communicated that I would like to hold hands next time next time, and over the course of two months we have hung out and everything has gone great.

It took me a while to realize it but I get a massive spike of serotonin everytime I'm around my partner. Although I've communicated that in passing, we didn't really talk about it until recently and the serotonin produced from knowing said spike in happiness is the same for both parties makes me feel like I could actually work with this relationship.

 ""Like yeah, I miss you too when you leave my house"" gave a MASSIVE ""aaaa that makes me so happy I feel hope.""  

I'm aware the temporary euphoric high is well, temporary, but that recent talk was the first time I'd thought, yeah I really want to keep this relationship for a long time, instead of being immediately hit with cynicism whenever I think about the long term. 

I've always just been way too busy for a relationship and seen bridges burn from relationships. I'm still conscious of terrible outcomes, but it's just nice to feel hope and reassurance from an event. It's just nice to live in the moment I guess and hold onto what is in the present as it has a positive outlook for the future. 

I don't really have advice based off my experiences because I only have crushes on people after I've become friends with them, which is known as being demisexual.

I guess the main one is if you like them, just tell them outright. People can be really dense, because they don't want to assume wrong so sending signals doesn't always work. Try to do it in person. If you find you physically can't and you text that person often, text CAN be a last resort.

It typically involves exploiting insecurity and using subtle tactics to degrade.

However, often times this type of behavior is conflated with being successful with women in general. There’s a perception that success with women is in inherently tied to deception and narcissism.

If a man understands that he should text with restraint, mirror behavior, be playful and tease while still being respectful, utilize subtle touch to escalate emotion, dating as much as many people as possible until a relationship is established, this doesn’t make him manipulative because he understands the true nature of attraction.

Some guys are labeled ‘jerks’, when in reality they simply aren’t Nice Guys, and neglect all other important components of their lives for a woman. They have integrity and are upfront with their feelings, but are still seen as jerks because they have boundaries and aren’t pushovers. Yes, a lot of assholes are successful with women, because their behavior is often confused with with assertiveness and masculinity. However, a centered, respectful man can still be assertive and strong.

There’s a contradictory expectation of men nowadays. Women revile and reject the Nice Guy, but it is also expected to be our default setting as well. When a man deviates from what society tells us is the proper way to win a woman over, i.e. through unwavering devotion despite any behavior she may throw at him, he is traditionally labeled as a jerk.

Remember, a good majority of behavior that is attractive to women runs counter to what society has conditioned men to believe through Hollywood and other forms of media. If you have authentic respect for someone and who they are, and don’t engage in behavior for the sole purpose of getting a specific reaction, you aren’t being a jerk. Especially if you have acted like a Nice Guy all your life, not immediately responding to a text or disagreeing upfront might feel uncomfortable, but it is how attraction really works in real life.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,935086,public,self,Men’s advice.

Out of the three attachment styles, I'm definitely the ""avoidant"" type and sometimes I wonder if I'm playing too hard to get. For some reason, I am very aware of coming off as too needy or clingy and I know a lot of girls feel this way as well. It's seeing our guy friends ignoring a text from a girl because she's ""too clingy"" or seeing those scenes in movies where the guy tries to leave right after having sex in fear that the girl will get too attached, it's kind of ingrained in us to be cautious of coming off as being that ""clingy"" girl. There's also an inherent need to be pursued in order to feel safe and trust in the dating situation we are in. I think it's a bit silly when a guy expects a girl to pursue him an equal amount from the beginning as the girl has more risk on her side in a physical safety way as well as potentially being used for sex (which I feel is a biological, subconscious reflex)...so I think that's a big reason why a lot of girls me included) don't feel comfortable chasing a guy, even if she is attracted. But I always find myself stuck between wondering if I should show my interest in a guy/texting him/asking him out etc...OR avoiding as to not scare him away and seem too clingy. And I know everyone is going to reply with ""just be balanced about it"", but it's not so easy, especially because every guy is different and has his own threshold to how much he will pursue etc...I also feel like there's a whole community of guys now who are totally against pursuing in the traditional way and want girls to chase them like they're rappers or basketball players or something....But I guess what I'm really looking for, is real advice on when ""playing hard to get"" as a woman goes too far, and maybe if there's any women out there who err on the side of avoidant attachment, how do you break through that fear of coming off as clingy and pathetic?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,935121,public,self,How to balance playing hard to get and showing real interest?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ox6mmi/how_to_balance_playing_hard_to_get_and_showing/,all_ads,6,,,

Last week I got to know a girl. We talked about 2 years ago for like 3seconds as we had friends in common, that knew each other and they said hi. So I already knew her name. As I was about to leave a party, I saw her walking by and said 'hey, aren't you ####?' she said 'sure, I know you, but didn't expect you to remember my name'. Anyways she was with 2 gf's of her but we went on to talk. Noticed we had like a lot in common. And well, we talked the whole night for about 5 hours until sunrise mostly about music and some other minor things. We just zoned out from her friends while we had our conversation and also noticed each other has adhd, which we found quite funny, the talk was a mess but I loved it. We sat under a tree for that time and when we switched music I sometimes looked her in the eyes and was like 'please, please don't catch feelings'. Well, I went home with that attitude, woke up, found her music in my spotify lib and now I need advice :)

I am quite lost, the only dating experience I had was with an super-introverted-introvert that I TRIED to date for a year but we didn't really talk about more than the weather. For a fucking year. So, well, I am starting at 0 and don't know how to proceed, I got her insta though and also texted her a little, but I am quite lost and can't think of anything to text or tell her now.

Now I’m 20, at university, and women seem really different. I used tinder, only got 10 matches or so and saw bios like ‘if you’re a midget go away’ or ‘entertain me or I won’t reply’ on overweight and unattractive girls’ profiles. Deleted the same day.

A few months ago I drunkenly tried to pick up this girl I wasn’t really attracted to normally at a party and got rejected. She obviously wasn’t supposed to like me just because I didn’t find her attractive, but she took it to the extreme and made fun of me with her friends, their group laughed at me every time I walked past them in public. And this is a girl I would’ve rejected normally. 

Other times, I saw my friends get rejected by girls who were clearly in their league. And several times I got rejected by girls who were clearly in my league (or even below) I did date 1 girl who was nice.

My point is, all of a sudden it seems women my age are dreaming too big, trying for guys out of their league, failing, and being used for sex. And they know what they’re getting into as well.

And a lot of guys have a defeatist mindset and are borderline incels.

When you're really attractive, someone shy and doubtful about what they can bring to the table of a relationship will usually prevent them from actually trying to pursue the attractive person. But someone who is without reflection and full of egotism will adamantly pursue the attractive person. And the attractive person will notice that while most suitors are shy, there is this strong minority of people actively pursing them.

I said yes and at first I thought this was just going to be an “us” thing. 

I later found out that a bunch of his friends are also coming with their wives/gf’s which I figured I’d be okay with. I didn’t really have a choice, they had credit for this game from 2019 and they couldn’t go last year because of Covid. 

Then he told me I’d also be meeting his closest female friend who he also hasn’t seen in 10 years. I wasn’t expecting this at all. Him and her are very close apparently, and they even dated for a bit back in the day. 

Granted she is engaged, I still feel like this is something he should have asked me if I would be ok with. She’s not a part of his friends group that’s coming along. 

I think I’m more annoyed because I thought this was just going to be an “us” thing and with a bunch of his friends already being there, I was already going to feel out of place. I definitely didn’t expect to become a third wheel in a reunion either. They haven’t seen each other in 10 years so I don’t know how much time they’ll be spending catching up. 

If I were to invite an old fling to an event or a game or anything, I’d atleast ask him out of respect if that’s something he’d be okay with.

Just for the pleasure of sharing.

About 3 years ago, I went on a date with a guy (we both were about 28 years old, so, this is important).

We decided to make it a little bit on the spontaneous side, because we were both working as waiting staff (on different places, we started being in touch by instagram) and out shifts were complicated. He had to run some errands on his only day off, so we decided to meet afterwards, I chose a cafe near my place (because I was going to be called last minute) and also with parking spots for him (so he wouldn't lose a lot of time parking after his errands).

I was at home, he called. We meet for breakfast. I was 100 meters away when I got a text: it was him, telling me he was already there waiting for me. I kept walking, saw the cafe from far, SUPER FULL. I text him back, saying this and asking him where I should find him.

""Oh, I'm wearing a navy blue t-shirt, jeans, and my sunglasses on my head, I'm around the bar, with my mom""

I froze. I literally stopped walking when I was at 10m from the door. Looked at the phone in disbelief. I mean... Was it some kind of joke? Because... It HAS to be a joke, right? I'm all in for dark sense of humour, but I just stayed still on the street, looking at my phone wondering what to answer.

He came outside alone, said hi, took me inside around the bar.

YEP, PEOPLE, THE MOM WAS ACTUALLY THERE.

I admit I was between insulted and fascinated. The lady started talking to me about how she was teasing his son about ""what if she doesn't show up? what if she doesn't look like her pictures?"". I had an impulse to just leave angrily but... I mean. I had to stay, I decided on the spot I wasn't going to date him, but my novel reader ass NEEDED to know what would happen on such scenario. So I JUST WENT WITH IT.

She told me I was attractive and offered me a coffee (I have no evidence, but I strongly suspect the lady and not the son invited me said coffee) and we took a table.

The man was barely talking, so I mostly talked with her. Then she standed up, and decided to go to a shop on the side to ""find him some clothes for his job uniform"", I thought it was a weird way of finally ""leave us alone""... the guy wasn't very communicative, by the way, but I was WRONG. She came back 10 minutes later, telling both of us that we HAVE to go buy him some shoes.

So we went.

They were between two kinds of shoes, so I was asked for my opinion about which one would match the uniform better. I gave my view of the matter and the guy went away to pay for the shoes. 

I was left alone with mom... who just took her phone and started making me a whole review of the family pictures... about how nice and attractive is his sister (?) and how good she looks on this fitted orange dress.

They finally decided to leave, because mom needed to do some stuff, and the guy decided to leave with her instead of offering me some kind of explanation and maybe take a bus like an adult.

Randomly the woman asked me: ""excuse me dear, do you have driving license?"" I was confused ""uh, yes"" she follows... ""Oh, great, and do you have a car?"" ok, this is weird... ""uh, yes, a very old one"" she laughs... ""you're approved"" WHAT THE ACTUAL F\*\*\*??!

The guy tried to call me to meet later, I said no, of course and I told him why.

Also called me drunk after my shift (keep in mind, we are talking about 4am) drunk and crying to tell me about depression, his problems with drugs, and about how he just broke the nose of his ex-best-friend who came to his place with his ex girlfriend who cheated on him with said friend.

Yep.

I have bad social anxiety and I thought that maybe I should speak with others even if it's hard. Then, on the first day of my ""challange"" comes this girls, who is beautiful (at least for my taste). 

I go up to her, I start talking about horses (we were at thoroughbred racetrack). As I was battling with my nervousness, I forgot to say ""hi"" in the begining (first mistake). Then we spoke a few sentences in a question-answer manner (additionalli she was watching her horse, as it was in the competition) but she always looked at me, smiled and gave a proper answer. We started to walk over to the track itself, and I suddenly felt like ""Jesus, I'm a creep"" so I just vanished into the crowd. (Idiot, Sarius, Idiot)

The next time, she recognized me, and said something to her girlfriend with a smile. I couldn't keep her eye contact as my anxiety kicked in with full force. That day, we were always in each other vicinity for some reason, but I was so nervous, I barely could function properly, so speaking with her wasn't an option. (I was close to a panick attack even about the thought plus she was always with other girls.) 😅

I found her on IG, started to follow her. (In a large follower group, so I didn't stand out). Her horse won I wrote to her, and I got a fast but really polite answer. However, I didn't give too much room for anythin else (one of the countless mistakes)

One of her friend said to another girl when they saw me that ""He is the one who.... /didn't hear the rest/"" (3 weeks after the initial convo)

I started to think about her waaaay to much, so I unfollowed her, but it actually backfired (🙄) I think much more about her. 

Now:
-Following her again might be ""suspicious""
-I would like to grow some balls and ask her on a date or at least get the converstion going. This is the first time I ever try something like this, so I have zero ideas.
-I know I made so many mistakes.
-How about betting on her horse and if she wins I could write to her like : ""It looks like she won you a drink! When do you want to redeem it?"" But I don't really know if it can work from this position, after million mistakes, taking 3 whole weeks, and being a noob. 😅 
-I think I could manage my anxiety if things somehow get going, in a more private situation (date for example), not beside/with all of her friends. 
-I certainly got her and her friends' attention but I have no idea if it's in a good or bad manner.

We both suffer from severe mental health issues and cycle regularly through ptsd and abandonment issues.
Very recently an old friend came back into my ex's life. I knew this man for years as well.  When we first started dating I was informed quickly he cut her off from communication shortly after we started dating.
For two years she mourned the loss of her good friend and attributed it to the fact he had initial romantic intentions with her she did not share.

A few weeks ago he popped back up and she jumped right back into the friendship like it didn't skip a beat. I was super happy for her as I knew him well and saw him as a good addition to her life.

Shortly after things got weird. He would show up to her work and they would hang out.  She would invite him over on days she said she was going to bed early and was to tiered to hang with me.
Last week was a birthday party and I have severe anxiety issues so I stayed inside in a room alone. When I finally came out to make and appearance they were sitting on the same side of a bench alone ,away from people , sitting less then a foot facing each other like her and I do.
I shrugged this off.
Today she told me she was going over his house to do laundry , didn't invite me , just told me what was happening.
So so expressed I was very uncomfortable with her (in those exact words) with her washing her underwear at his house after he just popped up again and those other two weird things happened.
She pulled the car over , kicked me out on the street and told me we were through and to never talk to her again.
 
I asked the friend what was up and tried to figure out if I was just being insecure.  He informed me he has no intentions with her and I believe him. He also told me he had no idea she was planning on doing laundry there (she has her own washer and dryer)
He went on and on about how he'd never have feelings towards her while she was with me and I believe him.

She also informed me because of this incident I was a waste of two years and she won't be allowing me to see my step son any longer.

A couple months ago I [f32] started hanging out with this guy [25] and we both started to catch feelings. Then he got scared and ghosted me for like two weeks. He hit me up again and we talked it through and he told me that he did catch feelings but he just didn’t wanna date right now. I was totally fine with that at that point so we agreed on being friends with benefits.
Since then we’ve been hanging out a lot, almost every weekend (and not just watching Netflix but actually doing things and even going on dinner dates). I’ve met so many of his friends, I met his family over FaceTime, he acts around me as if he was my boyfriend (cuddling, kissing and all that), even when all his friends are there. Everyone thinks we’re dating and we have to correct them all time. He posted me on his Snapchat story recently and we took these really cheesy couple pictures (his idea). 
Just a few days ago I had a really traumatic experience and without me asking he rushed to my side, stayed the whole day and the night, really cared about me, held me, said all these perfect things and handled the situation just perfectly. 
That same night we had a very deep conversation where we also talked about our past relationships and it turned out he got really hurt after his last breakup (that was like 2 years ago). So basically I think he’s just really scared to get hurt again. 
I told him I understand because I used to be the same way after my last heartbreak but then I also explained that I didn’t wanna stand in my own way and in the way of something that might be really good for me so I opened up to people again. But I think he might not be there yet. 
At the same time he describes me as the perfect girl to date (even on that night), compliments me, tells me how much he cares. I think he does have feelings for me but he’s too scared to act on them.
We’re both hanging out with other people too but we’re open about this. 
I don’t know what I wanna do. Because I can feel myself catching feelings again. I was able to handle all the forehead kisses and the cuddling and the pictures and meeting all his friends and family but that day when he was there for me and cared for me so much and was just perfect all around, I think that was the day where I started really liking him again. We had that one moment when we looked at each other for a little too long and I was like “oh fuck”. 
And now I’m sitting here and I don’t know what to do. I should probably cut all ties because he literally told me he didn’t want anything serious but another part of me wants to talk to him again. Not to convince him or to talk him into something but just to let him know how I feel. I think I’m just hoping that he might sit down one day with that knowledge and think about actually letting me in, like fully. 
I just don’t know what to do anymore. Part of me just wants to go no contact or at least keep my distance and stop hanging out all the time because I know if he won’t respond positively he’s gonna run the other way and I will lose him but if I don’t tell him and I just keep going I might get even more hurt. I don’t know if I should take the risk. Or maybe wait a little longer and then tell him? What would you guys do?

He lived 3 hours away from me so we texted and video called everyday for 10 months but only went on a handful of dates. I had told him I was moving to his city but due to a family member becoming ill I decided not to move and he ended things. We stayed in good terms.

After this he and I both ended up in relationships with other people. In March 2020 when our country went into lockdown we spoke everyday for a few weeks even though we were still in relationships with other people. We both told eachother that we still had feelings for one another but the next day he said he felt guilty for speaking to me and we should cut contact which we did.

A few months pass of zero contact and then I discovered he blocked me across social media in June 2020.

I broke up with my boyfriend in April 2021 and his girlfriend broke up with him in May 2021.

He readded me on social media in June 2021 and messaged me bassically straight up asking was i single and trying to rekindle things and I could see that it was less than 3 weeks since his ex girlfriend broke up with him judging by the date of tagged photos.

I just told him I wasn't interested in dating anyone right now but glad we can be friends. We happen to be applying for jobs in the same city and he has said ""who knows what could happen between us in the future?.. we might actually end up together this time""

I'm still dealing with my break up and amnt interested in dating yet, he has told me that he is still in love with his ex but is trying to move on. She bassically broke up with him because they couldn't see eachother much due to covid travel restrictions and told him she wants to get back with him in the future which he was sort of hoping would happen.

I speak to him almost everyday and he is very nice etc but my gut tells me that I am only a distraction for him and that even if we do end up living in the same city I should avoid dating him in case he is only using me as a rebound.

What do you think?

TLDR; Guy I briefly dated in the past but I am still attracted to is newly single (3 months) and showing an interest in me. He is still hung up on his ex (dated for 2 years).

Should I cut contact with him now or stay friendly in case something happensin the future?

The women I dated back then were smart, pretty, and fun. I wasn’t doing OLD back then, and was mostly meeting women at social events hosted by mutual friends. Those opportunities have dried up now. I‘m the only one of my friends who isn’t married, engaged, or cohabitating with a long-term partner, so now when I go to parties/BBQs there are no single people there to meet. It’s just a bunch of couples.

I’m trying online dating, and what I’m finding is that women who would be in my league if we met IRL won’t even give me the time of day in the OLD world. To get replies/matches in OLD I have to lower my standards pretty dramatically, to the point where I end up going on dates with women I’m not really even interested in. 

To be clear, I’m not the most handsome dude in the world. I’m a short dude with a big nose. That never used to be a real obstacle though. I‘m secure in who I am, and I make the most out of what I’ve got. I work out, dress well, and practice good hygiene/skincare. Most importantly though, I’m a good conversationalist who‘s fun to be around. 

I’m way more of a catch now than I was in my 20s so it feels like I should be doing better in my dating life, not worse. Mid-20s me smoked too much weed and lived with roommates.

It started when I met this girl at the office I work at, and I started to feel an attraction.  Well I’m almost 23 now and I’ve never dated so naturally I was nervous, but I made a good impression and she was interested.  We went on a date which was really awesome for me and boosted my confidence, and afterwards we talked about continuing.  Unfortunately life happened to both of us so it’s been hard to see each other.  She’s been really busy with life and I started to feel nervous she wasn’t interested in seeing me rather than it just being a time problem.  Eventually my anxieties build up and I have to ask her if she still wants to see me, so she tells me it’s really not a good time and that her life needs to calm down.  Of course I respect this and have done my best to not ask for her time right now, but it’s gotten hard for me.  I still see her at work so now I feel so anxious around her, despite not feeling it so much when we went on a date a month ago. I’m not sure what’s gotten into me, but it’s completely ruining my confidence with her and the thought of her has taken over a lot of my time.  I feel like I can’t control my anxious thinking about her, probably because I’ve never experienced this with a girl before and I’ve already become attached.

I got home, and a few hours later, she called me to ask me something.

She said she saw my picture (the screenshot of pics from my dating app, according to her) on that FB page, and the poster asked if someone was seeing me. Funny thing is that I have no idea how and WHY my picture was posted since I am not evening seeing or dating anyone. She was upset because she told me I did not tell her the truth.

I asked if she had taken a screenshot. After all, I wanted to see it for myself because I couldn't believe what she was saying; someone took a screenshot of me on the app and posted it online. She did not take the screenshot because the admin took it down due to the violation of privacy. She became even more upset because I was not trusting what she was saying and what she saw. 

I told her the truth and no reason for me to hide anything. Why would I? No matter how many times I said it, she did not believe me. The discussion got stuck in a loop and got so bad to the point where I wish I had someone I was dating so that I can just get it over with. But I would never do that because it would be a lie.

I've been in the online dating scene for some time but did not realize this is how low it got; girls feel so insure that they form this page or whatever the hell it is where they post a picture of (or whatever the information it is) a guy with zero consent to (quoting some of her words) ensure that the guy is not cheating and justifying that it is to ensure that girls don't get hurt because they need to protect themselves from guys. 

Super creepy and weird. I am just baffled by this.

At least, I got a story to tell for years to come.

We talked about other activities that I was into, and she mentioned wanting to do those activities as well. The next day that I saw her, she asked me to make plans to hang out at a cool place that I mentioned.  


With all this to say, we have attempted to play tennis other times as a group, but it has not happened again because her friend has been very busy.

It typically involves exploiting insecurity and using subtle tactics to degrade.

However, often times this type of behavior is conflated with being successful with women in general. There’s a perception that success with women is in inherently tied to deception and narcissism.

If a man understands that he should text with restraint, mirror behavior, be playful and tease while still being respectful, utilize subtle touch to escalate emotion, dating as much as many people as possible until a relationship is established, this doesn’t make him manipulative because he understands the true nature of attraction.

Some guys are labeled ‘jerks’, when in reality they simply aren’t Nice Guys, and neglect all other important components of their lives for a woman. They have integrity and are upfront with their feelings, but are still seen as jerks because they have boundaries and aren’t pushovers. Yes, a lot of assholes are successful with women, because their behavior is often confused with with assertiveness and masculinity. However, a centered, respectful man can still be assertive and strong.

There’s a contradictory expectation of men nowadays. Women revile and reject the Nice Guy, but it is also expected to be our default setting as well. When a man deviates from what society tells us is the proper way to win a woman over, i.e. through unwavering devotion despite any behavior she may throw at him, he is traditionally labeled as a jerk.

Remember, a good majority of behavior that is attractive to women runs counter to what society has conditioned men to believe through Hollywood and other forms of media. If you have authentic respect for someone and who they are, and don’t engage in behavior for the sole purpose of getting a specific reaction, you aren’t being a jerk. Especially if you have acted like a Nice Guy all your life, not immediately responding to a text or disagreeing upfront might feel uncomfortable, but it is how attraction really works in real life.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,935658,public,self,Men’s advice.

I have always been exposed to men in my childhood and tended to be surrounded by more men than women as I was very active, loved sports and video games and found conversations with both sexes quite boring and irrelevant. I would rather just read and listen to music. Usually boys would treat me really well and look after me, as I was their only girl in the group. They would also be into me, and I would be into them. I would get nervous if they touched my hand, for example, and giggle as a nervous reaction.

My first (38M, me being 19F) was married, I deeply regret what I did but I can’t change it. I fell in love with him, I was weak and clearly had a maladjusted moral compass. I know it sounds crazy but the fact that he had a family made me feel he was trustworthy - since I thought a woman had chosen to spend her life with him, he must be good, and also he must be responsible because he is a parent -. Absolutely nonsense of a logic. Later in the relationship I found out he had an email account from which he would have sexual conversations with other women and even meet up. Even though I knew this, I still slept with him. He felt like home. At times it felt like all I needed was his warmth and affection.

So I guess that, while I feel more attracted and a higher intellectual and emotional connection with a woman, I am bi. Right?

As a grew older, I learned not to trust men. Not only because of my first but also because I find it really hard to admire and respect men; quite opposite to women. There is a fight? Men. There is a rape? Men. There is a dead? Likely a man. Who are more selfish? Men. Who cheat more? Men. Also, the usual street harassment. It is rare that I don‘t get a man to tell me a ¨compliment¨ when I leave my house, and some of them look at you like if they were going to rape you, like you were just a piece of meat. On the other hand, while women tend to be deeper, I have experienced quite often that men stop talking to me on Tinder if I say I am not into casual sex, which I find not only reductionist but also completely disgusting. I have tried for a month now, nothing is clicking.

On the other hand, I dont find men particularly attractive. If I see boobs or a nice butt or a woman with a beautiful face, I get turned on instantly, I imagine how it would be like to kiss her or have her naked. I have never in thousand years had that thought about men. Even when I was younger, I was rarely into the main male character, always into the hot girl.

Yet I realise two facts about my upbringing:

1. Both my dad and mom always told me not to trust men. So it’s clearly partly nurture.
2. My relationship with both my dad and brother is absolutely shit - same with my mother to be honest, although less abusive
3. Women are sexualised in media, looking more attractive, as they are treated as objects and the ideal here is beauty. While in men is strength and power. Maybe that’s why I now find them more appealing? Yet in that case, why do other women not find them appealing?

There is something else. While sometimes I would see porn and miss being penetrated by a man, I am so scared of having sex with them. It just hurts. It really hurts until I get pleasure. And in the back of my mind, I am always scared that he may cheat or may just randomly dissapear, specially living in a big city like London; where everybody is double or triple dating and can find a replacement fit for purpose, for their physical desires, in a hours. I am just turned off when it comes to men.

I am just so confused. I don‘t know if what I feel is natural or a mental disorder (being into girls); natural or a social construct.

All I know is that life was easier when I was only into men. Even thought being into men is not easy. At least my cognitive dissonance and suffering from the realisation that society sucks was smaller.

I texted this girl later saying “hey I had a good time, let’s do it again” and she replied with an affirmative “I had a good time too :) “but has since gone radio silent. 

Obviously it’s fine to not go out on another date. It’s fine if you had a good time but you didn’t feel what you were looking for, and in some ways I can see why simply not replying to someone you barely know is the easier/better option. But it sucks to be on the receiving end! It makes me question my sanity a little bit like … was that actually a nice date? Was I putting my foot in my mouth the whole time and I didn’t realize, or is she just too polite to be honest? 

I hope in this case I’m not off my rocker and that this girl wasn’t secretly miserable while chatting for a few hours. But it would give me so much peace of mind if the other person would simply say “sorry I’m not feeling it” and be done. Implying that everything was nice and then never replying is just ….. inconsiderate.
