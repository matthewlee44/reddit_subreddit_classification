There is a guy at work that I am “friends” with. He is a supervisor that works in a different department than me. This morning he asked me to work in his department because they are short help. I said no because that would cause my department to be short help. I told him he needs to ask my supervisor if he needs me to work in his department. He said the other supervisor never asks for permission. When I saw the supervisor for my department I let her know what happened. She got upset and went off on him. Now he is blaming me saying he never thought I would do something like this to him, I ruined his working relationship with my supervisor and I also ruined his day. I told him I had no idea that my supervisor would react like that. So I apologized for that part. He told me he was only joking about pulling me from my dept. He would have figured out a way to get his job done. I told him it didn’t seem like he was joking to me considering he didn’t have any help. I explained to him that 2 other supervisors used to constantly pull me out of my dept causing it to be short help. I said I did nothing wrong and I did not stab him in the back. He said yes I did. Then later on I think he said sorry and something else but because of the face masks it was hard to hear.

Here is the post:

 [(18) Update on a post from a couple months ago and a question : datingoverforty (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/p59szn/update_on_a_post_from_a_couple_months_ago_and_a/) 

Anyway, here I am again reaching out to the wisdom of the 'datingover40' crowd on Reddit for some perspective.

We had our weekend away, which did NOT go as planned for a number of reasons (such as wildfires), and there was some awkwardness with the physical intimacy one of the times.  

We talked about it and realized that we'd jumped in REALLY fast  from ""hey, haven't seen you in 6 months"" to ""let's go on a weekend getaway"" after having one hour together alone and a passionate kissing session plus a few hours hanging out with our kids together (They know each other from when we met).

We decided to keep dating but no pressure.   The talk we had about it was wonderful b/c it was honest and grounded and kind and I felt closer to him after talking.  He admitted that he'd kind of given up on meeting someone so his mind has been on just doing life for himself, and then I popped back in, and that he's got a huge business endeavor coming up that is taking a lot of his attention (He owns his own biz, expanding in a big way).  He said he was really excited to continue dating and let things go where their natural course takes.

However, now it's been about a month and I'm feeling really, really confused.  I am almost always the one to reach out.  He's not a great communicator in terms of frequency, and yet when we are together we have a wonderful time, lots of good conversation, hand holding, snuggling, and kissing at the end of the night. No sex again yet (which is fine with me b/c it was too rushed. I'm kind of a slow mover).

We spent time together every day of last weekend, including a fun date night of dinner and a concert and lots of those great snuggles and kisses. 

But he rarely texts or reaches out to ask how I am doing (he does in person) and his response are super short and no substance. He will reach out to sometimes tell me about his day or vent about a stressor. I don't mind, but it feels one-sided.  This is really different than when we met last year when he was very engaged on text and initiated time together (granted it was COVID times and he wasn't that busy).

He invited me to a concert in October, and had invited me to go diving with him in Belize in Nov (I can't go), and we've talked a bit about the idea of a trip to Croatia next year.  WE both love travel.

I am confused b/c we have fun together but it seems like between visits there is nothing, and I am the one who initiates most of our activities together, aside from the concert invite.

The reason I'm posting is that I'm trying to manage my expectations b/c I have only dated 2 guys since I was 25, and both of them were long term relationships kind of out of the gate.  My last bf, for all of his challenges, texted or called daily the first year or so, we talked a TON.  Granted, he's a big talker in general, as am I.

Of course I know that if this doesn't work for me I can walk away, I guess I'm just wondering if I have distorted expectations or am over-thinking things.

Last night we had a brief text exchange and I said that I look forward to the next time I get to rest my head on his chest and feel his warmth (he's way taller than me and our snuggles feel really good). I got NO reply. 

PS: I don't suspect another woman, unless it's all online/virtual. Plus he has his kids most nights (and we spend time with together w/the kids too as our kids are also friends),so not a lot of time for that.

I don't want to F this up by over-thinking but I also don't want to be a stupid fool either - maybe we are just buds who occasionally kiss?  It all feels very PG, which is fine, but also not what I'm used to. He is a 'recovering Mormon' (his term) and left the church for good about 5 years ago, I can't help but wonder if that is playing in somehow in terms of physical intimacy stuff (like him not making more moves, although he totally made the first move when we were physically intimate) and his dating approach in general. He has indicated that he finds me attractive, and definitely snuggles in a way that would indicate as such.

We spent around an hour and a half together and seemed to get on. However I got home and slept on it without messaging after - knackered after the day at work and then rushing around to make the date on time. 

I checked the dating app and she had messaged twice first message saying ""how was tonight"" then 2 hours later saying ""I'll take that as a no"" 

I messaged back explaining why I hadn't checked for messages and that I like to take a bit of time to think things through before I arrange second dates.

Not sure I’m 100% ready but it’s the only thing I really haven’t tried in trying to make the final “moving on” step. 

Set up profile. Set age range from 35 to 55 but didn’t put it as a deal breaker. Been getting a LOT of likes / comments from guys in 25-30 age range. My girlfriends tell me to go for it, have some fun, I’m just dipping my toe. 

But it feels a bit icky to me. I have upstairs neighbours who are in their mid-late 20s - very nice lads, always have a nice chat with them, but not sure I would date any of them! Seems like the age gap is too much. 

Ultimately I would like to find a partner but in the interim, it’s more to dip my toe into the dating pool again, and to flex that small talk muscle. Not really looking for FWB or anything super casual, so don’t want to give wrong impression.

Take for instance this man I met on a dating app. First of all lied about his name and age. Said he was 40. He gave me his cell number into the dating app message so I plugged it into Fast People Search. Which gave me his correct name and age. Dude was 53 and had a bday coming up in a week. When I asked his real age he lied again and said he will be 53 but was honest about his bday date. 👀  



He sent me photos where the day and time stamp were months before meeting me and told me he took them for me. 



He was handsome as F so here we go- would you do a background check based on little lies?? Or does the need to do a background check mean run as fast as you can?

He was very excited about me and our future. At least in the beginning. Told me he didn’t want to rush things (intimacy) and wanted to make everything right. Well, 2 months later I started getting a vibe that he was not interested anymore. I asked him directly and he assured me I was wrong. Then things repeated and I brought the topic again. Well, he supposedly took it as if I was breaking up with him (over the text, facepalm) and literally ghosted me for 4 days. When I texted him again asking for clarity it turned out I never broke up with him but he did break up with me. Just like that, I literally am that idiot that didn’t read between lines. It hurts so bad. All I am doing is crying and drinking. He apologized for appearing to lead me on but it looks like this is exactly what he did.

I really was excited for him. I was only trying to be a friend but it backfired.   

My single, male, 44  of 2 years gave me (F, 43, married, ENM) a heads up he's going to see this girl he's been in touch with. We talked about her briefly and he didn't seem too uncomfy to talk about.  He's briefly mentioned her a month or so ago as well.

 I was really happy for him, and encouraging, and told him I think it's great he's doing this and to have fun (since he seemed unsure).  We then have amazing sex afterwards 

He was silent after his date night, but when we started texting, I lightheartedly asked how it went and hoped things flowed naturally and that he had fun.

He says: 🤔 🧐 🤨 ...then later: I'll give my uncomfortable answer 🤖 

Then even later: It went well. I was pleasantly surprised as my expectations weren't high. 

I excitingly (maybe too happily) told him I was glad it went well and  always good to keep expectations low 

 I now realize I stepped over his boundaries as his texts are short and kinda cold. 

1.  what the heck do those expressions interpret 

2. Should I bring this uncomfy topic up and apologize 

3. Do I continue communicating with him   flirtatiously like we usually do? Or just match his low energy?

We see each other just about every weekend, and now I feel odd asking about this weekend. 

 I thought it was OK to generally ask how it went the fact he mentioned about this girl a few times in the past.

 He's not non monogamous but tells me it turns him on that he is with me, married woman, and jokes about him effing me if he gets married one day!  (Yet prob post-nut talk there)

Just unsure what to do or think.  

 Part of me wants to just act like nothing has happened, and part of me wants to apologize if I stepped over  his boundaries that we never discussed.

And it does bother me if I hurt him in any way.

I fear apologizing will make me even look more nosey and I don't want to pry.

My bf and I have been together for about 16 months now. It's been great. I love him. He loves me. I don't doubt either of those things. But... and there's always a but, right?... I need more. I want more. I don't mean an engagement or living together. I mean, more time together. I'm starting to feel like an every other weekend girlfriend. And dinner on Sundays. 

I've already established that he's secure and I'm more anxious leaning. He's content with the pace of the relationship. I'd like it to move a little faster. He said something last weekend that was like a punch in the gut. I'm sure he's completely oblivious to the impact it had on me. His divorce was supposed to be final in February. It's still not final. And he hasn't been very aggressive in making sure it gets that way. There's one signature (his ex's), on one document standing in the way of his freedom. When I asked him for an update on how its progressing, he said something to the effect of, the fact that it's not over doesn't stress him out like it did earlier in the year. 

He has tied me meeting his 12yo son w/ his divorce being finalized. I agreed it's probably best. But it's starting to hurt our relationship. It impacts the amount of time we can spend together. If he met me then I could start making more appearances on my off weekend, for example, going over to watch a movie, or meeting for ice cream. 

Am I an asshole for wanting to spend more time together? In the beginning we would get together during the week. Then my schedule went sideways and that was impossible. Now I have a better schedule and he never initiates getting together during the week. If I didn't suggest it, we probably wouldn't. We have managed to have two weekday sleepovers in the past 5 weeks.

I'm very new to dating having ended an abusive relationship two years ago. So I just don't know what's typical and accepted and what's frankly not OK.

So this guy ive been seeing basically turns up at my house last night. I've been having issues with WhatsApp and messages and also wasn't feeling my best yesterday, which he knows.

At no point had we arranged a time, or anything and he didn't knock my door to even let me know he was around.
His messages finally came through about 9.05pm,by which point he'd blocked me on WhatsApp.
So I text trying to explain and apologise for what I hold my hands up to as an oversight on my part. He explained he felt angry and I think let down, I tried further to explain the issues I'd been having, and my health issues leading me to actually forget what day it even was(brain fog).

He's angry because he assumed I was with another man. Not was I ill, or dealing with anything, just straight up, has to be another fella. When I pointed out that when I don't get any response from him, or he's quiet for a day my thoughts turn to him being busy or not feeling great, he told me I turned it around on him and that's not OK because he's the 'victim here'.

Then I got a long lecture about how I disregarded his time and disrespected him. His energy and his time. I between this lecture id sent a text saying my kiddos are in bed if you want to have a chat. But he must have been too angry to take that in as I got a text saying I need a few days to think about your 'absurd behaviour'.

Admittedly that touched a nerve so I basically told him nothing to think about and if I've not apologised twenty times at least and that still wasn't enough then I don't need days to be told I'm not good enough.
Backtracked here and said but I thought I was still coming.
I basically said, nope. It's not wise. And I'm not putting myself in that position.
To which apparently you can be really mad at someone and then switch to being happy with them and if I want to grasp onto one thing he said that's in the past (?) then that's on me.
I've not responded because wtf?

I feel like my past makes me increasingly unreasonable because this exchange, it just felt off. I was saying sorry in every message. And because I felt sad he thought off the bat, I had another guy that I made him the bad guy.
I held my hands up, I dropped the ball. But no plans were ever made for me to have stood him up.

We took it slowly at the start, but since 4 months, we meet every second week (both have kids) and it feels really good when we are together. We have fun, there's a lot of attraction, talking, and shared values.

The thing that bothers me is a complete lack of verbally expressed affection or intentions from his side. It creeps up on me and makes me think that I am letting my emotions build up too quickly. 

He is also not taking any initiatives at all for me to meet his friends or family. He is not telling his kids that he met someone.  

A couple of weeks ago, I took him to my childhood country house. Showed him where we used to swim, walk in the forest, and go to a cafe that my mom's friend still has. This weekend he decided to go there with his kids. He mentioned it casually to me a couple of days ago and said that he had considered not to tell me..?! I joked about showing him my secret hidaways and him immediately stealing them. He did NOT ask if it was ok. On the other hand I didn't say it wasn't.

But... he went there today. Talked to my mom's friend for a long time, but didn't mention me at all. It feels so strange. And at the same time it makes me feel soooo ridiculous and childish. I obviously don't own the forest, beach, café... 

I realize this is not really about the cafe or talking to a woman he knows I know well since childhood, but about the whole situation. I am transparent to my friends and kids, I invite him to my life. I say that I miss him when we're not together. I've sent him a couple of hearts. He does not reciprocate. On the other hand, he is active with texting, planning to meet, he drives to see me even if only for a short moment sometimes, he is very sweet and physically close to me when we are together. 

We haven't met for a very long time and I should probably just sit back, relax, and let the relationship evolve... Or?

At this point I'm trying to think how to write what I'm feeling and it feels quite difficult but I'd like to hear your thoughts on this. 

I signed up for OLD and although I was optimistic about meeting someone I also have the fear that I'm just wasting my time and it will never work out. I matched with a few guys and sadly, they either didn't match up with the conversations  ( I prefer communicating this way as I express myself best - Introvert here) or they ghost or there will be an issue with the distance. 

As much as I like the idea of meeting someone local, my history of dating and relationships are all LDR. And with my present situation, I prefer it LDR to avoid any local gossips as the country I'm living now has a small population and the last thing I want is for my ex's family and him to cause any issues that might jeopardize my current living conditions.

After a week of OLD, I cancelled it mainly I think it's just useless and I'll just end up with the same results. I don't see myself as desperately wanting a relationship but having someone special who I can share my world would be really nice. I think deep down inside we all want companionship, knowing that we are not alone and that we are special, loved, valued and accepted. 

I can't remember how it is like to kiss someone or to hold their hand or to go out on a date. When I see pictures of couples or reading about their lovey dovey stories, I just look away and think to myself, ""maybe that could be my story too again one day""

I had a guy on OLD asked me if I would like to be married again. Somehow I cried so much before answering it. I do belief in marriage, just that the wrong people made the experience unpleasant. It is something that I like to try again if there is a chance but it isn't something that I'm ready for right now. 

Answering that question made me think a lot about what I really want. Something that I was quite afraid to admit to myself. Answering it also took a lot of courage to truly speak from the heart at the same time also acknowledging the amount of fear that I have from failing at it again or even being able to find it again. 

There is this feeling of hope and want that is trying to emerge and there is also the feeling of being hopelessness. 

I spend my time illustrating all of my feelings and 'telling' them on social media without fully exposing that that is what I'm really feeling. It's like an outlet for me to cry openly without showing any physical tears. 

A friend of mine once told me, ""to love again is to be dare to feel hurt again"". She meant well but I did felt my heart beat faster and my arms pulled a little closer to myself. Hurt can really help you build the Great Wall of China around your heart. 

Have you ever felt this way before when it comes to dating again/opening yourself to the possibility of a new relationship?

I did not hear from him at all last night. With online dating, you know how it goes. People can be flaky and disappear. I gave him the benefit of the doubt and waited till this morning.

I can still see him before my dinner w/ my gf easily but it won’t be the time that he suggested.
