0,o0pi40,1623793755,What should I do? What is the concept of flirting?,"27M here. I've never been into online dating, I've had maybe 10 dates from dating apps since they appeared around 2013. I tried dating offline with girls in the university, and at my workplace, but with no success. However during my years in the uni  I was treated well as a colleague and friend.  I've had sex only 2 times in my life during university times, both times drunk after parties.

My problem is, I cant seem to be liked by a girl. To me it seems I don't evoke any feelings and seen as a dull person. I guess I'm a nerdy guy, but have a lot of hobbies. I used to write poetry, I play the guitar, and I'm well educated, but I simply don't understand the concept of flirting. I just don't like talking about stupid shit like shopping, fashion, instagram, etc. I had a boring job, and there isn't many fun stories to tell from there. But I've got a new interesting job only last week, so at least thats something.

I want to have a relationship. Not one night stands, but a romantic partner. But don't know where to start. I have 0 experience flirting with women, and I'm afraid of getting rejected again.

2,o0ppu6,1623794393,PSA to those having problems on OLD with conversations,"Hanging out with some friends at lunch. Two of which are good female friends of mine and they were complaining that all of their conversations on OLD go nowhere. I looked at how they started convos and just “lol’d” and handed them back their phone. I’m sure this applies to a lot guys as well but since I don’t have any direct experiences messaging guys on OLD(I’m straight so when I was on OLD obviously I only talked to women) I’m going to direct this to the ladies. 

“Hi” and “Hey” as starters is going to get you nowhere. As I guy when I got these messages on OLD I would just unmatch. It shows you put no effort into either looking at my profile or nothing in my profile was interesting enough to comment on for you(which is fine but then obviously it’s not going to work out lol). I got this the most on Bumble when women obviously had to make the first move. Much less common on others. 

And then let’s say you get a response to “Hey” and a conversation does start. One word simple responses to questions without follow ups also shows no interest and will quickly kill the conversation.

I used think when I encountered this sort of thing that these women just weren’t interested. But hearing my friends complain about their OLD success and then seeing them do this exact thing it kind of makes me wonder. I feel like for guys there is so much emphasis to be charming and charismatic. Tons of dating advice on how to talk to women and keep a conversation going but you don’t really hear about that for women. For women it’s just… look pretty. Which is really sad for many reasons but as we date in our later 20’s/30’s that is way less important. And if you haven’t developed social and communicative skills it can really hurt your ability to create a connection with someone. 

Anyway… OLD sucks. Kicked that a long time ago. In person is 100 times better. But if it’s you’re only option and you are serious about meeting someone makes sure the effort is going both ways. And that goes for girls and guys.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o0ppu6/psa_to_those_having_problems_on_old_with/

I had been in a relationship for quite some time and now it's more than a year that I'm single so I thought to give Tinder a shot to find not a hookup but a good date!


Basically I've been chatting with this really cute and fine french girl for almost a week. To my surprise we clicked right away, she told me that she really liked my sense of humor and was so interesed in my job that (surprisingly again) she was the one to ask me out on a date. Because of my work we couldn't meet right away but It all was going very smoothly, we exchanged numbers, photos, had some funny conversations and the lot. I work really long hours and I cannot use my phone very often so I didn't always promptly replied to her texts but every time I had the time to send her one she was immediately online to answer me, I took this as a positive sign of interest from her towards me. I had an overall good feeling about it, ""back into the dating business"" I thought to myself. 


For a couple of minutes we had a chat the morning of the day we were supposed to meet where we planned most of the details of the date but after that I didn't receive any reply from her for hours. I thought it was noting  but since the date's time was approaching and I didn't hear anything from her I tried to reach her to know if the date was still up and she said yes. Nothing to worry about, I thought! So I shaved, ironed my good shirt, took out the best watch I have and proudly went to the arranged place.
In the end I waited for more than an hour and then had a drink by myself. 


Later in the evening I texted her, no reply. Out of curiosity I did the same thing the day later too and still to today no answer. 


I whish she would've told me she didn't want to meet anymore or make an excuse... At least the waiter was nice enough to let me have the drink on the house.


I have to admit that I didn't expect to be stood up like that so I don't know if texting her again should be the right move... 
I keep thinking that if she wanted to ditch me the most reasonable thing to do was to tell me that.


What can I do?

TL;DR - I really clicked with a girl who said that really wanted to meet me until the day of our date when she stood me up without any reason. Tried to reach her, did not receive an answer.

Basically when you are starting to get to know someone, take it SLOOW. When you think you like them, take more time to validate those things that you like about them to see if it’s just something they’re showing you to get you to like them or who they really are. 

There have been many times when I really liked someone for the first two months and then suddenly, aspects about them start to change and they weren’t the person I first met. This is because a lot of people are on their best behavior in the very beginning but their true colors start showing later on because you can’t fake it forever. 

When they start showing you that they’re not who you thought they were, you need to accept that quickly and move on.

&amp;#x200B;

I \[24 F\] met my S/O \[26 M\] back in college and we remained friends until about 7 months ago when we started dating (we now both work full time in a big city). It has been going absolutely AMAZING. We never run out of things to talk about, laugh 24/7, and the chemistry is definitely there for both of us. We probably see each other 3-4 times a week because we both like to also spend time separate &amp; have time for friends &amp; etc but that works well for us. It is the sweet, sweet feeling of love you get when you might have found your ""person"". 

&amp;#x200B;

THIS IS WHEN IT GETS LESS FUN! He just recently got admitted into a few law schools (his life dream!) and I am SO happy for him but I'm not sure where this leaves us. One of the schools is about 6 hours away &amp; the other is 2 hours but he isn't sure where he will accept yet (he's accepted both in the meantime &amp; waiting on a few more wait lists) which makes it even more difficult to know how we will move forward since everything is so unclear. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ideally, he would attend the school 2 hours away, but I don't want to push him because I want his decision to be his own &amp; what is best for him. If thats the case - I think we would be fine. However, if he chooses the schools farther away, he has expressed that he doesn't think he wants to do a LDR because of 1) time &amp; stresses of law school, 2) not being able to emotionally handle the distance, 3) not being able to ""give me what I deserve"".

Personally, I'm having a hard time with this because I am absolutely in love with him &amp; would be willing to do LDR. I did LDR a few years back and it was obviously painful and sad, but had its pros as well (ended bc no end in sight/different life outcomes). But do I try to convince him? How do I do this? SHOULD I do this?

33,o0s8qr,1623802323,I'm (24F) interested in my (40M) former professor.... how can I subtly demonstrate interest without embarrassing myself?,"I'm a 24 year old college senior. I finished this professor's class several weeks ago and final grades have all been turned in.

I am very interested in getting to know him more. Aside from being attractive and very much my type, he has a great personality that clicks well with mine and we feel similarly about many topics. It's unusual for me to meet someone I really click with and when I do, I want to pursue it.

I am definitely not obsessed with him or in love or anything -- I just see him as an attractive and interesting person and want to see where it goes if the feeling is mutual. I don't feel uncomfortable with the situation at all -- I'm 24, have dated men in their late 30s and age isn't an issue, and am a graduating senior (more on that below). I'm not connected to the university post-graduation and am working in a different field. If we date, I would be fine with keeping our relationship discreet for professionalism.

My first question is, how should I approach this situation? The issue is I don't know what his personal stance is on dating ex-students. If he were strongly against it and had an issue with any suggestion of flirtation, that could be harmful to me or give me a reputation for flirting with professors.

So instead, I could just email that it was great to meet him and I'd like to say hello sometime when he's around campus. However, that would likely lead to a state of prolonged semi-professional conversations on campus where even if he *were* interested in me, he would not want to disturb a perceived mentorship relationship and would likely assume my interest was purely professional.

So, what is the best way to communicate my interest subtly, that gives him a chance to reciprocate if desired, but won't embarrass me if not?

Additionally: a propriety question. I graduated last week, but still have 2 summer classes left and technically finish in August. Neither class is taught by him, one is just research and one is in a totally different department. Technically the university bans relations between faculty and undergraduates.

Men, because they don't get matches and women, because they have too many matches.. I don't quite understand how they can be similar. I also see women saying they quit OLD because they can't handle too many matches or it became too overwhelming..   
People compare men struggling to get matches, let alone going on dates to women struggling to find good men on dating apps.  It's like comparing poor fishermen in some third world countries who are struggling to make ends meet to millionaires owning sea facing homes and going - *""You know what, having too much money is an issue too. My BMW broke down and now I have to spend 50 grand on a Merc.""*

I understand women get stalked considerably more, probably get dick pics sent... But seriously, you are not saying that out of 500 matches 400 people sent you dick pics or called you bad names. If that's the case, we as a society are fucked. In men's case, 90 percent of the times our matches won't even respond. *Do correct me if I am wrong.* My ex had 700+ matches at any point of time and she ends up with someone way out of her league and is on the way to breaking up with him. And she also said - ""*It's not easy. Too many options doesn't help. You (men) have your problems , we (women) have our own issues*"" and I asked her - ""*why do you swipe so much then. Why not swipe just 20 profiles and see how it goes*""?. She isn't happy about that question.. anyway..

It just sucks that I don’t get to see him a lot due to my family and all but I currently stop by his tattoo shop when I can and see him for a bit.

Basically I have low expectations for what men can/should do for me. I don’t like being paid for or overly catered to. It could be that I’m afraid to commit or that I’ve had douche bags in the past. But how do I overcome this?

I don’t like gifts. I always prefer to go Dutch on dates and drinks. I just don’t like feeling vulnerable or like I owe the guy sex afterwards.

But I’m realizing that most women are more open to letting men do shit for them and put in the effort/time/money for them. Lots of guys have tried to give me so much effort but I’m realizing that I never really welcome it. How do I be more open to letting men impress me without being any less classy or independent?

60,o0uzce,1623811797,The Best Dating Tip a Good Guy Will Ever Get,"I am going to give away one of my trade secrets here.  If you want to get a date, tell people you are on the market for a serious relationship.

I ask guys all the time if they have ever told their friends, family, and especially co-workers know they are looking for a serious relationship.  Most guys hem and haw and finally say something like, ""Well, they know I am single.""

That is a huge mistake, because if you are a good guy and you let people you see every day you are on the market - so to speak - for a serious relationship people will come out of the wood with suggestions you meet sisters, cousins, aunts, mothers, and daughters.  This is how nearly everyone used to get married in the old days.

At least in the West arranged marriages largely died out by about 1600, but pre-vetted suitors certainly did not.  A brother had a friend at school or an uncle knew a family friend with a pretty daughter.  It was simple and natural and it worked.

Today it has largely died off in the United States and Europe.  Everyone has headphones in, no one joins clubs, goes to church, or knows their neighbors.  So, they go online looking for community.  That can be helpful at times.  I love Reddit and even my FB feed, but it is not particularly helpful for romance.

Real romance means meeting someone in real life.  It is just that simple, but today that is often a huge challenge.  And, if you never let whatever circle of friends you have you are looking for love it is almost impossible.

But if you get the word out at work, at the gym, and your coffee shop soon there is a very good chance someone will say, ""I would love for you to meet my (sister, daughter, or whoever).""  It often can be an amazing introduction to a woman you would never otherwise meet.

Now, we are on Reddit, so lets cover the depressing downsides, and there are some.  First, the people you know may not know any single women.  This not some nutty seduction advice.  It is real and honest.

If you don't get any feedback don't worry, but try to be even nicer than you already are to the older married women at work or wherever you meet them.  They are your very best sources for endorsements.  A girl might not listen to her brother or even her dad, but if her mom says you are an amazing catch the ball is in your court.

The next thing guys worry about is that if they don't have any chemistry with the woman they have been encouraged to meet the co-worker or friend will be upset.  No, not if you are an old school gentleman and have been polite.

If things don't work out do NOT say anything negative about the woman after your first date to ANYONE (things have a way of getting around) be complimentary and move on.   If things start to develop move a little more slowly than normal - and always be polite to the woman.  (This really should always be the case.)  But remember, the person that endorsed you thought you were great and as long as you are kind, compassionate, and nice their opinion is not going to change.

This is old school traditional dating, but it also comes with a built in support network most modern relationships don't have.  If you screw up and say something dumb and hurtful the person that set the two of you up can probably help patch things up if you both want it.  And in any relationship, there will be challenges.

Also, do NOT - and I mean NOT - do this if you are not serious about finding a relationship.  This is a very bad hook-up strategy, because it can come back to bite you.

But if you are seriously looking for a serious relationship tell everyone you know.  Let them know you are sick of Tinder and tired of Match.  You will find everyone is a matchmaker.

Let them help you.  It worked for the first 300,000 years of human life and it can work for you.

61,o0v4dk,1623812301,I feel like I’ve completely given up on ever finding love,"I’m 21F and have never been in a relationship. I’ve “talked” to multiple guys and then let my anxiety get the best of me and pushed them away, no matter how strongly I felt about them. One actually took me a year to get over—even though it was completely my own fault. I can be head over heels for a guy and still manage to run away from them because I’m so nervous to just go on a simple date. I don’t know what’s wrong with me.

And for a while I joked, “I give up,” but deep down I knew I’d work something out in the future.

But now I feel like I have completely, genuinely lost hope. I can’t even put into words how hopeless I feel. A cute guy will catch my eye in public and I immediately get sad and discouraged, just somehow *knowing* I’m not enough for him, so what’s the point of even allowing myself to crush on him? And when I’m out with friends, they always get hit on, and I’m just awkwardly standing in the back, completely invisible.

I’m not the most beautiful person in the world, but I know I’m not just disgustingly ugly. I’m somewhat shy, but I can hold a conversation with no problem. I just feel invisible. It’s like I’m just completely unapproachable to every guy. I just feel like a non-option.

I’ve started to think about what my life might be like if I never manage to have a relationship. And this sucks because I’ve always been the type of girl who dreams of starting a family as soon as I can, nothing makes me more excited for life than my fantasies of my future husband holding our babies. These imaginary scenarios have literally saved my life in my darkest times, and now I’m at a point where I’m hopeless that they’ll ever even come true. For so long I told myself, “I don’t need a man,” and “I’m just going to learn to love myself.” But I’m done. I spent years learning to love myself. I spent years learning how to appreciate the single life. But that can only go on for so long before you start feeling completely isolated and touch-starved.

65,o0vmqd,1623814048,She says she has no idea what she wants," 

So I’ve been seeing a girl for about 2.5 months now. The first month and a half we texted and had video chats because of distance, the pandemic, and me being busy with work. Once I had free time I started to go and see her in person.

Just last week she came to my house for the first time for 3 days and we had an amazing time. I took her out, cooked for her, went out of my way to get her favourite snacks, and tried my best to make her feel comfortable. A lot of laughing, and we ended up having sex too.

I noticed that when she left she started communicating less and I could tell something was off. So I gave her a couple of days and she still wasn’t talking like her usual self. So today I asked her if everything was okay and that she has been noticeably quieter since she left my place. She responded with “Idk I’ve just been thinking you know exactly what you want and I have no idea what I want”. I found that that was a pretty weird thing for her to say since I’ve just been going with the flow. I haven’t brought up being exclusive, nor have I been trying to force a label on what we are. So I asked her if she enjoys spending time with me, to which she replied that she does, but just doesn’t know.

After that I said that I enjoy spending time with her too, so we should just keep doing the same thing and enjoy each other's presence. I said we don’t need to rush and think about labels and stuff like that. Again, she responded with “I just don’t know”. At that point, I checked snapchat and saw she was spending some time with friends on her day off. So I told her that we don’t need to have this conversation right now and to take some time and enjoy her day with friends. I said we can talk about this another time, to which she said “okay okay”.

I plan on giving her space and letting her initiate again when she’s ready. So what’s the verdict here? Am I fucked?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o0vmqd/she_says_she_has_no_idea_what_she_wants/

74,o0wnvc,1623817785,Standards vs. Expectations in Dating,"I am confused about the difference between standards and expectations in dating, and I don't know what I am allowed to feel or what I can hope for when I like someone because of this. I'll give you an example.

I like when people I date are consistent and intentional in their pursuit of me; it helps to build trust, connection, and attraction. It's hard for me to stay open, vulnerable, and interested when someone comes and goes without warning and without follow-through.

When they suddenly change patterns from texting often, calling when they say they will, and not following through on / blowing off a date they asked me out on, I usually feel it's time to move on - I have learned the hard way that if a someone (specifically here a man) stops working to make you feel special, it's probably because you're not (to him I mean). I never confront them to ask what happened, I never write a snarky reply to anything they send me thereafter, and I am always friendly and passive when I see them in person.

I have noticed in those times when I do let someone go without a fight, they may come back, but in a lesser way, and always with a chip on their shoulder as if I was the one who ruined things by 'having expectations'. If they ask for something they haven't earned (like a late night meet-up, especially where I have to go to them) and I in some form or another say 'no thanks, I'm good', or especially after I point out to them the inconsistency if they challenge me on it, they become indignant and sour and write me off immediately. If I ever have given in when they've stopped being consistent and showing up for me, they again will think I have ruined things by being 'too easy,' (not with sex necessarily, but even with my time and affection), they will de-value me and use me for as long as I let them.

Is it wrong to hold someone you're dating to the things he says and suggests? Is it not okay to only stay interested and invested in someone who shows up for me, who doesn't leave me guessing and hanging, who will do what they say they will do, who makes me feel special, who doesn't play games with my heart?

I always thought a standard was something like believing we were going to go on a date on Friday because they said to me they wanted to take me out on a date on Friday, and then feeling disappointed and wary of they for not communicating with me about it or making it happen, which makes me question their genuineness. And I thought expectations were more like anticipating that the date that they said they were going to take me on is the fanciest restaurant in town and that from every date for now on they will have to spend that kind of money on me every time we see each other.

So, what do you guys think? What am I allowed to 'expect' from someone I am dating, and how should I feel about inconsistency and indignation? PLEASE stay kind :)",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o0wnvc/standards_vs_expectations_in_dating/

What the article meant by that is you can try as hard as you want, put in as much effort as you want, be the ideal partner...but if you and the other person aren't meant to be, it doesn't matter what you do. It's just not going to happen. It's never enough when the person is not the one.

It doesn't matter if you don't believe in ""the one"", or ""soulmates"". This idea is still relevant to any romantic relationship you are in. It doesn't mean you don't try or that if things are hard, it's not meant to be.

91,o0ykdy,1623825520,I think this guy is giving me the run around but I don't understand why he keeps messaging me,"I have been dating him for about 4 months. In the beginning it was just casual (in my mind), and then when lockdown lifted I was surprised that he started to plan real dates. Intrigued, I went along on them and a little romance evolved. I met his friends a few times, we hung out a lot on real dates, he never kept me wondering, I always knew when I was gonna see him. It felt different and natural, like it could actually be heading somewhere.

Fast forward to now, in the last month things have changed. I noticed that we were still texting a lot (not LOADS but at least 1-2x a day, just checking in, nothing intense). If there was a gap, he or I would initiate some more convo. But then I realised we were just talking and not making real plans, which I found frustrating. I talked to him about it and he suggested we meet up in person and talk it through. So we did, and he said he was sorry,  wasn't doing it on purpose, and he would make more plans. Some things he did say that I didn't pay attention to at the time but now I am: he was hurt last year and so told himself he should be single this summer, he doesn't know/can't guarantee where we'll lead, he said he was concerned I'd be upset because he has a lot of stag dos and weddings so he might not always be able to make plans. We made one set of plans that day, and since then those plans have been and gone, he hasn't sorted anything else.

Since then, he has still sent me a message or two per day. I asked if he wanted to play tennis because he said he wanted to, but when I ask he says he's visiting home for the week (this week). He never suggested another day etc. Basically I'm fed up and I think I'm going to call it a day with him when he gets back. He clearly isn't that interested and I want something more with someone that's actually going somewhere.

What's annoyed me is that, I have stopped messaging him first while he's at his parents, because I feel like the spark has gone and he's stopped bothering with me. So he messages me asking about stuff today, after we don't speak for 2 days. I reply nicely and also add 'well if you want to make plans when you're back, let me know'. He replies to ALL of the messages apart from that one, essentially ignoring it.

Why is he bothering to text me at all if I've clearly given up and so has he? why text me if you don't wan't to ever make plans and you're always too busy with something.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o0ykdy/i_think_this_guy_is_giving_me_the_run_around_but/

99,o0z86u,1623828375,Should I tell him to stop using women to push up his ego??!,"Helloo, I will write a long and the short story from that. 

Short story:

I met a guy at a Trainings park, where we have also like a Trainings group. So we probably see each other like 3 or more times a week. So we begann to flirt and spent some time together after trainings... and one day we had sex... After that day, he didn't wrote me like before, he was acting with distance. 
And my head was going crazy, because I felt used with someone who I had to see oft. 

So I wrote him, why is he acting like that, did he lost the interest on me, and I didn't want the atmosphere at the training to become weird. And we could be friends. He answered:
I think you are really attractive and it is always funny with you, but I don't want to hang out that much, because I want to avoid this turning into a relationship. But I will be happy to become friends. 
And I said yes of course, thanks for your honesty. 

The next day I went to train and he was there too. He came to me and told me:
Really brave what you did, and I was I needed to know where we were, because I don't want to get hurt. And he said: I can't normally talk like this stuff so easy and ask me if he hurt me? And I said yes you did. And he was oh... I feel bad and me saying don't worry it is going to be fine. I have shouldn't say that! But I just wanted that conversation to finish. After that we didn't talk anymore. 

The next I realized that I should have been more mad at him. And tell him it isn't fine at all. So now I want to tell him that I don't want him as a friend! Because I don't like people who uses other people just to feel much better with themselves! To push up specially his ego. 

Any advice? 

Long story:

I met a guy at a park, where we do train like almost everyday. And we are kind of in a group that also trains there.
And he came to me talk to me, flirted a lot with me and then we spend after training time together... Like 4 times, and the whole time was this game of flirtation. He knows he is handsome and has a really good body. At the beginning I had that feeling, that I should not trust him but at the end  I did...

The next week I had some drinks with some friends and I wrote him, to meet and he wanted to come to my place. And he said yes and of course we had sex because that was the intention. After sex I wanted him to stay and sleep with me but I didn't say anything, because he wanted to go home. So we spent like half an hour like talking and just laying down. So after that he went, and I had like a wierd feeling that somethinf changed.

Next day he didn't wrote until I did, he was colder than normally and yes... My head was really like thinking everything, that could went wrong...
Two days later I had a birthday, where before the sex I had invited this guy. And he told me he will be happy to come or he will let me know if he could come. He never wrote me at all. I saw him that he did train that night at the park and didn't write me at all.

The next day after the party, the training group, he and I went to a lake. He picked me up and talk normal to me but not like before, like with distance. And I was okay. I asked him if he played with me? He said no I don't do that. And I was okay... The whole day at the we didn't talk anymore. 
The next day I wrote him like thanking him for me picking me up, and he said how are you, and no problem at all with a kiss. So I told him I was fine but missing a hug from him and wishing him a nice day. He didn't answer at all. Until then my head was driving me crazy, and I decided to write him, why was he acting like that, and if he list interest on me, he could tell me, and I don't want the situation to become weird and we can be friends.
He wrote so quickly like I do finde you really attractiv and it is funny to be with you, but I don't US to spend too much time together, because it could turn on into a relationship and I don't want that. And would be really nice to become friends. 
So I answered OK fine, thanks for telling me the truth. We can be friends.

I felt really used... Because why would you that, with someone that you have to see every day in a group of friends... It is stupid. But yeah I think he wanted to push up his ego.

Next day I went to train, and he was there. He came to me and say oh really brave what you did, and I was I needed to know where we were, because I don't want to get hurt. And he told me I can't normally talk like this stuff so easy and ask me if he hurt me? And I said yes you did. And he was oh... I feel bad and me saying don't worry it is going to be fine.
