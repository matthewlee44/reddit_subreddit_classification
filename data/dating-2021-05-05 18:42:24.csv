So last week, she initiated a conversation with me that she have watched one of the latest episodes of the Christian TV series we both watched. She was the one who recommended me that series btw

So she initiated a conversation with me last week when she watched one of the latest episode, we talked about it and we really had a good and engaging conversation

She told me last week that she will watch the latest episode (episode 3) last week

Well, this week she did not initiated a conversation with me she have watched the episode 3. So I decided to message her today, asking her if she already watch that episode

She told me she did not watch it yet, she also told me that she is busy recently. I just responded that ""Its ok! no problem!""

But like I feel kinda sad tbh. Its like there's the feeling idk, maybe she have watched it but she just does not want to talk about it

1,n5u8pd,1620258952,What does it mean if someone sends memes about dating/couples/romance?,"Heya. 15M here, and I've been chatting with a girl I've had a crush on almost constantly for a year or so.

Here's a little background info:
We're in the same friend circle, and she's the ""attractive magnet""; all of the seven guys in our circle have, at some point, have been attrected to her one way or the other (we've both attracted our fair share of people, but neither of us have been in a commited relationship). When I first started making moves and talking to her about a year ago, I could tell she wasn't really into it, sending mixed signs, not really opening up, etc. Because of that, I took a lot of time to really think if she really was worth my time in terms of dating (she's really nice and a good friend to everyone). However, I couldn't stop thinking that she's the one, and she's perfect for me (some people have mistaken us for a couple/said we'd make a good couple... maybe it's just because we're both Asian or something).

Lately, however, we've been talking a fair bit, and she seems into it, and at some point, we started sending memes to each other. Usually, the memes are something we thought was funny or relateable. Most recently, she sent several memes with a romantic touch... I don't mean anything too wild, but they were kinda out of her style of things and seemed a little awkward coming from her. I don't know if she's trying to say anything with those memes, and I needed the advice of older, wiser people. Thanks! :)",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n5u8pd/what_does_it_mean_if_someone_sends_memes_about/

5,n5up5v,1620260363,Got rejected after the first date,"I'm sorry about the long post, but I just need to write this down so I can stop obsessing about it.

Just for context, I'm 25, been on a lot of first dates and this is the first time I got rejected.

So I met this girl on Tinder, she is cute and really cool, we hit it off immediately. Been texting for a few days, got to know each other a little bit, I made a joke about ""we should go out and do something"", and she said ""Are you finally asking me out ;)"", and this was after 4 days of texting, pretty fast in my experience. 

Naturally, this was a really good sign for me, she was really eager to go out with me, we were hitting it off on text, and so, like the idiot I am, I thought ""Oh, I got this, the date is just going to be a formality, I basically can't fuck this up"".

So we went out, got some coffee to go, sat by the lake and talked for 2 hours. It was a beautiful afternoon, I made her laugh, we talked about our lives, our hopes and dreams, there was never a dull moment. After 2 hours it was getting cold, so we walked to the bus station, said goodbye, talk to you soon and I went home. 

Sounds like a perfect first date, doesn't it? It certainly sounded like all the other first dates I had and all of them were successful, so I thought everything went well. 

So after a couple of hours I got home, and sent her a text saying I had a great time, would've been better if not for the wind but oh well, what can you do. And she sent back a really long text saying that she had a really nice time too, she said that I'm a great person and the 2 hours flew by, but she doesn't think we're compatible, it's not you it's me, I don't want to waste your time and stuff like that.

Obviously I was pretty confused, so I wrote that what she said kind of caught me off guard, I really had a great time and really like you, hope I didn't do something to make you uncomfortable. To which she said that I didn't do anything wrong and she's really sorry but her gut is telling her that this doesn't have a future. To which I really didn't have anything else to say, other than ""Alright, well it was nice hanging out with you, good luck""

I know the obvious answer is she didn't like me physically - I'm not trying to jerk myself off here, but I'm a decently handsome guy, and all the pictures she's seen of me were very clear so she had a very good idea of what I looked like before we ever met. 

I don't know, I'm trying not to overthink it, I just think it's really weird. I don't know what I could've done that made her go from 'can't wait to go out' to 'not gonna happen' in the span of 2 hours. If I came across as an asshole, she wouldn't have bothered writing me the nice and long rejection message, she would've just ghosted me. Maybe there was something that I told her about myself that she didn't like, it's possible but most of the important stuff I already told her over text. 

I know this sounds like someone who just can't accept the fact that someone doesn't like him so now he's going on a tirade to soothe his ego. But it's really not like that. I just feel really bad, I'm worried that I did something bad and I don't want that to happen again. I feel like this girl was really excited to meet me, and now I've somehow disappointed her.

As I'm writing this, I realize the bigger problem is I just have trouble accepting the fact that people can like you one day and then suddenly change their mind the next, over the dumbest things, or for no reason at all. It's just one of those things I guess, you have to accept it and move on.  I might have done something horrible, or maybe not, I'll never know, so there is no point losing sleep over it. Still gonna post, maybe someone can offer some insight or take away something useful from this experience. Who am I kidding, nobody is gonna read this

I’ve gone to therapy, reflected a lot (for two years) about my faults and my ex’s and why our relationship failed. I’ve done lots of self care and deep healing so I feel good.

8,n5v9se,1620262232,how to differentiate between ‘impatient’ versus ‘patient’ love-bombers based off my own personal experiences and field research,"The degree to which someone demonstrates trust, intimacy and emotional vulnerability should increase over time. If things immediately pop off and feel like 
a fire work that dwindles over time that’s a HUGE warning sign. HOWEVER not all love bombers follow the same course of action. The impatient types will pop off immediately but their patient counterparts will take a more subtle approach and play the long game.

The **impatient types**  can be sussed out within the first three dates if you keep objectivity. In my experience, these types are extremely arrogant and superficial with their charm. Here are a couple red flags that stood out: they bombard you with compliments, say will outright you’re amazing and/or claim you’re the best date of their life; they divulge personal information ASAP to gain your trust and reference future plans that include you, such as meeting friends and family etc; they are extremely complimentary during the date and make follow up plans in quick succession, on subsequent dates they may adopt a drastically different demeanour and begin to neg you if things are progressing fast enough. In an effort to move things along, they may offer up commitment too soon. If you’re a dead end,  they will likely immediately discard you. 

The latter more **patient types** are tricker to spot because they’re calm, cool and collected. In my experience, they are far more subtle and insidious. 
These were the red flags I missed: they rarely share any personal information about themselves, and redirect the conversation and/or deflect any personal questions back to you; they listen WAY more than they speak, to figure out your shadow self for best manipulation practices (ex: you speak highly of your academic achievements so they compliment your intellect); they preform acts of service to build a false sense of intimacy, to distract you from how shallow your connection really is! Another warning sign, the relationship doesn’t progress in: emotional intimacy, trust, and vulnerability despite going steady for months. By the time you figure out something is ‘off’ you’re usually hooked and therefore, more prone to stick around because you’ve fallen for their facade’. Assuming you’re serving a purpose to them (sex, services or supply) they’ll likely use intermittent reinforcement techniques to suck you back in: switching back to their facade, ignoring you then flooding you with attention, gifts &amp; compliments etc, 
to reel you back in. But MAKE NO MISTAKE, if you lose your utility they’ll be quick to discard.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n5v9se/how_to_differentiate_between_impatient_versus/
9,n5vazo,1620262349,I'm in love with my bestfriend for 7 years but I'm a coward,"I (M) have been crushing on this friend(F) of mine from what started as fellow club members in college to now bestfriends. N during that time, I've been in one 3years relationship and she's been in 3, the last one also ended after 3 years, so during our friendship in college we've never both been single at the same time. We're really close and cherish each other platonically on the outside, at least for me. She's has really put me in the friendzone absolutely. To the point that she's too comfortable in being friends with me without worrying abt crossing any line. 

I myself on the other hand, have been secretly in love with her for 7 years. And I'm not proud to say this, but even during my past relationship, the feelings didn't actually went away, just subconsciously disguised as me being caring towards her as a friend. I mean, I loved my ex at the time with all my heart, but I can't stand the fact of not knowing what's happening in her life at the same time. 

Anyway, I'm a people pleaser with the lowest self esteem so I've covered up my feelings quite excellently and played along with the platonic nature of our friendship. And it has reached to the point of we're both comfortable with each other to care enough like the bare minimum amount of how couples should take care of each other, without the romantic nature. I don't wanna lose that, would do anything to preserve that, but at the same it ACHES me to not being able to do more,to give more, to love more, to express all out and sincerely all the things I've been thinking about her, wishing to do with her, to share with her. To spend the rest of my life with her. It hurts so, so bad. 

And just recently, I found out she has broken up. But unfortunately I never heard anything from her. Because despite being best friends, love life is one of the aspects of our life that we agreed to keep to ourselves. And I found tht out abt a month after breakup. 

She's keeping herself busy with her job, and now she's REALLY in kpop group to the point of making them her whole life. Just basic overcompensating the exes voids. And even now, she hasn't shared anything regarding that with me. Kinda bum me out since friends are supposed to ne sharing about each others' heart break. 

My dilemma right now is being friends while deeply in love with her is the hardest thing yet for me. 
1. I could just not risking the friendship, and continuing what we have now, but I'll be forever eaten alive inside coz I know I'll be forever in love with her and without closure, I'll be left hanging n constantly asking the ""why"" and the ""what ifs""
2. I could confess to her, and she rejected me, but now that she sees I actually have feelings and hoping something out of her, she'll be hesitant to continue the ""platonic"" friendship anymore. Hence, ruining the friendship
3. I'll confess to her, she turn me down, but demanding to stay friends like usual. And considering it's a 7 year crush and being in love, I KNOW I'm not strong enough at all to just man up through that, and hence again, ruining the friendship. 

She never sees me in the light of potential mate. I'm very sure of that.. So it kinda kills whatever acts of love I gave her all these while. So what do I do? We live across the country from each other now, so our only mean of communication is by textings. Which makes it harder coz she's a dry texter as well. No room for further bonding... I know I'm being 70% unreasonable and overthinking. But she's just that great of a girl to be crazy n unreasonable to.

I made a lot of mistakes with her and came across something of hers online that paints a much better picture of who she is: very low self esteem, lacks self confidence, is dying to have a boyfriend, and gets hurt easily emotionally where she's trying to work on herself (she's not promiscuous though just reads into things and beats herself up about it).

My mistake was suggesting she'd pay for the 2nd date, then pull away from her when we couldn't go out right away and strongly hint at seeing other women (trying not to put all my eggs in one basket) to make her jealous. I also use to tease her to get her to open up more as well. I found out she gives up way too easily and also closes up emotionally so this backfired badly and I haven't had the courage to break the silence for about a month now.

Despite her emotional flaws, she's pretty much got a lot of potential for what I'm wanting in a long term partner. A lot of the girls I've talked to do not have these qualities: family oriented, reserved, sweet, still believes in love, wants kids, folks still together, healthy relationship with family. I'd very much would like to be the one who gets her and hopefully helps her see that she's quite the catch and make her feel special.

The first time I messaged him actually worried what has happened cause he's very active on social media and he was completely invisible everywhere but this time I promised myself not to follow up cause it's humiliating.. Based on my experiences before I didn't want to kiss or do anything in the first couple dates just to make sure it's not yet another heartbreak and disappointment. We kissed on the first date and held hands on our last date but nothing more and I'm happy with that.

The first time he ghosted me, he got in touch at the end of that week telling me he was swamped and he was super excited to talk so I gave him a chance having seen that but this time, I have gone completely cold... I know some people need space during the week when they work and I'm ok with that; in fact I'm much busier than him even though he works full time but I want him to communicate that to me and not leave me in the dark! But at the same time, doesn't matter how busy you are, if you care you can just send a single message to show the person they're important.

He just messaged me after almost 3 days but I am so turned off I don't even wanna talk to him. I really thought this is going somewhere cause we clicked instantly, we are very alike but also very different, our cultures are super similar.

Because my BF wants no involvement with her and its coming to a point with what she is doing is unhealthy for him to move on and it creates a stressful space for us.

23,n5wmne,1620266616,[24F] Can’t ever see myself getting into a relationship,"I’m going to be 25 later this year and I’ve never been in a serious relationship. I feel like such a freak. I’ve had sexual partners that have lasted for about 6 months - 1 year differing from each relationship. 

But so far, I’ve never been in love – I don’t even think I have it within me to feel that way about someone. I feel so uncomfortable in relationships and I truly don’t think I’m cut out to be in one. I know everyone here is probably going to say “but you don’t need a SO to live a happy life!!” I’d beg to differ. It’s human nature to want companionship and as someone whose an only child, I’ve always been alone. So it’d be nice to find someone but I don’t think I ever will. 

I think even if I had the opportunity to be in a relationship, I’d sabotage it because it makes me so incredibly uncomfortable to be in a partnership. 

I feel uncomfortable when people buy me things. I don’t like the idea of having a joint bank account with someone. I’ve been through a fair share of bad experiences with men and I just don’t trust them anymore. I like having the bed all to myself. I don’t want to have someone there to influence my decisions in life. I have my moments of being sad because I’m single — but I’m not sure if I would be happy in a partnership either. I’d be lying if I said it didn’t want a relationship though. 

Worst part is how other people react when I tell them I’ve never really dated anyone. It’s a common topic that often comes up in your mid-20s and I always dread it when it does. I don’t like to talk about it with people because of how my friends in the past have reacted to me never dating. 

One of my friends asked me how long my longest relationship was and I told him I’d never been in one. He just widened his eyes and looked at me as if I had 10 heads. Then goes on to say “my longest relationship was 3 months” as if that was some big accomplishment. I’m so sick of having friends that judge me about it because it makes me feel even worse. 

Anyway, anybody else in this same situation? Can you see yourself never getting married?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n5wmne/24f_cant_ever_see_myself_getting_into_a/

I created a tinder and right away I hit it off with this guy and we ended up going out for drinks a few days later and had a great time. I am extremely attracted to this man and we have a great connection but at times I am feeling a bit insecure. I’m normally a very confident person but it’s been 5 1/2 years since I dated anyone new and can’t help but feel a bit silly sometimes. He’s extremely good looking, has a house and generally has his life together and just had a lot more life experience than I. He also has had a lot more dating and sexual experiences than I have which also makes me feel unsure. On the second date we ended up going back to his place and hooking up, and then the following 3x have all been relatively the same, I will go over, we will cook dinner together have a few drinks and then have sex. We haven’t really had a conversation about what we are looking for because I haven’t felt it was necessary but after this most recent time I’ve started to wonder if he just thinks of me as an easy lay? He is generally pretty sweet and always wants me to stay over (I haven’t yet) but he also doesn’t seem interested in doing anything other than having me come over. In some ways he’s super open and honest and tells me a lot about his life but he’s also super private about his dating history, I even found out from our courts website that he was married and recently got divorced, I don’t really care but I also don’t understand why he wouldn’t mention it at some point. All in all, I’m getting mixed signals, on the one hand I think he’s just as into me as I am into him, but then sometimes I get the vibe that he’s not looking for anything beyond casual sex. Do you think I should be worried that he’s not into me? Or is it just my insecurities creeping in?

Well I'm here to tell you that dating isn't everything, nor should your success define who you are.

Life is short, yes - but it is also long. There is no need to rush and feel like you have to immediately dive into a relationship in order to feel happy or successful.

I know too many people that believed they would become happy and feel complete once they found someone, but even after finding said person, they still weren't happy, because they never knew how to be happy with themselves first.

Enjoy your life. Wake up and appreciate living comfortably in a society that gives you the tools to thrive and survive. Be glad you're being gifted another day to enjoy the finer luxuries and experience interactions with others. Take risks and try new challenges. Learn who you are as a person and become skilled at things that will make you marketable.

I'd rather see all of you develop talents that grant you economic freedom before you go running off looking for someone to jump into bed with. Make your money work for you first, so that you don't have to play catch-up while desperately trying to stay afloat with a family to provide for. You will regret not using your youth to develop your skills because you were too busy looking for love.

56,n60160,1620278901,Love Languages: Advice Needed for Dating Someone with a Different Love Language,"I’m not going to stick entirely to the 4 or 5 main love languages. I will do my best to sum up the issue instead. 

Me (F25) and my boyfriend (M25) have been together a year and a half and have been living together right over a year. I love him to death which is why I’m seeking outside, unbiased advice from any others. I want to learn how we can both work together to deeper understand each other and love through this. 

My SO and I have very similar interests and hobbies. So, we work great together. We do communicate with each other openly and respectfully. We don’t raise our voices and will normally approach the conversation letting the others know some time and attention to each other to listen is important. 

However, when it comes to our expression of love and our love languages... we communicate almost the exact opposite. 

1) I love deep, meaningful conversation and expression of love. He does not. 

EX: I’m the type to be falling asleep and say “Babe, you’re my favorite person and friend. You mean so much to me.” He will get awkward sometimes but will echo what I say or say he loves me. But he doesn’t go into detail when echoing me and he doesn’t initiate sweet convos. He has let Me know through open communication that , emotional conversations make him awkward. He says he isn’t good at expressing emotion like that. 

2) he says he is more one to show how he feels. I might take notice to him doing something once a month. 
EX: I’d had a tiring week like 6 weeks ago with working 6 days that week plus adding about 20 hours worth of schoolwork for college. He brought me a few roses, and when I saw them and looked at him after getting home, he told me he knew I’d been working hard and he was proud of me. 

This was the sweetest, and I truly appreciated it. But that’s the last thing he did to show how he cares. And I crave those conversations. 

I don’t want to add too much where it’s even more of a novel... but overall, just FYI we both have good sex drives and our sex life is pretty great, so I’m not worried about that part. 

And it’s not that I think he doesn’t love me honestly, but if any of you are strongly a Words of Affirmation love languages I feel that you’ll understand. I think he honestly just lets time get by him before thinking to do something. But it’s hard for someone who is talkative and open about emotions to figure out a solution saying a quiet guy who doesn’t like to get into emotional conversations about us. 

I love him so much, I just want some advice for ideas that we can both compromise. I’m really considering seeing a therapist, too.

I'm 22 male, and I have had some success in going on dates with some girls, however it seems like getting these dates are actually so hard and .. whenever im on tinder it takes 2 days to get a match, and when I do get a match its either a girl who has 90 plus matches who barely seems interested and its just so frustrating because whenever I switch to men, I get 99 likes almost in 5 hours and a shit ton of matches just to test, I guess girls really have insane standards

please help out a guy out its obvious im below average in terms of looks, but how is it this hard to go on a date with a girl? in 5 hours I get 99 likes with men, once every 2 days with women. and I feel shitty doing this because I'm straight but I just like doing it to test out.

Why are there standards so high!??!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n601j8/need_some_advice/
58,n601nl,1620278958,"The ""sorry I'm busy"" response"," Two years ago, I met this girl in one of my classes and we formed a group for a project. We spoke her and I after class here and there but I felt like she wasn't attracted to me judging by the way she looks at me and acted around me. I let it go and focused on the project, eventually the team didn't work out as there was a lot of conflit, we got split up. We communicated through Facebook but it was mainly work related for the project. A few months after finighisng the class, we would see each other around campus, I'd see her around and she would say hi and so we were on good terms, but never really talked on facebook after the project ended. Three week ago I decided to shoot her a text with 'are you alive ?..."" she didn't answer it. Two days later, I asked her to hang out and she answered 17 hours later with a 'Sorry I'm busy', I replied 'no worries, thanks for telling me' and thus conluded she wasn't into me. Now I'm wondering, should I have probed? Maybe she was testing me to see if I were going to ask her out again ? to see if I truly wanted her ? maybe she was playing hard to get ? Should I message her again to ask for a different time to hang out to show her I like her ? Is she even interested ?

59,n60710,1620279560,What are some red flags to look out for when looking for a guy and opinions,"I’m not sure but deep down my gut it’s telling me that I should walk away from this guy. I’m not sure if I’m being too overly sensitive but he sent me a Snapchat the other day and he called one of his friends kid a “psycho” when she was running into the room trying to go up to him in excitement. Not only this but he would double or triple text, if I haven’t respond back within a “reasonable” amount of time ranging from 2-15 minutes and longer. If it’s longer, he would send another text a few hours later or the next day.  He also never seems to answer my questions or would say something else to avoid the question or move to a different topic. He is very hot and cold. Should I just drop this guy altogether? Or just do a slow fade by eliminating contact and decreasing the amounts of messages/length of messages.  It seems like he is so full of himself but I am not even sure if I am being too judgmental about him. I tried walking away before and he reassured me that there was something between us and that we attracted to one another and got along. Idk but I feel like I can’t be my complete self with him both in person and through texting/social media.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n60710/what_are_some_red_flags_to_look_out_for_when/

So one fine day somewhere around Mid March, I woke up to a text from my gf that things can’t work out cause apparently she thinks I’m planning to date her friends too and will be inviting them for a foursome lol. This was some clear BS, implanted by the mutual friend oof. Begged her to come back, and even apologised for a crime I didn’t commit lmao. She planned on keeping  no contact rule but couldn’t completely honour it so kept on messaging me asking about my exams health and stuffs. Even messaged me for my b’day in April, and last-messaged me 2 weeks back saying I want you but I cant get you, I wanna fix this but it cant be fixed. Somewhere deep I still want you lol. Begged her again, and she asked if we can stay as friends, I denied her request and she blocked me:( Expecting another message in a few days, cause it ain’t the first time she’s blocked me and messaged me some days after.

63,n60tum,1620282201,I’m (25F) super afraid to express my feelings to him (30M). I love him. Anxiety on 1000,"We’ve been dating a year now and he always showed signs of interest since day one but he hasn’t come out and said how he feels. I think he is a shy guy but I’m just assuming things. I do realize that I have to initiate when it comes to expressing feelings, I’m usually the one that’ll say “let’s talk” and then proceed with how I feel and he would then reciprocate. The last talk we had was when we were 2 months in, I wanted to know what the plans were going to be for us moving forward where we agreed to continue dating. 

I don’t want to put any pressure on him but I want him to know how I’m feeling now. He’s also moving away from our city in 3 months for a new job opportunity and although I’m very excited for him to be leaving, it really has me in my feelings wondering if he wants me to come with him, visit sometimes or just let me go. My mind is all over the place, I’ll be missing him when he goes. 

I want to tell him how I feel about him while I have the chance but I don’t want to be awkward or say the wrong thing. Should I just leave it alone and not say anything? Or wait for him to say it first? I’m a hot mess right now.
I’ve never been this nervous about expressing myself to anyone before.

66,n625pe,1620287954,Was this just a rebound or should I ask her out?,"tl;dr: met a great girl a few months ago, nothing happened because we were both in relationships. We are both single now, hooked up and spent the night together at a party last week. Haven’t texted since, but wondering if I should ask her out on a date

So a few months ago I (24M) met this girl (23F) that I get along with really well, we kind of hit it off instantly, talking a lot every time we would be at the same party (we have some mutual friends). Only thing is that we were both in committed relationships.

We both recently got out of our relationships, I broke up with my girlfriend and she got broken up with not too long ago either. We had chats about each other’s breakup, she feels sad about hers but respects the decision of her ex-boyfriend.

Last weekend I had a party at mine, she ended up joining with some friends. Again we started talking to each other most of the evening and things became quite flirty, a lot of physical contact, eye contact etc 

We ended up talking in my room, when she mentioned that a few weeks ago she kissed a guy that asked her out on a date as she was curious what it would be like to kiss someone else as she’s been in a relationship with the same guy for the last 3 years.

We continued chatting, and I couldn’t help but think that I was curious about kissing someone new too. I decided to go in for the kiss, we started making out quite aggressively and eventually got to 3rd base which she initiated. We then returned to the party, stayed quite close and very flirty.

As the party went on quite late, we ended up having lunch with her friends/flatmates at a restaurant, before everyone went home and she stayed over to sleep. We didn’t have sex, just cuddled and kissed before falling asleep. 

The next day I had plans, so she woke up and we kissed each other goodbye. I texted her to ask if she got home safe, to which she replied “yes, thank you for asking”, and I left it at that without us texting since (this was 4 days ago)

I’m now wondering: should I ask her out on a date? Or wait for her to text me before I make the next move?
On one hand we had a fun night together and get along great, and clearly there is some physical attraction between us. Our conversations are also very flirty (joking about how we’ll fall in love with each other, how she’s going to invite me to her home town etc).

On the other hand, we both recently got outside of relationships and a date might be too early for her. Maybe this was just a fun hookup/rebound as she likes the attention, as from what I’ve heard she’s always been a quite flirty person.

What do you think? Should I just accept this night as a bit of fun in my life as a single person, or ask her out on a date? Should I take the next step to text her even if she hasn’t reached out since when I asked her if she got home safe?

Any advice is appreciated!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n625pe/was_this_just_a_rebound_or_should_i_ask_her_out/

She wanted to stop talking until the fall and then start dating again then, which makes no sense to me because I am not going to postpone my dating life for 5 months just to wait until we can go more than a couple months together without being interrupted by summer break. 
I was bummed out but I accepted it and just wanted to move on. But since then pretty much every weekend she will get drunk and text me, even though she has no intention of getting together anytime soon. This keeps drawing up the feelings I have for her and interrupts my moving on process. I like her but I think the best thing for me is to block her on everything so I can focus on myself and meeting other people.

74,n62hmh,1620289422,I’m done with dating for awhile.,"23 y/o male. I haven’t dated anyone in 4 years. It’s only been hookups, fwb, acting like we’re dating but not actually dating, things like that. Every girl I asked to date me, which was like 4 girls, they all said no. I probably had sex &gt;5 a year on average these past 4 years since I graduated high school. 

PS: If you see numbers and you aren’t sure why they are there, add a (per cent sign after, it’ll make sense. My post was taken down automatically because I had them so I had to remove them. 

I’m just convinced I’m not good enough to date. I’m 6’0 130 lbs, tall but slim. Nice jawline decent/good face but I’m biracial so my features are mixed and I guess that’s throws off for girls. Slightly bulbous nose, so it’s skinny at the top but fat at the bottom. teeth are naturally pretty straight but I never had braces so they aren’t perfect or pretty white. 

I don’t want to be the guy anymore where girls are like no or I’ll give him a chance maybe then she ends up getting with another guy, ghosting me etc. I want to be in that t•p 20 attractiveness of guys so the attraction is obviously there so it’s just about finding the best person. 

Instead of chasing these girls and struggling I’m going to focus on improving myself. After all this time I know the areas where I need to improve. I started working out a couple weeks ago. I’m getting braces soon. I’m going to work a lot this summer and save up money to get a rhinoplasty around January. Once it heals I’ll get a nose ring too, not septum but nose ring. Next summer, summer 2022 I’ll save up to get tats from 2 high end tattoo artists around the following January. By that time I should be able to get my braces off and get my teeth professionally whitened and I will have been working out for 1.5 years so I should have put on 10-20 pounds of muscle. 

So in a 1.5 years I can have a prettier face: nose that better fits my face, nice white perfect teeth, in good shape with dope tats, earrings and nose ring. It’s partly so dating will be easier but partly just because I want to be more attractive and look the way I want to. 

I already have good hygiene and dress well with clothes that fit me. My haircut is kind of a basic fade so I’ll probably find something that looks nicer, fits me more but still easy to maintain. 

At that point I think I will be in the top 20 of guys for attractiveness at my university and I’d be a junior. My opinion on dating in university from experience is that most girls (70) aren’t trying to date, will only date if it’s a guy they really like. 20 already have boyfriends and 10 are saving themselves for the perfect guy. 

The problem with that 70 majority of girls who aren’t looking to date doing hookups stuff like that is they don’t do it with anybody. They only get with the t•p 20 of guys while the other 80 of guys are struggling to get anything. If you can get into that t•p 20 of guys you can have sex pretty regularly with different girls in college. One of my good friends, white guy nice face tall skinny. Big as*hole tbh. He was barely in that t•p 20 and he’d hookup pretty regularly with girls, maybe 2-3 I knew of every semester. Guys that were even better looking, like this buff white guy with his own apartment I knew, he slept with 10-20 ladies a semester. I met him because he was sleeping w one of my friends. I don’t think I could get to that level but if I did the stuff I listed earlier I think I could sleep with 4-6 girls a semester. 

Once I do these things and I’m attractive enough for girls to get with me regularly, I’m going to make up for this time. I’ll sleep with 20 chicks and I’ll only date when I find someone really special. I’m not going to forget how these girls treated me when I wasn’t good enough. I’ll just focus on getting body count up, having fun experiences, making connections and trying to find that special person. I feel like that’s what a lot of these girls do already, sleeping around a lot and only dating if it’s a guy they really like. Doing this stuff I feel like will not only be a lot of fun but put me on equal footing with a lot of these girls. 

To make it short: I’m sick of never being enough for these girls. So I will focus on self improvement for the next year and a half, then when I’m more generally attractive to girls I’ll start making experiences and looking for the perfect one. 

Also: don’t start taking about, why are you focused on hooking up ? Why aren’t you focused on love ? I’ve been looking for love and dating for the past 4 years and I’ve been denied every time. When I’m “good enough” for dating I’m going to remember this and the girls are going to have to wait until I’m ready. I will treat them well though so when I do decide to date, probably senior year, I could try to date whichever one I really liked , clicked with the best and who was the best match for me.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n62hmh/im_done_with_dating_for_awhile/

I feel like that’s what a lot of these girls do already, sleeping around a lot and only dating if it’s a guy they really like. Doing this stuff I feel like will not only be a lot of fun but put me on equal footing with a lot of these girls. 

To make it short: I’m sick of never being enough for these girls. So I will focus on self improvement for the next year and a half, then when I’m more generally attractive to girls I’ll start making experiences and looking for the perfect one. 

Also: don’t start taking about, why are you focused on hooking up ? Why aren’t you focused on love ? I’ve been looking for love and dating for the past 4 years and I’ve been denied every time. When I’m “good enough” for dating I’m going to remember this and the girls are going to have to wait until I’m ready. I will treat them well though so when I do decide to date, probably senior year, I could try to date whichever one I really liked , clicked with the best and who was the best match for me.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n62n2a/done_with_dating_for_awhile_im_going_to_focus_on/
78,n62o5h,1620290305,When would FWB ever work? Why does it always end messy for me?,"Hi so i’m a guy M20, who have had my fair share of FWB’s. I can’t recall a time where it didn’t end extremely messy. There’s always someone who wants more, and often, feelings and emotions get involved. I’m quite sure i’m in the aromantic spectrum, so it really doesn’t happen to me (that emotions etc. get involved), but that just makes it easier for me to point out when a girl is trying to make me jealous or whatever.

I’ve actually been really good at communication with most girls (expect in like High School). Always Said i wasn’t looking for anything serious, that friendship is 1. Priority and the rest is just fun on the side. Always agreed, but never been on the same page...

I’m just really curious: is there ever a situation, where 2 people can go from good friends, FWB, and then back to friends as they were before, and not make it messy either?

I’ve just really been distant with dating and girls over this first part of the year, as i’m tired of the same thing happening all the time. I’ve litterally lost all my female friends by doing this (expect like 2). 

And also, i’m beginning to see a pattern here. It can’t just be the girls, it must be me who’s doing something, but what??? Why does it Seem like the girls get false hope, everytime?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n62o5h/when_would_fwb_ever_work_why_does_it_always_end/

Life is what you make of it, so be conscious of the decisions you make. Ladies deserve respect, all ladies; even the crazy ones. Crazy women however, should be avoided as much as possible. Jumping into a relationship with a quickness is a good way to set yourself up for both failure and heartache in the future. If you're going after something solid relationship wise then you can't be in a hurry, nor can you rush it. Be patient and spend time on yourself while you can, because a relationship is a whole fuck load of work. You're getting more than just cuddles and sex, you're getting a whole new set of issues and problems. Their mental issues, family issues, physical issues, financial issues, job issues, personal insecurities, etc; all of those problems suddenly become your problems. Dealing with all of that can be really really really fucking hard and time consuming. Relationships however can be a great thing, when you find that person who is not only good to you, but good FOR you. Until that day comes however, you should be spending your time on yourself in a worthwhile manner.

Or would you never feel like this person actually wants you and chose you but instead took what they can get and settled? Is it self respect to not date them if they've actively let you know many times you're not their first choice?

This has bothered me on and off. On one hand, I get pretty down somerimes because I feel like Im in a trap of liking those that are not interested and getting interest from those that I am not interested in. This sucks.

Or does it? Maybe Im being spared another catastrophe of a failed potential relationship burn? Perhaps I'm avoiding another stalker? Perspective.

Obviously I sympathise that it’s not a nice situation to be in but then a few days later she’s back out with the exact same people dealing with the exact same situations again.

We finally end the date, she hooks my arm and holds my hand on the way to her car, and says we’re definitely doing it again. Make out by her car for a while. She is flat out giddy.

I tell her to text me when she gets home, she agrees and drives off. She never texts. 

It bothers me, but I let it go. A couple days later, I text and invite her on a second date, which i’d already planned out. She replies quickly, saying she’s going out of town for the weekend but for sure when she gets back. I tell her to let me know when she’s back. Never hear from her again.

Just.... yeah. She was so into it during the actual date, it was obvious from the moment we saw each other to when we parted. Went out of her way to make it known we were going out again. Then apparently the instant she drove off, it was out of mind.

I feel as though he’s way too old for her (her just turning 17 and him being 20 later on in the year). She’s not exactly mature for her age and I feel like she’s unknowingly being heavily influenced by her friends.

There are so many girls around that are his age and I don’t know why he’s picked someone who’s only 17 but it feels really really really weird to me that he has.

94,n65vi1,1620303275,I'm (25/F) falling for someone who's (35/M) love language and attachment style isn't matching with mine.,"And that stresses me. 

We have been talking for over a month now. We met on Bumble, right away there was a click, our communication was smooth and we were having fun like we have been friends for years. 

When we met, it was even better than us texting. For most of the things we are on the same page, we have fun, I find him attractive and intriguing, I love seeing his smile and hearing him sing and enjoying things. I love the way he pays attention to little details about me and takes care of me. 

However, i want to be touched, kissed, given compliments, hugged and mostly I crave physical attention but this doesn't seem like that's his attraction style. My attachment style is safe type and although I don't know his for sure but it seems like the dismissive type. There was some red flags during sex. When we had sex there was little to no foreplay, almost no kissing and it felt like just raw fucking. It didn't turn me on. He didn't tell me when he was finished and he just pulled out and came on my back, making me feel like I wasn't part of sex. That happened every time we had sex. Finally, i told him about it and he reacted it really well, thanked me for talking about it. Since then we didn't have time to see each other so I can't really see if there will be a change.

We had a little argument and that affected our attraction to each other because he said that he was hurt by the way i was approaching to a point I was too blunt and critical so for a while we have been cold. I have told him I prefer us being friends thinking it's healthier that way. We continue talking and there is still a connection, thinking about him still makes me happy. This led to another red flag, and I still can't forget the way he treated me in some occasions. In short, there was a moment we were talking about sex and he said morning sex is not supposed to happen (what a gibberish), which led me reminding him that we had morning sex twice, as a response to that he said that was a mistake. I told him that the way he reacted hurt my feelings especially considering I was starting to have feelings for him and I care about him. He quickly brushed it off, completely dismissed what I said. After that I started feeling resentful towards him.

We have mutually said we miss each other and have the intention to see each other. But all these things that happened makes me feel confused. I still find him attractive and literally dream about him almost every night. On the other hand, he has showing me that he will maybe hurt me in near future, and has the potential to manage the narrative. 

I have a history of having dealing with physically abusive, manipulative and controlling partner so I want to be careful and just be in a healthy relationship.

I need guidance on how my approach to this almost-relationship should be like.

Two times she brought a girlfriend with her and last time she invited me to spend the evening with her &amp; a girlfriend watching a series and eating together. After that I brought her home and she borrowed / gave me a hoodie so I don't get cold on my way home. Was really nice of her. :)

I am a  young black man who grew up around biracial girls (black and white parents). Wether it was in my family (cousins ) or friends/classmates at school . And generally when discussing with them , I see a common pattern in their criterias : They only want white men. I am not saying it is bad , as long these guys love them ...and here lies the problem . They chase men that are little interested in them despite many fellow black boys expressing concrete interest in them . When I asked them why don't give a chance to these ones , they tell me they are not interested in black guys at all . When I replied that they are black like them so why not try , they answered me that sharing the same  skin doesn't mean black men are entitled to them . I even have an older cousin that even told me she is really frustrated to only attract black boys . Another classmate told me she find black men unattractive .  When I look in the media , I don't see many biracial women (caucasian/black) with black men neither(unless he has a lot of money) . 

So I want to know what can be the reasons of such a disgust for black men according to you .Or Is it the fault of the media. Or if in real life many biracial women of this mixity avoid us. Or if i am wrong , if it changes from one country to another .
