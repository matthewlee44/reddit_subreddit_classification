I recently went on three dates with a lady that I thought was going awesome. She ultimately came to the conclusion that she wasn't ready to date and was still struggling with her past divorce. It was one of those classic ""it's not you it's me"" cases. Having been absolutely crushed by hearing this, my emotional tank and self esteem are on empty.

&amp;#x200B;

Well taking a break from these abs sounds like it might be some thing I should do, I can't help but think that doing so would be a failure on my end. I've been going on tons of dates on and off for years but I can't seem to get past two or three dates with anyone. No matter what I do, it always ends up the same way and I feel like taking a break is just admitting defeat that I will never find someone. Because if you aren't putting yourself out there and trying, you're never going to meet anyone. So it becomes this strange catch 22.

&amp;#x200B;

It doesn't help that I've grown rather desperate at my age as I have never had a serious relationship in my life. I have Asperger syndrome so the stuff is naturally a little more difficult for me. I also spent most of my 20s in a professional band that did a lot of travel while also working full-time in the tech industry. I was gone so much with that band that I actually was unable to maintain any friendships outside of the people I was playing with so truly dating would not have been some thing that I could've dedicated the time to. I also did a lot of mental health treatment at that same time as I needed to learn how to deal with my emotional regulation and just how to handle some of my autism. Reddit has assured me over and over again that having no significant relationship experience at this age is a red flag. And I don't know how to necessarily undo that other than explain my situation.

&amp;#x200B;

Since all of the travel has stopped for that group, I have been hitting the apps as hard as I possibly can and going on as many days as I possibly can. I usually average about a date a week when I'm really trying and have no issue making conversation. Just for one reason or another, it's not a good fit or I get ghosted. Then I sit there and beat myself up as to what I did wrong for them to reject me this time. I will admit that my hair is starting to thin out and that I am 5' 5"" which I realize both of those will dock you some serious points. I'm also not super fit but I'm definitely not obese.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm still able to get a fair amount of matches and start conversations, but I find myself literally just staring at my phone now waiting for matches to message me back and being terrified that they won't. I feel so pathetic that my life has gotten to this point. I work from home and my gigs have slowed way down so I have tons of downtime now to just sit at home and wait for something to happen. I sit and I wonder why people can't just get back to me in a timely fashion instead of sending a few messages every day. Maybe it's because I have so much free time it's no trouble to just message someone back. But I get caught in this weird mindset that everyone else should be able to just reply without delay as well.

&amp;#x200B;

The point of all of this is that I'm not sure what to do anymore. I probably need a break, but that's just kicking the can further down the road here. Hinge has started to recycle people that show up in my queue so clearly I'm starting to run out of people. And 33 and I feel like the best years of my life have vanished by without a partner and I have become just a left over in the dating pool that no one else has ever wanted and that will scare away everybody else. It's such a demoralizing and defeating reality that I have to accept I guess. I've watched my friends get married and have kids while I fret over if someone will even get back to me on a dating app let alone give me the opportunity to even ask them out. And then when I do go out, I can't even get them to see me a second time. I see a therapist weekly and am medicated and it does help. It helps me cope but it doesn't necessarily change my situation or fix the problem. I don't know what to do anymore, I feel so alone, I feel like a failure, I feel like this will never change, and I feel like I've run out of options and time.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1132027,public,self,When taking a break feels like failure....,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r7p1ln/when_taking_a_break_feels_like_failure/,no_ads,0,,,

Before dating this guy, I was in a long-term relationship (my only relationship) that moved very fast. This guy is very much the exact opposite from that &amp; I wanna know if I’m really getting mixed signals (red flag) or if this is normal. I’d really appreciate your opinion, I know people on the outside can have a clearer understanding of what’s happening than someone emotionally involved.

Here’s what our dating has been like:

We meet regularly (once a week) and usually set up a next date at the end of the night. He never texts / FaceTimes me in between. If I do text first, he usually responds right away but conversations don’t really start. So I end up not having any real contact with him other once a week.

When we’re on dates, we have fun but he almost never holds my hand and on some dates we don’t kiss. At the end of the night, he says he had fun and unless we already have something planned, he makes new plans. Even if his plans are his suggestion to begin with or if he agreed to plans I suggested, sometimes I get the feeling that he’s iffy about actually having the date. But when I meet him for the date, he’s fine and enthusiastic and everything so idk if I’m being paranoid. 

We’ve already had sex a few times but it never feels like I’m allowed to spend any time with him afterwards. So, no cuddling or anything, and definitely no spending the night. Our first time, I almost felt kicked out because it felt like he really wanted me to leave. 

When I recently asked him what we are because he himself said we’ve been dating for a while, he said we’re kind of in a relationship but not really. When I asked if can see it turn to a relationship, he looked flustered and said maybe. Despite that, he wants to meet my family soon, during Christmas (he moved to my area a few months ago and doesn’t have family here). He has a lot of friends here and I haven’t met them yet. 

Personally, I really like having labels on relationships. While I don’t mind a slower pace, I mind it if we’re not talking between dates and I feel like I’m getting mixed signals. I’ve been anxious that I’m being led on or that there’s something there I can’t see. That’s the feeling I hate most in the world, feeling like there’s something I’m not able to clearly see even though it’s right there. It’s also made talking with my friends awkward because they’ve been referring to him as my boyfriend and I always insist I wouldn’t go that far. While I’d like to use that label myself, I don’t feel like I’m actually allowed to and that it’s not accurate. But how do I explain that he’s gonna meet my family for Christmas but is not my boyfriend?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1132033,public,self,Is this guy leading me on?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r7pmpe/is_this_guy_leading_me_on/,no_ads,0,,,

I have been introduced to some of his friends - I did an outing with them and then he slept at my place after. We texted a little bit throughout the day. We discussed having not slept with other people since we got together but it was more in the context of STIs and it wasn’t as much of an exclusivity/relationship chat. 

Now that university exams are coming up, he’s expressed not wanting to hangout until exams are done (about 1 week from now for him and a week and a half from now for me). We will both be around for about a week after this time before leaving for a 3 week holiday break. I asked him to go to eat this weekend, and that when he said he wanted to wait a bit first. He seemed enthusiastic about wanting to do something after exams.

So I got sexually assaulted when I first moved to a city, by someone who was disgusting. Half of it was she didn’t have good hygiene. I was drunk and I had already told her I didn’t want to. Anyways after that I met someone else. This person and I tried having sex a few times over the course of months but I couldn’t get it up ever- because I was kinda stressed after the incident. We lost contact because of the pandemic and  would text every so often, but it honestly haunted me for so long. I wish I had met this person later and not when I was trying to fix my problems by dating heavily. 

Recently, I got dumped by my ex gf, (not for sex reasons) and I hopped on hinge. I met this new woman and we connected sexually and personality wise.  


However, I had also made a date with my FWB from so long ago, and we also had sex. It was such a relief to show her that it wasn’t her fault, that my dick worked, that I wasn’t damaged irreparably. We actually had amazing sex and I was honestly so grateful she gave me this chance- I’ve been on cloud 9 since, as it was one of my biggest regrets that my body didn’t work how I wanted it to. 

But, she lives far away, I doubt she would want a relationship with me other than sex or the occasional drink! We are pretty different. We don’t text often. I think she’s way more mature than me and she’s wayyy smarter than me.

I need help navigating this. I just got dumped by someone two weeks ago (after a five month relationship) so I know the smart thing would be to remain single. I wasn’t planning on jumping into a relationship. 

But this new girl seems so into me! We have only had one date and we are going to hang out this weekend. I might also still be in relationship mode, but so is she! 

I think I need to tell the new girl: I want to take things slow. How do I tell her this without scaring her off? I wasn’t mining for diamonds when I was on these dating apps and the first girl I meet up with winds up being amazing. I don’t wanna be like, hey, give me two more weeks and I’ll be good? Or should I do that? 

And I honestly would not mind having sex with the FWB again- she said next week haha! She is a very sexually active person who I imagine has a lot of people she can have sex with- she may judge me for being a serial dater though. I don’t want to break things off so soon after having sex with her for the first time. I don’t want her to be hurt or for her to judge me because I really value her opinions.

I had been through a very tumultuous year with my ex-partner and I felt completely deflated. She managed to perk me up and really made me see the world anew. We flirted and eventually we had this on/off intimate 'thing'. Which I had hoped would have moved onto something more. It did not. 

She has no interest in relationships due to past history which I can understand completely, I've been there too. Although she says she does have romantic feelings for me, she doesn't want to act on them and rather would prefer to stay friends.

Later that week she asked me out on a date and even kissed me at the end of it. Couple days later she even introduced me to her friends.

Then we went on another date which also went great and on this date she told me she liked me very much and that feeling was reciprocated from my part.

Another few days go by and she introduces me to the rest of her friends. Now I have to admit this day didn't exactly go well and there wes some awkwardness in the air but nothing serious. She was also being kind of distant this whole time, which kinda threw me off. 

The next day she doesn't text me. I wait until evening to ask if everything's okay and if I did something wrong, to which she responds that everything's fine and she was just in a bad mood that day and didn't want me to feel that. I try to continue the convo but I could tell she wasn't really into it so I stopped.

The next day same thing happens and we get into a little argument. I apologize to her the next day and that's it. She hasn't said a word to me since then and it's been 3 days now. 

What do I do? Why is she acting like this all of a sudden? How can you go from liking someone, flirting and texting with them non-stop, to this?

We actually met for the first time in a relatively unconventional first date. We went plant shopping. Then went out to get some food. We both expressed that we are getting into plants lately so wanted to change it up a bit. I really liked that it wasn’t just a boring and typical date. After dinner, I walked her to her car and gave her a kiss. We ended up making out for about 20 mins and hugging. We really caught a vibe and ended up seeing each other the next day as she came to my place. We started watching a movie/ kissing and then one thing went to another and ended up having sex a couple times. It was a pretty even split on the initiation part. It just seemed really simple and like neither of us was really overthinking anything. We’ve talked every day since and are seeing each other again this weekend. I guess I’m just not used to things going so smoothly and wondering when shit is gonna hit the fan. I don’t know how to wrap my head around it.

Every time I Google for advice I only find topics where men are being too physical and pushing boundaries.

I (28M) went on a date with a woman (25F) after matching on an app. We had lunch, it went amazing, great chemistry and conversation, and she offered to walk around to just talk. What I thought would be an hour or two turned into four hours. We were literally sitting in the cold just talking and at times she looked like she was going to explode with happiness while we talked. I'm not even joking, it's like she had to suppress herself physically sometimes cause she was going to explode haha.

We hugged a bunch throughout the date. Arm around my waist, leaning into me when laughing, hugging me because I was shivering (I didn't realize we would be outside so long and came unprepared), linking arms when walking, no kiss at the end though (It didn't feel like she wanted one, but I kissed her on the cheek and gave her a hug and she seemed happy and was insistent we see each other again). I think she touched me (and I reciprocated) more than my last 5 dates combined....and then multiply that a few times. She even texted later with an idea for our next date later that day which we will be doing this weekend.

I've never had this before. I don't have much relationship experience, but the few recent dates I've been on recently have been nothing like this. The women are nice (sometimes not), but nothing felt natural and I had to do all the work.

But my buddy said anyone who is that affectionate/happy upon just meeting someone new is a red flag, and imagine how she is on all her first dates. She also admits to being a bad texter and her replies (while lengthy) take a day (sometimes two) which have always been a bad sign in my previous dating experiences.

I'm just a little lost. I'm not sure if I have a problem or not. I'm a bit reserved with my emotions, so this date was completely out of my element but I really liked it.

When I (21F now) was younger, I’d get so much anxiety (even nightmares) over it because I though I did something so awful.

Felt like I had to heavily improve myself as a person, but didn’t know how because these ppl wouldn’t tell me, they’d just leave. It would be very random too. Years of friendships down the drain. Would it be silly to say being ghosted was traumatic? 

Looking back I realize that I was a bit of a weird kid but so was everyone else. Funny thing is the people who ghosted me back then, have tried reaching out several times. I see their notifs but don’t even bother checking their messages. Not sure why this is starting to happen more frequently. Yeah we were young. Petty much? Not even. I learned that ghosting meant they didn’t want anything to do with you, so I trained myself mentally to make that feeling mutual. For every moment- once that feeling was there, there was no turning back. I simply didn’t care anymore. 

Ngl I do hate the fact that I became the person who ghosts a lot, especially to those I know who actually cares about me. Therapist say it is a trauma response to *avoid* being ghosted. To think of it, I haven’t been ghosted by anyone since I was younger.

Went on the apps after and my history so far has been..


- Went out with a girl 5 times. Were hooking up but I didnt pursue a relationship.

- Went out once with a girl. No chemistry, mutually ghosted after no big deal.


- Went out with a girl 5 times, were hooking up, but then I met a girl I really liked...


- Went out 5 times with this girl. First 2 dates are excellent, and I thought a relationship was inevitable at that time. She kept mentioning her ex BFs and its started making me uncomfortable. And she continued doing it and we failed to escalate physically. So I told her we should take a break until she resolved her issues with her ex. She flipped out over text, asking for another chance. Explained her ex BFs were ""depressed alcoholics"" and shes not used to ""emotionally available mature men"". I felt bad so I have her another chance. After we went out one more time she texted me like ""you're such a nice and great guy but let's be friends hee-hee""


- Move on to the next girl. She was very shy and introverted. First date was okay. We tried to set up a 2nd but things kept coming up so I just gave up.


- Moved on again 2 weeks ago. Had a nice lunch and she texted right after asking to go out again. It's been 2 weeks since we went out, due to thanksgiving and work schedules. Texting has dried up. She always responds but never initiates. I can see shes active on our dating app likely talking to other guys. Supposed to out Friday  night but I have a feeling she will cancel.

We text prior to dating for almost two months, I had covid.  She works night shift.  I was still fatigued while dating her.

On the first date we hugged and I gave her a compliment.  It went great and lasted about an hour and a half playing a gaming activity and she had to go to work after.  We mainly talked about a few things like (How far is she from here, why she chose her particular travel, and where we were both born) those were the main topics, while the rest was just on our gaming activity.  We hugged and I attempt to go for a quick kiss, but she turned her head and I got the cheek.  She texted me a few hours saying she wanted to see me again that weekend with hearty eyes emoji. She's an introvert, catholic school girl, mature 29 year old girl and I'm 30m.  She didn't flirt but mainly smiled.  I too didn't really get flirty/physical, only hug and touch her on the shoulder on all three dates.  I did pick her up for a photo on the first date.

On the second date, we met, hugged, and she wanted to pay for everything (which I told her, no that's fine, I got this) and played a few arcades (the main topic was when was the last time you been to the arcades) (mainly watching each other playing games and trying to match/beat score) we ended up leaving after an hour and went bowling, shared a drink together on the 2-hour mark, (main topic why I choose a particular job &amp; last time I went bowling story) as we were leaving, she tossed me a sexual innuendo which I just smiled and nod.   During the 3rd-hour mark, we played pool and we were doing badly, during the middle of the game she started looking at her nails, flicking them, and eventually said she was tired and wanted to go home after I hit the last ball.  I walked her to her car, hugged her and she left.  (I didn't compliment her at all that night) I texted her to make sure she got home safe and she texted me back two days later saying she was busy but wanted to take the time to respond to me and said she had fun and is done for another date.  We scheduled for that following Friday, but she ends up canceling at the last hour (due to work) and apologized and wanted to reschedule.  I said no problem.  After a week of not hearing from her, I sent her a funny image which she laughed at and told me that she was available next weekend.

On the day of the date, we decided to play mini-golf and she said we can grab drinks since she'll be free the entire night from work after our game she cares for me and sent a kissy emoji.

On the third date, we hugged and talked briefly about the event that took place.  We started playing and I said a short story, asked her if she had a sibling and she kinda released a sighing sound and said yeah, a sister which I avoided that topic and we continued playing.  We then cheered each other on as we played and the other topic I pulled up was regarding a neat event, which she liked which I followed by what kind of music she's into, which she said ""anything"" and I said anything in particular and she said ""anything I can hum to"" so I said ""interesting, your turn to hit the ball.""  So we just continued playing and cheering each other on all the way until we finished.  As we put our clubs away, she said how about we play a few arcades, which we did and after a few games, I said, ""how about we grab those drinks"" she said ""I'm actually kinda tired"", so I said ok? sure.  So as we walked out I asked how about I come over to your place which she said ""what? noo"" so we walked to her car and we hugged and she said bye.  I was confused as to why she wanted to leave only after one game (1hour and half play) when we had plans to grab drinks and chat.  

So I texted her that I had a fun time (really it could of been better, being optimistic)... after 5 days I texted her for another date to grab drinks so we can focus more on us and not playing activity games ... 3 days later I explained what I wanted to do (in a very huge paragraph saying I was explaining about being mindful of physical and personal boundaries wanting to know about lifting them and about what direction we wanted and I needed feedback to see if this can actually grow to something and I also told her I hope she didn't take the request I asked about going to her place the wrong way, saying get your head out the gutter smiley face (because I truly wanted us to chat because we didn't really talk much that night).

A few days go by and I asked her if everything is ok?  Which I tend to say I hope you're not wanting to throw these past few months away.
Which then I posted a funny ghosting image of a food commercial and said I hope you'll reconsider and talk about where things went wrong.

A few days go by and I started to mention what things might have gone wrong (asking a to go to her place and making it clear it wasn't for sex because I thought she was thinking I was a fuckboy when I am looking for a long term) and that I hope she'll reconsider and sorry if I hurt her in any way with that reference.

A couple of days go by and I sent her a heart emoji...

The next night she finally replies saying ""I didn't realize my last message didn't go through.  I did have a good time with you, but I don't feel in the right headspace for a romantic relationship right now.  I've been kinda stressed the past couple of weeks and I know you deserve someone who will communicate much more regularly than I could.  I did enjoy spending time with you thought.  I really did.""

My bf is 22M. We’ve been together for 3 years.

My boyfriend and I were hanging out on FaceTime for about 3 hours watching tv and chilling.

We usually get to hang out in person about three times a week. We will FaceTime and hang out if we hadn’t seen each other for a few days. 

Today was one of those days. We weren’t going to see each other for 3 days so we both had been saying since the morning that we were going to FaceTime later tonight.

As we’re chilling, he says to me, “I’m going to go play some games.”

I was confused because we were in the middle of hanging out. Usually the nights we hangout on FaceTime, we’ll chill and then fall asleep together on the phone. 

I said, “That hurts my feelings. I was having fun hanging with you. It feels like you’re trying to rush out of hanging out with me.”

He didn’t acknowledge my feelings. Instead he said, “If I didn’t want to hangout I wouldn’t have sat here for 3 hours. How is it rushing out? I just hung out with you for 3 hours.”

That made me feel like he was pretty much saying, “I’ve spent enough time with you now. I’m going to go back and game.”

The reason he wanted to game, he told me, was that he “just wanted to go play his game, relax and chill before bed” and that tomorrow he’s planning on doing homework so he won’t have any time to play.

This made me feel so many things…

First, I thought we WERE relaxing and chilling before bed. 

Second, most nights he will stay up until AT LEAST 3am gaming. He usually wakes up around 11am. THEREFORE, even if he did do homework for 8 hours straight he would still have at least 8 hours to game, which is plenty.

And third, gaming will always be there. He has hundreds of hours logged on his games and he doesn’t want to spend the rest of the night with me? What the heck :/

After that he started getting really upset. He was being short and told me, “nothing is ever enough.” When I was literally just trying to express my feelings, in a regular tone of voice, which I told him.

He abruptly ended the conversation bu saying he had to use the bathroom. 

I don’t know how to deal with this. I was being calm and trying to express my feelings. 

I was taking into consideration that he likes to game. I knew that the past week he’s played a lot so I didn’t think that hanging out with his girlfriend tonight would be a big deal.

PLEASE somebody respond and give their opinion or advice because I really could use it. I don’t know if I’m over reacting or if my feelings are valid. He made me feel like what I was saying was overreacting.

I also learned how to listen to my intuition very well. I try to understand why people feel certain things and it bothers me when I cannot figure it out.

I don’t think I purposely try to orbit her. Honestly I’m not sure if I even do. I get overwhelmed with snaps on Snapchat and so I do not open them. On Snapchat I purposely do not watch her story when I have not opened her snap. I don’t want to hurt her feelings. I don’t want to make her feel like I have options and more that she is the one. I also did not know that orbiting was a thing until before I started writing this post. I feel like she knows I’m doing that on purpose but for the wrong reason, like as if I’m reverse orbiting?? Really she just makes me anxious, so it’s hard to respond for some reason. Although we are fine in person.

Let me give some background. Last year around this time, we would hang nearly everyday. Remind you this is when covid booming so we had online school which meant we could hangout all the time. We always hung out with her best friend and my best friend, although they did not get along like we did (still did but the sparkle wasn’t there). Well, at first we had a third dude me and my bf were also bf with him. He left, tbh he really just did not like the vibe. Nor did I, but I really like the girl so I stayed in. As for the first friend I mentioned, I’m thinking he could not sense any type of anything in the air. If you catch my drift.

The four of us had the best time of our lives and we laughed harder together than we have ever before, honestly. That kinda doesn’t make sense, I’m saying that the hardest we laugh in our lives is when we were in the car with each other. We all nearly said the same thing “I never laughed harder,” except not we all, just me and the girl I liked said that. Her bf and my bf agreed but didn’t restate. It all seemed really genuine at the time. We had a true connection, the one where the person pops into your brain and vise versa Bc you are thinking about one another.

This girl would slide up on my story; picture of my dog or something that I thought was funny. She would say “aww I love Sunshine, she so cute” or make a joke to go with my joke. I would try to carry on the conversation, I thought she was showing interest. I never really knew what to say to her comments for some reason. I’m always really calm, but she made me anxious, a feeling I never really feel. Started to type out how I don’t get nervous or anxious, deleted it Bc I do, but the difference is I never had problems convincing someone that I was calmer than I was. I have a picture of me smiling while my leg is snapped, my friends were there. It didn’t hurt Bc adrenaline and what not, but the feeling of I may not be able to walk for a long time and I just ruined everyone’s day with how fast it went from 55-100 (tbf it wasn’t 0 lol) set in as soon as I saw my leg. Didn’t cry when Sunshine died (emotions were let out in other ways however lol but that’s another story) also I don’t scream or jump when someone try’s to scare me. Do not get me wrong I cry and do let people know the way I feeling, whether I’m happy sad mad disgusted whatever. But not when it doesn’t feel right. My perception of when it “feels right” may be off.  Well it probably is after what I just said about the emotions I “don’t feel” at times, about 11 lines up^^. Now that I’m typing this I see something is wrong here 🤔. 

THE POINT I’m getting at is that I feel and think she finds confidence in not responding/ending the convo early/ knowing I don’t know what to say Bc my of bitmoji and how it pauses typing when I pause to think about what I type. I honestly could be very totally wrong, but what I imagine is that she feels good Bc she is the only girl to make me feel that way, when really she kinda caters the game to her. At the same time she is the only girl that had me thinking about her before going to sleep, so she is right in a way, but not. It’s like set up. She says things that leaves me nothing to grab. At times she does slide up with some more meat to bite at but I just can’t formulate what to say or maybe I am able to think, but I second guess myself when I type that first thought. With anyone I usually just write my first reaction to the text. imo its the most genuine thing i can say since I'm not thinking about what it means or how the person feels when they read it; so much so that I change what I say Bc of thinking those things. I do do that with her. I overthink about girls after or maybe during I talk to them, but not in a way that they noticed. But for some reason it’s like she’s in my head and she can tell I’m overthinking even when there is no reason to think that whatsoever. I cant be genuine with HER. The next thing I’m gonna talk about is like when someone makes a bad joke and you acknowledge it Bc you trust each other but a less of a friend you would blurs out a fake laugh. Well I have said “yea she’s the best” when shes slides up talking about my dog with no substance and not like what I would usually disingenuously say “yea she never not smiling and shedding”. It’s not disingenuous Bc Sunshine didnt do that, she did, a lot lol. It’s just not what I care to say, just what I think she’ll respond to maybe. I want to keep the conversation going but at the same it’s almost draining to respond to small ass talk like that over and over. When I say “yea she’s the best” it is really a genuine response when she thinks it’s not. She doesn’t respond, then does 5 days later. I can only do it for like a day and then I respond. But that’s because I’m not on snap chat for a day. I don’t do it on purpose, like to get a message across. That’s what it seems like she’s trying to do anyways. She snaps dudes who have a girlfriend or dudes she is just friends with, back and forth constantly. So it makes me think she’s not responding for a purpose bc I’m the only one that I know of she does it to. The fact I can’t figure it out pains me. THAT IS WHAT I came to here for. To hear y’all’s thoughts, see if y’all can guide me and shi, anything would be awesome.

More details: I know she is not good for me so I did not talk to her for a really long time, I always respond to her snaps but am not bothered she doesn’t respond just agitated that she snaps once and then doesn’t. Just like how everybody else on snap DOES NOT DO THAT. It would be fine if everyone did it or if she did it to everyone but she doesn’t. It stresses me out I don’t know why. Also she tried to pepper my best friend with compliments and she would snap him all the time but not me. I think she wanted me to show some care for her. I did not lol. You may ask why? I thought about it. Getting mad at someone or disliking someone is showing you cared for them at a point. I did not think she deserved that and tbh I also thought it may get me something if I completely turned off. Turns out it does, she still try’s to snap me every once in a while. We never really went far, we’ve never hung out alone although I had asked but she had a bullshit reason. That’s when I kinda stopped it. Then she would asked me to hangout again. I did, but slowly every single time I did I lost interest and talked about the stuff we didn’t talk about before, purposely keeping the convo dry. ACTUALLY, I had broken my phone’s camera over the summer, it looks shaky. On thanksgiving I took a picture of my food “before and after” and she slid up and said “the camera quality 😍” the emoji is specific but I really don’t remember, def something like that though. Instead of being genuine or disingenuously nice/funny, I was disingenuously unfunny lol. I said “Isn’t it incredible ❗️” not much but honest work. Here’s why, tbh I coulda said a lot more things, but I chose the (hopefully it came across like this) weird obvious sarcastic joke with wrong punctuation. (Wrong punctuation isn’t necessarily a regular thing it just felt nice to half ass the emoji, this girl is super sensitive I know she thinks about things a lot too. I think it poked a button that she didn’t know was there) She was snapping me a lot before this of her smiling and having fun, she then slid up and said that^^. She did not respond, usually she responds to chats, but j not snaps. Basically I’m saying I think it worked, I made it weird, awkward and unfunny. On a real note she made me the most down and confused I ever been, I never felt validated for my emotions since she didn’t want a relationship/ didn’t like me. Usually I can use critical thinking and figure out why shit is, but I couldn’t and that fucking sucked. As well as my friend not talking to me for a long time with reason that I didn’t know but now I’m typing this is that it may be Bc I got competitive with him over the girl, which I can not believe. He never tried to make a move and I believed he wouldn’t but it was just that itch and I think subtly I was angry at him; angry or upset at/with him when I though I wasn’t

Also this is a girl that I always had vague bad vibe in the back of my mind. I like her a lot but dislike a ton at the same time. It’s like herself can be described as people who fall into gambling, losing money but coming back for more. I forgot to mention but she definitely is the most pretty girl in my grade. Her friend group is toxic, that’s another reason why, but anyway they did this survey and the hottest or prettiest or something was her, along with all other good categories. It made me think about the “why me?”, tbf is a me problem, but is it really?
I notice that in her posts her friend doesn’t look great and when he friends post the girl doesn’t look great either, yet they say they are best friends. I think they compete with each other hard core. Maybe that’s harsh to say “not great” but just a bad picture of them.

So I am pretty new to the whole online dating scene. I am 30, and i've been talking to this girl from hinge (25), for about a month now. Things went well in the beginning, and we were supposed to meet up. The day we were first supposed to meet up, she said she thought she was getting sick, and wasn't feeling well. However she wanted to reschedule. During the week she told me she broke out in hives, and even sent me a video showing me on her body. On the day of our 2nd meetup, she ended up bailing again. She was very apologetic, asked to reschedule again, and even offered to drive out to the area i live in (but i kept the meetup spot the same). During the week leading up to the 3rd time we were supposed to meet, she messaged me saying ""Remember when I told you I broke out in hives? I dont think they are hives, because my friend I hung out with also caught it"". Then on the date of the 3rd attempt to meet up, she texted me saying she was going through something she couldn't put into words, and would not be able to meet up. She understood if I never wanted to talk to her again. I didn't blow her off or anything like that, and responded kindly. I let her know I'd still be down to meet, and we can take it slow. Maybe a mistake on my end? We kept in touch, nothing crazy. Had a few phone chats, and facetimes. Didn't make plans with her because of a natural disaster that effected us where we live. This week she told me her skin condition got worse, and spread to other parts of her body. She saw a doctor virtually today, but hasn't told me what they said. I'm basically assuming (it's probably obvious), that she didnt want to meet up before due to this skin condition she developed?

I would say I used to be introverted but now I am more extroverted. So, I really enjoyed swimming since when I was little and due to covid last year, I gained a bit of weight. So, I thought it would be a good idea to start going back to the pool and it was a great decision and I realized that I really missed enjoying swimming. For the last 6 months, I have been going to swimming pools and not always the same location because I wanted to meet new people. The place I'm going to now is a bit on the expensive side and the people who go there are usually older than me (35-50). They wouldn't swim that much but really enjoys hitting the sauna as it is free included in the swimming pool. I guess this is the little background I set up. 

Here comes the juice, so I usually go to the pool 5,6 times a week and I would talk with the older people in the sauna and they know each other really well. Lately, this pretty girl (myage23) would start coming to the pool almost the same hours as me and she would always come by herself alone, not with friends. She doesn't come as often as I do but she does come from time to time. She would mainly hit the sauna though and I mainly swim a lot and we recognize each other as the girl or boy who comes along alone and does their stuff.  

I would sometimes go to the sauna and she would be there but remember there are like 7-8 other people in the sauna as well. Even though she is in there I would still talk to the older people as I would if she wasn't there but she doesn't really get involved in the conversation. I would hope that she would add something in the conversation so I can ask her name and introduce myself right but she doesn't really get involved in the conversation at all. So it backfires. This happens multiple times, hoping she would talk and she just won't. During this whole time, I don't know her name or anything. I started to regret how I should have just approached and talked to her when I saw her the first time and since I didn't then things got awkward between us. 

But then I got a signal when I finished changing into outdoor clothes and went to get my winter jacket. We come face to face because men and female jackets are stored in the same locker. I however decided to say nothing because I thought it would be awkward to introduce myself as we are leaving the pool. I would get my jacket and move out the way for her to get the jacket. Man, I was nervous as hell and I wanted to just put on my jacket asap and get out asap. I had a moment where I had to throw go and put my slippers back to the desk as I borrowed and before I knew it she was gone. She was gone so fast I was like damn she felt the same way as I did. That's when I realized she might be into me and I don't mind if she isn't into me that much but just a little bit was what gave me the power to do the next thing. 

So yesterday, I came to the pool earlier than usual and the pool was almost empty and she was there in the sauna. I thought today's the only chance I will get to meet her I must not fuck it up. So I just did my usual early warmup swims (since I just can't go straight to her and introduce myself) and head to the sauna where she was. It was the first time we were on 1 on 1 alone in the sauna and there was a bit of silence but I introduced myself to her and she did as well. She seemed to be happy I introduced myself to her, at least that's what I felt when I saw her facial expression. We talked about what we do and we both study, a little bit of work and swimming. I asked her to want to go for a swim and she agreed we went to the pool and I will be honest I was awkward. I started to act as if I'm sort of an instructor, I don't know why I was so nervous. We swam a few times and she doesn't swim a lot so she went back to the sauna but she spends time looking at her phone in the sauna as well. I swam a few times went back to the sauna but then there were the older people there so we didn't get to interact as much. We did get one more chance to be 1 on 1 in the sauna we talked about how she is studying as a medical and I added with I wanted to go medicine as a kid but didn't cuz I was or someshit. I am so dumb should have talked about what are you doing after this or at least ask her Instagram I don't know something other than that stupid medical story. It ended with her saying I'm going out as she was closing the sauna door and I managed to say goodbye. Now I don't when she will come to the pool next time. 

I am planning to go to the pool tonight and I think it is likely she might be there maybe not. I need help with what to do the next time I meet her? I just get super nervous around her.

When we split I was pretty busted up and to be honest I’m not sure how I feel about her now. For what it’s worth a lot of my friends and family think that getting back together with her would be a bad idea. 

To further complicate my situation 😅, I’ve recently started dating a new girl who seems pretty cool, but once again, I’m not so great at understanding my feelings so I also don’t know how I feel about her.
I really don’t want to be a dick and string people along, but I’m terrible at making these sorts of decisions. 

I was pretty busted up when my ex and I split and I really don’t want to get hurt again, part of the reason we broke up was that she’s big and hasn’t really explored that part of herself, I’m not really that keen on the idea of being in any sort of open relationship.

I've been told I'm funny and cute, I have a beard,  and people have told me I have a really deep voice, but I have a baby face. I'm not listing these as merits, just to best understand what to do from here because they might matter. 

Here at college, I don't know where to start with talking to women. I get the impression that they don't want to talk beyond being friends. And it generally seems hard to ""get to know people"" here like in my old town. I can't show my best qualities if people don't want to see them. 

Feeling adequate in a romantic way is a huge deal in America, our culture is obsessed with the rituals of dating, and many parts of the world, like Germany, just focus on serious love, not a dynamic game. Dating is commercialized here, so it's difficult to feel happy any time after 12 if you aren't in some kind of relationship most of your teen/adult life.  So I feel pretty bad, as I have for a long time.

 No one wants to feel subhuman and not date like everyone else, so I need to have some kind of outlook as a 5'7 guy that wants to date at some point. It's basically a hard and fast rule that if the guy is shorter than the girl, that's a no-go. Fair enough. What if the guy is still short for a guy-5'7- and a girl is 5'7, 5'6, 5'5, down to 5'0.

So this week in honor of sappy Hallmark movie month I decided to write all week about online dating. 
I wrote about how not to get catfished, I wrote about how men can improve their online profiles and today I have to ask if anyone else is confused about this online dating thing?

So I've been on and off these dating sites the last eight years and I still scratch my head and think Wtf? I don't get it, seriously.
And before the men come at me, no, I don't know what women do when online dating. I only know what I experienced and I haven't jumped that fence at least not yet but the way it's going I might see if the grass is greener on the other side.

So let's start with, why do men say they want a relationship in their profiles and then send you a dick pic from jump? Please just be honest, can anyone do that anymore? 
There are many women that are just looking for a hookup or Fwb so just say that and let the rest of us swipe left.

Or you start talking to someone and you think you have a connection and poof they ghost you. Why would you not tell them you're not feeling it, you are dating others, whatever it is but why just ghost them leaving them thinking wtf?
We ask ourselves, did we say something? What was it? They texted you every morning and night then nothing?

 And then so many men talk about women and our issues. Well many wouldn't have issues if you didn't pull shit like this! 
Be honest, we are big girls, we can handle it. Just let us know the truth. 

Why are there so many catfish? 
Do you not have a life? Is this your job to get women to fall for you and then send you money? 
Look, I own a business, I do a side hustle, I own and take care of my own home, I have 2 girls, I have friends, I have no time for foolishness. I got no time for games, so I will not entertain stupid. I have learned to spot a catfish from across the lake but it still leaves me with the question why? 

Is there anyone out there that is looking for love? I seriously doubt it anymore, maybe there are too many options. It's like when you're looking for a movie and you have 160 channels and you say there is nothing on. Maybe it's like that? I don't know but sometimes dating feels like a full time job and I work hard enough already.

Couldn't there be a site that really does a background check to see if they are real, that asks all the right questions for people who are really looking for a relationship? Why waste each other's time? I'm not doing this because I'm bored, I'm doing this to hopefully meet my soulmate.

So today my friends remember we are all in this boat together. We are all fishing and we are all confused about what these fish are doing. The only advice I can give is just be honest, that always works. Have patience and have faith that your prize fish is out there somewhere, maybe stuck in the ice but the one thing all these cheesy Hallmark movies teach us is never give up, and one day you'll find your King and have your own happily ever after.

- Hinge profile with 2/3 prompts on the importance of honesty. Dated and she turned out to be secretly married.

- Someone whose profile was all about what a great communicator she was and how ghosting is evil and cowardly. I’m sure you can guess what happened there.

- My fault for giving this person a chance, but a super left-wing profile about appreciating diversity and “never kissing Tories” (Conservative Party in the UK). Went on 3 dates, became apparent she had no friends who were not super-rich, upper class and white, some were very right-wing, including her exes in the group.

I told a good friend of mine how i feel about her a couple days ago. She told me she's had the same feelings for a while and we both made it pretty clear we are interested in a relationship with each other. However she made a commitment with herself and God to remain single for a year, wich ends in about 2.5 weeks. So we agreed to both think and pray about it for a while and see where it takes us afterwards.

Now i told her this over a call, wich is really unlike me and i dont like it at all, but i'm currently in quarantaine because i have COVID and i really couldnt keep it to myself anymore. So having to wait a couple weeks atleast gives me a good chance to do something for her that shows the effort/initiative that i like to show.

She has a bowel disease that makes her extremely nauseous and sick after eating a lot of different foods. And we've talked/joked a lot lately about how much she loves chocolate milk but how its the worst trigger for her disease so she always has to consider wether the pleasure of chocolate milk outweighs the suffering it causes. So i did some research and got the following idea:

I've ordered a custom mug with a nice design with her favorite bible verse which i know means a lot to her, and wanna make a little gift bag type thing with this mug, with a recipe and all the ingredients for lactose and sugar free chocolate milk that should be a lot less painful.

During this time, I made a ton of positive changes in my life (rediscovering hobbies, reaching out to friends, getting in excellent physical shape, going to therapy, etc). This gave me a lot of confidence to tackle online dating. 
 Through Bumble, I did have a 5 month relationship which ended just before covid when she accepted a job in another state and broke up with me.  Aside from this one case where she persued me, the number of ""failed"" attempts are piling up and it's difficult to know how react. My confidence has dried up from being stuck at home and lonely for two years.  Since quarantine, I've been on ~8 dates where all either ghosted or sent these types of messages:


""I want to be honest and tell you I'm not sure I feel a strong romantic connection between us.""


""Just to be upfront and not lead you on sort of thing. You're great but I don't think I feel enough connection romantically. I'm sorry.""


""Wasn't feeling the vibe!""


""You can text anytime... But I don't know that I see this working out in a romantic sense. ""


I'm not sure how to make a connection. If I let my mind spiral and look back 4 years, the number of rejections is probably in the high 20s.

BEFORE I begin: I have three loving sisters and a loving mom that taught me to be comfortably with myself. I also learned how to listen to my intuition very well. I try to understand why people feel certain things and it bothers me when I cannot figure it out.

I don’t think I purposely try to orbit her. Honestly I’m not sure if I even do. I get overwhelmed with snaps on Snapchat and so I do not open them. On Snapchat I purposely do not watch her story when I have not opened her snap. I don’t want to hurt her feelings. I don’t want to make her feel like I have options and more that she is the one. I also did not know that orbiting was a thing until before I started writing this post. I feel like she knows I’m doing that on purpose but for the wrong reason, like as if I’m reverse orbiting?? Really she just makes me anxious, so it’s hard to respond for some reason. Although we are fine in person.

Let me give some background. Last year around this time, we would hang nearly everyday. Remind you this is when covid booming so we had online school which meant we could hangout all the time. We always hung out with her best friend and my best friend, although they did not get along like we did (still did but the sparkle wasn’t there). Well, at first we had a third dude me and my bf were also bf with him. He left, tbh he really just did not like the vibe. Nor did I, but I really like the girl so I stayed in. As for the first friend I mentioned, I’m thinking he could not sense any type of anything in the air. If you catch my drift.

The four of us had the best time of our lives and we laughed harder together than we have ever before, honestly. That kinda doesn’t make sense, I’m saying that the hardest we laugh in our lives is when we were in the car with each other. We all nearly said the same thing “I never laughed harder,” except not we all, just me and the girl I liked said that. Her bf and my bf agreed but didn’t restate. It all seemed really genuine at the time. We had a true connection, the one where the person pops into your brain and vise versa Bc you are thinking about one another.

This girl would slide up on my story; picture of my dog or something that I thought was funny. She would say “aww I love Sunshine, she so cute” or make a joke to go with my joke. I would try to carry on the conversation, I thought she was showing interest. I never really knew what to say to her comments for some reason. I’m always really calm, but she made me anxious, a feeling I never really feel. Started to type out how I don’t get nervous or anxious, deleted it Bc I do, but the difference is I never had problems convincing someone that I was calmer than I was. I have a picture of me smiling while my leg is snapped, my friends were there. It didn’t hurt Bc adrenaline and what not, but the feeling of I may not be able to walk for a long time and I just ruined everyone’s day with how fast it went from 55-100 (tbf it wasn’t 0 lol) set in as soon as I saw my leg. Didn’t cry when Sunshine died (emotions were let out in other ways however lol but that’s another story) also I don’t scream or jump when someone try’s to scare me. Do not get me wrong I cry and do let people know the way I feeling, whether I’m happy sad mad disgusted whatever. But not when it doesn’t feel right. My perception of when it “feels right” may be off.  Well it probably is after what I just said about the emotions I “don’t feel” at times, about 11 lines up^^. Now that I’m typing this I see something is wrong here 🤔. 

THE POINT I’m getting at is that I feel and think she finds confidence in not responding/ending the convo early/ knowing I don’t know what to say Bc my of bitmoji and how it pauses typing when I pause to think about what I type. I honestly could be very totally wrong, but what I imagine is that she feels good Bc she is the only girl to make me feel that way, when really she kinda caters the game to her. At the same time she is the only girl that had me thinking about her before going to sleep, so she is right in a way, but not. It’s like set up. She says things that leaves me nothing to grab. At times she does slide up with some more meat to bite at but I just can’t formulate what to say or maybe I am able to think, but I second guess myself when I type that first thought. With anyone I usually just write my first reaction to the text. imo its the most genuine thing i can say since I'm not thinking about what it means or how the person feels when they read it; so much so that I change what I say Bc of thinking those things. I do do that with her. I overthink about girls after or maybe during I talk to them, but not in a way that they noticed. But for some reason it’s like she’s in my head and she can tell I’m overthinking even when there is no reason to think that whatsoever. I cant be genuine with HER. The next thing I’m gonna talk about is like when someone makes a bad joke and you acknowledge it Bc you trust each other but a less of a friend you would blurs out a fake laugh. Well I have said “yea she’s the best” when shes slides up talking about my dog with no substance and not like what I would usually disingenuously say “yea she never not smiling and shedding”. It’s not disingenuous Bc Sunshine didnt do that, she did, a lot lol. It’s just not what I care to say, just what I think she’ll respond to maybe. I want to keep the conversation going but at the same it’s almost draining to respond to small ass talk like that over and over. When I say “yea she’s the best” it is really a genuine response when she thinks it’s not. She doesn’t respond, then does 5 days later. I can only do it for like a day and then I respond. But that’s because I’m not on snap chat for a day. I don’t do it on purpose, like to get a message across. That’s what it seems like she’s trying to do anyways. She snaps dudes who have a girlfriend or dudes she is just friends with, back and forth constantly. So it makes me think she’s not responding for a purpose bc I’m the only one that I know of she does it to. The fact I can’t figure it out pains me. THAT IS WHAT I came to here for. To hear y’all’s thoughts, see if y’all can guide me and shi, anything would be awesome.

More details: I know she is not good for me so I did not talk to her for a really long time, I always respond to her snaps but am not bothered she doesn’t respond just agitated that she snaps once and then doesn’t. Just like how everybody else on snap DOES NOT DO THAT. It would be fine if everyone did it or if she did it to everyone but she doesn’t. It stresses me out I don’t know why. Also she tried to pepper my best friend with compliments and she would snap him all the time but not me. I think she wanted me to show some care for her. I did not lol. You may ask why? I thought about it. Getting mad at someone or disliking someone is showing you cared for them at a point. I did not think she deserved that and tbh I also thought it may get me something if I completely turned off. Turns out it does, she still try’s to snap me every once in a while. We never really went far, we’ve never hung out alone although I had asked but she had a bullshit reason. That’s when I kinda stopped it. Then she would asked me to hangout again. I did, but slowly every single time I did I lost interest and talked about the stuff we didn’t talk about before, purposely keeping the convo dry. ACTUALLY, I had broken my phone’s camera over the summer, it looks shaky. On thanksgiving I took a picture of my food “before and after” and she slid up and said “the camera quality 😍” the emoji is specific but I really don’t remember, def something like that though. Instead of being genuine or disingenuously nice/funny, I was disingenuously unfunny lol. I said “Isn’t it incredible ❗️” not much but honest work. Here’s why, tbh I coulda said a lot more things, but I chose the (hopefully it came across like this) weird obvious sarcastic joke with wrong punctuation. (Wrong punctuation isn’t necessarily a regular thing it just felt nice to half ass the emoji, this girl is super sensitive I know she thinks about things a lot too. I think it poked a button that she didn’t know was there) She was snapping me a lot before this of her smiling and having fun, she then slid up and said that^^. She did not respond, usually she responds to chats, but j not snaps. Basically I’m saying I think it worked, I made it weird, awkward and unfunny. On a real note she made me the most down and confused I ever been, I never felt validated for my emotions since she didn’t want a relationship/ didn’t like me. Usually I can use critical thinking and figure out why shit is, but I couldn’t and that fucking sucked. As well as my friend not talking to me for a long time with reason that I didn’t know but now I’m typing this is that it may be Bc I got competitive with him over the girl, which I can not believe. He never tried to make a move and I believed he wouldn’t but it was just that itch and I think subtly I was angry at him; angry or upset at/with him when I though I wasn’t

Also this is a girl that I always had vague bad vibe in the back of my mind. I like her a lot but dislike a ton at the same time. It’s like herself can be described as people who fall into gambling, losing money but coming back for more. I forgot to mention but she definitely is the most pretty girl in my grade. Her friend group is toxic, that’s another reason why, but anyway they did this survey and the hottest or prettiest or something was her, along with all other good categories. It made me think about the “why me?”, tbf is a me problem, but is it really?
I notice that in her posts her friend doesn’t look great and when he friends post the girl doesn’t look great either, yet they say they are best friends. I think they compete with each other hard core. Maybe that’s harsh to say “not great” but just a bad picture of them.

We skipped the small talk and admitted that we're both hopeless romantics and enjoy sappy love stories. Very corny, but very genuine interaction. I asked her to go on a date the next Friday (today) and she accepted. She gave me her number the next day saying she wouldn't mind chatting before then and we've chatted nearly everyday on the phone since. I'm not going to lie, I was very intrigued by her after our first conversation, but I feel like I'm falling in love after our second one. I can tell that she's an incredibly wholesome person, and we've been very comfortable with being vulnerable with each other. She's a grade school teacher and tells me about how much she loves her children. She's shared numerous experiences where her impact on her students has changed their lives. Every time we got off the phone we've been saying, "" I appreciate you."" It just feels really good just to talk to her, I get this swell of joy in my chest.

I picked up my daughter from her mema's a couple weeks ago and on the way out the door I passed by the TV and the local news was on. That's when I saw her signing off. I haven't been able to get her out of my head since. 

Fast forward a few days and I'm messaging in a friend group when we get on the subject of news stations. (This is not uncommon as one of the guys works for the cute anchor's competitor) I mention cute news anchor and made a lame joke about robbing a bank just so I could meet her for an interview. Then my news friend says he saw her on ""the dating apps"" a year or so back. I've been working through a divorce for a year and a half now so dating apps are relatively new to me but I will say that here in small town USA she hasn't popped up on any of my apps. So I decide to look her up on Facebook. She has one but it's a strictly for business page and the same for her Instagram. I did find her personal Facebook page but its all locked down and mostly private no friend request option and I doubt she ever reads messages that aren't sent by friends. I don't know where to go from here and even if I did I have no clue what to say or how to say it. 

I already feel like I'm approaching creepo territory.
