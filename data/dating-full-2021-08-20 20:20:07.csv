I was having this discussion with a friend and wanted to hear some other perspectives. I recently turned 30 and also recently entered the dating world again. I didn't pursue things during the height of the pandemic and before that I was in a long term relationship. So basically the last time I dated I was 28.

I don't really date casually and I'm at a point where I'm dating exclusively with the objective of finding someone to marry. It's worth noting just for context that I'm a committed Christian and date other committed Christians so the objective of marriage in dating is the norm culturally.

I think this is a *VERY* difficult topic to study objectively since you can't have an experimental group - i.e. you can't change your ethnicity and compare your dating success as each ethnicity. Obviously there's a relationship between ones ethnicity and their looks, but there are attractive people of ALL races and ethnicities and we *all* likely wish we were a bit more attractive so once again we're back to physical appearance simply being the most important trait in dating (as we know).

In what ways do you believe your race/ethnicity has impacted your dating life, and how strongly do your believe this to be a ""causation""? 

Would you ""give up"" a certain degree of attractiveness to ""change your race"" if you could? Would you be be willing to change to any *other* race if it were guaranteed you would be more attractive (or would you be worried about trying to date as another race)? 

What racial preferences are most widespread where you live (good and bad), why do you believe these preferences exists at all?

I’m, objective speaking, an ugly guy. I’ve fully accepted it fully and it’s something I have to deal with. I do my best with my appearance but all the confidence, exercise, grooming, and stylish clothing can’t fix my face despite years of trying.

My older brother is like a better version of me. Taller, in better shape, handsome, more charismatic, just more attractive. Like I was always afraid to have any girl friends if I had a crush on them over at our house because if I had so many girl friends talk about how hot my big brother was and they’d devote all attention to him when he was around.

He’s been trying to help me with my dating life since I’ve had literally zero success with women, and recently I realized why his advice hasn’t helped me. I’ve been going about it all wrong. He would tell me that if I was in a class with a girl, I wanted to get to know just sit down next to her and talk to her. Then see if she wants to study together and invite her to the library with me that evening so we can just talk. Because this worked for him when he was in college.

I’ve tried this and it has never gone right. He’s also given me the advice that no matter what if I like a girl I know and have talked to a lot to just go up to her and tell her I like her. He said that most of the time it’ll work just because of how attractive having the confidence to do that was. That method has cost me 2 good friends and it was for me.

He recently told me that at the gym, if I see a girl who’s form isn’t great offer to help her. And that if she seems interested ask for her number, but if not just make friends with her and she’ll introduce me to other friends. 

This is when I realized he has no game. Well, he does but his game is his face. He isn’t charming he’s just hot. And his advice is bad.

Also I'm on mobile if that matters. So anyways, on to it I guess.

So, I'm an 18 year old male and am not exactly what you could call ""dating savvy"". I'm completely fine with being social with people and really do enjoy taking my time to get to know them, but am unfortunately very timid when it comes to almost anything dating related. To date, I have not initiated any kind of forward romantic gesture on my own to show my interest to a girl (not that I haven't wanted to, but I think we all understand how bad nerves can get). This is part of what led to my acceptance of online dating at the time.

It was just a bit over a year and a half ago that I was confessed to and began my first relationship with a girl, lets call her Christy, on Discord. I was still pretty cautious towards the idea of dating a person online (especially on a olatform like Discord), but I had been in the same server as Christy for a long time and got along very well with her. For the first while I was still suspicious of her identity (even if I got along with her I still had to be somewhat suspicious as you know how many Chuck's and Larry's out there pretending to be women (my apologies to anyone named Chuck or Larry who doesn't do this)), but after a while I did began to trust that she was who she said she (I know its possible to fake voices and obviously pictures, but you cannot convince that me virtually sitting in on one of her families movie nights was faked). I really did like Christy, and will admit that that probably blinded me to some things. I first began to notice that something was off when she introduced me to this other guy, lets call him Dave.

Dave was a fellow member of our Discord and I hadn't really talked to him that much, but he seemed nice enough. The three of us hanging out became something of a regular thing, and Dave became something of a buddy to me despite our age difference (Dave was in his late 20's). Everything became a bit weird though when one day, me and Dave where talking and he asked if I was dating anyone on the server. I said yes, though Christy had asked me to keep our relationship under wraps because she didn't want people in our business (looking back it was a red flag, but at the time I just didn't see it) so I didn't elaborate on who, though I did gush about how much I liked Christy (kind of embarrassing to admit, but I had fell pretty hard for her by this point). Dave was unusually pushy though, and I decided to trust him to keep it a secret as he this wasn't the first one he had kept for me. 

Unfortunately (as you could probably tell where this was going), this is where things began to fall apart. Dave had a breakdown and the truth ended up spilling that Christy had been dating both of us at the same time, though it was worse for Dave as she had him buying her things and her had been dating her for much longer than I had been. I was obviously hurt but some small part of me still wanted to believe it wasn't true, and so I confronted Christy and eventually she admitted that she had been and was working towards getting us comfortable enough with eachother so that she could introduce the idea of one of those group relationships. I was extremely hurt and tried to cut off the relationship then and there (I was sitting in my work's lobby 10 minutes before I had work when I finally found out, and just broke down crying and just had to go home). 

Later that night, Christy was still messaging me trying to get me to take her back, and I blocked her on discord while trying not to breakdown again when she messaged me through my actually number trying to get in contact with me. It eventually got to the point where she was threatening to kill herself if I wasn't going to be with her. This is where I made my biggest mistake, and took her back as a friend with the idea that maybe we could work back towards dating (I didn't want anyone hurt despite knowing how stupid the idea was). I never should have done that. Two weeks later, when I couldn't stand how toxic everything had become, I ended up leaving the server, changing my number, and reblocking her after saying my goodbyes. 

For months after I was just horribly hurt, I couldn't even think about dating without feeling sick and tired and just horrible. People would try and console me, but really nothing helped. It took me almost a year to get back to some semblance of normal, and ever since then dating has always just felt off the table and not even a consideration, despite how much I wish I had a partner I could rely on and share with. Recently however, I find myself looking at women again and just kind of wishing I could even try to initiate something. I'm just not sure I want to put myself out there and possibly subject myself to anything like that again though.

(TL;DR I got hurt deeply in my very first relationship; Should I even bother trying again?)

But I came across a peer-reviewed article saying that couples who post on social media (especially those “Pinterest” style loved-up couple photos) tend to be more satisfied and happier than those who don’t. This also includes putting your partner as a profile picture and mentioning their name in your bio.

My own relationship had its downfalls. My ex boyfriend disrespected me (didn’t even want to have s*x with me). He didn’t want to take photos with me and when he did he would smile awkwardly (wasn’t doing this in photos with his friends) and never want to share them. Obviously it wasn’t the main reason for me breaking up with him but was definitely a factor. 

Also observing my circle. Those who post on social media tend to last longer and are much more happier than those who don’t. So I believe the theory to somewhat of an extent?

I figure even if you don’t think like this yourself, you’ll still understand another man’s mindset better than a woman would.

1. Why do some men get conversationally sexual in the first 5 minutes of chatting?

I’m not able to post pictures but I’ve got tons of screenshots of guys saying hello and then asking if I like sex and what position I prefer, or telling me I’ve got great boobs, or wanting to find out if I’ll kiss/have sex on the first date, etc, in dating apps. Then when I ask them to dial it back, they talk at me like I’m a prude who doesn’t belong on dating apps and I’m taking up profile space that would be better used by a hornier woman, blahblahblah.

I get that we should seek the kinds of relationships we truly want when searching on dating sites/apps but are these guys really just that creepy and forceful/incellish, and if not, why do they think this strategy will work? Why do guys like this think this is an appropriate way to “get to know” a woman in the first five minutes? I don’t care if you want to find out if we’re sexually compatible or not. The first 5 minutes or even first few dates doesn’t feel like the time for that sort of stuff.

2. Why do some guys refuse to post photos on apps/sites that allow them to not have to post photos?

Why is it they want photos of -us- but will only share photos back once they “approve” of us and deem us worthy to have a photo? And yes, a guy straight up said this stuff to me.

3. Why do some guys complain about their exes bitterly but ditch a girl if -she- complains about -her own- ex?

A dude might talk for half an hour about how this chick had “done him wrong”, then if they ask you about your exes and you tell them how they didn’t work out or were sad, the dude will label you a “psycho with baggage who is hung up on their ex and isn’t it great how he just dodged a bullet there?”

Why do guys get to rant about their exes freely but women don’t?

4. Why do some guys treat every new woman like she’s the continuation of the last one?

Some guys talk to a woman and immediately compare everything she’s saying/said to the last failed date they had, like they’ve decided this new woman is gonna be just as awful as the last one was. If she says she and her parents didn’t/don’t get along, she’s probably just a messed up chick with a 747 passenger plane’s worth of baggage. If she says she got tired of the constant arguments with her ex and doesn’t want that anymore, the arguments were likely because she was being psycho/a controlling beeyotch/a gold digger/some other negative thing, and there’s no way it’s because her -ex- was the toxic problem.

5. Why do guys ask on the first date, “So why are you single/why did your ex leave you?”

I had a guy once phrase it this way on a date. “So why did you get divorced? What was wrong with you that made him leave you? I need to know before I decide if I want to invest anymore time and effort into you.”

Why do some dudes think, “So what was wrong with you that made him leave?” is remotely appropriate or even true? Maybe -we- left -him- because he grew bitter and antisocial and we got tired of the constant fighting? Don’t they see how grossly rude it is to come at a woman as if she’s someone else’s tossed out garbage?

I’m a betting man so if I had to, I’d bet that approach doesn’t work for them and just also it’s obvious why that’s annoying/get a bad rep)

I’m curious to why people who aren’t looking for relationships from online dating are seen as an inconvenience to the dating experience of those that are? 

Lurking across multiple dating subs I always see that typically people who may not have a bio on Tinder and Bumble or have their “looking for” setting on Bumble set to “something casual” or people who don’t really have their Hinge prompts filled out are seen as people who shouldn’t be on the app or as “time wasters” and things of that nature. So if I had to assume, it’d be that most people are on dating apps to find serious long term partners but why does it have to be seen as a bad thing if someone’s not?

Everyday dating interaction is different so  intentions can be exposed at different points of a connection/match so I definitely get why going on a few dates or texting somebody for a few weeks only to find out they only want sex or to hookup can be frustrating but is that really apart of hookup culture or just someone who can’t communicate and isn’t honest? 

If I’m off on my interpretations with this let me know because I can very well be projecting my assumptions to be the norm. I just feel like the 2 sides (those looking for relationships and those looking for sex) don’t really have to interact much at least not enough to inconvenience the other’s dating experience to the extent that",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,965909,public,self,Why does hookup culture have a bad reputation?,0,[],0.5,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p8ge5m/why_does_hookup_culture_have_a_bad_reputation/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,

We recently spent last Sunday to this recent Friday morning together. We don’t text much because we are usually together. We texted some Friday and Saturday. We planned to meet Monday.

Radio silence. Some texts go through blue, some green, and usually I’m sent right to voicemail. I’ve had a friend call as well to make sure it wasn’t just me being blocked and it isn’t. I’m confused because things were great and he was very expressive about how much he thought so. We had deep conversations on many occasions. There wasn’t an awkward moment one. But now I’m starting to think I was ghosted. He does have family issues, starting a business, finding a new place, caring for himself mentally, etc. Could it be chalked up to being busy?

We agreed to continue as something serious and that we were dating exclusively the last day we saw each other. There were no indications that this would happen so suddenly.

It is so intense that I honestly dont expect people to believe me. I will leave the grim details out.

In short, my father worked in the army and went to three wars. He died at 60. My crush got run over by the school bus. I was living in Italy at the time. She was an Italian girl. She was in coma for a week. I dont believe in God but sometimes you dont have any option but to pray.

Its a childhood song my dad learned me. He was more of a believer than I ever was. So whenever shit hits the fan, I sing that song and pray to God. After a week of praying for her, she died.

I guess that is enough for a lifetime for most people but there is a little more. I was an activist for some time from 15 to around 19. Some day a psychopath blew up my city and went to my summer camp and shot around 250 people, killed 77. Many of them were my friends. I dont even remember their names anymore. They deserve to be remembered but its all black and white and I cant even remember their faces if I wanted to.

There was a wave of suicides in the years after. My best friend at the time was one of them. I spiraled out of control. Attempted suicide 4 times. I had no friends left basically. It earned me 9 years in the psych ward.

Since then I have learned to meditate and reset every now and then. The past is the past and I am trying to appreciate life as it is. To be honest, it is quite good right now. I just never realized since I was too busy worrying about all the horrors life had planned out for me right around the corner.

I am 29 now. My life up until now got screwed up by circumstances I cant control. I had an amazing date today at a restaurant with my first proper girl friend.

How can I get her to value herself more and allow her self to open up in conversation? When she is constantly second guessing herself it looks like she doesn't know what she wants to do and I have to guide her around with everything.

I’ve been lying to myself saying “oh most guys only want new girls and fucking  the same girl twice is less likely.” But then, I found an article saying:

“1. You usually can’t get a guy to sleep with you a second time, even if it is no strings attached. Guys love sex and will rarely say no to “NSA” fun. As a result, most guys will be happy to hit round two, three, or four. If you’re really awful in bed, though, they may not actually find it pleasurable enough to want to go again.”

I'm a normal weight for my height not overweight so it's not to do with a health problem that would be extremely concerned about my welfare even though he acted like I had a serious weight problem, and I started to believe maybe I do and started to feel super insecure about my body. I went over to his place and his father had cooked something and gave me a bowl, he then offers me more and I go yes please, the guy I was dating comes in and goes she has had enough, and starts this argument with his father.  I thought it was so rude and it made me uncomfortable when he started arguing with his father over me getting a second serving. 

He kept showing me females online and going look what she does she feeds herself through oxygen and breathing mainly etc....I'm not one bit interested and could care less. He kept showing me super fit females bodies and trying to get me to be like I want to be like that, when I didn't. At that point I wasn't enjoying spending time with him anymore, I felt I was being physically judged all the time and that he was trying to morph me into someone he wanted me to be. 

I end up losing contact with him and a year later forget about it and remember the good times together so I go meet him and he had this really excited voice and tells me to start fasting that I could be super healthy and fit if I start doing fasts and how much it helped him etc...I start doing it and then hate it and start eating normally again and he had already said he was going to check in with me daily to see how it's going and to keep it up and it all felt so forced and controlling. He kept telling me cycling isnt enough I need to do a lot more exercise than that and I felt all this pressure. He is super fit himself but it felt like he was trying to create this ideal image of me and make me feel insecure about my body. He never once complimented me, looking back everything always needed improvement. It was like he saw me as an old house that needed a renovation project and was barking at the builders or motivating them to do it. I then told him one night I cut some of my hair myself cause I wanted to and he asked if I had a mental breakdown, I felt ridiculed, at that point I realized it was a mistake getting involved with him again and I cut contact with him, stopped responding. I went into a group chat a few days later after he added me to this fitness chat group, and I see a message from him to the group going "" this group isnt for mentally unstable or mentally unwell people it's for people who actually want to get fit,  we dont have time to babysit the mentally unstable here"" I felt so diminished and was glad I stopped allowing that level of control over me.

I think this is important for health but also aesthetics. I don't like having rolls of fat on me and I don't like them on women either. I think the human body looks best as the Greeks sculpted it - fit, lean, athletic, and muscular. That's what I try to achieve myself.

However, it's gotten to the point that almost the only slim/fit women I see nowadays are teenagers way too young for me. Any woman past 25 or 30 is usually overweight. 

Even the few women who go to my gym are usually very overweight.

Sorry for the long post but I would really appreciate any insights from people who can relate.

I have posted about this relationship since before I even met this girl, just shortly after matching, when I was wondering what her hot and cold replies meant over text, then periodically since the breakup 4-5 months after that as I am occasionally hit by the memory of this relationship.

Basically I met a very beautiful (as in head turningly gorgeous) and mysterious 25 year old girl via Tinder shortly before the pandemic started. After an intense first date full of the most genuinely interesting conversation I have had on a date before and the most passionate makeout at the end, we basically spiralled into a relationship. She did almost everything in her power to make me happy but more importantly, to ""be"" what I wanted - I will explain.

I was in a bit of a difficult spot emotionally in terms of dating and wanted to take things slow, but I enjoyed being with her, really appreciated her unique and quirky personality, all the time and energy she gave to me and the sex/passion was off the charts.

However I quickly started to notice a feeling in the back of my head that things weren't quite right. She seemed just coincidentally all of a sudden like things that I liked, but have no real knowledge of them. She would stare at me when she thought I wasn't looking with a vacant expression and cold eyes for long periods, only to turn to a beautiful warm smile when I made eye contact. She would drop strange, trivial inconsistencies eg. I might ask her what she was doing that night and she would say, playing The Sims, and then a few days later I might ask how her Sims are going and she would say she hasn't played it in months etc. She had a dream that I cheated on her one night and that morning attempted to steal my Apple Watch when returning home, but I tracked it with my iPhone.

I was not fully conscious of these things at the time but I had a growing sense of unease around her despite the fact that she totally lavished me with love, passion, sex, affection and stimulating conversation.

Eventually this feeling grew so intense that I simply had to break up with her, but I became consumed with guilt, feeling sure that I was being avoidant and ruining things with this incredible girl, and we tried again. Almost immediately she pressured me into assuring commitment and I replied that I still wanted to take things slow and it basically ended right then and there.

About a week or two after the breakup I began thinking back over all the wonderful things she did for me and how unique she certainly was and I essentially fell in love with her at this point. I tried very hard to get her back with handwritten letters and meaningful sentimental gifts relating to us, but she was cold and seemed to relish in rejecting me. She even rejected closure, refusing to ever talk to me again. I understood that I hurt her by leaving her despite her trying so hard, but I couldn't understand the total silent wall she put up when I tried to discuss why.

At this point I will add that she told me early on she had a history of a severe psychiatric disorder that was now ""under control"", related to past trauma but that her dad suffered it too. Eventually everything clicked and I assume it was BPD/NPD.

Today I was in her town and I saw her again, she didn't see me but it brought back a lot of memories. Since her I have not really managed to find any feeling of passion for any of the girls I have met, I just crave the intensity and the almost dreamlike feel of being with her even though I know that she herself could not provide a stable relationship.

I have had therapy since then about this and been told that my assessment of the situation, including my own faults, is fine and that I will eventually meet someone who makes me feel genuine love and move on, but it has not happened. I can't count the number of dates since and I often go months without thinking about this girl, but still I truly crave the ""passion"".. Passion is the only word I can find to describe what I felt with her and what feels missing now.

I just want to know if anyone else has been through anything else like this and has anything to share? I am 33 now, too old for this, my whole life is together and I would like to meet someone to progress to the next steps of love, marriage, commitment and children but I feel like I am treading water (although to be fair every single person I know says the same these days).",False,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,966128,public,self,Almost 1.5y on from a breakup after just 4-5 months of dating and it still holds me back,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p8lb5v/almost_15y_on_from_a_breakup_after_just_45_months/,all_ads,6,,,,1629521660.0,,,

There were Soo many times I was "" this is Soo not my cup of tea ☕""

I met people who are flaky, people who said they like talking hanging out even the sex but they are not my boyfriend (this was after 2dates btw)
I had someone who said they want to be friends I was like works fine for me , we hung out for like 3months untill he said "" I am too attractive to be friends and now he doesn't want to talk""😑 like what the serious fuck

But after all these disasters ppl only wanting hookups or friends with benefits or just the benefits...
I met this guy on hinge, really cute our text were effortless although he mentioned he was just visiting the city and was stuck for a month bcoz of covid
I immediately tune my brain this is just drinks temporary 
We went bar hopping, watched seaplanes land and takeoff he showed me star fishes stuck to the bay I showed him the residents seal 🦭
We parted ways because we committed to some other friends and met back up.
He asked me what I wanted to do I wanted him to take him to the playground to swing but he looked super tired so we watched a movie and he saw my name in the credit list .
A day later we met up again I took him to a restaurant on the mountains but the restaurant was closed (google deceived me) we watched the city from the top and he was shivering head to toe but he refused to take my jacket or leave ( we were hoping to see meteor shower) I had to drag him from there 

At this point I am falling for this guy hard!!!! When I know this has no future
Here's the catch the guy is US marine! He dosent retire for another 6yrs to do anything he is based in Japan for now.
We spent 5nights together already 
He leaves tomorrow....
It took 8years for me to get a date I fell head over heels, he has been stuck here for a month and only met me on his last week
Like LIFE : "" WHAT THE DAMMN HELL""

I met her on tinder a while ago and had some conversations from time to time. Things seemed generally fine at least online, but later I learned that her life came to a somewhat of a wreck. I don't want to go into details, but she told me that she has PTSD and BPD. She's blocked me on multiple occasions for different reasons, but after our most recent date, we found some closure to it. We just talked and were vunerable with each other about everything and my confusion about our relationship started to make sense. The only reason as to why I say I think she's my girlfriend is because she told me how she was being completely exclusive with me and we had sex that day. I expressed my concerns with her habits of cutting me off from communication and she promised she wouldn't do it again. I myself have issues with interpreting situations under negative connations but realized most of it was due to her mental illness. At certain moments throughout our date, she'd lighten up and I found myself extremely attracted to her, but moments later she'd have a mood swing. For example, my car battery died and she started crying and blaming herself for it and said she's bad luck to everyone. As of now, I just spend my days trying to encourage her and make her feel better, but almost half of the time I feel that we don't communicate as a ""normal"" couple would, and altogether it's just hard to read her.

I recently started using hinge, and it has been going decently well, if rather slow. I've kind of been half-assing it.

I recently got a like from someone from my hometown, who I went to high school with and who is two years younger than me. We are in our late 20's early 30's and divorced, so she presumably got married young just like i did. 

So the thing is, this woman, when we were teenagers in high school, very clearly was interested in me and then was turned off by something I did and lost interest. This seems pretty obvious to me now in hindsight.

The problem is, I wouldn't let it go. I wouldn't drop it. I texted her incessantly when this happened and it got to a point where I was doing it for my own entertainment. It was total lunatic, psycho type behavior. I was teenager and an idiot. I remember it clearly because I cringe about it from time to time, to this day. I'm lucky nobody called the police on me.

Now obviously, this doesn't represent me today. I'm a grown ass man with a professional career. I've had so many positive experiences as well as rejections from women in the last 13 years that I don't care one way or another. Again, I was 17 and now I am 32. Obviously an entirely different person and a normally adjusted adult.

I am interested in matching with her, but I have decided that she either:

1. Forgot about the whole thing and we will meet up, her memory will be jogged, and it will be awkward as hell.

2. She sees this as ancient history and doesn't care. 

Should I bring this up in chat at some point to clear the air, or just play dumb and let it be? Or alternatively, ignore her like and go with someone else?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,966176,public,self,Possibly a unique situation,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p8ma55/possibly_a_unique_situation/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,
