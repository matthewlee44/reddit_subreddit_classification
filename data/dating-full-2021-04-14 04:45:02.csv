If you look at my post history I‚Äôve been wondering for months whether we were serious and I just learned that it‚Äôs just better to ask early on.

I can list out a ton of reasons on why it did and didn‚Äôt feel serious but the bottom line is she said that she never felt it was serious, and I admittedly was sort of wanting for something more when she really wasn‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt know this doesn‚Äôt necessarily hurt but this happened after I introduced her to my friends and bought her a birthday present but we had been seeing each other for like 3 months now so think this would‚Äôve happened eventually.

I just wish I would‚Äôve asked sooner but I was scared of the answer, I knew the answer and I think secretly I was hoping that my actions would sway her. I think for a bit I did but I don‚Äôt even know what to feel right now bc we went out on a date a year ago too and stopped talking bc I thought she didn‚Äôt like me. I learned a lot and basically lost my virginity to her, although we didn‚Äôt have piv (oral, i fingered, dry humping, I‚Äôm fucking counting it lol) and I‚Äôm glad at least i learned some things.

And I would ask her directly like sometimes ‚Äúlike it feels like you don‚Äôt care about things, or you‚Äôre very nonchalant about us,‚Äù and she would mostly reply saying something like that‚Äôs just the way she was, so I‚Äôm glad I knew something was off and it finally got confirmed. 

I also realized that never assume things and I cut off another girl for her and I was so stupid to do so. I might hit her back up but doubt she‚Äôll still want to go on a date after a month of not talking but we‚Äôll see.

This is sort of bad timing too bc I recently got caught for cheating on an exam (super long story) and so this girl ‚Äúbroke up‚Äù with me, and it‚Äôs just been a lot this week.

Some context - I‚Äôm a 22 y/o male dealing with a 20 y/o female coworker. It‚Äôs a very long story so I will try to cut out as much irrelevant factors as possible. We started off as friends with a lot in common (same concentration in school with similar professors etc). She flat out mentioned she had a bf when we were all sitting at a table in the lunch room where she looked at me after saying that, I didn‚Äôt pay any mind as I just found her hot but not anything more. As time went by, we laughed a lot, spent a lot of time together at work, and joked a lot. It always became routine for us to be together at work now. Throughout this whole time I never really hit on her however somethings I‚Äôve said could‚Äôve been taken as what‚Äôs he trying to say (being honest). I could feel her trying to take the question out of me to ask her to which I never did bc of her ‚Äúbf‚Äù. After about 3 months of knowing each other she started bringing up her boyfriend to me all the time it started becoming noticeable. She‚Äôd always find reasons to text me whether it be asking for assignments, if I was working same day as her, how‚Äôs life etc. She cooled off talking about him for about a month then started it up again mentioning how she‚Äôs getting engaged now and how happy she‚Äôs going to be which I encouraged and gave her my congratulations. Now, it‚Äôs been 5 months of knowing each other and I mention that I found a girl gorgeous that we work with and asked her if she knew her and she became FURIOUS with me (the crazy thing is she pretended to not know her but while I was describing her she‚Äôd finish my sentences of things about her like she already knew but didn‚Äôt want to talk about her). I asked her how I should approach and she didn‚Äôt really give anything helpful still told her thanks. This same day her whole attitude changed dramatically, made conversation quiet, walking behind me, glaring at me when I‚Äôd talk about something else. THEN, as our shift ended she tried almost running me over in my car when exiting! I was looking at her in my mirror and she was going full speed then halting her breaks. We worked together the following week and she brought up that girl and told me I‚Äôd better switch my station and see if she‚Äôs working and to go talk to her. I told her to stop talking about it and that I didn‚Äôt like that girl I just said she was gorgeous and I‚Äôm interested to see what kind of women she is. She continues to tell me how I‚Äôd have to convert my religion if I want to be with her to which I said I‚Äôm not changing my religion for anyone and she said too bad her religion type of people look for marriage at this age and just a whole bunch of stuff that I don‚Äôt want to get into - I cut the conversation. About a week later I texted her asking if she‚Äôd like to get something to eat, she said she‚Äôll see she has to take care of her mom who‚Äôs sick I told her alright no problem let me know she said ok then  she texts back ""what will we be eating tho?"" I said haven‚Äôt given it much thought downtown has some nice places tho and she said ""we‚Äôre going to downtown lol"" and I said anyways just lmk she said ok then nothing. I‚Äôve told her so many times before that I‚Äôve had no luck with women always getting rejected but I‚Äôd be playful about it and she‚Äôd always act so surprised how that could be because I‚Äôm not bad looking and I‚Äôm in shape (really giving off the vibe that she likes me - not trying to give wishful thinking but it rly seems that way). I don‚Äôt know where I stand right now and her reaction is now scaring me reflecting. Is she narcissistic?

We switched to Instagram after a few days and then ""upgraded"" to WhatsApp after that. We haven't met yet, because of the covid situation and that she went back to her home in another city for a few months. But the consensus is that we both wanted to meet each other when she comes back. 

We texted almost daily and when we did, we texted all day. Some days we stayed up till 3 am chatting. We talked about stuff, opening up and all. Watched movie together, played online games together. 

Then, a few days ago. I was not in a good place, I got anxious and it spilled into my texts to her. I asked her if she wanted me to give her space. She asked what did I mean by space and I told her I meant for me to not pester her with texts too much like I was doing as I felt like I'm losing control. 

She didn't reply fast like usual. I panicked, my existing anxiety got even worse. I started flipping out, saying why she ghost me like that, and sent paragraphs of texts. 

As I hit send, I knew I was only ensuring to end the bond between us by freaking out. Nothing disrespectful but I understood it is needy. 

I texted her a lengthy apology the next day for overreacting but she doesn't even read it.  

It keeps me thinking. It's bad for sure, but is it that bad that I don't deserve to even be looked at anymore? Is the margin of error really this thin for guys? That's it? One moment of weakness and I'm this psycho needy guy that must be avoided at all cost?

Hello everyone! My bf (m 27) and I (f 27) have been having some difficulties lately and I am seeking a third party perspective. FYI we are seeking a counselor to evaluate our situation, too. 

My boyfriend and I have been together for about three and a half years. The pros? We share values, love and care for each other very much, he fits right into my friend group, and we are supportive of one another. I would honestly say that he benefits from our relationship more than I do. I have played a strong role in his emerging career (school psychology), introducing him to new friends (I like his friends too, but he loves my friends as much as his own), and constantly encouraging him to travel with me and experience new things. I‚Äôve also supported him in realizing a problem with alcohol that he is working on. My boyfriend is undeniably a good person. He is genuine, kind, honest, faithful, and hilarious. He‚Äôs definitely my best friend!

The cons. Well, I‚Äôm going to have more to say here given the current climate of my relationship. There would be zero romance if I did not initiate dates/hangouts/trips/gifts. I make way more of an effort to carve out quality time between the two of us, and really want him to initiate more (I have expressed this numerous times). There is little sexual attraction between us. I think this aligns with the lack of romance in our relationship. Neither of us feel as happy or excited in our relationship as we used to. We have planned to move in together this summer. I struggle to feel excited about milestones as I would like too, because my boyfriend struggles with OCD/ anxiety, and these kinds of transitions are not easy for him. He is excited by the idea of living together, but also nervous. It‚Äôs hard for me because I‚Äôd like to see more confidence in my partner. 

My boyfriend is super busy with graduate school, practicum, and his part time job. He also struggles with time management. This increase in activity definitely aligns with a decrease in the quality of our relationship. I sometimes feel like the desired changes that I communicate to him come off as more items for him to add to his to-do list. When I have qualms about various things (his drinking, poor time management, lack of romance), I wonder if I am being too critical or if I‚Äôm being unreasonable. 

I still feel like I want the relationship to work, because my BF is a great guy with many awesome qualities, but maybe I‚Äôm grasping at thin air. My bf has expressed that he really doesn‚Äôt want to lose me. I actually think his life would be a lot less vibrant without me in it. In the flip side, I almost feel like my life would be less stressful....

This all being said, here is what I am looking for. 

- thoughts on whether this relationship seem salvageable or like a total mismatch. 

- Advice or thoughts on experiencing a rut like this for approx 8 months.

I decide that he is wonderful and want to spend all my time with him. 

I try to keep swiping but have a hard time mustering any enthusiasm. I actually feel guilty and conflicted even if I have only been on one date with the person I am smitten with. Meanwhile, he is still dating other people and is probably turned off by my being so available all the time. 

There are a lot of downsides to this approach. For starters, it wastes a lot of my time as it takes several weeks/months to determine compatibility + a few more weeks for me to recover. When I am over invested in something working out, I also make too many excuses for bad behavior. I also think men interpret my eagerness negatively and take me for granted/are scared off, only to pop up again months or even years later when I have totally forgotten about them. 

While I know cognitively that I should cool it and not overinvest in an imagined future with someone, I seem to find it nearly impossible to do this. I try to stay busy, but since I have a desk job I still find myself thinking about the person way too much.

So, I (21M) haven't had any success dating in my area. When I say that, I mean I've never been in a relationship. I understand 21 is still young, but I think it would be nice to finally meet someone. I've tried Bumble, OkCupid, etc but with no success. I don't have high standards or anything, but I do admit It is hard finding people on these apps. And with this pandemic it makes things even harder since I try to stay at home as much as possible to stay safe. So, I'm hoping to perhaps get some advice, not just for now but maybe for when the pandemic is over too. And another question I have that I've pondered recently is if online long-distance relationships are a viable option for relationships? I've met quite a few friends online from other countries and I find it easier meeting people online than in person for some reason (I'm a tad socially awkward). However, I always get compliments that I'm friendly and funny, so I don't think its my personality that women don't like. But I've heard that long distance relationships can be a lot harder than when the relationship is local, so I'm a bit unsure about this option.

This is long, I apologize in advance.

TL;DR at the bottom.

Before I get into it I want to give you a bit of background on us. I 33\[F\] am a fairly successful entrepreneur. She is 47\[F\] and a successful bartender.

We're both stable, single, and emotionally available. Important to clarify that these days.

We are both alternative and share similar interests. I've been told she has a history of dating/hooking up with less than desirable men. While it is concerning, I don't hold that against her in the slightest. I have no expectations what-so-ever. But I do not want to be seen as a pushover, too nice, or simply too much because of our different lifestyles.

For the record, I exclusively date women.

**Now for the good stuff...**

I moved to the city months ago and wandered into her bar with a mutual friend days after my arrival. As soon as I laid eyes on her, I was very intrigued. Over the next few months we saw each other a handful of times but it wasn't until last weekend that we really connected.

After a bit of banter and flirting three of her good friends told me to approach her as she was seriously attracted to me. I was also informed that she has reservations about things such as my age etc.

On Sunday she invited me to walk home with her and her friends. To my surprise she invited me upstairs to hangout. I was getting ready to leave and she said I could stay. Awesome! I'm cautious and didn't want to intrude.

While cuddling and exploring each other we discussed her concerns and I assured her the age difference would not be a problem. I asked that she simply communicate her needs and what I could do to make her comfortable. Told her I'm willing to take it at a pace she's comfortable with.

It could have gone further but we were exhausted and the sun was coming up so we opted to rest.

We seemed to really hit it off. She is thus far is everything I look for in a partner. It's refreshing to finally connect with someone that I don't have to always impress, support, can hold an intellectual conversation with, and don't have to be fearful of. She seemed to appreciate this as well. I'm comfortable with her and that's huge.

The following morning as I got dressed while she made coffee, we chatted and whatnot. We shared our interest in each other and decided to see where this leads. She asked my schedule and said we would get together again this week.

I left, then saw her at work late that evening. We were flirty but I kept a safe distance as to not smother her. Before closing I asked if I could walk her home, waited for her to close, walked her home and left. No questions, no expectations. Just being nice as our city is dangerous and I live a few blocks away.

I texted this afternoon to send well wishes and let her know I was thinking about her. She did't reply. Today is her day off, and she was most likely exhausted. I didn't expect a response, but it would have been nice. She has a life of her own and that is attractive. Space can be attractive.

**Here are my questions and concerns:**

She has, in the past, dated really terrible men and from what I've heard a handful of women. She's attractive and works at a popular bar in the city, so she has options. No worries, all good. I'm confident.

I travel a lot, and have been told I too am very attractive. Naturally she questions why I would choose her (How could I not? She's great!).

I had planned to let her lead, but was informed that was a bad idea and should step up. No problem.

**1.)** If I don't hear from her, she obviously isn't interested. Totally fine as we've only spent one night together. However, can I still go to her bar? Should we remain friends? Potentially difficult, I know.

Sidenote: It may just take time for her to warm up. Attraction is two-fold, first physical then emotional. The physical is there and we're both big on forming deep emotional connection with our partners. Trust is huge.

**2.)** If she is interested and wants to see me again. How can I alleviate her concerns with our age and lifestyle differences? My current plan is to simply show up for her and be myself, I am a very kind, caring, generous, and mostly easygoing person. While, i'm not majorly into drinking every day. I do not mind her occupation or that she indulges often both at work and in her personal life.

**3.)** Again, if she's interested, how should I approach dating/communication and work towards building a healthy longterm relationship with her? Obviously everyone has individual needs so I want to make sure she's comfortable, confident, and happy.

I genuinely want to get to know her better, however, I'm not always the best at these sort of things. I have the potential to get anxious and attached if I'm really interested in someone. Doing my best not to do that this time. She is very independent and I've been told that being a successful thirty-something year old woman makes me hard to date and/or intimidating.

I don't want to mess this up and i'm already a bit nervous. Any advice is appreciated.

**TL;DR:** I 33\[F\] met a 47\[F\] and we seemed to hit it off. She has some concerns about my age etc. We spent a night together, cuddled, and shared our interest for pursuing this further. She said we'd get together later this week.

Going forward I'd like to make sure she's comfortable. Texted her this afternoon to let her know I was thinking about her after walking her home from work last night. No response. Totally okay, she has a life of her own. If she is interested I'd like to be prepared. If not, that's okay too.

Also, looking for advice on how to better communicate with her and possibly build a lasting relationship.

I‚Äôm 19 in University, and my field of study (media) makes me a minority in class (99% girls, 1% guys) [could be my classes intake, or study choice. I don‚Äôt know exactly] In my first intake, I‚Äôm literally the only guy in class. 

I‚Äôm literally trying to make friends but girls are reluctant to communicate. Then there were 3 girls that I spoke to. Out of 3 of em, I only liked one girl. Just one. We had things in common etc, she flirted with me, told me she‚Äôs single, we did go out, we texted for weeks &amp; hours on end. When I finally confessed my feelings to her, she said ‚ÄúOh I didn‚Äôt think of us as that.

Why would she send me literally half naked photos, text me for hours, and sit to me in class all the time. Like why? DO GIRLS SERIOUSLY THINK IM HITTING ON ALL OF THEM, LIKE SERIOUSLY?? Or do girls think they can‚Äôt be friends with guys? 

Then here goes the other two. These two other girls keep asking me for help in class, and actually it was borderline annoying. I did help them etc, I talked to them both for a while. When I wanted to meet up and hang out (as friends) One ghosted and the other one says she doesn‚Äôt go out, yet 2 hours later I see her going out on her Instagram. 

Online dating isn‚Äôt suitable for average looking guys. It just isn‚Äôt. Hardly any matches, when they is. It‚Äôs either no reply, or unmatch, or talk for a while but reluctant to go on the actual date. 

If girls say they aren‚Äôt confusing, I‚Äôm sorry that‚Äôs a lie. Over 20 years I‚Äôve lived I‚Äôve  never had once a girl be upfront and tell me what they wanted or at least communicated

I‚Äôm a 22y/o female and I recently started seeing a 25y/o guy I met through bumble. We talked online for about a month and then we met in person, and now we‚Äôve been on four dates and on the fourth date we were supposed to celebrate my birthday. 

Leading up to this fourth date, we‚Äôve been texting everyday and I told him my birthday was coming up in two weeks, but when it came to my birthday, he forgot. I told him it was alright that he forgot, he could make up for it on our next date (the fourth date). 

On this fourth date, we spent it walking a 7km walk and then just drinking and chilling at his place. During the walk, my mind began to spiral and realise he didn‚Äôt care about my bday, coz he didn‚Äôt even get me a present or wishes. 

This guy is 3 years older than me, and has also had previous dating experience, whereas I had little to no dating experience. 

My problem is that during our walk, he said that I looked tired, when actually I was incredibly upset, and rather than telling him ‚Äúyes I‚Äôm upset‚Äù I just told him I was tired. It‚Äôs been making me really depressed that I wasn‚Äôt honest with my feelings and I should‚Äôve told him how I really felt, but some of my friend have been telling me not to say anything because we‚Äôre only seeing each other and there are no strings attached.

He told me that he thinks we get along pretty well compared to his other bumble dates tho.

So what can I do then? I spilled my guts and let her know that I‚Äôm down for the count if she is. Oops I‚Äôm a sap. Can someone give me some marching orders or rules to follow? I suck at this.

LOL! I don't even know where to begin with this and i do not want to sound hysterical or anything but yeah i'm kinda freaking out here and need genuine sincere PERSPECTIVE! Not really advice but just COMMENTS TO GIVE ME VIEWS! OTHER VIEWS AND INSIGHTS of what's happening in our relationship. Things that i might perhaps not have thought of!


I will be truthful, respectful and direct so here goes nothing......


So i am 30. He is 40. We met in the forest ü§£ WHO EVEN MEETS IN THE FOREST? well us i guess ü§£ hahaha! The cave man and his bush lady! Lol!¬†it's kinda romantic if you think about it ü§î coz these days folks meet on tinder so a forest for a change is kinda nice!


So I was out riding my bicycle, lost control of the damn thing, hit a tree, the bike broke, my knee was badly bruised, i couldn't move an inch and blood was flowing freely like a river! He stopped his jeep, asked if i needed help and we went from him cleaning my knee with bottled water which he got from his jeep to him next cleaning my pussyy with his tongue! We shamelessly fucked under those trees until it got dark and then we headed back to my place to finish off our fuck fest extravaganza. At this point my knee was nearly healed! I'd forgotten all about it ü§≠¬†We met a couple more times upto 6 months in that forest to get it on. We love each other's bodies. Every curve, every inch, every orgasm is pure heaven! Then out of nowhere he opened up about his on &amp; off girlfriend to which i was upset because i don't want to be ""the other woman"" My plan is not to fuck anyone's boyfriend so i stopped fucking him! But 2 months later he resurfaced telling me that he had completely broken it off with her and chose me. He asked if we could finally date not only forest fucks!


We ended up dating for 2 years so i guess all's well that ends well! We fell so in love! We still are.


So the thing is, He is white. Uuuummmm hmmmm yeah!!!! Hmmmmm so unless you've been in a black and white interacial u might not get why that could be an issue here!¬†


The disrespect from both sides of the families (my black family and his white family) but not something we couldn't handle at first. We handled it. But the disrespect HALLELUJAH!!! The disrespect!


Some of the disrespect was unintentional just cultural differences/ difference in upbringing so different views of life generally but some of it was just actually very intentional! Just shitty family members being racist and provocative which we just generally ignored coz we loved one another. I chose him with all his whiteness and green eyes, he chose me with all my blackness and big behind, period!

(And uuuuummm yes u guessed it, the overall racism was mostly from his side of the family and I hate to stereotype here but i told you that i would be HONEST it's just such a damn pity that to this day and age some white folk out there still won't accept a black person as their equal!)¬†


I mean they just had a hard time processing how i get to eat and dine with them on the same table, how i have a college degree like their own daughters, how i am not a single mother in the hood somewhere struggling with a child whose father is in jail somewhere, how i have a well paying job, BASICALLY I AM A NORMAL GIRL WITH GOOD MORALS AND A NORMAL LIFE! And to these particular family members it was like too much, too fucking much to process in their minds! They wanted me GONE! Coz see in their minds, i represent some kind of threat to their existence that only God himself can explain! I never got it! I never quite got what it was they were soooo afraid of! Questions such as,""Oh so your mom and dad have a house? How?"" ü§î ""Oh so u studied at the same school as my niece, hmmm what grades did u get exactly?"" ü§î And it wasn't so much the questions, it was how they were asked! Even going as far as asking their little kids if they were afraid of me! Like why should they be??? It was just constant subtle insults!)¬†

One time we all went to the club, his white sisters and cousins start to twerk, i join them, all the guys suddenly stop what they are doing to watch me twerk, even strangers they were staring (more like oogling) and the girls tell me to ""WATCH MYSELF!""......Like damn, could u be any more obvious that u are feeling threatened!!! (Watch myself??? Uuummm why?) The question is WHY???? Why can't we all just get along and have a good time! It's just a dance! 

Later on, he confessed to me that random guys at the club had secretly bought him drinks that night going like,""Bro! You hit that? I want ur life"" ...""bro, u are my role model"" ....while giggling and secretly congratulating him whenever their own girlfriends were not looking! Like these guys legit turned him into some kind of ""hero"" that night when they found out i was with him! To which i thought it was just men being naughty! I thought nothing much of it. But now in hindsight it's like these people really did view me as some kind of threat even in the most stupid stuff like dancing! I see it now!

So yes this and many other examples but yeah there was instances of direct racism as well but to be 100% fair, he also faced discrimination from my side (mostly my brothers. They thought he was a punk &amp; sometimes ignored his views) but me and him sat down, analyzed EVERYTHING (we took out a pen and paper and actually wrote everything down!) And we realized/reached the conclusion that my family were mostly just RESPONDING to his people's first aggression, they always seemed to have started it in 99% of the instances with just their constant condescension, micro aggression and undertones that suggested that we did not belong! That we were ""less than""...that they were ""better than us""...etc.


To which he suggested he talks to his people and he agreed that they were unnecessarily rude to me. I said fine. He went &amp; talked with them. They acted cool with it. One of them actually even called me and said that she felt bad that she'd touched my hair and asked her kids if they found it to be beautiful because she just realized that she wouldn't do such a thing with say a very blonde Swedish lady! And she did say that she had felt entitled to me coz i was black and she realizes it now. I was very impressed by her and wholeheartedly accepted her apology. I thought that was very grown up of her, very mature, sensible and sensitive! It's also BRAVE! It can't be easy to admit such a thing!


Now the last 1 year down the line dating, he is not invited to any children's birthday parties, they've isolated him from family gatherings, he has been branded a ""Conflict magnet"" with his ""aggressive black woman""...He is suddenly a controversial figure in the family! LIKE WTF??? We thought we were all cool. Why are they waging this silent war now? What's the retaliation about? For asking for equal treatment and mutual respect? What is this punishing him?!!! Smh!

He said he feels disappointed by his people but that he won't let them be rude to me all the time least of all make racist remarks all the darn time just for him to be accepted by them! He said he is fine living away from their nonsense! 

However, i see he is hurting and i am thinking of walking away at this point. I want to make up some excuse to break up with him coz it is evident that this man misses his people and i am not about to keep him away from them. If it means breaking this off, so be it. Though it would hurt me like a motherfucker! [Dude just last month we were naming our imaginary future mixed kids!!!] I don't wanna break up with a person i love but i want him to also have his blood family like he always did even before meeting me!

So I told him that and said we should only catch up if we both want to be together and he said he understood and wished me all the best. Apologised for the hurt he caused me too.

a girl I work with I really like, first few weeks she seemed to really like me back, started texting, instant responses, very flirty, voice notes selfies, videos.

changed her pic from her ex to just her,  conveniently she had ""forgotten to do it before""  said she's single, said she loves it when we work same shift, kissing emoji, misses me when I'm not there etc etc.

at work, very talkative, smiles, flips her hair, searches me out to start convos, on purposely bumps/ brushes against me etc. said she hates it when another guy from work flirts with her but likes it when I do n"" im better in every way.""

then randomly over the last week, her responding got slower, shorter, she broke her toe, then she had a kidney infection so fair dos, flirting via text got less, less voice notes, selfies and videos. 



however come Monday morning shes text me morning after blanking my text for 2 days. my guess is she was worried work would b awkward, whatever I didnt respond.

at work Monday in person extremely talkative, flirty, asking me questions, she even mentioned out loud to everyone, oh hes(me) been very busy, taking ""long to reply and not posting in the group for days now""

does that mean she's been thinking about it or me?


I was gna call her and tell her I'm picking her up and we're gna go for food after work but I didnt like an idiot 



After work I text her saying ""cheek of you to say I take long to respond, you take days, if ur bored of me il stop bothering u""

her response: no way I'm bored of u, how can I be bored of my fave, iv told u before I'm jus shocking at replying to texts, I'm an in person sort of girl""

fairs, how come she wasn't at beginning? didn't wna be rude?


so anyways yesterday at work, extremely flirty, touchy feely, said she thinks she can beat me up in a fight and wants to beat me up, absolutely can't btw 5ft2 which I tease her about, she was talking to this other guy for a bit so I ignored her for an hour so she started a convo again.

flirted on the stairs to the store room saying am I chasing her, I said u wish etc she laughed. didnt deny, showed me how she's blanking her ex over Instagram. I then mentioned before we finished thT I was gna ask her to come out to eat with me but didn't cuz thought she'd be busy. she said you shouldve, I wouldve come. DAMNIT. 


sucks I know cuz I can't today cuz I'm fasting for a month(ramadan).
 which she's gna fast next Monday to support me btw.

text her last night, she responded once fell asleep didnt respond but has seen online.

so my question is, what do u make of it all, is she into me? what's she trying to say,  im confused whys she so different in person and over text. 

how do I play this? do I keep reaching out with the fear of looking needy, or do I play scarce on text and jus flirt at work.

and before you say why have I taken so long to ask her out;it's cuz of the mixed reactions I'm getting, I wouldve thought if someone liked me they'd wna talk call text first etc, but then at work she's all up for it.

But recently a woman I met on a dating site. We matched, exchanged a few messages then she went cold on me. Didn‚Äôt unmatch her, months go by she messages me again. Just some small talk, things seem okay. I ask her to video chat and she didn‚Äôt get back to me for a week (noticing a pattern?) She says that‚Äôs she‚Äôs willing to chat.

I expressed to her that I‚Äôm not feeling attracted to her because of her flakiness. She insists she needs time to get to know someone and that it takes three dates for her to start dating someone. I let her know that we are just talking at the moment and dating is really not in the picture just yet. 

Anyway I planned a nice evening of dinner and drinks. She shows up LATE and says that she has someplace to be in a few hours. Mind you we met up at 8 pm. I was upset because I was trying to express to her this is not going well during our meet up but she kept giving excuses (she just went through a break, work stuff, and etc). I‚Äôm not upset at the situation, I should have seen the red flags. I guess I‚Äôm just saying this to vent. It sucks when you try to express yourself and it‚Äôs completely ignored.

I'm in my early 30's and this guy is in his mid 20's 

I met this bloke online and we hit it off and there was definitely an attraction on both ends and we later discuss and agree that we are interested in each other. He calls me beautiful, cute etc on the regular. I asked him if he was interested in a date and he said that he's ""open to it"" he's never been in a relationship and I have a lot of casual sex and I very rarely get to the point of being interested in someone and I haven't had a boyfriend in 10+ years so it's very new to me. The texting used to flow and feel natural and now it feels forced and awkward because I recently brang up that communication is important to me and things did slow down for a period of time. I don't see him very often as he lives over an hour away and we both work, he does say that he's still interested in seeing me but it's like pulling teeth. I've told him multiple times if you're not interested, just tell me but he keeps reassuring me he's still interested. He seems like an honest guy but people are liars. I'm still seeing other people so this hasn't stopped me from putting myself out there. I don't know if I should just let things go or just keep talking to him and seeing where/if this goes anywhere.

Also I‚Äôm 29 and she‚Äôs 21 I‚Äôve never really had a good time with such an age gap before.  

Maybe I‚Äôm paranoid but we met this Sunday at a local bar, whole thing was pretty out of the blue.  I‚Äôll be honest in saying that I‚Äôm an incredibly forward person which ended up in us spending the whole night chatting and well getting a bit fresh with one another at the bar.  Had some great conversation and found a lot in common.  Downside is that we both have some shit going that‚Äôs less than ideal, she was pretty clear that she and her ex had split up recently because she was cheated on.  I on a similar note got broken up with over text a few months ago when I went out of town to visit my parents.  But she genuinely seemed excited to continue talking, and continuously talked about seeing each other again that night and into the next morning.  So after the bar we spent the night together the morning went as well as the night before in my mind, she made no indication that it wasn‚Äôt going anywhere.  I‚Äôll be completely honest in saying that I communicated openly that it‚Äôs okay if she wasn‚Äôt feeling ready to go any further with whatever it is we planned on doing.  But she stayed singing the same tune. So we parted ways that morning after she dropped me off at work.  Anyway this was Monday morning, I excitedly texted her shortly after I got there finding I didn‚Äôt have a whole lot to do that day.  No avail but also the message wasn‚Äôt read, not a big deal.  Texted her again after work asking how her day had been saying that I had a great time and I‚Äôd like to see her again and she left me on read.  

I haven‚Äôt reached back out since then, figure I‚Äôll give it some breathing room, but I‚Äôm admittedly feeling a little rough over it.  I‚Äôm not one to waste my time on this type of thing but she didn‚Äôt really give me any indication that she wasn‚Äôt interested in taking it further and we got along way too well almost to a weird level, which if I had a guess that might have something to do with this response.  My plan is to give it until tomorrow before I ask what‚Äôs up if I don‚Äôt hear from her.  I have no intention of being crappy about it but I figure I have nothing to lose by being forward, if I get left on read after that it‚Äôll be pretty self evident.

I guess I just want some opinions on where to go from here.

I asked her the night before since it was a spur of the moment decision, she said she had other plans already (which I expected), I said no problem, and that was that.

I said something along the lines of ""I know it's last minute, but I'm planning to check out a hiking trail tomorrow if you'd like to join"", so it was very impromptu.

Lately I've been wanting to ask her out in a bit more of a serious way (as in not on a whim the night before), but I'm not sure if I'm pushing it. My main reservation is that she didn't suggest an alternate date, which could be because it was in the middle of the school year, it was a spur of the moment thing that wasn't really planned in the first place, or maybe she was trying to let me down nicely. Even if she says no I wouldn't be angry or anything and I wouldn't see her any differently, I just don't want to go on wondering about it, but at the same time I don't want to kill our friendship by seeming desperate or pushy since she's a great friend.

I have a decent life; I'm generally happy, I have a beautiful dog that brings me endless joy and I have a really awesome supportive family, but I've been running into this same brick wall for years and its getting really tiring. 

Much like everyone else, I have always wanted to find someone whom I enjoy being with. I don't think I'm too picky. I'm usually attracted to less ""traditional"" beauty and like to think I give a lot more weight to someone's personality as opposed to physical appearance. And I don't try to just sleep with girls. I'd much prefer to have a mental connection before a physical one. I think that mental connection can really enhance the physical side of things... But maybe I have no clue what I'm talking about, because I've been falling flat on my face since I was 18. I've had plenty of friends, and a lot of them female but the romantic side of things has just been a dumpster fire in a pile of shit. I've lost count of how many times I've heard how good of a guy I am, and how lucky some  *other* girl will be. 


I feel like maybe dating gave up on me. Things seem to go great for about 2 weeks. And then it'll implode. I thought maybe I come on too strong, so I've tried to hang back a bit. Which usually just leads to never hearing from them sooner. Which was fine for a while. But after 13  years of getting my hopes up it's starting to feel like maybe I'm not cut out for a relationship. It got to a point where I started to question my sexuality, like maybe girls can tell I'm gay and I just don't know it? But I've never been attracted to a guy so I'm pretty sure that's definitely not it. 

I know all the alone time has left me a little awkward, but I don't think I'm that strange. And I know I'm no model but I don't think I'm some hideous fucking chud either. But again... I'm questioning my whole perspective on things. And its crushing my confidence.

I mean. You can only tell yourself it's not me, it's them, for so long.


So that's it. I feel... Defeated. Like I'm just sitting on the sideline watching the game. Like maybe I don't see the whole picture and really dont have much to offer as a person.

I‚Äôm so incredibly hurt bc idk it was the first time that I became super attached to someone and once I caught real feelings it‚Äôs like she started pulling back and then I started trying to pull her in, but I always asked her why it seemed like she didn‚Äôt take things seriously bc it seemed like she didn‚Äôt care sometimes, and she would always say that‚Äôs just the way she was. The truth was that she never saw things seriously and sort of maybe was just seeing what could happen the whole time or honestly I doubt she even thought about it tbh.

Idk if she met another dude, I had just introduced her to my friends and a couple days after she sort of broke things off. I basically lost my virginity to her (no piv but everything else so I‚Äôm counting it lol) and I‚Äôm glad I never told her I was a virgin, but like I was so touchy with her and maybe became overbearing and overwhelming which probably would have been fine if things were serious but in her mind everything was casual.

We went skydiving, skating, I met her friends too, and we had snorkeling planned and now I have to cancel it. I guess the biggest thing I‚Äôm worried about is that I wonder if I can ever know if a girl truly likes me, and I wonder if I can feel this attraction again.

We would spend a whole day together every week like 10-12 hours, and we would just cuddle sometimes and I can‚Äôt believe I lost that and I‚Äôm wondering if I‚Äôll get that again. At the same time she was always out partying and drinking all the time, i knew that she was never a relationship girl but I guess I was sort of hoping to sway or change her, and maybe for a little bit I did but she ultimately said that she didn‚Äôt want to lead me on and wasn‚Äôt ready for a relationship. We had been on like 9 dates and somehow earlier in the week I had a panic attack bc I felt like something was off and she didn‚Äôt respond to my text, so I sort of guessed that something was up.

In my mind I don‚Äôt know if it was me, like I became more invested than her into the relationship but she started to pull back, she would never text that much, always keep things short, but she would say that‚Äôs just the way she was and that was her personality. So on one hand I feel like relief knowing the truth now, snd now I don‚Äôt have to worry as well. 

I just feel so heartbroken though and numb, I feel like I was clouded by all these feelings but at least I can say that I wore my heart on my sleeve and I tried. It feels so personal and like an attack on me, even though we went on 10 dates together so I wonder at what point she had this in her mind.

I recently went on a date with someone who I was very interested in. He did most things right - he took me out to eat, showed me some cool different places around the city we live, showed up clean and put together, etc. There were some smaller bumps in the date that I was willing to overlook.

I found him attractive and planned to see where the night was going to go.

But, there was a problem: he had *such* a bad attitude.

The constant negativity started to pull me down. He took me places and didn‚Äôt like anything there. I tried to tease him or joke with him and he sort of joked back but generally acted disinterested and cold. He asked me some questions and I would answer but he‚Äôd kind of cut in with something sort of unpleasant or derailing to say. It made me wonder why he asked me out at all.

He was also down on himself. After I told him a story about something I did, he said something like ‚Äúoh, I guess you‚Äôre just out of my league, then?‚Äù And I was really shocked by him saying that because I didn‚Äôt think it was really a ‚Äúleagues‚Äù kind of thing - he had a lot going for him that I guess he just didn‚Äôt see. He said he was half kidding, but I felt uncomfortable. 

At a point, I would just say something nice to him and then ask him a question in an engaged way. He would give flat, serious answers.

We ended the date on a so-so note, but I just told him to text me. He said he felt like this date went better than our first (it didn‚Äôt - he was very sweet on the first date and I way preferred that). I won‚Äôt initiate anything, but if he actually does want to be around me then that‚Äôs cool.

But my point is this: if he had kept things lighter and had a more positive attitude, the whole night would have gone differently.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,714278,public,self,Negativity on a date is such a turnoff,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mqukrd/negativity_on_a_date_is_such_a_turnoff/,all_ads,6,dating,,,,,
