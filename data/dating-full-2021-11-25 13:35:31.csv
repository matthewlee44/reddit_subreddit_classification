However, there may have been some red flags that with space, I’m uncovering. 

He asked us to be exclusive about a month and a half in. I was dating other people but only sleeping with him. I agreed to it because I realized I’d be hurt to know if he was seeing anyone else.

Immediately after “exclusive” he stops using condoms. I got tested for STDs right after. I usually only forgo the condom with a long term boyfriend. Three months in he asked to become my boyfriend. 

We used a condom maybe twice after becoming exclusive, and there following. But every once in a while he’d say, “we should use a condom”, and then never actually reached for one. However, condoms went missing. He said he used them to masturbate into for easy cleanup. 

I’m not sure why I’m ruminating on this. I’m glad I broke up with him because ultimately,  I felt a lack of intimate emotional connection with him. I think I’m feeling like the title change granted him some access to unprotected sex, and maybe there were other people he was also sleeping with (using a condom) and *sort of* felt like we should, too, but not enough to care. He also hid my toothbrush so well when I was out of town, I thought he threw it away, only to see it on the counter the next time I came over. This could be me cherry-picking. 

I’ve been cheated on before so I have a tendency to catalogue inconsistencies and am learning to trust my gut before things get too complex.

Now, we aren’t official yet she told me she wants us to be. And I was talking to someone also but I was cutting things off with that girl to focus on her. …but having a random guy text me on her phone was just disrespectful 

But should I even give her a chance to listen or should I just let it go? I want to hear her side but idk if I could trust her after that but I also have no claim since we haven’t been official yet 

I simply want a healthy relationship

We communicate well, have similar values, and make one another laugh. I’m quite in love.

We’re both very active. I’m a runner, hiker, and cyclist. We both rock climb and do yoga. Shortly before I met him, my partner started to get into weight training. He lifts most days a week and says that in the course of a year and a half has gone from being really out of shape to the best shape of his life.

He is interested in experimenting with steroids. He’s done a great deal of research and claims that he understands the risks and will go about taking them responsibly. I’m very uncomfortable with the idea, but whenever I raise doubts, he can counter them with an academic study or some sort of logical rationale. He’s got a biomed background and knows what he’s talking about, so my arguments don’t hold a lot of weight.

I don’t fully understand why he wants to do this. He says something about getting to a goal weight then just maintaining it? And wanting more energy? I think he also maybe just wants to see how he can transform his body further. When it talks about it, I point out that I sense a bit of body dysmorphia and addictive behavior, and he agrees.

I really don’t want him to do steroids. I’m very healthy and fit, but kind of approach my own health in a more natural way. But it’s his body and I want to be a supportive partner. I worry that if I see any negative side effects, I’m prone to end this relationship. I don’t think that is right of me, and don’t want to tell him for fear it sounding like an ultimatum. He insists that he’ll listen to me if I notice any mood changes, and will stop.

Am I being close-minded? Should I support my partner’s decision despite them being contrary to my beliefs?

So I met this guy about a month and a half ago at the strip club I work on weekends.  He was there one Saturday,  we had drinks and it turned out we live really close, basically neighbors,  so he asked my number.  

After 1-2 weeks comes back and I told him to have a dance, he said preferes private. In the end he ended up paying me for sex, which was good and he asked me out on a date few days after. That night he asked me whether i have done sex with other guys too in the club, and i told him it has happened a few times.

So 1st date was good , I showed up 20-30 mins late ,conversation floaded well, he was keen on getting to know me , asking about my previous relationships and told me that he is divorced ( he is 7 years older than me). After we went to his house and we had sex, chemistry was really good and texted me afterwards that he had a great time and wants more of me . He seemed really sweet towards me .

We arranged to meet few days after( it was friday), but he told me that early at night has to attend a company dinner and cannot make it and I also told him I would be at the club later at night.  The night after he booty called me late at night,  asking me if I was at the club , I said no as I was working in the hospital ( I'm a nurse too). He wanted me to come to his place which was not possible for me,  so we arranged to make it on Sunday.

But Sunday came and it was a disaster for both from the very  beginning . I showed up again late and he was really angry about to leave. I considered it as a red flag, I excused myself for being late but I found his approach really disrespectful.  So I entered his car and told him to go out, it was a rainy day and told me he preferes at his place . The whole night we were both distant with each other and I totally turned off. Few times he tried  to touch me and approach me, I avoided him cause I was not feeling it, from the moment he was about to leave me at the beginning of the night.  He asked me whats wrong and I told him that I'm afraid we are not compatible characters , since he was so easy to abandone me and this has never happen to me again . He said that hates when people get late, but again said he feels sorry for his behavior. Anyway he kinda pushed it to have sex a bit later, initially he took of his tshirt, telling me to touch him,  then he started rubbing me, I was not feeling it so much.  

We ended having sex again, I didn't came and asked him to finger me which he avoided as he said doesn't trust me  and wants me to get std tested . He said we can have sex again and last longer,  I said no and got dressed as i found him disrespectful and told him that he only cares for his own satisfaction and there are no feelings, no trust and better to break it off. He said trust is building with time.  I noticed his eyes got a bit red, a bit sad maybe not sure. He also was a bit distant and avoiding kiss me, I noticed, it was really minimal kissing. He simply told me in order to do more things in bed I have to get tested.  I even told him that my ex was way better in bed and was doing everything to satisfy me. I had enough and left his house, he told me many times to take me back home,  but I turned him my back and left. Arriving home i blocked his number. 

As the week passed I started missing him and so unblocked him and talked to him again explaining my complaints.  He excused himself and explained his part and his complaints,  he said that he felt attracted and connected to me but not ready for a relationship but we can always see each other.  I said ok better for both to keep a sense of freedom.  Then after days he suggested me some casual invitations which I declined. Anyway I maybe changed my mind and told him that I'm looking for something more meaningful,  emotional, effort,  time and not an empty sex. I did std tests and were all clean and showed him. Few days after came by the club asking for me, at the moment i was having drinks with a client who was rubbing my shoulders.  He showed this and just left. Then asked me to come to his place saying that he craves me and wants every inch of my body but also respects me and looking me in the eyes put him in peace. I explained that I'm not into sexual invitations again , he agreed to just come there just talk and cuddle.  

Actually it was nice seeing him again,  but I'm a bit confused since he has stated he is looking for a sexual relationship but I felt for him something more. At times has asked me to stop with the club and I was just wondering if in the case I was stopping he would want to actually date me or his intentions would be always purely sexual.

Please help me , I need advice on this !! How should I approach him? Should I ask him out? Let him go? Give it time or stop working at the club?

She’s an extremely busy person with work, and four kids.  Five kids if you include the absolutely worthless Ex-husband who are 38 years old still has no clue how to order food online.  When we first met I had already taken a job that was 2000 miles away.  I considered declining it to stay with her, but she insisted that I go and didn’t want me to miss the opportunity.  I respected her thoughts and asked if she wanted to do the long distance thing.  She told me she did and for over a year we stayed together.  It was one of the hardest things I’ve ever done, but we worked through it and made it happen.  We also made time for one another. When she’d travel for work I’d travel with her as I had the ability to work remotely.  I’d travel back to see her as often as I could, and despite everything going on with her she also came out to see me.  After about 14 months of living apart I decided I needed to move back.  I looked for jobs in the area near her and grabbed one that was about 6 mins away from where she worked in the city, and 45 minutes away from where she lives.  Despite the the change in proximity to one another, we now rarely ever see each other.  Even in her lunch break there is “no time”.  The people she works with are assholes, and will rat her out if she leaves the office alone (this is what I’m told). But if everyone from her work decides to go drinking on their lunch break, it’s ok for her leave as long as she joins them (I’m never invited).  When an opportunity presents itself to get together I adjust my work schedule, meetings etc. to accommodate as we get very little time together.  We use to talk every night on the phone, now sometimes I don’t even get a good night text as she just falls asleep.  I told her I missed out nightly conversation a lot, and she responded with how it takes time away from the kids in the evening.  I respected that and eliminated that expectation as her kids are and always will be priority one.  I’d say on any given month we maybe see one another for a total of 3-5 hours in a 30 day span.  In the past I’ve expressed how I’d like to spend more time together and actually make plans for date night.  She always agrees with me but never follows through with making plans.  She always talks about setting healthy boundaries with people to prioritize what’s important.  But I feel like I’m the only person she does this with.  She doesn’t set any with the needy ex-husband, who calls her when we are out because he can’t figure out how to cook something for the kids she laid out clear instructions for him to do, and zero with the kids which i feel as though it’s caused resentment for her from them and no respect for her as a parent.  I try to be extremely attentive to her needs, always answering calls, being available etc.  but if I open up to her about anything emotionally related to how I’m feeling about us (in a communicative and constructive tone) it generally gets a halted and avoided as I feel she doesn’t want emotionally invest in dialog about it.  I get she’s busy, but this relationship is leaving me feeling like it’s ok to push your partners needs and feelings aside in lieu of setting “healthy boundaries”.  There are times I know our conversations get derailed as she has to deal with an immediate family issue that just happened and we have to pick it up later.  That’s totally fine as family is number one.  But there are other times where I try to talk to her and the long pauses between responses are filled with social media updates.  People tell me to set no expectations in a relationship.  Do things out of love and expect nothing in return.  I never do anything with the thought of the favor needing to be returned for her.  I pour into this relationship because I love and care for her.  But the exchange back isn’t filling my pot back up, and I keep trying to pour from it.  I don’t feel as though it’s an expectation I have as much as it is need for me to continue in a healthy relationship.  Or is that an expectation.  Are her boundaries actually heathy for her to set if she expects expects a heathy relationship to come from it?  Are they even reasonable boundaries or is she just avoiding dealing with things?  As I type this out I feel as though I’ve answered some of the questions in my head, but still left confused to others.  Also before anyone concludes that she might be cheating on me I can say with confidence that’s not the case.  When we talk she is extremely loving.  We just never see one another, and if I push for it I feel like my feelings get pushed aside and empty promises get made just to put a bandaid on it with little effort in following through, “kicking the can down the street”",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1129644,public,self,The fine line between boundaries and plain just not wanting to do something,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r208g1/the_fine_line_between_boundaries_and_plain_just/,no_ads,0,

So I have an ex who I am still finding out or you know when something clicks in your brain and it's an ""OH!"" moment, that I was lied to about like 90% of things about him.  
First he told me he is a sociopath (on the first date) which still idk because I don't have anyway to confirm, second he told me that he was a LoL professional player which you know could be I don't care too much and didn't look in to it but now I was searching and didn't find any evidence of that. Next he told me he had an apartment with his ex and he is trying to sell it (lots of money) and never wanted to show me, that he had a car which she used and never showed me - and of course he said it's not my bussiness and I don't care about materialistic things like that but I am very curious and also I am an open book in every way so I thought I could know things too, no? Also one time I heard a conversation with his friends about another apartment in another city and I was like wtf why didn't you tell me and he just tried to convince me he told me (and I know 100% he never did) And he always told me he will show me , later that not anymore because I don't behave , that I'm not his wife yet etc. Whenever I asked he shut it down or made me feel bad about it and a year later he put this as the reason of breaking up that ""I ask too many questions"". I now came to understand most of it is probably a lie as I didn't find any evidence of anything like that, but I still wonder why? Why would you lie about things you can prove later? Like how can you lie about having a house or flat or something - if we would stay together for years then what? And I also never gave an impression to be the type to care about things like that that he would feel the need to make up this big things :/. And I also wonder did everyone play his game against me or did he bamboozle his friends also to believing this?

Oh yeah and also made me then feel bad about not having enough going for me and that what he ""has to gain from me"" (I'm 21 and finishing my bachelor's degree lol)

It’s gone well; very little anxiety. I’ve been on 3 dates since I started about 3 weeks ago. I’ve gotten 3 numbers and they are all interested in going on another date after the holidays. However, the last girl(F/31) I went on a date with— I really felt chemistry. 

We are getting together this weekend. All of a sudden, I feel like I have something to lose and all this anxiety and self doubt has come rushing back. Does she like me?! Why does she like me?! Is this just how she is with all her dates?!

I’ve listed all the “evidence” I can think of that would support her truly liking me:

-	She sent a message within an hour of our first date ending, saying she had a great time.
-	I responded saying I felt the same and asked her to go out again— she said yes and gave me her number.
-	She’s texted me everyday since then— good mornings, how was your day, etc. She even said that the photo of my dog I sent on Monday lifted her spirits, and she wants to make that a regular Monday thing. (Just how many Mondays are we envisioning, here?)
-	She sent photos of a cheesecake she was making for the holiday and said she would make me one sometime.
-	While we agreed to a second date the night of our first, we didn’t discuss details. The next day she came right out and said, “When can I see you again?!”

Twice after that on the way back to our cars she mentions to have a movie night together on Friday (tomorrow). I said sure lets do Friday night after texting later on.

I also replied with "" Theres definitely no expectations I have of anything. We can stay out too "".

In the old days, it would just be to our close friends or parents, but now we get to show our lives off to the distant acquaintances or old tinder dates who have mindlessly stuck around on our social media friends list. We make tiktoks about it, and post IG photos and make facebook updates. But something struck me as odd today, and its the way people percieve a highly publicized relationship as ""successful"" and one that is rarely broadcasted as ""on the rocks"". I have posted a grand total of one, faceless, vague photo of my boyfriend on social media. My boyfriend is an absolute angel and we have a shared photo album between us where we keep all our cute photo moments with each other. A few months into our relationship, his ex reached out to him to say she hoped he was ""ok"". Normally he would just ignore her messages, but he was puzzled and asked her why. Her response was ""oh, you just never post photos of your girlfriend so I assumed it wasn't going very well"". Months later I'm out with some of our mutual friends and they are sadly discussing how ""crazy"" it was that one of our other mutual friends had just ended their relationship. 

""They seemed SO HAPPY online!!""  ""Did you see how sweet he was to her?"" ""Omg, they just went to MEXICO and it looked like they had an AMAZING time?! How did this happen?!""

It was almost as if the carefully curated online life we were all witnessing was.....gasp...not a reflection of reality? Being closer to this newly single mutual friend... I knew perfectly well that the reason that they split was because of the constant fights they were having over family planning, and that reason was no ones business. The relationship wasn't perfect, but apparently because they could take a nice picture together, it meant that there was no question about how solid it was. Often I will get asked by friends and family if me and my boyfriend are ""still together""... strictly based on the fact that we just don't post the photos we take of each other online. 

My reasons for keeping my private life private are fairly simple. I used to be a small-time influencer for about 5 years, and I hated how manipulative and predatory these apps could be on your mental health, it inspires a panicky competitive nature because we don't want to fall behind or become irrelevant. So when I met my partner, who was vastly disinterested in social media... we both agreed that we simply don't want to share our lives with anyone who doesn't directly ask us for updates... which is ultimately what people used to do before cellphones.

I guess I just think its important to point out that while we have such amazing tools at our fingertips, its easy to be misled about what's important in life, because its not found in seeking validation about  the fancy trips and grand gestures of love we receive... its in the gritty and tiresome work of consistent committal to a goal, whether its a relationship, or career success or building a family... and its easy to feel insecure about the things that we chose not to share with others or don't have... because often we just want to show the world that yes, we are in fact, keeping up and ""doing the right thing"". 

So just a gentle reminder, that it's ok if you don't want to share the happy moments you accumulate, in fact, it may even cause you to appreciate them more, like it did for me.

Thanks in advance!

I am from Puerto Rico, born and raised. I speak English at a native level. I also speak Spanish. I did by BA in the United States. I majored in Philosophy but I did a lot of research in Ancient and Byzantine Greek. I returned to Puerto Rico after graduating. I started a small business where we create resources for Japanese learners. (Where'd the Japanese come from? Well, I know Japanese and I minored in linguistics and something happened on Tumblr ages ago where I became 'Tumblr famous' by creating a system from the ground up to account for Japanese grammar.)  I'm very happy with how it's grown because I really do get to make a difference in people's lives. However, my passion isn't Japanese or linguistics. These are things I do for work. My passion really is helping people. This is just the way I do it. The other thing I spend a lot of my time on is working with my religious community. I'm something called an 'Eastern Catholic', which to put it very succinctly is a Catholic who does things like the Eastern Orthodox. I recently left Puerto Rico once again to do a Master's at Oxford, in the UK. I spent 4 years in the workforce, which means that I'm older than my peers - and working ages you a lot. People who have only been students their whole lives act very differently.

In short: I am Puerto Rican, which does often make me 'other' when with my peers outside of PR. I surround myself with Japanese media for work but I'm not 'interested' in it. I'm Eastern Catholic, which is a very minority religious group. I'm currently in a college town, where girls are a bit too immature for me (lack of life experience/adult relationships).

**Here's the question**:  How does one present oneself in a way where a peculiar mish-mash of things constitute a cohesive whole? I'm not bad looking (if I may say so) and I'm not socially awkward, so I don't think the issue is my personality.

P.S. I will be returning to Puerto Rico after I finish. But I think my experiences abroad have made me incompatible with most Puerto Ricans. Although we share a culture, we don't share interests or philosophies. I'm very good at being a teacher figure, but not a 'peer'.

I [California Male]
In school we are taught what friendship, caring, and sharing are. These are fundamental to existing in a society, and we learn more properties and principals that maintain a society, like taxes or charity and donation.

However, when it comes to building more intimate relationships, it seems like our major options are: 
Social media
Entertainment media
Religion
Commerce
Family

There are ""public"" classes in american family making, relationships, and altruism, but they are available via colleges or ""loce gurus"". It seems unnatural that relationship theories, data, and analysis methods arent available via a public accredidation like k-12 school or a federal research center.

We have an overwhelming amount of data, observances, metrics and equipment to observe and study intimite relationships. Yet... its like the study never occurs, or there is never a official whose job it is to inform and regulate local communities into better relationship practices.

I can't tell if she still sees me as date or if she just like to hang out with me, I'm very bad at reading signals.

That slowly cemented itself within the past few days. I’ve been trying to keep a very level head about everything, and this is past infatuation for me. I’m still going into this date with few expectations so I can objectively determine how we would be together. I’m doing my best to control any wayward emotions. 

Assuming this date goes well, I intend to bring up the conversation of exclusivity in short order (even though we are already both talking only to each other I believe). This is more of a formality than anything, just to touch base on our expectations out of *this*. 

My question is: Is this a reasonable course of action? Does a month seem like too short a time? How long before the “what are we?” talk?

Once again, this is only for if everything goes well. I’m optimistic, but trying to quell unreasonable expectations. I am finding it difficult, however.

Be very observant, pay attention to not only what they say but how they say it. I’ve had quite a few bad dating experiences,  it took me five years plus one last awful first date to realize this: YOUR INTUITION IS ALWAYS CORRECT! For example, two weeks ago, against my better judgment I agreed to go on a date. The backstory, this person and I had been messaging on Facebook. We didn’t know each other, but they seemed nice enough and since I’m not on any apps I thought I might as well seize the opportunity. On a random Thursday at 11 pm they asked me to go for dinner and a drinks. Two things stood out to me: they said they were bored and wanted to get out of the house, and; it was an obscure hour, on a week night. Instead of reading between the lines and honouring my intuition I decided to give the benefit of the doubt and suggest we meet up tomorrow.They agreed, we made plans for dinner and drinks for Friday at 8pm. Even before going on the date, my intuition was telling me do not go on this date! Well, after wasting an entire evening I found out the guy had a girlfriend and our date was a glorified booty call. Next example, while out with friends I met a guy at a lounge. We exchanged contact info and set up a date for the following week. He suggested we meet for patio drinks, on the day of the date he back pedalled and said he didn’t actually drink - despite me seeing him drink at the lounge on the night we met- He then suggested we go for a walk instead, and said he only suggested we meet at a patio because he thought I’d want to meet in public first. But silly me, agreed to go and by the third “date” it became apparent this guy1)did drink 2) used the bait and switch tactic on me bc he didn’t want to run the risk of spending a couple bucks on someone who he intended on never actually dating. My point is, every single bad date and/or talking stage I’ve EVER HAD started with me ignoring my intuition! Even in situations when the “red flags” weren’t as obvious my intuition KNEW something was up. Always pay attention to how something makes you feel and never ignore it!

So much that i could sense her energy with me was way better than the other guys that would hit her up on her meme posts (she posts alot - maybe 20 at the most in a day, which i liked as it was a way of how we could get know each other) And, I mean, we were constantly bouncing off each other with our jokes on her posts &amp; in DM.
i’m experienced enough to know it was going well for a week or so. 

Then, she started going bit quiet, not posting as much but we were still DMing here and there. Through this period, i would jokingly inilitate meeting for a drink &amp; she played along, so it def seemed though as she was interested in meeting. 

The one time when i asked how her schedule was looking for this week (that was last week) for her to say she was flexible as she was freelance, which lead us to talking bit more about work.

In hindsight i feel like i should’ve initiated with contrete plans at the time.

Anyway, so i asked her when i’d be seeing her and she responded with not sure yet as she’d been so busy lately. Which’s prob fair enough as she has a kid &amp; works a-lot. (But it was with a bunch of emoji, which she doesn’t always respond with, usually when she likes what I’ve said) 

So, i decided to leave it for couple days (in my defence i’d been out and, genuinely busy in that time) so i decided to take or leave it by giving a date, time &amp; location which she hasnt read/responded to &amp; its honestly killing me man !! 

I’m debating whenever to comment on one of her posts today, to make a lil comment and something along the lines to prompt her to check her message. Something like ‘Love it. Check your messenger when you get a min’ xxx

Since when she said she wasn’t sure yet when we’d be meeting on Saturday evening, she posted a 💙 sticker on my photo i shared of me (the only post i’ve posted to my profile since we became fb friends, and i don’t want to share/post anything just to see if she reacts lol). The energy still seems pretty good the couple times when I’ve commented on her posts since then, if not better. (I mean this is like 2 posts out of 10/15 so I’m not eagerly spamming her photos ha) Just she hasn’t read/responded to my inbox &amp; so i’m not sure what to do 😔

Hate it how i have to take it personally.

I’ve my degrees, my career has hit its heights, I’m regularly called beautiful, I work out at least 4-7x a week, travel solo regularly, meditate, look after my appearance, engage in self improvement and I do my best to be a good person. I apologise when I’m wrong and I would do anything for my family and the ones I love. I have ADHD that I’ve learned to manage and combined with trauma from the first man I ever dated, I think this is what makes me undateable. 

The longest relationship with a man I’ve ever had is 6.5 months, he was 29 at the time. He turned around and said he couldn’t see himself marrying me or having children with me, so we called it a day and he proposed to his next girlfriend a year later. That boyfriend ticked every one of my boxes: tall, educated, decent looking, great family, wealthy, slick and successful. I helped to explore sex for the first time, because at first he struggled to do anything, he used to lose his erection if I gave him a blowjob. But we worked through it gently. But even then I felt trapped, like I wasn’t being my true self. I didn’t tell him about my ADHD, my past trauma. He violated several of my boundaries on a serious level, lied / changed his narrative constantly but he was still able to settle down and marry after me. 

The last boyfriend I had was 26, almost 2 years back. I told him about my adhd, but not explicitly about the trauma. I never have told any man properly about that since one boyfriend at 23, tbh. But this one would call me in the middle of the working day to talk about very serious topics that would trigger my trauma. I would spend my evenings in hospitals with his mentally ill mother. He lied to me saying he understood my cultural restraints and heritage.  Eventually he turned around and insulted my family, when I got upset but later apologised, he accused me of being domestically abusive and that he couldn’t be with me because of my condition. 

I sought therapy after that because I believed him. I’m being kinder to myself. But I can’t shake off the feeling there is something wrong with me that I’ve never had a boyfriend longer than 6 months. These men usually say it’s because of my family or my condition. I don’t know. 

I date regularly, and usually it never goes anywhere. I dated a man for 3 months who was 13 years older, with an ex wife and kids and I never even liked him. I broke things off with a successful finance man after we had 4 dates in 9 days and I panicked. I ghosted a several more because I felt there was something off or red flags. I get the ick very easily. The common denominator each time is me. I’m the problem it feels. Each time, the man moves on and has a serious long term relationship after me. 

What do you think? Is it my adhd or is it the fact I’ve never really opened up or showed my honest self to man that I feel trapped and deeply unhappy each time, and that’s why it tanks? Or perhaps that I’m allowing my boundaries to be violated which is why?

**This is the story, short and simple**: I met a girl in my driving school, I briefly spoke to her and I feel like I made a good 1st impression. On the 2nd day, I talked to her and it didn't go too well (or at least, I think it didn't go too well, maybe she didn't see it that way). Keep in my mind that we go to the school at different schedules, so it's been difficult to see her again. So, the next time I find her or come across her, I need to take her number and I need some sort of a fast method or a line, something that works, something like those lines ""I think/want us to be friends, let me have your number"", but not like that exactly, I just happen to find those lines cringe somehow, so I need something more authentic and fast, as in I don't want to waste time.

**And this is the story, in details:** I was at my driving school, just outside the class room, and it was an exam/test day (all Fridays are reserved to exams). So as I was studying, a girl left the class room and was leaving the school, and as she approached the place I was seated, she said hi, then I thought I needed to say something to make her stop briefly and talk to me, so I made up an excuse and talked to her about something concerning the exam she had just done (I pretended to be new in the school, or something like that just to get her to talk) and I even got her to tell me her name, in general, I feel like I made a solid 1st impression.

But here's the thing, I found out that on regular days (Mondays-Thursdays) she attends the class in the morning, and only on Fridays (exam day) is that she attends in the afternoon (the same time I attend both during normal classes and exams).

So, I made my math and realized at what time exactly I needed to be there on Fridays so she could run by me again.

On the 2nd Friday, I went there but unfortunately the place I was sitting in the 1st day was occupied so I sat on a bench where a person leaving the building will give their back to, so I only saw her leaving from the back and she didn't even turned to my side, I couldn't just get up and chase her, that would seem weird and needy. That's why I tried to seat there because I wanted to intercept her like I did in the 1st day.

On the 3rd Friday (I kinda messed up), I went there and I didn't want to have the same issue as the Friday before, so I entered the exam class, I saw that she was there, I noticed that SHE LOOKED at me, but I pretended I didn't see her, so I actually finished the exam way way before her but I didn't hand over the exam to the teacher because I was buying time to make sure we leave the class at the same time so I could walk with her and chat with her. So I was checking on her and I realized that she was about to finish her exam so I handed out my exam to the teacher and I asked him to give me my results right there and then, just so I could be there a little longer waiting for her, and just after that, she got up, handed her exam and chose NOT TO wait for her results, that would have made her stay longer and leave after me, so I watched her leave the class while I'm waiting for my exam results. I get my exam results and leave to find her, on my way out I saw that she was still inside the building, she was at talking to the receptionist, I passed by her and didn't say hi (yeah I fucked up). So I left and walked very slowly while pretending to be very concentrated on my phone, so she could reach me and we could talk, but guess what? She used another path to leave smh, she didn't leave by the same path she left on the 2 previous Fridays, and I got really annoyed hehe.

So, on the 4th Friday (I know this is getting longer but stay with me :D), I did basically the same thing as I did on the previous Friday, and strangely enough, the same thing happened when I was leaving (she was at the receptionist), so instead of leaving first, I went to the WC to make time, and when I left the WC, she had just gone out, I found her on the exit lane and she was walking very very slowly (as if she was expecting me, or maybe I'm just crazy), yeah, and this is where I REALLY FUCKED UP, I said hi and called her by her name (thought it'd be cool to let her know I remembered her name) and I lied by telling her that on the previous Friday I didn't recognize her (remember I passed by her inside the school and didn't say hi), and she said like ""oh okay"" idk, than she said that she remembered me because we talked on that first Friday (and inside I was like: good, good, I'm glad you remember, that's why I said I thought I had a good 1st impression), but afterwards I kinda blanked and froze, I asked her something about some documents that the school required (yeah, i know, and I got really nervous, my body language was not good) and then I asked her if she lived close by (because I wanted to walk with her), she said no, and than asked me something about those documents and then we parted ways (she left from that path she used on the day I miscalculated her exit, and I left by the ""regular"" path). I got so frustrated, I couldn't believe I blundered like that. Only after, is when I came with the idea that I should've said something like ""let me walk with you"" instead of asking where she lived and then part ways. The thing is, in my mind I was like ""it's okay, I'll meet her again next Friday and I'll finish the job""

5th Friday, I arrived late at the exam, she left the exam like 10 minutes after I started, I couldn't finish in time to go after her.

On the 6th Friday, she didn't go to the exam that day

On the 7th Friday, I saw that she wasn't there as well and I was like why is she missing so many exams, and I checked the registry book, and I saw that she had been there and made the exam at the same period she attends her regular classes, in the morning, and I was like damn I really lost all my chances.

Tomorrow is the 8th Friday, I'm hoping she will be there at my period (afternoon), and if she is not there, I know I can force an encounter in the morning, cause I have to go drop my documents in the school, so I can go in the morning, but then I won't have the time and liberty to walk with her, so I need a good, short and simple line to ask for her number.
