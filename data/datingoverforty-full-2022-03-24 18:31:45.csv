I also would prefer to go out once in awhile to a nicer place, but they seem to prefer going out 2x a week or more to average places and also going to a nicer place 2x a month. 

On my own I only ever really go out to dinner like 1-3x a month. And usually only go to a nice play every few months for a special occasion like my birthday. In dating someone 1-2x a week I just get worn out from going out so much, and frankly a little resentful because often the places we go are not very good and expensive. I also really prefer smaller mom &amp; pop joints or ethnic cuisine... not hotel restaurants or Capital Grille.

I just feel like finding someone is hopeless unless I force myself to go out multiple times per week, which seems to be the norm for women in their 30s/40s in my city. For example the last woman I dated would go out every other night for dinner, often to places I'd never ever consider going because they were trashy and trendy.

She was smart, artistic, funny and beautiful - and most importantly in this traffic-congested metropolis, only a few miles away. Jackpot, right?

But as we got to know each other, more and more warning flags appeared. She's a single mom who shares an apartment so she can't ever play host. Ok, I understand, I'm a single parent too, and I'm extraordinarily fortunate to own a home, I don't expect the same of others. She doesn't really have a job, just a bunch of creative hustles - again, no problem, when you're an artist that's what it takes. She doesn't want to reveal her name. Totally understood, women should be careful of their privacy online, she has no idea that I'm not a lunatic. I get it, it's fine. But despite all that we make plans for a coffee date during the day.... which she cancels at the last minute citing circumstances beyond her control. Like, ok, not good, but stuff does happen. We'll reschedule.

But then the kicker, that didn't quite sit right with me - she won't ever be free at night. Every single night, she has to be home by, basically, dinner time. No dinner dates ever, even on her non-custodial weekends. She needs that time to herself for self-care. Which ok, man, the endless grind of being a single parent, I do understand the need to have alone-time, I really do. But I'm just trying to see how this turns into a relationship if all we're ever going to have time for is lunch and coffee dates. No nights means never able to go out and do something out on the town together. It means no sleepovers, ever, and I miss having a partner spend the night. 

I conferred with a best friend and he told me I was catastrophizing - that I should just agree to the day-and-early-evening-only schedule and see how it goes. But I couldn't get past peering into the future, and seeing that, even if everything went in the best possible way - great chemistry, great compatibility - that I'd still be frustrated and not have my need for quality time met. Ever. So I cut bait.

And when I woke up this morning, I thought about this sub - and about how many women have told the tale of a guy that had somewhat fishy but maybe-understandable boundaries ... only to find out that he was married and cheating. And that's when it clicked, that's probably what was happening here.

One of my favorite acronyms. 

Learned it a long time ago while in group therapy and it's stuck with me ever since.

Life is just a series of AFGOs. I've been in a few relationships in my life (now in my mid-forties), including one marriage that ended about 7 years ago. 

AFGO.

I believe my purpose in dating isn't to find ""the one."" I realized the problem with that a long time ago. Rather, I look to relationships now as parts of my life that bring more purpose and clarity.

My last relationship brought with it my first opportunity for a ""good breakup."" This was important to me. To be able to end a relationship with someone and to have it be ""ok"" afterward, where I could say to myself, ""Person X was in my life and I'm thankful for them. The End.""

AFGO.

I don't know what AFGOs my next partner will bring, but I'm excited to find out!

I have been following some of the forums and subreddits of most of the dating apps out there (Hinge, Bumble, Tinder, etc...) and I have to say a lot of the posts are from 20 to Mid 30's and some of these posts are down right mean. Not that it can't get a little feisty on DO40 but I couldn't imagine being on these app in my 20's and I am thankful.

* These screen shots of conversations where men or women go on a tangent about what's wrong with the other person
   * The belittling, the crass reactions to rejection, ghosting
      * Ghosting probably happened in some form in our 20s but it was more like ""Ok I can't go to that coffee shop for 6 months...""
* I assume there are more dick picks out there than Kim Kardashian butt memes
* You can find most anyone on  dating apps on Facebook, LinkedIn and harass them there 
* Perfectly cute men and women looking for people on the internet to rate their profile

Back in November of '21, I met a woman online and we instantly clicked. After a brief conversation on the phone, we Facetimed and normally communicate via Facetime multiple times a day.

She made it clear from the beginning that she wanted friendship first before she considered being in a committed relationship. I strongly feel that the most healthy relationships have to have a foundation in genuine friendship. At least that's what my life experience has taught me.

I knew early on that being in a serious relationship with her could potentially be challenging down the line. Firstly, she's a single mom to a fifteen-year-old epileptic boy who has mild autism. Secondly, her disabled mother lived with her and her son up until maybe six months before we met. Third, the father of her son has never been involved in his life. In fact, she has a permanent restraining order against the man she calls ""the doner"".  On top of that, she's by far the most insecure woman I've ever dated. The kicker is she's one of the most physically attractive women I've ever dated. Beautiful face, great shape, and beautiful spirit. 

While she was pregnant with her son, she gained a significant amount of weight. From what she told me, she was well over 200 lbs. She had a gastric sleeve inserted surgically and lost the weight she gained. She's very health conscious and works out at least a few times a week. She's 5 feet and maybe 120 - 125 now. She also was in a relationship that clearly traumatized her prior to meeting me.

We get along fine, love being around each other, and planned a vacation together to celebrate her birthday.

One point of contention is her TikTok page. Dating in the era of social media is somewhat new to me and I didn't even use TikTok prior to meeting her. I had an account, but very rarely ever opened the app to browse any of the content.

She told me she set up her page after her sister suggested it after her weight loss surgery. As I mentioned before, she's a very attractive woman who gets approached by men on a very regular basis. Apparently, the TikTok account is an ego boost for her because of the weight gain and subsequent surgeries to remove the excess skin after she lost the weight.

The videos she posts are often in form-fitting clothes and are playful yet sexually suggestive. She's well aware of the attention she gets from the men that follow her and very much seems to enjoy that attention. After she posted a video that was far more sexually suggestive than most, I spoke to her about it and told her I felt it was inappropriate for a woman who's in a committed relationship to post. After she explained that it's for fun, doesn't mean anything, she was thinking about me when she made it, etc.; I then asked what she would think if I posted something similarly suggestive. The light bulb came on and she admitted she wouldn't like it at all. She took that video down.

This morning after a slight disagreement about me not calling her as much (we still spoke daily) while I was on a trip to LA to visit friends, she puts on a very tight fitting dress and posts a video with a voiceover that basically says she should not have to beg anyone to call her. Mind you, the trip was planned before we started dating and she couldn't go because she had to work. We spoke daily while I was gone, but not as frequently as we normally do. Apparently, she feels that I should have made more of an effort to initiate calls while I was gone. Keep in mind that she works nights in a hospital ER (7 PM - 7:30 AM) and worked three of four nights I was out of town. No, I wasn't TikTok stalking her. I just opened the app and started browsing people I follow and bam, there she was. 

I haven't heard from her since this morning and generally just don't have a good feeling about things. IMO, certain things shouldn't be shared with the world. It's not that I think she's going to hook up with any of her thousands of followers.

She frequently makes comments about how being single is preferred over being in a relationship. Those comments are always rooted in negative memories from her past. From the beginning, I've helped financially, given her plenty of attention, and paid for her to go on her first international vacation. I just feel it's distasteful that the woman I'm in a relationship with and give plenty of attention to feels she needs attention from strangers on the Internet.

The conversation become stale as there was sports on (I like sports) and he disengage and was frustrated. I had more conversations with the table next door, as the sports was thrilling.

Fortunately the bar was closing soon and I asked for the bill. He suggested we share the bill -  not being petty but if someone orders more expensive drinks and food, surely we can just pay our respective bills - out of courtesy?! 

As we were leaving, he offered another date and I declined. At this point he got annoyed and suggested I reach out to him when I want to hang out.

Take from it what you can and dismiss the rest.

I‚Äôm 48 years old and my wife cheated and last spring asked for a divorce (after 3 years of counseling after the affair).  She lives in the my dreamhouse we just purchased but we hadn‚Äôt sold the old typical 4br house on a cul de sac, that‚Äôs where I live now.

I got on OLD for just 2 weeks last summer.  My ego was shattered, so I needed something to rebuild it.  Reassure me I still had some value.

My profile was as 100% accurate I could make it.  Even to the fact I was still married, but divorcing.  Latest photos, etc.  My age-range for women was wide.  Like, really wide, casting a big net.

I was on Bumble and several commented that they liked me, but ‚Äòyou‚Äôre still married‚Äô.  Right, so why contact me?  Which I still am married BTW.  But went on dates with 4 women.  If a woman contacted me, I‚Äôd ask for a date.

#1 I‚Äôll get back to.  #2 was waaay out of my league and 22 yo, pretty sure she went to dinner with me to get me to pay for her Ivy League college tuition.  She texted me the next day, but I just couldn‚Äôt keep that going.  At dinner we went to an outdoor rooftop restaurant and I couldn‚Äôt keep eye contact, she was that gorgeous.  #3 was also young (28, I think?) but batshit crazy, went on a couple dates and had a good time ;), but I just couldn‚Äôt either (although I could call her now for a date, probably).  #4 is just 29 and is a sweetheart.  We went to a few concerts together and dinner a few times.  But she moved to a different state so I haven‚Äôt seen her since October.  Although she has a friend coming from Texas for her birthday (I live in Northeast) this weekend and wants to come to my city and me hang out with them.

Back to date #1.  Went to 4 dates (3 to the top restaurants in the city and a museum, the first was just a lunch).  She‚Äôs older than me, think she‚Äôs 52, but she‚Äôs really smart (speaks four languages - learning a 5th) and I LOVE intelligent women.  In fact, one woman who rejected me was a professor at the Ivy League college I mentioned earlier, but overweight and not attractive, to me.  But I swiped right because she was clearly intelligent.  Almost certainly brilliant.    But she was one of those who contacted me and complimented but said ‚Äòcall me back after your divorce is final‚Äô.  

After those 4 dates I was kinda attracted to her and we kept in touch by text but never even kissed.  She called me in late September (not a coincidence I haven‚Äôt seen #4 since then) and said her lease was running out and was wondering if she could stay with me for ‚Äò7-10 days‚Äô.  Fast-forward 5 months.  

In those 5 months we became good friends, but again, NOTHING physical.  She hugged me once.  We went out to eat a lot.  I always bought, but she cleaned the house and bought groceries.  She became a good friend and it was nice to have the companionship.  My, still, wife was pretty peeved about the situation but fuck her.  However, my friends and family were actively convincing me I had to get rid of this woman.  Thought she was taking advantage of me.  So I did.  She now lives an hour away but we‚Äôre going out to dinner next week.

So that‚Äôs my story of OLD I was on for 2 weeks last summer.  I guess if there‚Äôs a lesson in there it‚Äôs be honest, be yourself, cast a wide net and you can find someone.

Almost all were first dates going nowhere.

I get a match. I do some ice breaking witty chit chat. I ask her out on a date.  I use both Hinge and Bumble.

On the first date I greet her with a gentle hug. I buy her coffee, and we typically sit outside or go down to a park.

I then just talk with her normally trying to get to know her finding some common ground / laughter.  I like hearing people talk about themselves, and I usually share stories of the hilarious things kids do at my work (I work at a public school).

Sometimes I'll talk a bit about grad school / my hobby of mountain bike riding / somewhere I recently visited.  But usually I just try to let the conversation drive itself.   Best convos take us both along for the ride.  I try to let my date do most of the talking if I could.

If she has a bracelet on, I'll compliment her bracelet and gently grab her hand to have a closer look (Or if her nails or done / she has a tattoo / whatever). Just a few seconds of skin contact.

Then upon leaving I read her body language, and 99 percent of the time she just hugs with her head turned.

Then I text ""hope you made it home okay. It was nice getting to know you more today.""

Then the following day I ask her out on a 2nd date, and then I get the ""no connection, nothing in common, no chemistry,"" abstract rejection message.

And I scratch my head like WTF am I doing wrong? This sounds incel, but sometimes I really do wonder if I'm just an ugly guy. I workout a lot and dress nicely.  I swear I've been on first dates that were dead from the first minute.

I sometimes just rack my brain how come I'm just very unsuccessful with it all.  Sometimes I'll date someone for a couple of weeks, and even that fizzles off very quickly.

What are your thoughts?  I sometimes think:

Maybe I'm too nice?  In the rejection message they always say ""It was nice meeting you, or you're a nice guy.""

Sometimes I think I have a weird nervous energy that's off putting.  Or maybe I'm coming off as way too platonic.  I just don't know.

We met through work and had a connection for years before I acted on it by asking him out. He is a lovely and caring person and he ‚Äúgets‚Äù me in a way that a lot of people don‚Äôt. He has all his Life Shit(TM) together which is refreshing change from a lot of the guys I have dated basically my entire life up until this point. 

My struggle lies with his relationship with his daughter (18), which I would describe as codependent and enmeshed. She and I get along well. She is a sweet, smart, amazing person and I love her. She has had problems with anxiety and depression her whole life and experienced suicidal ideation in the past as recently as 2-3 years ago. It was a really scary time but these days she is doing well. She gets good grades, spends time with friends, and seems as well off as anyone living in this world during this garbage time in history. 

Here are a few examples of things that don‚Äôt sit right with me. 

1. She cannot comfortably be alone. It makes her too anxious. It is so extreme that the other day he and I had plans to go to my house after the three of us had dinner. She asked if we could wait at home with her until her friend came to pick her up. She could not tell us when this would be. He asked her if she could sit and watch tv until her friend came, and I was not in the room but he said she ‚Äústarted panicking‚Äù when he proposed this. As a compromise (I was volunteered), I drove 20 miles out of my way to take her to her friend‚Äôs house so she wouldn‚Äôt have to sit by herself. Mind you she has a license and her car. She just didn‚Äôt want to drive. I was really not happy about this. I told him it was unreasonable that she can‚Äôt be alone for short amounts of time. He will listen to me without getting mad about it but he has nothing but excuses for her. He said ‚Äúwhat do you want me to do, just coldly walk out the door? She had been crying earlier in the day.‚Äù This seems to me an extremely low stakes situation that did not call for this. 
2. His sister had a super bowl party, she came with us (he drove all of us). She mentioned she was in a really bad mood on the way there. Once we got there, she got for real angry because the sister didn‚Äôt have Doritos, when she had said at some earlier point that she would have Doritos. BF came up to me in a panic and said he has to take Daughter home right away because she is upset and crying. I find out later this is because of the Doritos and because the aunt was ""getting on her nerves."" They live about 10 minutes away. He said he might need to stay at home with her because she was so upset, which didn‚Äôt end up happening. 
3. She skips school for various maladies, anxiety and headaches and etc., but none of this ever stops her for doing things that she wants to do. She is with her friends whenever she wants regardless of anything else. Meaning that she is fine doing things she likes but if things start not going her way that is when this panic mode sets in for her and subsequently him. 

His big concern is for her mental health. Like I said it was quite a scare a few years ago but she is in so much of a better place now. He says her mom is such a bitch (this seems true from the things I hear she says but of course that's only one side of the story) that he feels like it‚Äôs his place to be that more nurturing parent for her. I told him he's just as unhealthy just in the opposite direction. 

All of this is really starting to bother me. And of course I‚Äôm not her mom or even step mom so I feel like it‚Äôs not even my place to have an opinion but it feels really sick and unhealthy. I feel like me and him don‚Äôt even have our own relationship, instead like I am a third wheel on their relationship. 

She is set to go away to school a couple of hours away in the fall and based on the level of what I perceive her coping skills to be and all the times that he stops everything to ‚Äúrescue‚Äù her from uncomfortable feelings, this really makes me doubt that she will be able to tolerate being away from home. I do believe she is capable but she has just never had to stretch those type of emotional muscles before. I really don‚Äôt see her being able to make it through a whole semester.
