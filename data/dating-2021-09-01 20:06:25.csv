2,pg80ou,1630547090,Bf not asking about/wishing me luck for major interview,"I need advice. Have been dating a guy for a month now officially (seeing each other for a few months casually before that). Had two major interviews last week that I’d told him about and how I was super nervous for them. He didn’t wish me good luck or ask me about how they went at all. When I asked about his day he didn’t even ask how mine was. I eventually had a chat a few days later I told him this had upset me that he didn’t seem interested in such a big event for me and that it felt one sided in that he never seemed that interested in how my week was going. He seemed really apologetic about not asking about the interview at least. 

Fast forward to this week, told him heaps of times when we were chatting that I was prepping for an interview etc (he asked no questions didn’t even ask which company). Well he didn’t wish me good luck and then we had dinner together that night and didn’t ask about it until I’d casually mentioned it twice. 

Not sure what to do - he seems into me but it feels very one sided and that he’s not really interested in what’s happening with my life. 

Advice?? Not sure what to do or whether to bring it up again or with him or not.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pg80ou/bf_not_asking_aboutwishing_me_luck_for_major/

This time I decided to wait and see if he would text me and it’s been 3 days that I have been left on read.

7,pg8h66,1630548722,"""Do you hate me?""","I was dating this girl for maybe 2 months. I thought things were going well; we would usually see each other about 3 times/week. By the end of the first month, she would always tell me how she thought we fit well together. Without having made any plans, she would just come over after she finished work, and we would just cool out. It was great.

Then out of the blue, after she came over three nights in a row, she just stopped reaching out. I would text her something, and she'd send a quick reply, but it was never anything that would keep the conversation going. It was about a week of this before I asked her what was going on, and she said she found another guy, and she wanted to follow her heart and blah blah blah...

I was completely blindsided. She led me to believe that we were working toward a relationship only to cut it off without any warning. And if I hadn't asked what was going on, she might have never said anything. I blocked her number, because fuck that.

It's been about a month, and I recently went to delete her number when I saw a blocked message from her asking ""Do you hate me?"" I'm not going to respond to it, and I wouldn't have if I caught it earlier either, but like wtf? Why would she even ask that? Why would she care what I thought, when she clearly didn't care what I felt? 

I understand that not all relationships work out, and I would have totally understood if she just felt the relationship had run its course. But is it really so hard to wait until you break it off before seeing someone else? Or am I really so naive to think that I was the only person she was seeing?

TLDR: She wants to know if I hate her after she started seeing someone else while we were together instead of breaking it off first.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pg8h66/do_you_hate_me/

He’s very jealous of my guy friend who I don’t want and also doesn’t want me. I honestly could care less he tries to control me from being friends with him. I keep saying that is so unnecessary and unfair and I won’t do it. He’s done a lot of stuff I didn’t like but I didn’t control him. For example, he bought a pet he knew I was allergic to and tried to force me to be around it after I already said no. He’s asked me to stop being friends with that guy friend and I won’t do it for him.
He has been snooping through my phone and it’s gotten to the point that it’s so ridiculous I can’t even believe how jealous he is of absolutely everything.

10,pg8rn6,1630549759,Am I crazy? Or just being made to feel crazy,"Strap in- this one is long. But oh could I use the advice and assurance.

Three years ago, I (29F at the time) went on an amazing first date with B (31M). I was smitten. We dated for about six weeks and I couldn’t have been happier. Then, his mother died in a freak car accident and it was over between us as he was grieving and not in the head space for a new relationship. Two months later, his dad died of cancer. Throughout the few months following, I saw him a few times but his treatment of me progressively got worse as far as hot/cold, mind games, etc. I gave him a free pass due to the grief and trauma for awhile but eventually it reached its head, and I couldn’t do it anymore

Fast forward almost three years later, we reconnected via Instagram. I admittedly have never stopped thinking of him and I wanted to see if maybe the timing could be better for us now, and threw him a follow and he followed me back. We flirted increasingly over IG, and it eventually turned into a real date plan. He was back to acting how he did when I met him, putting a lot of thought into a cute date, opening my car doors for me etc. I was so excited and hopeful that maybe he wanted to give this a real shot too this time. That date was the best date I’ve ever had. 

Well- fast forward a month later and we have only seen each other twice. We saw each other last Thursday as a sort of sex meet up after texting all day. We had the most intense sex I’ve ever had in my life. And afterwards…. He told me I couldn’t sleep there because it was a weeknight. Bear in mind that I have never had a guy ask me not to sleep over and my emotions were all over the place. I had always slept at his house before and on our date two weeks before. He tried to talk to me when he saw I was upset, but I just wanted out of the apartment. 

The next day, I was day drinking because a friend was in town and we started texting and he was teasing me and not taking my hurt feelings seriously, and I was very emotional via text because I felt he wasn’t being very caring. Asking him to step up please because I really wanted to keep seeing him. He stopped responding and the next day coldly replied to me saying he ‘doesn’t typically appreciate ultimatums ‘. And he stopped responding to me after that. 

I have tried to talk to him but he won’t speak to me. I am out of my mind with heartbreak. A part of me knows this is just emotional manipulation (he is very charming usually) but now I’m beating myself up for my drunken show of emotion and feeling like I ‘blew it’. I’m just inconsolable. I really feel none of this would be an issue had I stayed to hear him out that night, or if we hadn’t texted, or if I hadn’t had any drinks. I have cried every day for three days. 

I think I drunkenly couldn’t conceal my disappointment that he is still emotionally unavailable and nothing has changed. But was I totally out of line?

For reference I’m an 18 year old male and she’s 18 as well, we’ve been talking for 3 months and on multiple occasions, kissed twice she said she likes me and FaceTimes me all the time. 

We even went on a date Friday where she gave me a letter asking me out and I gave her one that was the same. 

On the date I felt good she even let me hold her hand lmao.After a few days after the date  I kinda sensed that she was wasting my time a little bit. 
I had told her she bought  something for me even tho we weren’t dating and she said “best friends do that all the time tho”, which kinda pissed me off ngl. so I decided to maybe end it before it started. 

I texted her this morning saying “what is the nature of our relationship” she said basically she still wants to get to know me and there’s a possibility of her having a relationship with me. I was pretty direct and basically said I don’t have time to wait for a possibility. I have goals and accomplishments that I have to go for now so I don’t want to waste my time being her friend and waiting for her to have big feelings for me. I felt confused because we’ve been talking for a while now and didn’t understand what more does she want to know about me.

After I send that text she left me on seen and hasn’t responded. Was this the right move, and why is she so confused about her feelings now??

But as much as I told myself it’s just a hookup, it’s just for fun, there’s no romantic feelings, it’s just the adrenaline I like, I realized I am always using making out/sexual acts as an attempt to get people to romantically like me.

It’s just hard for me because in relationships I’m a really sexual person and it’s kind of how I express my love. But when I’m single I forget that sex is meaningless to some people.

So I went on a date with this girl about a month ago. We had a great time, went to the beach with her 2 kids and had a very nice time, spent about 5 hours together. As it ended I walked her back to her car and we hugged and she mentioned we should do it again soon. 

We leave and about 10 mins later she texts me saying “I had a dope ass time.” We spent some time texting back and forth for awhile.

Things seemed to be going well, she told me I was funny and cool, she seemed interested. The weird thing though is that we both will take awhile to text back. We have different work schedules and it can be hours before a reply. Well those reply’s started to become later and later like 12+ hours before she replied. 

Up until now I would ask about once a week if she had a day off or just time to hangout, go for a walk or go to a restaurant. She told me we could do those things together but whenever I was like “awesome! What day works for you?” I would then get radio silence. This has happened a few times. I always wait a day or 2 to reach out again, usually I would swipe up on her snap story if she posted one, then we would do the same little dance. 

This time I did just that swiped up on her story and gave her a compliment about how great she’s been doing. I then asked what she has been up too and then she asked me back. Well I responded, also asked a question and she just opened it and didn’t reply.

We made eye contact and I was hoping to god that he came over and talked to me. I finally left and made a block to turn around. The light was red and as I was stopped, I could see that he was still there. I decided f*** it, I look super cute tonight, I was going to shoot my shot. I pulled into the gas station parking lot, parked right beside him and rolled down my window. His tint was dark and I couldn’t tell if he was inside at first. Then his window rolled down and he was by himself. 


This was the moment. Suddenly I was nervous. I asked, hey..are you single? He hesitated and said yes.  So then I said, can I give you my number? And he goes yeah sure. So I gave him my number, and told him that my name is 901blazebunny. He told me his name. I asked him if he lived nearby and he said yeah, right down the street. I told him I’m not too far and we should hang out. He said sounds good and he was going to text me right then. As I drove off he texted me. 


I told him that I hope that wasn’t too weird and he replied that he appreciated my confidence. I asked him what he was doing tonight and he said he would be down to hang out. He said his roommates had a bunch of ppl over but he could grab some beer and come over to my place. I asked him if he smokes and he said he used to. We texted back and forth awhile before he came over. Turns out he’s  22…the youngest guy I’ve ever dated at my age. He was so cute though so I wanted to get to know him. 


He comes over and brings a 12 pack of Budweiser with him. We hang out awhile and I ask him what he does. He’s in university, working on a finance degree and he waits tables. We chat awhile and then he admits that he also sells drugs out of his house with his roommates. Of course! I definitely have a type. I ask, it’s weed and pills. He says they mostly sell to college kids. Ok, so that’s not too bad I think but yeah red flag. 


As he’s telling me this, his phone is blowing up and he explains that he didn’t want me to come over to his place tonight bc they were buying from a new connect. And his friends are freaking out bc things are getting sketchy. His phone rings and he goes omg they’re freaking out! He answers and starts pacing back and forth. Then he hangs up, walks back to where I am and asks if it’s ok if he leaves the beer over here and comes right back. Things are not going great over there and he needs to check on them to make sure everything’s ok. I tell him sure, I’ll put the beer in the fridge for him.

i know my fault is there too, i complained all day because we couldn't spend the day together before he leaves for a training for a month and he told me i was accusing him something he has never done - putting less effort. 

i always came to his town just to see him and spent the night there. even the day my ankle was fucked up. he started just leaving early after one night. i really felt like he was bored of me. i asked him if he wanted to call me, he said no because things wouldn't be really different from there. i apologized, explained why i felt that way via text because he didn't pick up his phone at all and his last text was ""i don't understand.""

37,pgbdbj,1630559940,Do I need to explicitly write “not interested in anything casual” on my dating profile?,"26yo f here, extremely disillusioned experiences with dating + currently going through it. I went on a date tonight with a man I met on a dating app and up until today our convos have been going pretty well + had a FaceTime date that went smooth. I found him attractive and interesting - only problem is we haven’t spoken about dating goals yet. We had so many interesting deep convos about all sorts of other things and I didn’t want to force bringing it up, but was curious if it would come up on the date tonight. Unfortunately night came to a screeching halt bc he tried to go in for a kiss and make out with me which absolutely turned me off- despite the fact that I did like him up until now. My disclaimer is I’m very not into casual sex or intimacy- esp on a first date. I need time to get to know someone before I can open up like that. 

I ended up walking out on him and have been feeling rageful all night for him assuming I not only would be interested, but not asking me anything about where I’m at mentally or sexually before. Am I crazy? Or am I valid in my feeling? 

I consider myself to be a pretty attractive woman so I know men are physically attracted to me. But that’s part of the problem. I’m so sick of men just assuming I’m some hot down for whatever individual and that intimacy is an entry point to getting to know me.  For me it is a privilege and a level to unlock and I’m guarded there. 

I feel so intense to the point I want to explicitly denote this on my dating profile or feel I need to say this in messages as soon as they start, because of how many times I feel attacked now.  Though i also worry this will make me look really crazy and push ppl away from me.

Advice?

38,pgbesr,1630560125,Feel like I became super jaded after hooking up with most recent girl?,"This happened like maybe a month ago, but long story short I hooked up with this girl, she had expressed interest in me before, but she had a bf and we just held hands and that was that. Then next time on a night out with her and a couple other people, she was dancing and grinding on me, we get back to the hotel room and my brother in law dares her to suck my dick. She does it but midway though she begins crying bc she has a bf and didn’t mean to do this or something, and I felt absolutely awful and we were all drunk and it sort of just happened.

She then crawls into bed with me after everybody goes to sleep and we start cuddling and all that, we end up just fooling around for like an hour or two and it was just dirty with her licking me, me fingering her, she gave me a blowjob, and I was drunk so I was telling her how good of a girl she was (like thinking about that now wtf that’s so cringey lol), and it was like just pure horniess. 

For some reason it took like a lot out of me, it sort of made me realize that while sex does feel good, that if it’s not with someone I value then it almost makes me feel worse and dead inside or something. Like I think if we built up to it and I knew her better it would be fine, but just the way it happened and how I felt after just surprised me. There I was getting my dick sucked on the 4th floor of a balcony, and what I thought would make me feel super good, actually didn’t. 

So now I just feel like I don’t go out of my way as much to do anything bc I feel like whatever happens is meant to be, and also I need to like a girl a lot and vice versa for me to actually pursue her. Like there’s so many beautiful girls, but I just find myself thinking like it’s not worth the effort, and when it does seem worth it, I’m just too scared to say anything bc I’m shy and scared of rejection, have low self esteem sometimes, but that’s another story.

He's someone I went to high school with, but we didn't know each other, just of each other. Fast forward like, 12-14 years and we've matched on tinder. We're having great conversations over the 2 week period we've been talking. He's got all the basic traits you'd want in another human, including that he's open minded, smart, and caring. Is open and interested in learning things about me, and is open to sharing things with me as well. From where I stand, a good man to build a partnership with.

The problem is.. I just noticed that a mutual friend had posted some pics and a video of him recently, and he doesn't look anything like the way he represented himself on tinder.. like a good 100 lbs or so. I know that the pandemic has been unkind to many, and he's probably very insecure with this himself.

He's back in town come Friday, and we have plans to grab drinks. If I were him, I'd be concerned with this, and I'm wondering if it would be socially acceptable to address this over text before meeting up?

It was all fine because initially she use to collect things like books, shoes, clothes, masks, fidget spinners, bags, etc. But.. but.. things got really creepy(at least for me) when she started collecting knifes and blades recently.

But I just don't feel it. I mean I feel just like a tiny little bit attraction to him. Ok, I had one other 2.5 years relationship back in my early 20s where the attraction came after 6 dates.

He said he feels the same like my values and he loves my intellect. But he also said, he feels like I have a hard shell outside. I told him, that I have a hard shell, but soft inner side. But it takes time to build it up, if the base trust is not fully build up. And to be honest, I don't think you can have a base trust after 2x 4h date. You can't really know the person after this short time. And this lack of softness makes him unsure about me.

59,pge0fp,1630572950,Is it normal to get jealous over how easy it is for girls to get dates/hookups?,"When I was at university one of the girls I lived with was fairly attractive and as a below average looking guy it always blew my mind how easy it was for her to get pretty much any guy she wanted. She wasn’t super-model looking good but she was definitely above average.

We became pretty close friends while living together and she was pretty open about guys and dating etc. I asked her if she could help me with my Tinder profile and she brought up her Tinder app and showed me example of guys she had matched with. She started swiping though some new ones and I’m not exaggerating when I say every single one she swiped right on matched and a few of them messages straight away and they were all good looking, interesting guys. 
Obviously a few of her matches were creepy, like offering her money for nudes but she had offers from guys asking to take her on expensive dates or weekends away and just generally telling her how hot she was.
I’m lucky to get 1-2 matches a week and even then a lot don’t respond so seeing her have this open choice of attractive and successful people made me so jealous.

Even when we went on nights out she’s be approached by guys who’d buy her drinks or ask for her number, sometimes she’d accept and a couple times went home with them but mostly she’d just shoot them down if she didn’t feel like talking to them.

I remember one day before we were going out she told me and one of the other girls we lived with that she was feeling stressed and horny and just wanted a no-strings-attached fuck. She put her smallest dress on that showed some cleavage and showed off the shape of her ass, did her make-up and looked incredible.
When we were in the club she had some fun dancing with her friend, got hit on by several good looking guy and then when she was ready to go home she saw a guy she thought was hot, glanced over at him a few times till she caught his eye and then gave him a cheeky smile and bit her lip and within a heartbeat he came over too her and was flirting and asked her if she wanted a drink. After 15 minutes or so of them talking and her making sure he wasn’t too much of a weirdo they got into a taxi and went back to our flat and had “very satisfying sex”. 
The next morning she politely kicked him out and within a day or two he was texting her practically begging to see her again. She told us she probably won’t see him again but she might invite him over sometime if she’s in the mood for some fun.

I’m not jealous of her getting to fuck a guy. I’m not jealous of him getting to fuck her (okay maybe I am). What I am mainly jealous of though is how effortless it was. She was horny, saw someone she found attractive and then fucked him like it was just routine and even then there’s very little pressure to be good in bed because the man is expected to put most of the effort in.
Every time I’m in a club I see at least 40-50 girls I’d more than happily sleep with but would have no chance with so for someone to make it look so easy just gave me this weird sense of envy that kind of made me a little mad too.

I’m not saying she’s bad for doing it what so ever. If I was in her position I’d 100% be doing it too!

Women get ton of interest, but choose only the most attractive ones and then complain that those super attractive guys have a girlfriend and was leading her on. I have nothing agains women, but lets be honest, you have it easier. For once admit it. Getting led on + sex is better than solo + no sex.

64,pgeosr,1630576451,"Should I be worried about my girlfriend's ""Guy friend"" ?","**Introduction**  
So me (M23) and my girlfriend (F20) have been dating for about a year now. She isn't the type that goes to a lot of parties or hangs out in big friend groups. Instead in her freetime she usually meets up with a few friends, or visits family hangs out with housemates or with me.

&amp;#x200B;

**Context**  
All of her friends are girls, except for one guy that is doing the same major as her. They have known eachother for about 2 years now. They actually are pretty close. They go to the gym together, they started a small business together and are part of the same friend group. This guy had a girlfriend during all this time, so I was never really worried about this friendship. In fact my girlfriend is quite close with his girlfriend as well and even visited them in their home country in Italy this summer for a few days, whilst hanging out.

I really like this friendship she has with them and fully support it because it makes her happy, however...

&amp;#x200B;

**Problem**  
Recently, because of big drama, this guy and his girlfriend broke up this summer. My girlfriend was contemplating whether she should remain friends with him because he was abusive in some ways in his last relationship. I actually tried to defend his actions and explain that what happened was a long time ago and that he clearly regrets it, and that if it is a strong friendship they have, she shouldn't immediately give up on it. Part of me did this because I never would have imagined that a romance could exist between these two anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

They actually hang out about as much as me and her do. Last friday for instance, they wen't to a party together and smoked/drinked there etc. and just had a good time. I wasn't there because I was not able to make it that night (although they invited me a few hours in advance). Furthermore they sometimes just hang out with the two of them and this almost always includes drinking or smoking (weed). They go to the gym together, have classes together and even started a small business together. I was never worried about any of this, just because he had a girlfriend. In hindsight, I don't know if I was just being naive...

&amp;#x200B;

**Current situation**  
Ok so now the new school year has started, and my girlfriend is busy with an internship that takes up the whole week (except for Saturday/Sunday). So I won't be able to see her nearly as much as I used to. I live 2 hours away from her, so it is not exactly convenient to visit during the weekdays. 

&amp;#x200B;

This upcoming friday I have a party that I was invited to, and she was invited to a party by this friend again (she said I could also come). Should I be worried and cancel my own party and join her party? Or should I invite her over to my party? Or should I just not worry about this at all and meet her on Saturday as planned? He lives much closer to her (about 10 minutes) than me (2 hours), and they share some of the same friendgroup. Heck', they even go to school together. Realistically I can't stop her from seeing him if she wants to see him, and I think it's ok for her to have friendships. It's just the change in the dynamic that has me stressing a little.

&amp;#x200B;

The positive sign for me is that she is telling me about these parties and even inviting me over to join them, so there's nothing secretive going on. And honestly I don't think she has feelings for him right now, but maybe this could change in the future if they hang out a lot?

&amp;#x200B;

**How I feel about it**  
As you can probably tell from this post, I have been worrying quite a bit this past week and realised that I'm uncomfortable with this situation. I used to never doubt her feelings toward me and we were quite secure in our relationship. It is definitely heading in the right direction so I sincerely hope that I'm just making a big deal out of nothing. I'm just worried that if something is going on, that I need to act soon rather than later.

&amp;#x200B;

Part of me is worrying because I did notice a small change in attitude over the phone this week. I don't know whether this is because I feel insecure about the situation, or because she is just busy/st ressed out because of her internship (which she told me she is stressed about), or whether there is actually something going on between her and this guy.

&amp;#x200B;

**What should I do in this situation?**

1. Should I just proceed as if nothing is going on?
2. Should I let her know that I feel uncomfortable about the situation? (The downside of this is that it might seem insecure)
3. Should I join some of their parties and see if there is actually something going on?
4. Or has this gone too far already, and should I voice my concerns and put restrictions in place?

***The biggest question I have is whether I should talk to her about this or not...***

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR;**  
Girlfriend of 1 year has a good ""guy friend"" that she spends a lot of time with. This guy used to have a girlfriend but they recently broke up. My girlfriend and this guy hang out together alot, doing drinks and smoking (weed). She is busy during weekdays and I live quite far away from her, but he lives 10 minutes away, should I be worrie",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pgeosr/should_i_be_worried_about_my_girlfriends_guy/
65,pgesa8,1630576911,The experience of feeling emotion once again!,"30M.I broke up with my ex-gf in 2018, due to cheating etc. and subsequently left completely heart broken. I was madly in love and wanted to marry her. It took me a VERY long time to recover, I didnt date for the best part of 2.5 years. 

Since the break-up I felt very numb, emotionless, exhausted, pessimistic, negative...the feeling of ""I'll never be able to love again"". 

Fast forward to 2021, I decided to try dating again. Went on a few first dates, and just felt completely numb, no feeling, nothing. Again, i felt like loving was impossible. 

This week, I had an initial phone call with a girl and we ended up talking for almost 3 hours. I was mesmerised by her voice, the way she speaks, personality, humour. Its not ""love"" (yet), but once again I felt a giddy circus of butterflies in my stomach and couldnt sleep all night. 

Just goes to show, when the right person pops up, it is possible to feel emotions again...

66,pgf88v,1630578942,I figured out the perfect metaphor for men vs women online dating. It’s like trying to get a good sandwich.,"Dudes out here complaining because they are hungry and it’s been a long time since they’ve had a sandwich. Some of them keep almost getting a sandwich but then it’s taken away for one reason or another. We look over and it seems like women can have a sandwich whenever they want. Well that sucks, we want a sandwich!

But wait. For women even if we take for granted that they are constantly getting sandwiches flung at them, an ungodly amount of those sandwiches are filled with actual shit. They are shit  sandwiches. You can only take so many bites out of sandwiches which seem great on the outside but are filled with poopoo before you gotta get more selective, start sniffing these sandwiches beforehand and pass if you catch even a whiff of mr. hanky. A few of the sandwiches don’t have poop but they still aren’t the right sandwich, not everybody likes bologna dude but it doesn’t mean bologna is objectively bad.

Stop blaming the other side for your lack of quality sandwiches, it’s just people trying to do the best with what they’ve got to deal with. Also maybe consider that your shit attitude might be like dingleberry croutons in the bologna sandwich that is you. Focus on the things you can control, work on making the best ingredients you can in your sandwich. Mix some garlic salt, sriracha and Mayo as a spread on your sandwich and give it a little kick. Put some Gouda and Muenster cheese on the bread, toss it in the toaster oven to melt the cheese before adding the middle ingredients. Get creative and find ways to improve your sandwich, and find the person that thinks you are delicious.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pgf88v/i_figured_out_the_perfect_metaphor_for_men_vs/
67,pgf9pq,1630579123,"Dumped by an emotionally unavailable person, feels awful","Long story short I was dating this girl for only 8 months or so. I should’ve seen the red flags, so many of the textbook signs she was emotionally unavailable. 

Despite this, things did feel different. She opened up to me in ways she hadn’t with anyone else. We would have incredible dates like something out of a movie. I made sure to not be too full on emotionally so would give her space when I could sense she needed it. The last couple weeks things felt like they were getting more serious, we went for a fancy dinner, we were talking way more, she was dropping hints about the future etc. Anyway after our last dinner date she suddenly takes a turn and says she feels unwell so I said I’d leave and we kissed goodbye and said we’d hangout next week. She kept apologising for ending the date early but I reassured her it was okay. Next few days she was super distant and I didn’t hear from her. Just yesterday I get a message from her saying she’s not in the right place at the moment and it’s not fair putting me through that with her so she needs to take a break from dating. I said I understood and told her I really have liked spending time with her and I think she’s wonderful. She replied wishing me good luck with my move (moving house next week ) and that was it. 

I’ve also just realised she has blocked me from viewing her Instagram story. Not going to lie it fucking sucks. I don’t understand how one minute we were heading towards a really amazing thing and it’s like a light switch has gone off and suddenly it’s like nothing ever happened ?!

We talked about exclusivity, well more like he said he wasn’t talking to anyone else and didn’t plan on it for as long as things between us go well. I didn’t say it back because I’m a dummy but I’m not seeing anyone either and I don’t want to. I definitely wanna revisit that conversation and let him know from my end. He also mentioned that it takes him a long time to move from exclusivity to official and that’s fine as long as it doesn’t take a year. I feel like within a few months you should have an idea of whether you wanna pursue a relationship with someone. I know he’s been really busy, he works in big law and his hours are crazy. He also moved apartments this past weekend so he had to balance the packing and unpacking on top of his job. I haven’t seen him for almost 2 weeks now because he was busy preparing for his move and then busy at work and then I left mid week to go on a little vacation. We’ve been texting still but usually we’d plan on when we’d next see each other and he hasn’t brought it up. I asked when I could come visit his new place and he didn’t answer that part. When we’re together it’s amazing but recently I’ve felt like he’s been either distant or maybe just extremely overwhelmed with work and the move.

I also learned that he didn't remember that I have cats (or their names; this i'm less concerned about because it was part of a more general and larger swathe of information). This is something that we've talked about a while ago/much earlier on in whatever this is so maybe it's unreasonable that it bothers me that he didn't remember. 

The main reason, probably, that this bothers me is because I could probably write a small biography on him because I remember pretty much everything he's told me.

In my past relationships, I have always been so used to going over the top and grand for special occasions such as these. What makes it more important is that this will be her FIRST EVER anniversary.

79,pgh0md,1630586205,Am I overthinking? ( I deal with anxiety and ocd just as a heads up),"So my fiancé  and I have been together for almost 4 years. We’re getting married soon &amp;amp; I love him very much. This year has been ALOT. I had a mental break back in April and it seems my mental health has suffered since then, I’m better but still not where I would like to be. My fiancé has been so patient as I am working through childhood traumas and just my mental health in general.

Now to get to the question, my fiancé and I was discussing this guy we know and my fiancé is aware that I’ve said I thought the guy was attractive so when I was talking to him I said “you remember the guy, that I thought was cute?” And. he responded with “oh yeah, he was a good looking guy”. Then a couple days ago, I was telling him about one of my clients, I work with individuals with developmental disabilities and one of my clients is very flirtatious in a cute way and she’s hit on one of my coworkers husbands before so I jokingly told him “gotta be careful she might try to take you from me” and he jokingly said “babe, just tell her I’m gay”. That caused me to overthink and think the worst. Then last night we were watching Tik Tok &amp; there was a girl who was packing some stuff (it was an organization video) and he said “what is she doing?, like it’s already full, girl” and you can imagine, I started overthinking like crazy. 

Just for background, my mom’s last marriage ended because of her husbands homosexual past, which is something she’s went into great detail with me about so I think that’s a fear of mine. 

I’ve been open and honest with my fiancé and he’s reassured me that he is NOT gay and only desires and wants me. He’s been patient but this morning I was really overthinking and he was like “I’m patient because I understand you’re going through something but this has got to stop, you’re questioning my manhood &amp; its hard”. 

I will say, my fiancé &amp; I have no problems in the sexual department. I’ve been holding out as I want to wait to marriage for intercourse; however, when we do engage in sexual activities he almost always initiates it. He’s always touching my boobs (has to have a handful before he sleeps lol), and my butt. &amp; last year for his birthday I purchased some lingerie but I ended up not wearing it &amp; he was annoyed that I didn’t wear it so there’s that. 

I talked to my therapist about it &amp; she said “I don’t want to say thus because I don’t want to make you more anxious but I mean I could see why you asked him if he was gay or not” &amp; that made me overthink even more lol

I guess my question is am I overthinking? Or do I have reasons to be worried?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pgh0md/am_i_overthinking_i_deal_with_anxiety_and_ocd/

81,pgh2e5,1630586392,I've been ghosted and I'm really shocked,"Hi there. This is actually my first Reddit post ever. Shame it's about such a pathetic situation lol. It is rather long so please bare with me. TLDR at the end of the post. 

I met this guy (22) on Tinder the first week of August. We didn't actually talk on Tinder because he ""didn't tend to answer as fast as on Instagram"", so we moved onto Instagram and had a great talk about things we had in common. A few days later, he asked me my number and I gave it to him, as I wanted to keep talking to him.

We texted each other for a whole week and then he asked me out. According to him, he wasn't much of an outgoing person, but proposed for us to meet in a very nice bar in the city. We spend a great time, talking and making connections, he seemed invested and so was I. At the end of the date, he confessed he had planned to hook up. Of course I said no, it was the first time I saw him lol. Plus, I told him I didn't like casual things, one-night stands, etc. So, he kinda made up his mind and said ""well, I liked tonight, let's see what happens if we keep dating"". We even shared a little kiss that night. 

We kept on chatting through WhatsApp and all the conversations were entertaining and interesting. We had a good time talking about everything. Must say he kinda replied fast, sent voice notes and everything. He planned our second date by the end of that week.

Second date was awesome too. We went for a coffee, talked a lot, and finished things early. After that, we were in the car wondering what to do next. We confessed each other our feelings (nothing about love, of course, we just used the word 'like') and agreed to 'take things slow', relationship-like I guess because twenty minutes later we were making out and taking our clothes off lol. 

We spent a great time there and I could tell he started to develop more feelings after that. Like, can you tell the difference between lovemaking and casual s3x? I could but maybe I'm delusional. Must say that he clarified that night that ""he didn't know what kind of relationship he wanted"" and I was like ""let's enjoy the moment, shall we""? (even though, and I repeat, I don't like casual things and hoped for this relationship to develop into something deeper in the future).

After he dropped me home, he texted me and told me he liked everything we went through that day. I was feeling happy and, obviously, started to develop deeper feelings for him.

The third week we texted each other, University classes had started and, even if texting didn't happen that often (we didn't talk for a few days even), we still managed to send some messages to each other. I'd say even flirty and romantic kind of texts. Things were going well, I guess.

Last weekend, we went to the park and talked about stuff while having a walk. Then, we were sitting on a beach and looked like a couple, we hugged, we made out, we talked about deep stuff such as love/s3x/relationships/etc. After making out for a while, we decided to go somewhere else to... well, you know. Spend a great time, again. The only thing that I didn't like is that he started talking about his celebrity crush and how perfect she was. Like, I wouldn't have minded in a normal situation but while in bed, naked? Boy, please lol. Unrelated, I guess. 

We exchanged few texts over the weekend but everything was cool. On Monday, he left me on read. I didn't want to bother him as he had told me he was going through finals and important Uni stuff, so we didn't text each other on Tuesday either. I missed him but I don't like to bother people, you see. Yesterday, I realized that he had softblocked me on IG and fully blocked me on WhatsApp, even he blocked me on freaking TikTok. What the hell!? I felt so confused and I'm still practically frozen. I sent him a DM on IG but then deleted it because it didn't felt right. Technically, I haven't contacted him. 

Honestly, the best thing to do would be to move on but it feels hard to do. I had some strong feelings for this guy and, unless he's a freaking psychopath, I believe he had developed some strong feelings too. I would be lying if I told you I wouldn't like to know his reasons. Also, although it is not right, I really hope he comes back, although I wouldn't know what to do lol. 

What shall I do now? What shall I do if he comes back? What if he doesn't? These are the questions running through my head rn. 

Ok, now I need your advice about the whole situation, even if it is based on your own experience as a ghoster/ghostee. And if you have to be brutally honest, please do lol. 

TLDR things were going pretty well with this guy and he suddenly ghosted me in every social media app we were friends in. I'm shocked.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pgh2e5/ive_been_ghosted_and_im_really_shocked/
82,pgh6yy,1630586840,"How do I get my girlfriend to lose weight, in a nice way we both can enjoy.","My girlfriend and I have been dating for almost a year now, and she’s kinda heavy set you know? But I love her so much for her personality but she has so me things I don’t like. She’s always been that way, but when we got together we laid out this list of things we wanted from each other for our future, like goals for the ideal relationship we wanted. We didn’t go crazy on each other. This was her list “get a stable job, eventually, make more than I do now, open up more about my feelings to her and be patient with her when she has anxiety attacks.”I thought, “that’s reasonable and I get it, she wants to be loved and have security”. So I made a list which wasn’t long, and all I asked was, “to cook my food, and lose a little weight”. Now I tried to laugh afterwards to soften the blow, because I know how hard it is for young girls that have body issues, I’ve had them myself. I thought it was reasonable and she wanted it for herself too. Then she goes on this rant, “ Are you serious, that’s just mean, why can’t you love me for me.” It’s not like I told her something that she can’t change, or that she doesn’t want to change herself. I didn’t get up in this fit about her wanting me to make more money like it’s a magic wand 🪄 and poof I make 100k now. How can I tell her in a nice way that she needs to change, because if I’m being honest it’s getting ridiculous.

Edit: I don’t want anyone saying how I just need to leave if I don’t like it, because I love her and I don’t want her to leave I just want her to change. Give some real advice not some soapbox about how I need to accept something I don’t want.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pgh6yy/how_do_i_get_my_girlfriend_to_lose_weight_in_a/

I replied I was back in my country something like 9 hours after he texted me back, so he read my text and didn’t answer anymore. I couldn’t see him this time around because he stayed in his city for work reasons, it kinda makes me sad because I remember we had so much to talk about. I don’t know if he would be interested if it wasn’t we live so far away, anyway if he was interested I wonder why he didn’t keep the conversation going. What do you think and what should I do?

85,pghjgg,1630588078,I asked a guy out for the first time and he completely ignored me,"I’ve had a huge crush on this guy for a few years now, but I had a boyfriend who I lived with and he was a neighbor so I did my best to ignore it. I eventually ended things with my boyfriend, in part, because I knew I didn’t feel the way I should about him if I couldn’t stop thinking about someone else. 

The guy I like just moved out suddenly and I’m not sure, but I think he might’ve been fired from his job and is staying with family. Even knowing this might be the case, I figured I’ve liked him for so long and now he’s gone without me ever knowing what could’ve been. I decided I’d finally work up the courage to ask him if he’d want to get coffee. 

I was pretty sure he liked me. I frequently caught him staring at me/checking me out, he’d always greet me with a big smile, he’d awkwardly linger around me like he was trying to work up the nerve to talk to me, and whenever we did talk, he’d have a big smile, hold eye contact, and try to make me laugh and keep the conversation going. I thought he had a thing for me but was just shy and probably spooked by the possible boyfriend. I’m shy, but I also get a fair amount of attention (and his friends were always staring at me and trying to talk to me when I’d see them) so I thought maybe he’s intimidated and I’ll have to be the one to make a move. 

I texted him the other night and he does read receipts but left me on delivered until the following evening he finally opened my text. He never responded, which hurts infinitely more than if he just took a second to say “sorry, I’m not interested”. This feels particularly cruel and I don’t understand why he’d want to hurt me when I was just showing interest in him, especially when he’s probably going through a hard time. 

I feel like an idiot and it has me questioning everything. Just why? Why would you hurt someone like that?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pghjgg/i_asked_a_guy_out_for_the_first_time_and_he/

So how I got here .. I suffer from a terrible mental illness (bpd) and was severely depressed throughout high school and barely got my diploma, I made lots of friends at school but lost all of them by the time I was 22 due to to my behavior. threating suicide multiple times for attention, Making insane posts on social media that made me look absolutely crazy (through therapy I realize this was all for attention even though it was negative attention),  Saying extremely inappropriate thing to girls and just an being an all around horrible person. The last straw was when I called a black guy at a bar the 'N' word.  This behavior was due to my illness, being an alcoholic, abusing Xanax as well as cocaine. I'm sober now and own all of this behavior my illness and drug use is no excuse and I regret it all incredibly so. I've apologized to the gentleman I said that horrible word to, I've apologized to the girls I said inappropriate things to , as well as my former friends (I did all this immediately after the bar incident)  


I've only ever worked minimum wage jobs and have been terrible with money thus resulting in living with my parents and not owning a car. I've come a long way with my mental illness and feel much better these days , I'm employed and paying my debt off and should be debt free within a few months. I have a plan to go to college and improve my life and try my best from here on out.  


Just wanted some honest opinion's on if I still have a shot at making friends and dating with all the inexperience I have and the task of reintegrating with society.

93,pgibd5,1630590732,First Date Expectations,"So I met someone on an online app (basically on my first day of making it). Never dated from online before / It's been about 4 years since my last relationship.

We messaged some and scheduled a date for yesterday.

Coming into it, I see all these stories of people having amazing dates, and also some crazy horror stories. But also just managed my own expectations-

It was a first date, probably will last an hour or two and be kind of awkward at some points. Most likely won't lead to anything -

What happened was incredible. We talked and got to know each other and things seemed to be going well. Like no awkwardness at all. Then after a while...I don't know how it happened. It was like magic. We were just looking at each other.... and the energy was so... I don't know ""tense""?

Like we were just laughing and giggling at each other smiling and it felt so damn good.

I had so little expectations coming in, but it lasted 8 hours and we even kissed. It just felt right.

With all the negativity surrounding OLD, I wasn't expecting this on the first date I've had using it.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pgibd5/first_date_expectations/

It was a very immature thing to say for sure esp when I was very respectful with her. She even said “you’ve been really kind to me,” which makes me think that she was getting flashes of how it ended with her ex since I was the first guy since then that she talked to for a serious relationship. She told me we should stop engaging in further conversations but it just sucks because for once I saw myself with someone. She recently unblocked me from social media for whatever reason.

98,pgj2ha,1630593118,Am i overthinking,"I am feeling extremely confused at the moment about thus guy I've been seeing. 

We've known each other for a month, so a relatively short while but during this time we've had 2 dates, a weekend together and have been in daily contact. There have been lengthy phone calls too. So its pretty much gotteb intense fairly quickly. 

Now typically i would be hesitant or cautious about anything if it was at this speed, but to give you context ive been single for over 3 years and in the last 2 years have been actively dating. There have been many a first dates and a few where weve dated very slowly and its fizzled out. So at this stage, i feel quite secure in myself, and know what i want, am looking for and what I won't tolerate. 

Anyways this guy, i have to admit, at first instance i didnt look at him and think wow and to be honest, i still have some concerns/reservations (i.e. he hasnt totally won me over and im not crazy about him... Yet). 

I liked the confidence at first, and then as weve talked, i realize how smart he is, and how much we have in common. The first time we talked, the first date, it felt like id met someone ive known all my life. The level of comfort i feel around him is amazing. 

Hes very complimentary, caring, sensitive, smart, gentle, grounded. Had an idea of goals/ambition, quite masculine and strong which means i feel free to let down my hyper independent persona i put on. Thus sounds really positive etc, but i can see that he has a darker side, his trauma, he seems insecure about his body, addicted to the gym. So at this stage i feel like i have a fairly balanced view of him and although i know there's more to learn, i feel like i know who this person fundamentally is. 

About me, i have a lot of baggage, mainly trauma and i keep this hidden but during our most recent date/time together i told him some of it. I have extremely extensive scarring from self harming throughout my teenage years which has been a deal breaker for many and. He found the scars hard to stomach, which was expected and feels that i am quite troubled because of my history. 

Anyways the last time we spent time together, we had an absolutely amazing time, it was beautiful we both connected on every level possible but on the way back, the conversation was based a lot around his last relationship, and what he is looking for in the future. I guess what stuck with me the most was this phrase he said ""im looking for someone a bit screwy"" which basically to me sounded like im too much for him. 

Anyways im feeling quite down by this because the way he talks about me and about what he is looking for and what he liked about his ex basically says to me that i am what he is looking for. It feels like what's holding him back is mainly fear that we could be toxic together because of my (past) and his (current) struggles. 

Anyhow, i didn't want to pressurise him or anything so i asked if this is goodbye, because although i would ve gutted, i totally respect if he doesn't want anything more with me. He responded that hes not good with good byes and asked i let him know when i get home and when i said i might do, he was worried he'd made me upset. When we were saying goodbye he sort of lingered. 

Anyway, i since reflected and let him know i got home safe and he has since reflected/reminisced about how much of a great time we had together and how i made him feel. I told him that i feel confused about us and he just agreed, so i dont understand what is going on at the moment. 

Im refraining from any deep conversations and we're not messaging as often as prior, more like the odd, how are you albeit the messages are daily. 

I don't know what to do, part of me says just step back and if he wants he will pursue and the other part of me says just keep it light and see how things go - dont make a rash decision and say goodbye or bring this up again. I don't know what to do, and i feel incredibly confused.
