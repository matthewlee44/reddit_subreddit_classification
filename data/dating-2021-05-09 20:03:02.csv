1,n8sa82,1620609128,Matched With Someone On Hinge And Said They Just Want To Be Friends??," Hello, I am F23 who recently matched with someone (27M) I find extremely my type. we chatted a bit, I moved things over to IG, he friendzoned me (we have never met or anything! Just a short conversation) by saying he was ""just looking for friends right now."" He recently moved to my state about 3 years ago and I have also moved to the state I'm currently in around the same time so I understand that hes just looking for friends if he's new since that's what I did in the beginning but I thought Hinge was more geared towards dating and this is the first time I've talked to a guy who was just looking for friends so I am a bit confused.

Anyone have advice on what to do or have any clue on whats going on? Do people recover from the friendzone? does the "" right now"" in his sentence mean that hes open to the idea of becoming something more or seeing where things go or am I just looking too into it?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n8sa82/matched_with_someone_on_hinge_and_said_they_just/

I just knew from the very start she's the one, and so far we've definitely had our ups and downs, but I still have yet to scare her away. I'm so thankful she's even decided to give us a second chance after our ups and downs. I can't believe she's still here. I love her more every single day, even if every single day isn't the best, she's proving to me that she's willing to give me a college try. There's definitely things she does that I don't like at all, but it just ends up pulling my heart strings and make me love her more, aka worry about her a lot. I really hope this works out, I love her so God damn much it's ridiculous, and I probably sound crazy, but it's the truth. I'm totally in love with her, and feel like I can't live without her. I know it's not the same on her end, at least not my level, I fall in love way too fast, but it's still real love nonetheless. I'm just trying not to bother her too much with the fact or scare her away, I told her how I feel and she's still here figuratively, now I guess I have to give it some time so she has a chance to love me too. If you were in my shoes you'd understand how special she is and why I continue to give the relationship effort, she understands me, and I sorta understand her, but we do have a lot to work out.

Do people really have such low standards for themselves? No one is asking you to act or be different than what you are. Is wearing a nice casual t shirt instead of the lousy muscle tank you wear at home really asking you to change the person you are? Really? Im not surprised the general population here has a hard time dating then.

I know why it makes me instantly put my guard up, I was brought up in a strict culture and have some hang ups about being taken advantage of, but I‚Äôm too old for this. 

My question though, is how do I kind of change this and say something cute in a situation where I have done this?

I know that him leaving will probably make me feel bad for a good time, and i know this may sound dumb but there's a part of me that think that the best thing to do is to end up things now,i just feel like i'll get attached even more for nothing at the end and i'll just waste my feelings for nothing,but there's that other part that really enjoy spending time with him, i really love him and im really grateful that he gave me faith in love again, i mean, i'll probably feel bad about him leaving anyway so why not just try to enjoy the moment ?

I know that part of me never having a girlfriend is due to the fact that I‚Äôve been shy my whole life. From ages 18-25 I never bothered looking for love because I was very shy. I started to try at age 26. In June 2019 I met a woman, she was the same age as me. When we first met, she pretty much told me amazing things such as ‚Äúyou‚Äôre the one for me‚Äù ‚ÄúI like you‚Äù ‚Äúyou‚Äôre a cutie‚Äù just sweet things like that. We only went on 4 dates that lasted 2 weeks. She ended things with me because she said she wasn‚Äôt ready for a relationship, I was heart broken. Fast forward to November 2019, I met another woman who was around 21 years old I believe. She was an actress &amp; she was very attractive. I quickly knew that I could never be in a relationship with her, so I only tried to pursue a friendship with her, but I wasn‚Äôt even good enough to be her friend! We hung out like 5 times and she just stopped talking to me out of nowhere. Fast forward to February 2020, I met a different woman, we only met up once that day, she didn‚Äôt show any interest in me &amp; she stopped talking to me for whole year. Fast forward to March 2021, I found her on Facebook &amp; I sent her a friend request. She accepted and messaged me a couple of days later asking how I‚Äôve been. We met up a week later after messaging, we met up at the same place we met up a year before. She showed a lot of interest in me this time, she seemed to regret that she stopped talking to me for a whole year. She told me things like ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre an amazing man‚Äù ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt plan on letting you go this time‚Äù ‚ÄúI hope to be the one for you‚Äù but after 3 weeks of going on dates, she ended things with me because she sent me some texts which I never got, she thought I was ignoring her and she lost interest in me quickly. She thought I was looking for an excuse to stop talking to her, but that wasn‚Äôt the case. I ended up calling her a few days later because I missed her. We would talk on the phone often after that and help each other with our anxiety issues. But she hasn‚Äôt texted me back since last night and she hasn‚Äôt returned my calls from this morning.

I've heard comments from friends and strangers that I'm ugly as fuck or ""you have a face only a mother can love"". I have had a few relationships in the past but nothing ever lasts, probably due to my lack of confidence. 

 About two years ago I matched with this girl from Tinder. Things were going good for a few weeks via texting and face timing so she knew what I looked like. When we decided to meet up at the restaurant, the first thing she said was ""ew, you're weird"" and made some excuse that she had to leave. That shit fucking hurt man.

Is her assessment accurate? Is this something a lot of women would be into even if they weren't aware of it? Or should I be treating our date tomorrow as a unicorn situation?

39,n8w343,1620621656,[M 31] Shaken,"Hi all,

I recently went on a few dates with a woman and we had both been very interested in each other for the few weeks that we were in contact.  However, after the second date this past Sunday, communication between us kind of slowed, and I had the sense from when we kissed during the second date that she wasn't as into it as I was.  This turned out to be correct, as she ended up sending me a text in response to my asking for a third date several days later that said she liked everything about me except that she just didn't feel chemistry with me.  I really liked this woman, for various reasons, and one thing that really disappointed me about this was that, prior to our first date, we had done phone calls and a video chat and, when I mentioned the possibility of us finding out we didn't have chemistry, she texted me later that evening saying that, although she knew I felt that way, she felt very confident we wouldn't have that issue.  She also said on another occasion that I was special to her, and I really think at that point I was.  As she said in her breakup message to me, this kind of thing just happens sometimes, which is totally true, but...this really shook me because I thought I could relax a little bit.  The first date went really well and she had great things to say afterwards, and we did kiss on the first date.  She broke things off a couple days ago and since then I've gotten to feeling a little better, but...yeah, this shook me.  From what she said, she liked everything else about me, but in the most basic sense (sexual chemistry), when we were in person with each other I just didn't do it for her.

How do I get over feeling inadequate and like I'll never find someone as good as her again?  I tried everything I could this time to make sure that if I got rejected, it'd be quick, and yet this took me by surprise.  I guess I thought that she'd be sure whether we had basic sexual chemistry by the second date, but I was wrong.  I've been rejected and done the rejecting many times before this, but this time has hurt notably more.

Unfortunately she had just started seeing someone and told me if she wasn't she'd be 100% down.

Met up at a dive bar since  we're both fans, and had an incredible date. Drank 5 tall boys of PBRs  each and waxed lyrical about history, love, science, film, punk shows  etc. As we were leaving (an hour after closing) and a country woman said  ""you two are so cute"" and held hands immediately after.

I  walked her back to her home(it was on the way to my place), we kissed face for 30 more minutes, and agreed to do it again. Spent the week planning via text with her, and once I came up with a plan for the  weekend(which she agreed to once more) A day before, we continued to text and when I gave her the 2 options for places to meet, she ghosted me. I threw away my pride and double texted her,  still nothing. So I gave up. Man did that shit sting, because I legitimately liked her and we really did have so much in common. I'm still using dating apps, I never really had a problem getting dates-  but I still sometimes pray she'll respond to that last message out of the blue because I do sincerely want a relationship that also doubles as a best friendship-which I could have seen happening there.

But i'm just curious, why does his still happen(clearly on either sex)? I think it's pretty disrespectful to a person to make plans and ditch them with no explanation.  I could understand in the initial stages prior to a date to a point, but after a great date and an agreement- why would that happen?

She then told her ex-boyfriend that the guy she is seeing on the side told her that he loved her. To which her boyfriend said ""what did you expect when you slept with other people."" To which she sounded super offended by, but honestly kind of feel sorry for the ex-boyfriend. Like what response was she looking for? 

And now she's in an open relationship with the European guy, to which she says its a ""real open relationship"". Which suggests that her previous one was really just an excuse to hook up with other people...

57,n8x72z,1620626084,I feel like I'm a walking deal breaker...,"I (M,22) have had trouble with dating in my teens and now in my 20's.

I'm a fairly peculiar person that would be a deal breaker for the majority of people.

For instance:

I don't want kids and I wanna stay childfree.

I'm extremely career oriented. I'll likely have to move a lot and travel for work.

I'm an atheist. While I'm no anti-theist, just lacking religion can be a big deal-breaker for some.

I don't have a friend group. Mainly because I moved a lot, but also because I just don't need a whole lot of people in my life beyond my sibling and acquaintances at work. It's enough socialization for me.

I live with mental illness. I mean, I've got Depression, OCD, and ADHD. While I've been fairly lucky in my life  not to deal with much shaming about it besides from family, it's still something that people just don't want to deal with.

those are just some of the points. It makes me kinda apprehensive to date since it's a long shot to find someone that share my values about the future and ambition.

It's these parts of me that just make dating difficult... Although they're rather moot in the grand scheme of things since I've gotta meet someone before they come into play...

I just worry about wasting someone's time when if they knew X about me they never would have agreed to date. I'm not someone that is a risk taker.

I like hedging my bets so I don't ever have to worry about people lying that they're  into me or lying that they also don't want kids just to try to convince me.

I guess, when it all comes down to it I just don't wanna be hurt by people again because that shit stays with me for years because of intrusive thought cycles.

I just don't really know what to do since I wanna try dating, but I just feel like there's a barrier since so many people that I may find interesting and/or attractive will want nothing to do with me if they find that we don't have the same goals or foci in life.

60,n8x9k1,1620626363,Height/race -Need advice,"So I‚Äôm a 5ft2-3 Pakistani male in the US. When I was young I was an outcast in school and at home and in my community to a certain extent. At school I never really connected with anyone due to having speech issues and at home I didn‚Äôt really connect with my family since they were strict Muslims. (I became atheist at a young age) 

Due to lack of self awareness and other issues i had socializing with guys even, i was never really aware of how unattractive I was to the opposite sex until I turned 18.

One of the only things that I wanted out of life was a relationship with mutual attraction. I don‚Äôt fault girls for liking taller guys, because they can‚Äôt control their attraction anymore than I can control my height. 

I just turned 24 and I live alone now and make close to six figures but that hasn‚Äôt helped me any. Living alone has made me think about the future and tbh id rather be dead than continue the status quo.

Dating someone from my own culture is very hard when you‚Äôre an atheist and even more if you‚Äôre short. Ive tried to date less attractive women who were overweight, but I could never really get over the complete lack of attraction. There was no spark. Ive tried to see if getting fit would help and getting ripped hasn‚Äôt helped me. I was able to get nearly a 4.0 gpa in engineering, but trying to get a date has been infinitely harder.

At this point I‚Äôm at a crossroads. I realize that ending my life would obliterate the minute possibility of finding what I want in life. I don‚Äôt take suicide lightly. However I also realize that past performance is the best predictor of future results and that there is a very high possibility that i die alone and miserable.

So im giving myself an ultimatum. In 3 years, if I haven‚Äôt found someone or garnered any interest, I‚Äôm going to end my life. I figure if i cant attract someone at my best, then there is no point in going on. Especially cause I don‚Äôt want to live a miserable life alone or with someone I‚Äôm not into. I‚Äôm not even upset about it, and I‚Äôm a bit relieved because I feel this is truly the only solution to my issue. I‚Äôll do my best. Permanent problems require permanent solutions. 

That being said, what can I do in these three years to maximize my opportunities. My speech has been corrected years ago, and I‚Äôm already pretty charismatic now and can strike up conversations easily with men and women. I‚Äôm actually pretty confident and have been told so myself, so im not entirely sure what im missing. How else do i attract.

We joked around, had the ""if we are both single at 30, we'll give it a go"" talk, but in my mind, it wouldn't have taken that long. 30 is old when you are 8 or 9.

Along the way, we lost touch, both moved, and we didn't hear from each other in over a decade. Through the wonders of social media, we reconnected with each other early in our 20s. It has been great to slowly catch up over the years, even though we lived thousands of km's away, every time we were in the same city or town, we have caught up, and had a great time at it.

We are now living a few hours away from each other, and catching up more than ever. We talk multiple times a week, on social media, and things are clicking more and more. It feels like when we were kids again. This week, the if we get to 30 agreement came up again, and it got to the point where we have both not had any luck dating, and don't see ourselves having luck before we turn 30. We joked about the agreement, and what will happen if it gets to that point.

We talk about politics, the environment, sport. We ask how our days are, and share our struggles and triumphs. We talk about our plans, how impossible it is to buy real estate, our futures. Our plans, whilst very different, seem to line up well in a context of being able to co-exist.

Now, the more I think of it, the more the though of her has shaped the idea of who I want to be with. I want someone passionate about causes, hardworking about their pursuits, someone who will push me to be a better person, but at the same time not being the same as me. All of these things are what I see within her.

Now it's getting to the point where I don't want to wait until 30, it's getting here fast, but not fast enough. The next time we catch up, I'm trying to work out how things can move forward. Any extra time or chance is all I feel I want at the moment.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n8xhu7/single_at_30_pact_almost_up/

Wanted to keep her in my livingroom since the rest of the house was in order, but she wanted to be on the bed. Wasn't like a hurricane tore thru it but, definitely should have been better than it was. I could tell her mood shifted and I just nuked my opportunity with her after so much  effort. I admitted I wanted to date her but she told me straight up no and why thru texting later. I can handle rejection very well but I feel so bad that I fucked up by not cleaning up enough.

67,n8y3sz,1620629779,What are some default openers you can use in any situation to approach a girl?,"I realized that a lot of my approach anxiety comes from not having a game plan. I think having some kind of enter and exit strategy or framework would help me a lot. 

I know the prevailing advice is to use your environment as inspiration for an opener (comment on the groceries or the long line, etc). While I agree with this idea, sometimes I just can‚Äôt come up with anything. As it stands, I would just get super anxious and not approach. But if I had a Swiss army knife opener, however bland it may be, at least I‚Äôll make the approach and not cower away. 

What are some universal openers that can be used no matter the environment? I‚Äôm sure just going up and introducing yourself or just a genuine compliment, but where do you go from there? If she doesn‚Äôt join in on the back and forth, putting in an effort to make conversation, where do you go from there? 

I just imagine a scenario something like this:
Me: Hey that‚Äôs a really cool jacket you got on. 
Her: oh thanks
Me: my name‚Äôs ballzhang
Her: Hi I‚Äôm her.
Me: ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..

We got along very well (similar interests, personalities that meshed, etc) and we both made it clear that we really ~liked~ each other. When we hung out it was amazing, like the conversations just flowed so naturally, they were super respectful and kind and just,,, things were awesome! 

The only caveat was that we did NOT live close to each other. 

Out of the blue, they texted me apologizing that they wouldn‚Äôt be able to see me anymore because of the distance‚Äîthey explained they‚Äôd done long distance before and it was not good for them mentally/emotionally. 

I was kinda shocked and pretty sad, because I liked them a whole lot, but I responded by being understanding and we just stopped talking cold turkey. 

Cut to now, a year later, and I‚Äôm moving for work, and it happens to be super close to them... 

And my brain has been running like crazy wondering if it would be okay to reach out to them?

These were not exactly blind dates, as I had one or two interactions with the women beforehand. However, I noticed something really important.

My previous experience of online dating seemed shit. The site I used is so popular and I had over 5k men show interest/ hold conversations with me/ ask me out. 
Obviously based on my picture and personality it's probably what attracted them and made them stay. Out of all these men only 1 was my type.. 

For me it's my unconditional + appearance + personality . I personally can't find you physically attractive if you don't meet my unconditional or have a personality I enjoy. Actually I probably won't get to know you if you don't meet my unconditional.

I think people forget that it's alright to have unconditional whether that be religion, age, height, culture, anything and everything. It's alright to have that as you filter. Not everyone is the same! 

My biggest problem is seeing essays upon essay on their profiles. And getting essay upon essays on their messages.
If  I know everything about you how do you expect to move forward and have a conversation. 

Secondly. It's fine to share but it seems people just want to have random meaningless and forceful conversations.. 
If you want to be friends then fine I can have qwerKY conversations.

For example the really well written paragraphs, I just don't think us forcefully speaking the queens speech is going to do anything for either of us if that's not how we naturally talk. Though, I don't want someone who speaks like a 13 year old chav. 

If you want someone as eloquent as well written as you then fair play I see why you write in essays.

That's fair, but it wasn't always like this. I used to be a bitter person and get really angry and sad whenever I got rejected or turned down, sometimes lashing out at the girl or getting really depressed for quite some time

But recently, I DMd a girl I was interested in, shot my shot. She thanked me for the funny messages and the ego boost, but told me she was gonna have to say no for now, but maybe some other time we could go on a date (which I'm 99% sure is just a nice way of saying no). I joked around a little bit, told her ""Task failed successfully"", she laughed, and I said ""Well, if you ever do wanna go on that date, you know how to contact me"" and that was that

And you know what? I felt good. Now I know, now she knows I'm interested, and I'm free to pursue other options and not wonder about this one girl. I honestly didn't feel sad at all after the rejection, and even if she didn't want to date me, she left our interaction just a little bit happier and not thinking I'm an asshole

Would I rather she had said yes? Obviously. But, whatever, she wasn't mean to me, was actually quite nice, so it is what it is.

I don't know what to do or where to go from here.","That's about the jist of it. Someone who I feel very strongly about, someone who I've come to look up to in a great many ways, rejected me a few months back and every since I've been feeling an overwhelming sense of complete and utter decimation since, and it's only worsened more and more the more time passes. I feel worthless, I feel angry, and I feel unbearable sadness. It's getting to a point where I just can't help but feel a complete and utter sense of disgust and hate for the entire world and everything about it. I know the feelings aren't right, and I know that it's not healthy to feel this way, but the feelings are still there, lingering like a festering rot on my fucking soul and I don't know what to do about it or how to help it.   


I've always struggled a bit with depression and anxiety, but I've always tried my best to stay positive and give my best possible self to the world when dealing with other people and have always tried to live as my best self around others. I've always maintained the outlook that everyone is trying their best and deserve to be given the best effort I can make, even when I'm not doing the best internally and even when other people are difficult to deal with. Lately though, no matter how hard I try, I just feel hateful and resentful of everything and everyone. I hate myself because I can't stop thinking and wondering what about me wasn't good enough for her to like me back and tearing myself down over every little thing, hating everything about myself and about who I am as a human being. I hate people in general because I feel like everyone I see is judging and resenting me over all the things I hate myself for. I hate the world and the way life and society is. I'm angry about it all, I'm sad about it.   


I've never felt such an intense and unceasing level of insecurity, worthlessness, and alienation before in my entire life. Being being bullied, socially outcast, and always having a difficult time with other people socially while growing up and into my early adult years, while it always hurt a bit, I always tried to stay positive about life, learn to accept myself and others as is and know that eventually I'll find myself at a place in life where I'm happy and loved by people who like me for who I am, and for the past couple of years I actually started to feel like I was beginning to get there, beginning to get to a place where I started to feel more comfortable with myself, feel less rejected by others around me. Then this happened, and now I can't look at myself of think about any aspect of my life or myself as a person without feeling a sense of disgust and repulsion, of hate and rejection of everything I am and could ever be. I'll just be minding my own business, doing something I would typically enjoy or whatever, and all I can think is ""That (that being just about anything, from a hobby I enjoy, to the way I move when I walk, to the way my body looks, you name it) is why she fucking hates and why nobody could ever, *ever* love you, you worthless piece of shit!"" And then I feel like everyone around me feels and thinks the same way and I feel like I they hate me as much as I do over every little imagined, perceived slight, and I resent them as much as I resent myself for it.   


Anyways, I'm sorry for the long, venting post that probably doesn't do anybody any good. I just don't know what to do. I feel like there's nobody who I can talk to about it. I feel like nobody in my life around me actually likes or wants me around, not really, even if they say otherwise I feel in the back of my mind like it's a lie, like any superficial level of acceptance anyone has ever displayed towards me is nothing more than a lie for their own convenience. I feel like I can't trust anyone or anything and that the only thing I can feel 100% confident in is that life is awful and always will be. I don't know what to do about it. I don't know how to not feel this anymore. I don't want to feel this, I don't want my life to be this, but I just can't see anything else right now, and I don't feel like I will ever see anything else ever again. I feel like I'm ruined and used up, and like there's nothing left inside that could ever be good again. I feel expired and broken now.   


I guess the reason I'm positing is, I want to know, when you've been hurt, when you've opened yourself up to someone after feeling shut out for so long and working so hard to build yourself up to the point that you could open yourself to feeling romantically towards someone and trying to involve them in your life only to be discarded like a used piece of trash, how do you possibly start over? How do you ever, ever feel anything other than hurt and misery ever again?

85,n914wy,1620642136,Can we be Friends After a Weird History?,"""D"" (mid 40s M) and I (mid 20s F) met in our grad program last year and went on a few dates before the pandemic set in. When things closed down we got in a routine of hanging out at his house twice a week, fooling around, cooking dinner, and talking for \~6 hours. It was casual, but when we started spending more time together and things seemed on the verge of getting serious, he prompted us to take a ""pause"" and think about what we wanted while I was out of town for a few weeks. 

While still out of town, him and I talked over video. I wanted to date, but he said he wasn't comfortable with it because A) he worried about doing something that might affect his relationship with his kids (14 and 17 at the time, he had a pretty amicable divorce \~10 years ago) and B) he felt that it would bother him down the road when I couldn't relate to his aches and pains of turning 50, 60, etc.

I accepted these reasons even if I didn't agree, and thought that was it, but when I got back into town next week, he invited me over to hang out, and it was clear he still wanted to fool around. Nothing happened, but after one more time of this I told him we couldn't be friends like this, and I was done.

I spent the next few months getting over him, improving my life, and one day he texted randomly, inviting me over to hang out. I was curious and bored, so I went. We fooled around, and I decided I was all for it, as by then I no longer had feelings, and figured a purely physical thing would be mutually beneficial. Well, the following week I texted him to see if he was free for another hookup, and he texted me back ""I think we should refrain from having anymore se\_ual encounters"". I was confused and hurt, but it made it clear there was absolutely nothing for us to have contact over in the future.

We stopped talking again for 6 months, then this year when he heard one of my family members passed away, he reached out to ask how I was doing. Since then we have had 0 se\_ual contact, but we have hung out a handful of times. He has been kind enough to fix my car on two occasions, meet me for coffee to help with schoolwork, and the other day he came by to help me with some painting. He never takes money for any of this or shows any se\_ual interest, but every time we spend 4+ hours talking after the fact talking about all kinds of things: his dreams, my career goals, our mutual hobbies, his kids and how they're becoming adults, etc. The other day before he left, he said something about how much he loved being able to talk like we did. It made me think back to all the talks we have had in the past. Last year I had gone over to his house to drop off a jacket he lent me. I had been in a hurry and never even got out of my car, but he ran outside when I drove up and spent half an hour leaning in my car window talking to me like a teenager. It was pretty funny.

I am wondering whether we are both at a point where we can just be friends. Is this possible after our history? When we were seeing each other he never once raised his voice, spoke unkindly to me, or was bad to me, however I felt so hurt and disrespected by what he did when he called me after months of healing, only to fool around once, and then cut it off the following week. I am much more cautious and guarded with him now, but I still enjoy talking to him so much. I have a good network of friends and family I can talk to, but the conversations him and I have are just incredible. I know there is nothing there romantically and that is off the table as far as I am concerned, but is being friends a bad idea?

But a few months ago I realized how unattractive I actually am and how thin my penis is(thick as a marker). I've read and made countless threads and now I feel worse than ever. The more I think about it the more I realize how dire my situation is. Not only I'm, not I good-looking but im also short with a small dick. I stumbled on a subreddit called femaleDatingStrategy and it destroyed all self-confidence I had left. Women there seem very honest and what I read made me feel like shit. Apparently to women if im short and less endowed im called lvm(low-value male). I could work out and I intend on doing it seriously(im not fat btw) and do programming on the side, but no matter what I do I will remain short with a small penis.

90,n923gf,1620645703,Going for a drink on Wednesday for the first time with a girl I matched with back in 2019. I'm obviously attracted to her but our communication has always been platonic. How do I change this in person?,"She (22F) and I (26M) matched on Tinder 2 years ago as per the post title and quickly established a friendly online relationship where we would speak about work, studies, family and dating. 

I've always found her attractive and I think she finds me attractive too, as she compliments my profile pictures and has also drunk texted me at 3 in the morning before yet despite this the vibe has always been platonic and I've tried to make plans to meet her a few times but she's always been flaky. The one time we actually were supposed to meet last year I planned to bunk work but my manager called me and I ended up flaking on her.

Now she's been in another city for most of the year as she's a final year physiotherapy student and has practicals there and recently hit me up to say she's back in town for 2 weeks.

So we made a plan to go for a drink Wednesday evening. Obviously I'm attracted to her and would like to make a move but I'm scared making a move might be super awkward given the relationship we have, especially since I talk to her about my dating life. I'm currently on the rebound from someone I was casually dating who ended up ghosting me and I told her all about my situation there, except for the ghosting part and I'm not sure how I can address this.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n923gf/going_for_a_drink_on_wednesday_for_the_first_time/

95,n92ryz,1620648116,Unsure how to proceed with my ex-boyfriend (35M) when he says he misses me (26F). Advice?,"I‚Äôve been dating this guy for about 8/9 months. We‚Äôre 9 years apart and I don‚Äôt notice the age difference. 34m, 25f. We get along like a house on fire, always laughing together. He tells me regularly ‚ÄòI laugh so much with you‚Äô, I know his friends, his family know about me but we haven‚Äôt been able to meet due to Covid. He used to call his parents every Sunday but since we‚Äôve been dating, it‚Äôs become less and less. We normally see each other a few times a week, sometimes less or more depending on our schedule. He invites me to all the 'big' things in his life, for example, we were going to go to his medical ball together (he would've been seen with me in front of other girls if there is anything nefarious). When we drive or hangout in different areas together, he likes to look up the prices of houses. He's also said in front of me how cute kids are and that he can't wait to do that one day. Signs to me he's testing my reaction and seeing if I want that as well.

A few months into dating, he asked to make sure that we‚Äôre not seeing other people. He isn‚Äôt into casual sex and I think exclusivity is important to him. A few months ago I was anxious about what we were - he hadn‚Äôt asked me to be his girlfriend and I thought this is something that he would‚Äôve wanted to do. He‚Äôs traditional, wanting something serious such as marriage/family. We had a few talks about the direction of our relationship, he said there were a few things he was a bit concerned about, a few things we maybe didn‚Äôt have in common (he‚Äôs very risk-averse and overthinks everything).

He‚Äôs studying so after that conversation he said he would decide at the end of his exams, his exams have finished now. He went away recently with some of his University friends, he was unsure of whether to go (seemed like he wanted to be with me, haha) and wanted to see me before he left. I‚Äôve felt good about everything between us post-exams as I had a feeling he was going to slowly contact me less and less and try and see me less - due to his uncertainty.

One night on the phone, I told him that I wasn‚Äôt quite sure whether continuing to have sex with him was a wise idea as we aren‚Äôt boyfriend/girlfriend. He was confused that I said it was casual. I said ‚Äòwell, we aren‚Äôt in a relationship‚Äô and he said ‚Äòyou are my girlfriend‚Äô I‚Äôm certain he went onto say ‚ÄôI thought we‚Äôve known this since we started dating‚Äô so I then asked him ‚Äòwell if I was to meet a new friend of yours that I haven‚Äôt met, would you introduce me as your girlfriend? And he said yes. Unfortunately, he has to repeat his exams so I may not be able to see him for a while, I do need to clarify that he actually meant this.I just wonder why he had this hesitancy a few times when we had the discussion a few months back though? There was even a point where I suggested we should end things because he wasn't so sure and he agreed. Maybe this is natural though and a reflection of his risk-averse attitude about things. There were just some uncertainties on his part. He said he could've been overthinking it. As a result, it sort of made me more anxious and I suggested we should end it.

He said it‚Äôll be good to have a proper chat about things as we‚Äôve both been putting things off, as so he said.

I got to his house, he said yes I have been his girlfriend all along and he doesn't know why I would think otherwise. He said that he feels it‚Äôs not going to work because of our age gap and he claims we're very different people. I personally do not see this as I feel like we share the same values, we're compatible in a lot of areas etc. He told me that he finds me beautiful, loves my sense of humour and that we get along and have fun together. I did mention that we handle conflict differently but our only arguments have been over text/call and since that's such a poor form of communication - it's hard to tell.

He started to cry (this is the most emotion I've seen from him), saying he won't be able to cook me any more dinners and our memories shared together. He then went back and forth and said he doesn't know if he's making the right decision, that he will never find someone like me, I am out of his league etc. He said maybe he's just one big idiot after all and he's made a stupid decision. I was calm in my response and he said ""why don't you get angry? this is making it more difficult"" in a somewhat cute way. He just kept saying that lately everything has been solidified in his brain that it's probably the most responsible decision. He asked me if I thought he was being unreasonable.

Now I feel like since we've been arguing quite a bit the past few weeks and he's been stressed, possibly his decision is skewed. I hadn't seen him in 2 or 3 weeks due to exams and I asked whether maybe we just got cold feet because of us not seeing each other. I remember months ago he said he sometimes questions us in absence.

We spent over 4 hours talking and it was like he didn't want me to leave nor did I. He then asked if we should go to dinner together. He finally walked me to my car and he couldn't stop crying.

Something in me decided to message him the other morning after I left:Me - Morning üì∑ I don‚Äôt know if messaging you is the best idea, but I hope you haven‚Äôt woken up too sad. If you ever want to catch up on neutral grounds, a coffee or lunch, don‚Äôt hesitate - I still consider you a friend. Even under these circumstances, it was nice to see you last night and I am saddened I won‚Äôt be able to have more of them with you. That‚Äôs all üì∑Him - Morning! I was in two minds as to whether to message you with the same sentiment üì∑ I feel very much the same. Like you say it‚Äôs always nice seeing you, and it‚Äôs hard for me to think we won‚Äôt be sharing more moments together. I really hope you‚Äôre feeling ok today üì∑ Enjoy the rest of your weekend üì∑Me - Aw, well if you‚Äôre keen to catch up in a week to come or a few months, let me know. I‚Äôm trying to not make this any harder for us but it is difficult. I didn‚Äôt react with anger because that‚Äôs genuinely not how I feel about us. I miss you, enjoy your morning eggs üì∑Him - Will do üì∑ miss you too, at least you can have your eggs with olive oil today üì∑Me - These thoughts are best discussed in person but I‚Äôm not sure if that can happen and they‚Äôre weighing heavy on me. I do think we could work through the issues as I feel there are more positives than negatives. I am aware that the past few weeks have been pretty nasty for the both of us but I‚Äôve been particularly harsh on you. If I don‚Äôt hear back from you, I will, of course, assume you do not feel the same way and will accept your decision.Him - I thought I did explain that although the last month or so has been really difficult, it hasn‚Äôt been the main reason why I reached the decision I did. Of course I‚Äôm always really happy to talk to you about anything though, so if you still want to talk things through naturally I‚Äôm happy to do that üì∑He went onto say that he hates that he's upset me and that it's all really difficult for him but he¬†**thinks**¬†it's all for the best.

We caught up and went to the beach together. We had a good time, he just feels at the moment he thinks it‚Äôs the best decision, although he isn‚Äôt fully confident he‚Äôs doing the right thing. He said maybe in a year it‚Äôll make more sense and we realise we‚Äôre fit for each other. He said that he told his mother we broke up and she got really angry. Something was quite odd, he told me his friend (who I know) broke up with his girlfriend but they‚Äôre back together. We then went back to his for a cup of tea and we talked a bit more. He admitted that he does get in his head a lot and could be overthinking things. Said again that he's scared he's going to lose someone amazing but feels it's the right decision¬†**right now**. Again, I feel because I've been arguing with him over text lately and he feels overwhelmed. When I left, he said he wants to see me again in a week or 2.

We spoke on the phone and I told him it‚Äôs really painful catching up with him and I don‚Äôt want to feel like an option to him or being left on the back burner, he said that wasn‚Äôt his intention and he would never do that as he has too much respect for me. He said it was hard catching up with me recently as well. He said he agreed to catching up because he felt like it was something I wanted. We spoke a bit more and he said that if he has a change of heart in the future, he won‚Äôt just sit on it. He‚Äôll tell me. He told me he hopes I know how beautiful I actually am.

He ended up calling/messaging me over Christmas and NYE. I do feel like I am the one who predominately initiates contact with him first, I‚Äôve been sending him sort of lengthy messages and he claims he‚Äôs overwhelmed by it. Recently we‚Äôve been having an hour or so conversations when we usually would never have that as he was never one to speak on the phone. He expressed doubts about our break up as per usual and said he‚Äôs probably one big idiot after all. He told me he‚Äôs been on 2 dates with 2 girls as I asked, said he‚Äôs sort of interested but it hasn‚Äôt gone anywhere. I was quite upset and he assured me he wants to stay single for a while, he also said it‚Äôs not like he even wants a relationship with them. He said to give me some context that there were girls before we met that he was interested but it didn‚Äôt go anywhere. I was quite offended because he went on dates with girls that he basically broke up with me for. He broke up with me over an age gap but then went on dates with girls my age? Makes no sense. He said it‚Äôs all really regrettable and then told me that it's not that he wants a relationship with these people and said they‚Äôre just friends he wanted to get to know better. He said he wishes I could see his phone. Near the end of the phone call, he got teary about the fact he thinks I'm so sweet and don't deserve this.

He said over a month ago that a catch up would be good to clear the air. He also wouldn‚Äôt directly answer the question when I asked if he just sees me as a friend. I‚Äôve decided to pull back, but it seems like he wants to catch up. At the start of this month, he offered to call about something, I think he was sort of surprised by that as I usually am jumping at any chance for us to speak on the phone. He sent me a message about the date/time tba (which I didn't respond to) and then he sent me a follow up message about a week later saying ‚ÄúMorning, when works this week for you?‚Äù with a smiley face. He then said whenever is fine, to choose a day/evening and let him know. He then said he hopes my mother is doing okay. This was 2 weeks ago and I didn't responded. He sent me another message 2 weeks later saying he hadn‚Äôt heard from me in a while, was wondering how I am and asked if my mother is okay. I replied and I was friendly, but brief. He replied and said a few things and then said ‚Äòwe never caught up in the end, let me know if you would still like to‚Äô we talked a bit more and then I told him that I feel he just wants to catch up to free himself from guilt and that we can only catch up if we both feel it‚Äôs best for us to be together. He responded with saying that he understands and he didn‚Äôt think it would still be really difficult but he understands and there is a bit of truth in wanting to free himself but he thought it would be healthy in general. Apologised for the pain he‚Äôs caused me and wished me all the best. I told him that I just felt him talking about clearing the air was ominous and I just wanted to have dinner with him and not talk about us. He said that he understands how that could have caused it and apologies and said it‚Äôs the furthest from how he wanted to make me feel. I didn't respond and almost 2/3 months later, I sent him a message telling him what I wanted to tell him if we had cleared the air. He positively responded to it, told me things have been really difficult on his end, he still thinks and misses me all the time. That he basically feels the same, it‚Äôs just really hard and he doesn‚Äôt know what to do and doesn‚Äôt want to mess with my head so he tries to leave me alone. He also said he misses laughing at dumb things with me/times we shared.

Advice? What do you think he would benefit from telling me he still thinks about me all the time/misses me.

\*\*TL;DR\*\* ex-boyfriend broke up with me in November 2020. He cried a lot that day. He's expressed doubt and says he's probably one big idiot regarding his decision.

I feel a bit upset and get upset time to time because my current boyfriend he‚Äôs amazing and a great boyfriend but before we started properly committing to each other , I had feelings for him for years and he always ‚Äúnever wanted anything serious‚Äù and when I finally moved on and started seeing other people he basically wanted a proper committed relationship.

But it annoys me because prior to that I was all about him and he‚Äôd message all these girls even though he knew I had feelings for him but it‚Äôs not like just cause I fucked someone else he ‚Äúsuddenly‚Äù developed feelings like he would‚Äôve had them prior because that seems odd. 

So what I want to know is if he did have feelings prior and obviously had this mentality of yeah she‚Äôll never leave me so I am gonna talk to all these girls then like why would you not want to be exclusive with somebody you have feelings for? I really doubt just cause I saw someone else would make him suddenly form feelings.

‚Ä¢ LGBTQIA+ RELATED
I‚Äôm going to start from the beginning and hopefully I get back some helpful answers. Preferably not rude ones. This is my first post. 

My fianc√© and I have been together a year and a few months. When we first started talking he had told me about how he was non-binary and was wanting to transition. I was perfectly okay with it because I thought I was bisexual but a couple months after we started dating, he told me about how the feeling of wanting to transition was no longer there. I didn‚Äôt really feel a certain way but as months went by I realized I wasn‚Äôt actually bisexual because I had done things with females sexually before BUT I was never able to commit to one and I don‚Äôt think I would ever be able to commit to one now. I have fallen in love with my fianc√© as who he is now. I feel like transitioning adds a whole new level of stress and anxiety for me because I worry for his health &amp; safety. I told him if he was to transition from male to female that I would no longer be dating him but I would still be his friend and support him 100%. However, he will not let me break up with him and wants me to stay with him even though I don‚Äôt feel comfortable with dating females. I have however expressed these feelings to him so he knows how I feel so I wasn‚Äôt sending mixed signals about how I feel.

I just need help/advice because I feel like such an a-hole of a fianc√© but I know I‚Äôll probably get hate &amp; that‚Äôs okay. I‚Äôm just trying to figure all of this out.
