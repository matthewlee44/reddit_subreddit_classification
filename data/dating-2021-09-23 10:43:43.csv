I am 31 old,living near Serbia.
I had 2 girlfriends/relationships,never had one night stand or felt that someone wants me.
One relationship lasted for month (my cousin introduced us), second one was 4 years long( we meet on tinder,i was her first boyfriend).
I work of home,living alone,no social skills at all.I dont have any friends,i dont like asking anyone to help me with meeting girls.
I have fear of talking to girls ( i get red in face then stuttering,dont know what to say, trying to run away )
I am texting girls i know from before highschool or when i see their name tags in store i add them on instagram and try to start conversation,but none of them is intrested once they realize who i am.Family says i am not ugly,bur i dont think so,even tho i have little bit better opinion about my look than years ago.
I am smart and successful,but that is not enough to get anyone interested into me..
Is there any help / way to take so i can meet someone.

Thanks for reading and for advices..",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pty38w/31_old_guy_no_friendsno_social_skillsfear_of/
1,pty4zt,1632412221,Is dating now just for tall beautiful white men and the women who want to pump and dump with them?,"The only guys who post on here saying they're successful in dating seem to always be some combo of tall, white, and beautiful. It seems that never goes out of fashion for women.

Every guy I know IRL or that I see only who isn't those things is talking about how they can't even get any dates at all.

It seems the only people who are having fun are those guys and the women who want to get pumped and dumped with them or be their ""FWB.""

What do you think? Is dating close to dead for us men who don't fulfill the Hitl3r fantasy? 

I even saw a post yesterday from a good looking tall buff black guy who shared his photos (which all looked great). He said he couldn't get any matches or dates either. If I knew him IRL, I would have thought a guy like that would have zero problems and have lots of women want him. Yet here he was also posting on here about how he can't get any matches and all his dating apps are dead.

It seems things have gotten worse than I imagined. I know most women have never wanted brown or yellow men except as friends, but I thought tall fit black guys would still be fashionable enough.

3,ptyild,1632413284,I just freaking quit at this point. I know I don't matter to anyone.,"Dating has been especially bad and demoralizing the past two months. So far I've...

* Been stood up not once, but TWICE in the past week
* Been flaked on very hard by two different people after investing enough time/energy in the early dating stages and vocally led on to believe things were going somewhere that got \*some\* hope up
   * One of those flakes re-entered my texts about 3-4 weeks later apologizing and wanting to be friends with the end game of a relationship while she ""worked on herself"", only to flake again two days later
* Went on a date with someone whose profile pictures were very outdated in terms of her physical fitness
* Had a Zoom date with a woman who was either stoned, drunk, or both and she could barely sit up or talk 
* Had a phone date who only talked about her work and asked me a bunch of questions about my job you'd expect on a job interview (she even joked, ""Sorry if I'm asking so many questions that sound like a job interview..."" but it wasn't funny really...)
* Talked to a 43 year old woman for almost two weeks before she disclosed that she had a 16 month old baby, and it soon became very clear she was on the app just looking for a virtual pen pal and someone to talk to daily
* This atop of the usual ghostings, disappearing acts and breadcrumbings of dating, plus I've just not been very hopeful about how I'm getting less likes/matches these days

4,ptyiwd,1632413309,"I didn't get complacent in my relationship, I got exhausted.","An awful part of my breakup has been looking back and thinking ""I could have done more"" or ""I stopped doing as much to show my love"", and it also sucks when I have an idea of something cute I could do (or could have done before) like writing a love poem, or learning an instrument to serenade them. And I kick myself and hate how things went. But when I look back I never did anything awful, and did lots to try and communicate how I loved them.

But it wasn't me getting complacent with the relationship, why I didn't do as much, it was because I was getting so exhausted.  It was exhausting staying up until 3am, having to go to work during the day still because my ex was having another panic attack over nothing multiple times a week. It was exhausting being in a long distance relationship, driving 8 hours every weekend to see them since I worked somewhere else and couldn't get a job there when they never came to see me. It was exhausting having to deal with my love self harming if I brought up something I was unhappy with in the relationship. It was exhausting driving there for the weekend, and having to calm them down from panic attacks all weekend, then leaving. It was exhausting having to be talking or texting literally all the time while we were awake or they would get panic attacks. It was exhausting having to almost always prove that I truly did love them because it seemed like they were always looking for ""proof"" that I didn't love them.

I loved them more than the world, and that's why I did whatever I could to help them feel better and work through things, but it wore down my body and mind endlessly getting me sick and gaining weight, and me talking about this was just more ""proof"" about how I didn't care.

6,ptyjei,1632413349,Any women here feel like they’re always the one courting the men?,"In my last relationship, I was the one that remembered his favorite dishes from restaurants and his favorite snacks and brought them to him most times we’d see each other since he was tired from work. I’d bake any recipe he sent to me and package it up for him. He lived 45 minutes from me, hour and a half round trip, I’d drive to see him three or four times a week whereas he did not.  

If he was feeling down, I was the first to swoop in and reassure him of how wonderful and smart and kind he was. I learned about all his favorite sports teams and hobbies, stayed on top of everything happening, I looked for trading cards of his favorite players and if I ever saw something related to his favorite show, I’d pick it up for him.  

These actions don’t make me entitled to love and you can’t buy or cook or bake your way into someone’s heart, but I guess I’m just tired. I feel isolated because I always read about men having to court women, whereas I feel like -this- pattern is reflected in every single one of my relationships.  

I’m the one courting, I’m the one putting in emotional labor, I’m the one remembering the small things and trying to make the person feel sufficiently prioritized and appreciated. I’m sorry for any men that have been in this situation and are always having to court partners, too.

24,pu14gy,1632420631,Should I feel guilty about getting dating advice from this person?,"So I made a story on Snapchat about looking for advice. The advice was about dating and this girl I like. I was looking to get advice from friends when I made the story. The thing is, one person that reached out happens to be a stripper that Snapchat I got when I went to the club one time. It’s not that she’s a stripper that bothers me, it’s the fact that I was interested in hanging out with her at one point, actually a year ago. It never happened but my intention was to hang out with her in the past. So my question is should I feel guilty about receiving advice from someone that I tried getting with in the past? Is that a reason to feel bad? Please help.

Hello everyone, the reason I’m asking this because the girl I’m talking to wasn’t too fond of the idea that I replied to her. I tried explaining that it was just friendly advice and she had a boyfriend anyway. When the girl replied to my story and offered advice, it was one week after I met the girl I like on Tinder. So we were like only in the talking phase anyway. She wasn’t buying it but then eventually apologized and later admitted we weren’t claimed to each other so she didn’t have the right to get mad. But yet I still feel a lot of guilt for whatever reason. I guess cause I upset her and it wasn’t my intention. I also made it clear that since I met this girl, she’s been the only girl I’ve been talking to, I haven’t even explored talking to new people. I did stop messaging her after I replied once explaining my situation to her (the dancer). Am I wrong for feeling guilt or is it justified meaning she had a reason to be upset? And of course, had we been in a relationship or gotten very serious I wouldn’t even try to get multiple peoples perspectives on this subject. I would just keep it between us 2 to work out or I would only contact people close to such as close friends or family. But it was strictly just dating advice. Also I’d like to add that the dancer and I literally never talk, only time we communicated in the past was like 3 times and that was only to see when she was working. This was the first time we actually had a talk, like a normal chat other than when she was working and she came to me to try to help. I also said if she tried to pull anything more than advice I would of just said fuck off and block her. So what do you guys think, should I feel guilty?

If the roles were reversed and she was seeking advice and a guy she use to talk to offered to help, I wouldn’t mind because it’s only advice. If it was more than that then of course I’d be upset and she had the right to be upset too if my situation was like that but it wasn’t. Or if even she went to an ex or someone she hooked up with. Then maybe I might feel a little off about it. But if it’s just something like you guys tried getting together and whatever reason it just didn’t happen and just acquaintances, I wouldn’t care

He gave a time and meeting to meet today at 7 by a landmark, but he didn't say what we would be doing. He mentioned he knows a few places he can take me for drinks, and maybe dinner. I get the low effort vibe from him, but whatever. Anyway I send the last message yesterday at noon. I don't receive a response, and I don't hear anything from him all day today. Fine, whatever, I head on my commute home and go about my evening. 

And then at 6:42, he messages me to say he's running late. What? He doesn't speak to me for 29 hours after my last message and he expects me to still turn up? LIke what? I text back within a couple of minutes, that no since he didn't respond to my text, nor having heard from him all day, that I headed home after work. 

He calls me, and he's arguing with me. He's saying well he confirmed the time with me, and it doesn't matter that he didn't respond to my message or contact me all day. Apparently he sticks to his word, and I should have known he would. I'm like, you're a stranger and I know nothing about you, but you did leave me on read. The tone is unpleasant, he keeps shouting my name and talking over me, and I tell him I'm not interested in meeting him. He argues with me for five minutes, using a super aggressive and patronising tone saying that I am being unreasonable, that he's been travelling and that I should know that he meant what he said. OK? He says he will travel to where I am, and I tell him no. The tone that he's used is not for me. Whatever, I say, I tell him to have a nice evening, and I hang up to walk the rest of the distance to my home. 

By the time I get there, I see he's left me 4 missed calls. I pick up the 5th, and ask what's up. He's still using an incredibly aggressive and patronising tone towards me. He keeps talking over me, shouting my name. And eventually I just had enough, I told him again, you left me on read, for over 29 hours you ignored me and decided not to confirm. And now you want me to meet a man who acts like this. I mention the recent murder of a woman by a stranger in London and that I'm already on edge, that women live with this fear and I'm freaked out. He accuses me of screaming at him, I was like ""I'm calm, me talking to you is not screaming, you're being irrational"" - but it was another red flag that he labels anyone woman who can't be assed with his shit as screaming. Like he's called me a bunch of times after a silence for 29 hours without any solid plans or bookings in place, and now I'm being unreasonable because I've got a boundary. And he shouts at me, ""I'm calm, you're just screaming at me"". 

So he tells me to never contact him again (no shit) hangs up and blocks me.

37,pu2og0,1632425040,Does trying to date still feel worth it to you?,"Let me just preface this post by saying I don’t want to come off as bitter or pessimistic. I just want to cover the harsh truths that we seldom discuss around dating. 

Dating in todays modern world feels like a chore. Everyone wants companionship yet the amount of time wasted, effort and energy poured into almost never yield any results. Men have to go through dozens of not hundreds of women to find one compatible relationships all in favor of getting dumped a few months later for making one mistake. Women have to weed through all the fake people and men who just lie to get sex. 

Much of todays dating feels heavily influenced by social media and dating apps that it’s almost impossible to find genuine connections with people who want the same thing; COViD didn’t in this regard very much either. Instead of focusing on how we make each other feel, it’s about always finding the next best guy or the next best gal. Who makes the most money, who’s the best looking, who has a boat, who can give me this superficial social status perpetuated my social media. 

Worst of all is this idea that all we look for are red flags 🚩 instead of just trying to get know people. We focus so much of our attention on looking for the tiniest of reasons to leave someone instead of working through hard situations. 

Even if you do manage to maneuver through todays world of dating and find your love, studies show half of all marriages end in divorce in less than 10 years and then you go right back on the chopping block. 

All I’m trying to say is todays world is way to shallow. My parents got married after dating for 9 months back in the day and have been married for over 35 years now happy.

39,pu2tw9,1632425461,I like the best friend of the girl who likes me,"Sorry for the terrible english.

 I've been in this friend group for 4 years or so, and I feel great hanging out with them, but I started having something towards this girl I'll kindly refer to as A lol.
 
 A is super attractive, and I've been in the lucky position of noticing how she's kinda into me, even if it's just a little. Me and A flirted for like 3 months before the first time we made out. This event was before the pandemic, and  we ended up not speaking to each other for some time.

 We started speaking again, and the attraction returned at some point, so much so we kissed the first time we could meet each other. I'm really into her, like REALLY. For the first time in my life I have a hard time looking at other people and finding them appealing, because of how much my feelings for A distract me.

 What I haven't mentioned is the fact that her friend, B, was in the same circle of friends all of this time. B was always a nice person and a good friend (best friend of A, btw) and recently I found out B likes me.
 
 I don't like B the same way she likes me, but I don't want to hurt her. The thing is: A knows that B likes me, and when I asked a third friend about advice, they were really sure that A wasn't going to try anything because of B, so I should give up. Even if in the week before, A said to me in message she wanted to be with me again.

 B knows there is something going on between me and A, and she insists on hitting on me, probably because she thought I was flirting back when I was just trying to be nice. She caught me and A together for god's sake! That kinda pisses me off.

 The thing is, I'm definitely not certain that if I continued trying for an official relationship with A, this would work out, probably because I like her more than she likes me (she may like me, I think I l*ve her), and we would feel guilty about B. So, preserving their friendship and my sanity, I decided to slowly drift apart from the group. Did I make the right decision? I can definitely go back, this happened this week.

We're all barely adults, which is why I'm so inexperienced. A and B are girls, I'm a dude.

I don’t think so, but I’d like opinions. 

My biggest thing is I need clear interest shown, if I have to second guess it I’m already halfway out the door. When I like someone I want to talk to them, I want to see them, I want to connect. I want somebody on that same level. 

When it comes to texting - if you can go 24 hours without talking to me or responding, go even longer. When I’m seeing someone, especially early stages, regular texting is huge for me to continue to develop my attraction. I have a life too, but if it’s been a day of no contact, it’s not for me. 

Other standards are the usual - clean, respectful, kind etc. but I’m wondering if these 2 things are “too much”? 

I don’t demand it, and I’ll happily compromise, but if I’ve told them those things are important to me and they don’t make SOME effort, I’ll leave.

43,pu32gx,1632426128,Can Texting habits really indicate interest? or am I overthinking it?,"I'll give a little backstory:

So this summer i went on a little Europe tour, and ended up meeting this pretty attractive guy local to that city. The first night we met we hung out in a group setting with his best friend and my best friend. Long story short that night we ended up making out. I didn't think much of him as a ""potential"" as i was living in the moment and enjoying the time. However the next day he asked to take me on a date, and i'm not gonna lie the date was amazing, we got on really well. My friend and I were leaving that country the next day and moving onto the next destination on our trip, so once again i didn't read much into it and just thought of the situation as casual, some good memories and maybe we'd keep in touch every now and then.

Well turns out from the time I left, him and I started naturally texting everyday non stop. The texts were flirty, fun, and we were really getting to know each other. My friend and I had decided to go back to his town for a couple days at the end of our trip as we didn't get enough of it the first time. (beautiful town with amazing beaches.) From the first time we met, until the time we had gone back to revisit it had been over a month of non stop texting everyday.

When we went back to visit, I ended up spending pretty much everyday together for about 5 days. He took me on romantic dates, went to the beach, etc. I felt really comfortable around him and really liked a lot of his qualities, the vibe we had in person was great. And I could tell he felt the same way with a genuine interest, I didn't really find any red flags. (We also never had sex, as that is not my thing and i told him that and he respected it.)

The problem was that i live on the other side of the world to him and my trip was coming to an end, he had told me that he never spoke to someone from a distance before and usually if he meets a girl that lives far away he'll just leave it, not even try to pursue it but told me with me it was different. Before I left he got me amazing gifts, a perfume with our initials engraved into it and he wrote a card and printed our pictures out, etc it was very thoughtful. He told me that he would come visit me where i live in a few months, and that he couldn't wait to see me again.

Well now the issue is, when i got back home we still had been texting everyday non stop since i met him i don't think there was a day where we weren't texting. That continued when i got back for about a month, and then started to drop off. It started to bother me, so I decided to communicate to him that i was confused by the change in his habits, and if he had lost interest he should say so. He reassured me that he didn't lose interest he very much likes me and that he is a really disorganized person and can never find the right time to text back, he forgets etc. I told him that i am not much of a texter either and that we can always just speak on the phone every now and then instead. (I dont think he likes talking on the phone much as he didn't say anything about this.) He promised to put more effort, and he did for a little while, and it fell off again. His best friend and my best friend were still in touch, and his friend also told me that he is just like that, and he will even take forever to respond to him too. So it made me feel better that he is like this with everyone even his friends, and just let it be.

Well lately, his texting habits have gotten worse, he always took a long time to respond but now the content of his texts has changed, he doesn't flirt anymore, doesn't send photos or voice notes like he used to, not much emojis, and ignores or skips over messages sometimes, where he used to reply to ever single little message even if he had nothing to say he'd still aknowledge it with an emoji or something.

Whats confusing is he will still initiate texting everyday, and the other day he did call me out of the blue and said he wanted to see me.

Can these signs indicate he's losing interest?? or could it just be his burnt out from all the texting, tired of it? Its hard to tell because this situation is long distance, normally I could tell right away if he was flaking on dates etc, but this is much more confusing for me. I am starting to overthink everything and don't want to self sabotage this over perceived thoughts based on texting. I know guys can fake it for the first few months, but I genuinely don't see what he could gain from it? (he's not love bombing or future faking btw, and has never tried to ""sext"" or ask for nudes or any stupid stuff like that guys usually do, it's always been just a genuine natural connection.)

I am moving to his country in a few months for school, but he was only recently made aware of that, and seemed excited about it but the texting habits haven't gotten better since learning that.

(his best friend also mentioned that he kept bringing up coming to visit me, and that he seemed like he saw something more with me in the future based on their conversations) but from my end it seems like either he's losing interest or he's getting lazy with the texting... or both?

Only physical contact was on the first date when I put my arm around her back while walking and when went for a hug at both end of the dates, and kissed the back of her head lol.

Also via text she has basically never iniated apart from before the first date when she asked if I still wanted to go etc. And often takes hours to reply and not much convo.

Via text and in person she doesnt seem flirty or giving any signs etc, like if she is like that I feel I shouldn't escalate or try physical touch idk.

47,pu3cil,1632427038,Friend of ours made a remark that bothered me.,"This Saturday my (25 f)  boyfriend’s (27 m) uncle is getting married. He and I were sitting around at his place last night and he asked me what shirt I thought he should wear with his suit. I told him I like the blue one because it makes his blue eyes really pop. I *love* his blue eyes. He’s got really pretty blue eyes. They’re one of his best features.

So my boyfriend is a childhood friend of mine who I’ve known since I was five. I am
his sister’s friend and he and I have always been close. We’ve been seeing each other since July but only recently went public with our relationship. We share a lot of the same friends too.

Our friend Jason was there with us. He immediately said “Wow. She’s already telling you what to wear. What’s next? Is she gonna tell you you’re not allowed to hang out with us anymore?”

I was a bit taken aback by this. I’m definitely not the type of girl who’s ever tried to control my boyfriends. I honestly have. always thought I was a pretty laid back type of girlfriend. Plus why would I ever tel my boyfriends couldn’t out with his friends? We have a lot of the same friends.

After Jason left I asked my boyfriend about what he said. My boyfriend didn’t seem to think it was a big deal. He said he asked for my opinion on the shirt and he knows I’m not a controlling type so I shouldn’t worry about what Jason said. He also said maybe Jason’s jealous that he has girlfriend now and Jason doesn’t. 

I’d hate to think our relationship would cause some sort of problem. All of our other friends are genuinely happy for us and a few of my girlfriends even said they’ve been shipping us for a while anyway.

I have this really i mean really close friend of mine, she's been there for me at my worst and so on and so on, we have been flirting, and when she was drunk, she kissed me. This was just a quick backstory of our relationship.
So before i met her one of my classmates was ""dating"" with her, they met once or twice nothing much tbh. He broke her heart, by canceling plans etc. She hates everybidy who doase drugs and he's that guy who doase drugs all the time, so after all the bullshit he did, she hated him and didn't want to date anybody, or at least that's what she said, before we were flirting and stuff.

So guess what she chose to bring that other guys, who she ""hates"" and saying stuff like maybe he changed kr something. (he was also sending dick picks to other guys, cheating and other kinds of nasty stuff) so can anybody tell me why do girls always choose the guy who will break her heart, and i don't and can't look at her like any other friend now so this friendship is over imo.

 We went on one date and it went really well. We had lunch and then we went to a nature trail nearby, and he sat me down on a log and we made out.

57,pu4axc,1632429921,"Dating was hard before Covid, now its just impossible. How are people falling in love these days if at all?","California has kept their mask mandate in place for the last two years and it really
creates tremendous problems for normal human interaction. All facial expressions you make get obscured and your voice gets heavily muffled. To make matters worse, a lot of people try to avoid you while you speak to them out of fear of covid. 

To further complicate the issue, my primary concern is that I do not know what her face looks like under that mask and she doesn’t know what my face looks like under mine. She can have the most beautiful hair and eyes yet have rotting/missing teeth, a recessed weak chin and I wouldn’t know. She may also assume I could have these things and so would be hesitant to give me her number or plan a date. Its hard to commit when you don’t exactly know what that other person looks like. 

Before you mention online dating, I want to remind you that literally every guy who is not in the top 10% of men looks wise can tell you that they just don’t work. There’s a ratio of 5:1 men to women on the dating apps, far worse than the actual ratio of men to women living in America. They just aren’t a viable option. 

So let me hear what you guys think. Is the dating scene dead so long as covid doesn’t go the route of the dodo? Are there clever ways to still meet women despite of the mask mandate?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pu4axc/dating_was_hard_before_covid_now_its_just/

61,pu4xnl,1632431787,Boyfriend told me he takes steroids. Did I overreact?,"I full out asked my boyfriend last night if he takes PEDs and he admitted it, but denied hiding it from me - which I disagree with wholeheartedly. How do you not reveal to your partner, who you envision sharing a life with, that you shoot steroids into your ass 2x/week? For me, I view steroid use as a deal breaker. The last (and only) person I dated on them was controlling, jealous, and paranoid. He tried blowing up his ex’s house (the same night he asked me to see him after 6 years) and ultimately hung himself in his prison cell after getting caught. I do partially blame steroids with his behavior in our relationship. So I blew up on my current boyfriend last night, which he stated was only due to my ignorance. 

He has a child and is going to blame me for breaking the kids heart if I make this issue end us. Meanwhile I think it’s his fault for not revealing it sooner. To me that’s a first month before you proclaim your love to the person kinda thing. 

I’m worried about his long term health. At 33 he already has fucked up shoulder mobility and back issues as well as high blood pressure, but denies PEDs are at fault. 

I’m willing to learn more about steroid use - particularly the kinds he uses, as he doesn’t have the same issues as my ex, but he feels as though he can’t get over the fact that I judged him for his use and that I told him I lost respect for him because he’s selling himself to others as something he’s not. Meanwhile, I feel deceived that he kept this hidden from me for so long when there were PLENTY of opportunities for him to discuss it. 

So, am I overreacting?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pu4xnl/boyfriend_told_me_he_takes_steroids_did_i/
62,pu52dy,1632432182,"Limerence: Or, something I’ve learned about romantic connections but struggling to use what I’ve learned to my advantage…","[I’m reposting this from my original post in ADHD to reach more folks and get more insight]

Not too long ago I got out of a 2.5 year relationship that I had realized wasn’t great. It wasn’t terrible by any means but as sometimes these things do, it had simply run its course but with the realization that I don’t think I was truly in love with my SO, just, comfortable. Fast forward only a few months I try to put myself out there and after a few misses I meet this person who, about an hour or two into our first date, I’m floored. After that we go on a few more dates and I realize I’m becoming head over heels for this person, the next few dates are great, I get all giddy when we message and chat, I have crazy butterflies around them, that I didn’t have around my ex. I start planning just a few more dates over the next few weeks, things are feeling great, all until they message me one day saying they’re not feeling it and an old flame came back into their life. Hey, it happens, and I’m not necessarily the kind of person that fights for someone’s affection if it means competition (maybe I’m more of a people pleaser than I thought). So all of this only lasted, eh, a month? And I took it hard. Harder than I thought I would. I realized I fell too hard too fast, and for the life of me I can’t really understand why aside from just, high dopamine levels and such. I responded to them with just a simple reply and that was that.

The next few days and weeks however, following the rejection, were absolute Hell for me. Little things, I mean LITTLE things were reminding me of them, including bigger things like stuff we talked about. Sounds, sensations, songs. I got rid of everything I could but later as my therapist had said, it’s okay to remove things but instead of repressing the memories and emotions, you need to let yourself be sad. “It’s okay to be sad. Not being sad is the unhealthiest thing you could do to yourself at this point.” Okay. I’ll work with that. But it doesn’t necessarily help the random breakdowns I’ve had just standing in line at the store, or taking food out of my fridge.

But what I learned and am still struggling to figure out what to do with this information is that, instead of a romantic connection, I feel as though I suffered from this notion of “Limerence.” Not love, but obsessive infatuation. (But what is love if not that? Don’t answer that, I know lol). I didn’t have more time with this person to find out many flaws so my image of them was, not necessarily perfect but just, a good match/connection I hadn’t had in years. Putting a word to it has at least helped some of the healing process, but I find myself still pining over this person, yearning for contact or circumstances to be different but of course, only moving forward will heal such wounds. 

Has anyone else experienced this? And if so, what were some methods or tactics you used to get through this weird funk/period?

TL;DR Been having trouble getting over a rejection I thought for sure was going to turn out great, but when it didn’t, I realized I might be (most likely) experiencing “Limerence.”",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pu52dy/limerence_or_something_ive_learned_about_romantic/

Since we have met, he's done/said a few things that i dont know how to interpret:

* He blocked me for half a day after an inoffensive joke I made over text (I promise it was so mild) then tried to play it off as if nothing happened
* He always tells me when he's horny or if he was during the day
* He insults me one minute then compliments me the next (I have never insulted his appearance out of principle I just don't do that to people)
* He randomly trauma dumps to me over text or while facetiming
* He will try to control me in random ways (like not cussing at him or he'll hang up)

81,pu6q6y,1632437453,Was This My Fault?,"
It's been 3 years but I still think about this a lot. A lot has happened since this has occured. In spite of the amount of time that has stood between this event and the present era( about 3 years or so) I still think about this regularly. I am ashamed to admit this considering I should have been long over this and almost everyone involved with the exception of myself have moved on. 

So back in 2017 shortly after my Nana died, I came to meet a girl I had no idea would come to change many things for me, including my self esteem. This girl gave me hope that I can be loved and have a shot at life. I grew up with my mother who was very emotionally abusive and generally very difficult to live with. This has greatly impacted my self esteem and how I view myself. I have been asked out by girls since middle school. People have complimented me regarding my looks but I could never take them seriously considering I have such a damaged self esteem. 

Anyways this girl started flirting with me and trying to get my attention around the beginning of my sophomore year in HS. She was very beautiful and I thought she was waaay out of my league. I couldn't accept the fact that someone this beautiful could want anything to do with me. I believed everything my mom said to me and I still kind of do. Anyways come 2018, she starts flirting with me and making it obvious she liked me. Then a couple months after school starts in November she nervously confesses that she likes me. I tell her I like her too. I stop going to school and come back around Christmas break. She keeps trying to get my attention, puts her hand on my shoulder and keeps flirting with me. Needles to say she really liked me but I screwed it up. I got kicked out of school, and now she's with a new guy and wants nothing to do with me. 

TLDR: Girl really liked me and crushed on me for about a year. Self esteem issues got in the way and I cower and miss my shot. I could tell she was hurt by my actions and I am greatly sorry. I didn't mean to hurt her. I still miss her but I need to move on.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pu6q6y/was_this_my_fault/

92,pu7umq,1632441211,Is living with parents really that bad?,"I’m 24 male. I live with my parents still. 

Let me explain why. 

It’s not that I can’t afford to it’s more that I see no logical reason why I would at this stage. The pros of staying just out ways the cons. 

If I were to move out then suddenly I’m a third of my wages goes down the drain. I can be saving that for a future deposit on a house and to live slightly above my means right now. Like treating myself which I could not do if I had to pay rent. 

I haven’t “settled down” yet I don’t know what you would call it but I’m kind of in a gap year but it’s gonna be about 3 years. I’ve just finished university a year ago and I’m looking to do a masters in the next few years. The course I want to go in is pretty competitive and they like people to have experience in the field, which I am actively getting. If I could to the masters tomorrow I could but I literally need to put in the work now to get on it. 

It’s not like I’m not independent. I do my own shopping and cook myself. Of course my mum picks me up things from time to time but do the majority of my own shopping. Also I pay rent which is of course much lower that what I would be paying normally. 

But is it a big turn off? I know it’s not ideal but the only advantage of moving out I see right now is it’s more attractive and I wouldn’t mind the freedom from my parents from time to time. Even though we get on. 

Worth mentioning I’m in the uk maybe.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pu7umq/is_living_with_parents_really_that_bad/

94,pu871z,1632442404,I am so worried that I won't be good enough for this girl. Any advice?,"I started talking to this girl earlier this week and we have hit it off pretty well. I am constantly worried that she might gain interest in someone else. My personality is good but where I fall significantly short is on looks. I also tend to blow things out of proportions. For example, when she takes a few hours to respond to my text I know it's because she is a single mom of a 2 year old and she is with her daughter but I start telling myself that she is talking to someone else and is losing interest in me. 

I am so insecure and I really wish I wasn't. I still have trauma of being cheated on broken up with from past relationships and they are all coming to the forefront and we have not even gone on an official date yet. A girl has not been interested in me in over a year and I like talking to his girl. I am so worried that I won't be good enough.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pu871z/i_am_so_worried_that_i_wont_be_good_enough_for/
95,pu8891,1632442518,Is he friendly or interested?,"There's a guy that I've been working with for about a month now. For more context, he and I are both in our early twenties, and we work in the food industry. He and I have a lot in common, such as living in the same town, aspiring to have the same professions, etc. We also go to the same university. He's a pretty friendly guy, but also kind of nerdy.

There was a time when work was really slow, and he and I were the only employees at the time, and we were talking for about an hour straight. We were talking about the high schools that we went to, and he asked me what I like to do for fun. I gave him a couple of my hobbies, and he would say things like ""I like doing that too!"" or ""I need to do that more!"" That same day, he also told me about really personal information about him getting bullied when he was younger. I'm happy he feels comfortable around me to share that info with me.

Before, I would usually be the one coming up to him and asking him questions. They would be simple questions such as his weekend plans. However, I stopped because I didn't want to be the one always initiating the conversation, and I felt as if I were asking him too many questions. I also am introverted and sometimes have difficulty starting a conversation with people. Since I haven't been starting the conversation, he's been the one approaching me and asking me questions about my weekend plans. While he does talk to other female coworkers, I'm the one he speaks to the most. And whenever I come in, he'll always make an effort to walk over to me and ask me about how my day/or weekend went. From what I've seen, he doesn't do that to other people.

Whenever I need help with something, he's always the first person to help, even if it doesn't benefit him. For example, one time, he was restocking items, and I was helping a customer at the register. I made a mistake and forgot to give the customer change, and I was unable to reopen the register. I went to another employee that was slightly more experienced, but as I was asking the other employee, he came up to me and asked me what happened. I explained to him, and he tried to help me out. He wasn't able to help me with the register, but he tried regardless. And since he was doing something else at the time, it's not even as if it were convenient for him to help, yet, he did, and I didn't ask him to. But I'm grateful he did.

Another thing I forgot to mention is that there is a day where it is really slow, so there's only two or three workers for the entire day. I start early in the morning, and his shift always starts closer to noon. However, he comes in about 30 minutes to an hour after I come in and will be on his computer. I thought he was doing homework, but he watches YouTube videos. And I've noticed he chooses a table where we can see each other perfectly. Idk it might not mean anything, but I thought it was interesting.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pu8891/is_he_friendly_or_interested/

97,pu8gzz,1632443399,Need help on why a girl would act like this.,"I am getting really annoyed by this girl that I wish I never spoke to her. I don't know why she is so mad at me? Is it because I actually walked off from her when she said to leave her alone which she expected me to keep chasing her? She later got a boyfriend and I thought she moved on and so have I but by the looks of it she honestly didn't. I never dated her nor did anything intimate, just tried to ask her out on a date which she said was going to fast yet she was very flirty and dated her boyfriend in just three days of knowing each other while I was going to fast 5 days in. We just talked and she knew I liked her and later she wanted me to stop talking to her because she got mad that I said she wasn't ready for a date with me to my friends and yet she is showing our text to her boyfriend and his friends. Why is she doing this? She even stares at me too which I get creeped out. Any clue to why she is doing this? Does she still have feelings for me so she is doing this to get rid of those feelings? Or is she pissed off that I man up and moved on which non of the guys she has been with did that. Because by the looks of it she  Hypnotize her boyfriend to the point where he gets sad when she misses a day in high school.

99,pu8j3y,1632443604,Need advice regarding this new guy I met off tinder,"Hi Reddit, it’s fun to ask for insight and advice on here so thought I’d share about this tinder date I’ve been seeing and that I really like but also want sex with 🤕 We met a month ago for a drink and got to know each other a bit, hugged goodbye, and let me know he was going on vacation for 2 weeks to visit fam but that he would like to hang when he comes back. Texted me the next day to say he had been a little nervous but thank you for my time and that I seem cool and smart. While on the tail end of his trip, he texted me to ask how I was doing and I asked about his trip which I thought was nice. 

We hung out a second time last week, met at a park and watched the sunset and then went to get food, talking a lot about different and cool stuff but not really much flirting at all. After it was like 9 pm and he said he still wanted to hang but we didn’t know what to do and I said I would be down to go to his house and keep talking. At his house, he eventually asked if he could kiss me and we started making out and touching. I got horny and wanted to have sex and I said that and he said yes and went to get a condom. When he put the condom on, he went soft. We tried again and i asked if I could go down on him and he got hard again, put a condom on again, and he got soft again. He was really embarrassed, said that he was really attracted to me and wanted to and had never happened to him before, but that he’s also never had sex with someone that he just met, so he might be nervous, which I understood. He touched me and we had an intimate moment and talked about where our heads were at emotionally, personally. We talked about music as he drove me home, I asked if he would be willing to share some with me, and he followed up with a Spotify playlist for me he made a couple days later. 

I saw him for the third time this week, he picked me up and took me to a spot he liked this time to see the sunset, and we went to get food again, ending around 9. After, we didn’t talk about continuing to hang out and he drove toward my house and I just got out and said goodnight. While at the sunset spot, I thought he might kiss me but he didn’t and he didn’t kiss me goodnight either. I left feeling kinda disappointed that we didn’t even kiss… lol. After, he texted me to say he didn’t mean to cut the night short and he felt like were in the middle of talking, but I had just gotten a tired vibe from him. We made plans to hang out again and I said “you looked real cute tonight by the way,” and he said, “Thank you, I was very much thinking the same thing. But probably best i’m home early” like …ok. 

I’m confused about this guy and if he’s just nervous or aloof? If he likes me and wants sex or intimacy with me… He doesn’t seem that nervous when we are talking and he seems pretty confident in himself but talking about our recent relationship histories, I also think he might be a little rusty on courting someone new and maybe different than the people he’s used to, as I can sometimes be “bold.”  I want to kind of get a better sense of how he feels about me and maybe how much. Any tips for how I can approach this? Just communication I’m sure lol",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pu8j3y/need_advice_regarding_this_new_guy_i_met_off/
