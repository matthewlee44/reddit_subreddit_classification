Or, they’re looking for a guy, so that they have a partner to finally *get* a dog with.

Or, they don’t own one/want one, and they just don’t *trust* you when they find out you don’t like dogs.

Maybe they just see it as a cute little surprise or something, but still.

That last one is really starting to piss me off, because I’ll see a profile, get interested, look through it, get *more* interested… and then *BAM*, the last photo is her dog, or her with her dog.

And it sucks, because I can’t tell you how many women I’ve passed up because of it.

Because dog lovers won’t let you just *put up* with their dogs, no matter what they say about it.

You have to actively *love* their dogs.

I found that one out the hard way.

And whenever I try to talk about it, everyone just acts like I’m crazy.

“Well, *yeah*, everyone likes dogs! How could you hate dogs?!”

They gaslight you so hard that you actually start thinking you’re wrong or awful for not liking dogs.

That’s some Big Brother shit.

The worst one was actually my therapist, of all people; I told her I didn’t like dogs, so she started bringing hers to our sessions to “get you used to them”.

She did this without my consent, by the way.

I guess she just couldn’t handle me not liking her bestest boy.

And, as for the reason?

Don’t have to have one.

Don’t have any trauma, I don’t set dogs off or anything, dogs actually like me.

My sister had to teach her dog to *not* get excited when I come over.

He introduced us about 2 months ago via discord, and three of us started watching a DND stream every week. My friend started gradually leaving the two of us alone. We have also been playing boardgames or watching something in a group with a few more people, usually once or twice per week apart from the DND stream where it's mostly just the two of us. All of this happens online, but we live in the same city. (I have been very careful because of Covid, couldn't vaccinate earlier this year due to medical reasons, but I'm currently about to get my 2nd dose and everyone in the group knows I avoid social gatherings, etc. until I'm fully vaccinated). According to my friend, the guy he's trying to set me up with doesn't have much experience with girls, and doesn't share his feelings etc. so it's really hard to tell what's actually going on in his head. The more time we spend together, the more I like him, but there is an issue ... he doesn't know what I look like, and he mentioned that twice to me, but never really asked. I was having a good feeling despite all that, but then something weird happened. We were about to play some boardgames on Friday evening, and the two of us were a bit early in the voice chat, he had changed his discord pic and I mentioned it and asked about it, and he started telling me about some girl he met on a discord server of a mobile game they're playing, that they are vibing and she likes him, texts him a lot and looks good, but she lives in another country (even continent), and that he doesn't believe in LDR, but is rather interested in learning stuff about her country and culture, and he changed the pic for some bet with her. I didn't react to that, just acted as any friend would, despite feeling sad and disappointed because I felt friendzoned. But the next day when we talked again, he said some stuff that got me slightly confused. The girl he was talking to came up again in the conversation, and he told me that he has no interest in her (romantically), I said I got a differend impression, and then he apologized for giving such impression (like, why would he apologize, I don't get it, he definitely doesn't know I like him or that our friend is setting us up). He also said some other things like ""your voice is pleasant"", ""I enjoy talking to you"", etc., but I can't tell if he was just being polite or else, and he mentioned once or twice how it's different to talk irl, when you see the other person's facial expressions, body language, etc. His birthday was on Sunday, I texted him with some birthday wishes and sent him a pic of one of the DND characters holding a birthday cake (I drew that pic, did not mention that, but he knows I draw so idk if he figured it out), he thanked me and said it was awesome.

First one I got engaged to and she cheated on me shortly after, at which point I ended it. Second one I really thought was “the one”. She seemed to hit everything I was looking for but it ended about a year and a few months in because we really lacked that strong emotional and sexual connection/chemistry. We also wanted very different things out of life so that didn’t help. Since then, it’s been 4 1/2 years since I’ve had a real date or sexual encounter. I had a date and went to a festival the next day with one other woman but it was just awkward. We even slept together in my bed, yet didn’t have sex. 

I was raised very religious and as such held myself to the rule of waiting until marriage to have sex, which I ultimately made to be if we were serious about each other/committed, we were “married” all but legally. A sentiment I still hold to this day. Since I examined and left my religion last year, I decided to go in the essentially opposite direction. I want to casually date, hookup, and for the first time I’ll be allowing myself to date multiple people at the same time until one partner and I define our relationship and make it official/exclusive. I hope that in doing this, I’ll find the right person for me that way. I should clarify that I will only do this in a way where my partners and I know that we’re dating other people at the same time. 

But the title of this post says “I’m terrified” so let’s get to that. I’m relatively over-weight and have been working on that almost all year now (hoping I’ll be ready to put myself out there in a few months) because I finally accepted that the kind of women I’m attracted to weren’t attracted to me. So I’m fixing it. And this leads to one of the first fears, being that even with all that I’m doing to look good and become conventionally attractive, it still won’t be enough. 

You could boil all these fears down to that, trust issues, and fear of being taken advantage of.  But more specifically my fears are that of false allegations (which could even happen years later), coercive pregnancy (I don’t even want kids and this can still happen from a ONS), being cheated on and/or finding out my partner isn’t who I thought she was again, paternal fraud (combing two things I’m afraid of), being stuck in an emotionally and possibly physically/sexually abusive relationship, or an emotionally/sexually dead one. 

I try to think of this logically mainly with things like how I drive all the time but am statistically way more likely to crash than have any of my relationship fears come true, yet I drive all the time and have no issue with it. Why I can’t make that same connection to sex and dating I don’t really know but it’s hard for me. I’m in therapy for this and other things but I’m not sure if this is even something I can reason logically, though I have tried for a long time. 

I wasn’t really sure where to post this because I didn’t want my concerns brushed aside, but I also didn’t want other men talking down on women to try and give advise on this. Because that’s ultimately what I’m looking for here. Advise. The closer I get to being physically ready and able to put myself out there, the more these fears plague my mind and I want to be rid of them. I don’t know if anyone here can really give it or how this will go but it seemed like a good option and the community is pretty diverse enough that I think and hope it’ll be a good group to get some advise from. 

Anyway, I’m done rambling lol. I’m kinda hoping others are dealing with this stuff too so this can be used for them to relate as well but in any case, I look forward to and appreciate any discussion, support, encouragement, etc. that this will bring up.

So I’ve only been talking to this woman for a few weeks now and the conversations was nothing too exciting but just normal. So randomly One evening when I get off work, she invites me to come out to this bar and drink with her because her best friend couldn’t make it at the last minute (which I call bullshit)—anyways I pull up there (still in my work clothes) we have a good convo, she pays her tab, I pay mine, she hugs me in the parking lot, we go home.

Next week comes around, I told her I wanted to go out and have drinks with her again. She didn’t hesitate, we meet up have drinks, we shoot pool afterwards, we both had a good time and I had her laughing pretty much the entire time, and I paid for everything. At the end of the night she makes out with me briefly in the parking lot before I leave.

Today, she drove across town to bring me lunch at my job (only because I asked her what she was cooking the day before)..we both relax in my car during lunch break and she kisses me again at the end of my lunch. I walk her to her car and I kiss her a few more times again the she leaves. 

We just made plans again for this Sunday. Are we going to fast here? Or is this a good sign? Or is this a sign of something I’m unaware of in her end? Or maybe I’m just overthinking. I’m 29M, she’s 35F. Everyone on my end told me to only pay for one or two more dates, and see if  she’s just using me.

im 17 and ive had 2 relationships in the past before this one and i lost feelings for both of them. this relationship is different becuase ive never connected with someone so quickly. everything was so perfect for the first 2 months and id literally cut limbs off to go back to that but now it seems like i just cant have fun around her or im always in a bad mood around her and she doesnt deserve it. sometimes she can do something so little and i overthink things but recently i have not been able to be me around her no matter how many times i go to the bathroom and slap my face to try to snap out of it. i dont know whats wrong. sometimes when im with her i wish i just stayed home and i get bored and i dont know why. I just wish things were the way they were when i could literally not sleep because of how much i wanted to see her and thinking about all the memories we had together in the beginning makes me depressed. when i think of all the fun times and the laughs it makes me wonder what went wrong with me why cant i just enjoy a good thing? why do i feel so nostalgic thinking about the past with her? i cant quite say there has been anything in particular that has changed since then so i jave no clue where this has come from. she really likes me and its easy to tell theres so much i want to fix but i feel like i cant because i have zero energy right now i think i actually am depressed just battling in my head every day trying to convince my self i am not lossing feelings and this results to me having no energy all the time and when im around her and i have no energy i feel like a failure, like she doesnt deserve this. i feel like all my charisma is gone when im with her even though thats partly how i got her in the first place. i feel like im just so dry i cant even joke around with her. idk if somethings wrong with me or what but i cant lose this girl. i also fear if i keep acting like this, she might just go for someone that actually has the energy to put the time in for her instead and leave me. i just want anyone who can help does anyone know how this feels am is this normal? please dont be afraid to be brutally honest.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1133280,public,self,i fear im losing feelings what do i do?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/raove9/i_fear_im_losing_feelings_what_do_i_do/,no_ads,0.0,,,

1. Girl #1 - I have known for a really long time and I'm still friends with her. We had been really flirty with each other in the past and my friends kept telling me that we would be perfect for each other. I developed feelings for her and told her right away when I had a crush on her and asked if she'd be open to going out on a date. She said she ""needed to think about it"" and waited a month to tell me that she doesn't feel the same way and won't be interested. We're still friends and she always supports me and is a wingman when Im with other girls but never told me why she didn't like me.
2. Girl #2 - I started talking to her next. We had been talking, hooking up and really getting along for 2 months before she GHOSTED me out of the blue. I was again never offered any explanation for why she ghosted me. I had feelings for her so it hurt pretty bad. But I told her I had feelings for her before she ghosted me and she told me she had feelings too. A week after being ghosted she posted pics with another guy on instagram.
3. Girl #3 - I meet her through a friend. He tells me she's interested in me. I ask her out. We go out, I have a good time, she tells me and my friend she had a great time. I'm interested as well. We make plans for a second date and shortly later she flakes on the second date and slides into my best friend's DM's.

The reason I'm worried is because I just asked out another girl. We went on an awesome first date. I don't think I can handle being lead on/ghosted again right now as I've found my confidence to be decreasing. If things go well on this date then I'm going to be really worried about the future. Because of course if I like her she'll just pretend to like me back. After having the last girl I liked slide into my best friend/ roommate's DM's I had a little bit of a breakdown. 

I'm a handsome guy, I don't lead girls on/ ghost but I do reject other girls quite often. If I wanted to be in a shitty relationship it would be pretty easy to find. However, I  I'm saying this because I don't think the problem is that I'm being clingy or desperate. I like to take things slowly and let things develop naturally and I like to talk to my friends and get advice about things. Do I develop feelings for the wrong people? Or is it my fault that this always happens when I have feelings for someone. Nobody can tell me that its my fault I just get ghosted / flaked apparently and my friends say the girls suck. I just feel like no girl can even respect me enough to be honest with me (other than girl 1) and that really hurts me. 

I guess my question is, how many times do u have to be rejected before you realize that its your fault and that you need to change something?

Until a few days ago she messaged me out of the blue saying her ex texted her. She said she thought she was over him and that she meant it when she said she wanted to be with me but she was confused because she was with him long term before they broke up and needed to step back and evaluate what she wants.

I haven't texted her since. I do not have her on social media. I have no intention of blocking her number but made a promise to myself I will not text her first about anything.

I’m the only child and me and my mum have lived together since I was born. She’s always been there for me and raised me up. My dad who currently lives with us, only just came back from living abroad 2 months ago. He’s going to return back abroad in 1.5 months, which will leave my mum alone. He’s not lived with us for around 6-7 years as they’ve separated.

My dad is early 70s and mum is early 60s.
My GFs dad is early 50s and her mum is early 40s.

Now that I’m moving out very soon, she’s very upset, feels worried that she’s going to be alone in the flat, lonely and depressed (she’s always unemployed and at home everyday on her phone on social media interacting with people that she doesn’t know). Her being alone might make her more lonely and depressed? 

She gets upset and says she’s raised me up and looked after me only for me to move out with a girl and forget about her.

I’ve already said I’m going to make the effort and come see her 1-2 times a week. Although I know I’m going to be busy with work, I’m still going to try but my friend thinks the ‘1-2 times a week’ will slowly decrease and end up being 1-2 times a month. Which I’m very worried about.

Her parents doesn’t have a problem with her moving. I feel the age of our parents play a part in this. As her parents are still young, they’re more chilled and aren’t concerned. My parents are older and have health issues, which makes it harder for me as I worry about them and me moving away just makes my mum stressed that she’s worried she’d be more depressed and lonely.

She has no friends and has no job. She’s got some health issues where she isn’t able to walk too much or lift heavy stuff. Sometimes I tell her that I’ve told her many times when she’s had opportunities to be friends with people or keep the friendship, she chooses not to and it’s her fault for preferring to be alone and have no friends as she enjoys not socialising with anyone.

Today she was talking to my dad about me moving and complaining that I’m going to be paying rent there and wasting more money when I can be paying here and it’s not like our flat is full of people that I have to move.. but she doesn’t understand that I need to try explore my life and learn to do things myself as right now she’s doing everything for me?

Today I heard her say one day I’d come back and I wouldn’t see her again, or she’d eat a lot of medicine till she passes out so there’s no more to deal with..

Part of me wants to stay and part wants to move. But as she’s feeling so stressed and upset about it, I’ve already had to rethink this moving out decision many times already.

I don’t know what to do.. 

I’ve suggested my GF to move in here but she wants space and isn’t comfortable if my mum is here too as she’d want to do things with me.

A few weeks ago when I had to rethink, I did suggest maybe to stay down there and not move up or she rents herself but she said she didn’t want to lose the opportunity with the job and she can’t afford renting herself as it’s pricey.

We’ve already bought some furniture and house things and are nearly ready to move in soon.

But the situation with my mum still remains ongoing.

I worry how she will cope alone as she’s been so used to me coming back home from work everyday and cooking food for me everyday.
I worry she’d not have to do that anymore and feel depressed and rejected.

What is the right thing to do? Some say I need to spread my wings and move out so I can explore life and know how to do things myself, and make the effort to come see her? But of course it wouldn’t be the same and I would feel sad that I’m not able to be with her during the times where she gets older (example if I saw her in a few months and she’s changed a lot, that would make me really sad inside).

And some say I shouldn’t leave and just tell the GF I have to take care of my mum, and if she wants to leave then let her as there’s plenty of fish in the sea and I only have one mum?? Or if she really loves me, she’d understand?

She doesn't feel like she's all there yet and wanted to keep things slow, which I respected. We both felt very anxious about our future and asked the question if we should even be together if we won't be able to keep this going after I start working. We still hang out and talk everyday, but we agreed on not getting physical. I don't know if this is healthy. I want to be with her. She's even fun to be friends with.

Then when we were working the same shift on Thanksgiving, we were paired up to do an assignment and I risked it and started talking to her. I honestly don't know what came over me to make me start talking to her because I'm quiet and I guess a little anti-social but I just did it and surprisingly our conversation went well and we were talking about college and where we came from and I really enjoyed talking to her and it all felt natural. After that assignment, we kept getting paired up to do other things throughout the thanksgiving shift and we would talk about the job and joke around and I feel it boosted our relationship from strangers to at least acquaintances.

The next day she would come up and talk with me and make jokes and I would do the same and she'd always laugh at mine or she would ask me to help her with things but it was always about work and nothing else but I liked that she would come and try to find me now instead of how it was before of us never speaking. This would continue for the coming 3 weeks until this past weekend (p.s we both only work on the weekends) where she wanted me to stay and talk with her on both days right before work ended where everyone had just left except the manager who was finishing up some paperwork. Our conversations became more personal and we talked about different things besides work.

I really do want to ask her out on a date but I'm not sure if she sees me as a romantic interest, she's friendly with everyone and sometimes it makes me feel that she just wants to be friends which I'm fine with but if she does want to be more than friends I honestly can't tell. I'm just scared because if she rejects me then I'm going to feel embarrassed going to work and we have a small staff (under 20) with mainly women so I don't want to risk my job.

I (18M) visited the insurance office today to drop off some paperwork for my car insurance and the woman who helped me (mid-to-late 20sF) was very kind and interesting to talk to. We hit it off and ended up having a half-hour-long conversation about each other's lives and connected on quite a few different random things, needless to say, stuff that has nothing to do with insurance.. At all.

I know this is stupid, but I ask for no judgment xD. But, I never got her number or anything (she did make *extra sure* that I got her business card, in case I ""needed anything."" Of course, I didn't need her business card because I already had her direct line since she had previously helped me and she knew that, so I don't know how to take that bit).

Anyway, I'd like to ask her out to lunch/dinner (or at least bring her lunch) to get to know more about her and see if it can go somewhere? I'm sure maybe it's a bit unrealistic given my age and everything, but, I feel like she might be open to it? Maybe not, I don't know hardly anything about her.

Once again, this all might be stupid, maybe she's just trying to build a relationship to keep me as a loyal customer, but I figured I'd ask for Reddit's infinite wisdom on this.

My question is this: is there a possibility there's anything here and should I ask her out at the risk of making future interactions awkward should I get rejected?

We’ve had no big fights, but our first misunderstanding came up Saturday night after a birthday party. For reference we are a neurodiverse couple and I’ve learned a lot about autism (she is high functioning) and anxiety
To be a better man to support her and people in general. She seemed very nervous, so I told her if she didn’t want to we could cuddle and relax. I told her she looked gorgeous. She ended up knowing more people at the party than me, and I was a little nervous because I’ve never been to a big party before. She seemed very blank the whole time so I checked in on her a good bit and asked if she wanted to go, to which she said “whatever you want”. I honestly got really annoyed because I was just concerned. I pressed her hard for an answer because I was really worried, which was wrong of me. I admited it, and looked to fix it. When I dropped her off at her parents, I hung around for a while. After I left I could hear her crying, so I came back in to check and her mother said “she’s not crying she’s in the shower”. I left, didn’t get a reply that night. Her mom is a woman that held my respect, I always had her daughter home on time and really tried hard to be the best I could be to her family. I asked for her moms advice, which was “maybe wait till monday to talk to her, room does her good” and I respected that. I couldn’t sleep good that night and nearly puked my guts out the next day because I was so nerve wracked. I reached out to check on her, but her mom left me on read. I eventually sent her a heartfelt message saying I hope she’s ok and we can get through this and that I’m here. She replied after some time, and said she was ready to talk. I let her express her emotions and I listened and validated her feelings, Held her and tried to be a good guy. Her mom messaged me that night and told me in abt 4 ranting phone long texts “I’m very upset you didn’t follow my orders and next time I will sever communication between you and my daughter. I will not stand for you bullying her”. I replied that I understand her frustration and I want to fix things, I fessed up to where I messed up. Her mom said “actions will prove more than words” to which I agreed. I felt very uncomfortable that her mom flipped on me when I’ve tried my best to be a good guy to her whole family. I decided to come forward about how I felt about that to my girlfriend, and she got very upset and screenshot it and sent it to her mom, calling me a gas lighter when all I did was explain what I felt. Her mom said  “Tell him thmisplacing his anger at me on to you is unacceptable.   He can stop communicating with you until you are ready to reach out.  Then block all his communications” . I was simply expressing how I was uncomfortable about how far her mother went. She said that she needs space and will talk to me when I’m done, which I have respected. I’ve been on read for 14 hours and I’m shaking at the thought of being blocked. I feel like this is a major overreaction on her mother’s behalf. I understand motherly instinct but I’m dating the daughter, not the mom. some time apart could fix this. I reached out to her mom and extended a hand of peace, wanting to understand the emotions in this situation and how we can bury the hatchet and work to build from here. I was left on read there, I’m so lost on what to do, I really don’t wanna be blocked. I’ve spent the better part of my year helping their family out while mine has been through so much shit. I’ve lost 3 grandparents this year, one to covid, watched my family fall apart, failed a class in my first semester of college, had to be my brothers therapist, broke out of years and years of childhood grooming last year to which I still have bad memories of, watched my grandma die in front  of me and I was all alone with the body because my family was too busy fighting over who is right and wrong, and everyone is telling me to suck it up, it’s so hard.  our relationship brought me a bunch of joy, just the fact that her mom is determining the emotions really is annoying and I don’t want her to keep me away.

so idk this person much but to save some obvious details, I (27F) shot my shot at a guy 30M. I know he has a party lifestyle job, he is very handsome guy and I know he must get hit on often, especially in his line of work (nightlife/entertainment sorta)considering that’s how I met him. 

For context, I’ve been fully single for 2 years, I want to date again after a long term relationship. I’ve tried to let fate put someone in front of me, I’m not a fan of apps but it just hasn’t happened. I feel I’m an okay/attractive girl but any relationship I’ve had I had to initiate which I kind of hate but whatever. 

I noticed him looking at me throughout the night, and same. I struck up a conversation with him and after talking for a good 10-15 minutes he asked me to get his phone number and give him a call. Cool, great. I give him a hug and say it would be nice to hang, chill sometime. Fast forward, he texted me in the morning. We talk a bit it’s super fun and flirty we exchange some appropriate selfies. It’s going great he’s getting a bit extra flirty, which I don’t mind it’s been two years I’m lonely it’s nice to get some compliments. He did mention his busy schedule, with his work that adds up and he was going to hang with family that night. We had a really good back and forth all day and he even said how was it possible that I’m single ? What’s the catch? Towards the end of our conversation yesterday he mentioned he promised would hit me up tomorrow with more info on when to hang out sometime this week. 

Now I completely understand getting busy and him not texting today. I guess what I’m asking here is does this guy sound like he just wants to mess around with me ? Or is it too early to even tell that? Is it wrong to assume he’s that type Bc of his looks/job? 
I’m not really the clingy type but I’m overthinking for some reason because I really want to see this person again ! We had similar interests, values, and the sexual attraction is there!!

I was the last person to message and he hasn’t hit me up today which is fine but I’m curious if I don’t hear from him in a few days would it be off putting to send him a message like just what’s up or something ? Or if he doesn’t hit me up should I take the hint? 

I’m very out of the dating game and I don’t want to mess this one up so any advice is much appreciated!

One of my friends found out and when I confronted her she denied it but I found out it was true after seeing him on her social media so I deleted her off everything even though she tried messaging me just before her wedding. She eventually ended up getting divorced a year in to her marriage, that was around 4 years ago. Around last year we got back in touch and we got back together as she seemed to have changed a lot, but a while in to the relationship she revealed that she did have quite a few boyfriends before then and that she had slept with someone. I was understanding and things seemed to be going fine after and we even planned for marriage, but then I noticed how much of a rush she was in to get married and how she said she always misses me. But lately we have argued a lot and she has really wound me up to the point where I didn't want to speak to her, she knew I wanted my space but to get my attention she ended up blocking me off everything. When I asked why she blocked me she said she didn't want me to have access to her if I can't commit to her, even though she has a lot of random guys on there! She eventually unblocked me. My own family wasn't happy about my relationship as my mother wasn't keen on her but I eventually persuaded her to accept (I realise now how stupid I was). A few months later, I noticed her being open again about other guys but instead of saying anything I stayed quiet. Because there was a guy that she used to talk to that got in touch with her, he was actually a married man so I don't know why he was reaching out to her but what bothered me the most was that she would complain about him getting in touch but she never blocked him to stop him from getting in touch with her, it felt as though she liked the attention. When she asked why I was quiet, she insisted that I can talk to her about anything so I told her that I wasn't happy with how open she is with other guys, she then went on to say how she didn't want to be with someone that is insecure as her ex husband was the same. I was quite annoyed at this point as she has said herself in the past that she is insecure too and she always had mood swings and emotional issues due to her endometriosis which I was always understanding of, it hurt that she couldn't be understanding of my mental health. So then she went on to complain about me not committing to her, at this point I had enough of it and said that if she wants to end it she should do it now so she went ahead and blocked me off social media. She didn't block my number but now I have blocked hers so she can't get in touch with me. I told my mother that we had broken up so she shouldn't get in touch with her mother to sort wedding arrangements, at that point my mom informed me that she rang her mom a couple of weeks ago but she said that she was busy and and that she would ring back later which she never did. I was tempted to unblock her and have a go at her for saying that I was the reason things weren't progressing. But I though forget it, I no longer want anything to do with her anymore. Its been over a month since she blocked me, I have missed her a lot and was tempted to try to get in touch with her. Im hurting so bad but I am trying to get in touch with her but I know deep down there's no point. I noticed today that she has now unblocked me on social media.

I went out with this Tinder guy. First date we went to the movies, and then the second date I went to his place and eventually we had sex. 

It was pretty clear from the start that he was looking for sex: quite shallow conversations (nothing deeper to get to know “me”), tried to get me to his place on the 1st date already, a few shirtless pics, one slight sexual innuendo

**I recognized that he only wants sex and I was fine with it at first**. Sex was good, and so was the time we spent with him chatting, watching a movie and cuddling afterwards when I spent the night. 

But after this incident I realize I’m not built for “sex only” or FWB relationships. If I personally have sex with a guy, I find him attractive and a decent human being, and if I continue spend more time with him, I’ll inevitably grow to like him and wish we were more. 

At this point I feel like it would backfire it I continue to see him, cause I personally liked the cuddles and hanging out even more than the sex itself. 

I notice after we slept together he has become less frequent with his texts. He only texted me 4 days after we slept together (earlier it was daily texts and asking about my day etc) and didn’t even say anything significant. 

A week goes by and he asks do I wanna come over again. I feel like I’m in the bootycall category now too. One part of me wants to, because he’s so handsome and I enjoyed chilling with him, but I also gotta face the reality that in the long run, he’ll probably just keep using me as a bootycall and I’ll end up getting hurt when he gets bored with me and moves on to other girls.

**How do I make myself realize (and ACT on it) that it’s best for me to not to meet him no more and place myself in a position where I hope it would be more, but settle for less?**

I don’t even think I have high expectations. I want to date someone who is kind and who I find attractive, who cares about others, and who is also career-oriented.

All of my boyfriends I have had (three) I met off of dating apps. 

I’m not promiscuous (nothing wrong with that) and don’t use them to hook-up, but all of the guys I have gone out with over the past few weeks have been totally sleazy, like they’ve tried to get me to have sex with them on the first date. They were also all over 35, so they knew better.

Men who meet me from apps are generally really interested in my appearance, and nothing else. 

I want to get married and have kids, and I feel like the dating apps are functionally worthless for that. You treat people like they’re objects you buy, people you can pass over super easily, and you don’t appreciate the connection you have with others.

I'm a 19F and I've always been a huge romantic growing up. Like, I always loved watching movies with meet cutes and the whole thing. Finding my soulmate used to be my life goal. Now, I've become more realistic with it and dating is a bit less of a priority.

Anyway, I have used dating apps and I have been asked on dates by guys I meet in public. Through this, I realized that I don't want to meet someone with the obvious intention of dating. I think I really enjoy ""the chase,"" the whole ""will they-won't they"" part before dating. 

I'm much less of a romantic than I was growing up after some hard life lessons. Still, a part of me just really wants a good love story that isn't just a swipe right or ""We met in a cafe, bar, etc."" I prefer to be friends first, and I can't find myself wanting to even have sex with someone idk too well. I feel like maybe that's why dating apps aren't really my thing, but I think they're good for people who don't care about whether the way they met is ""romantic."" I know it's sort of unreasonable to have this expectation, and I think it's mostly due to this childlike idea of romance that I grew up on and loved.

Emotionally, I don't think I can be with guys. I've done some acts with them like cuddling and kissing, but that's all. It's mainly a flat and hollow experience. 

I recently had an experience a few months ago where I talked to a girl for five minutes about some place that was closing and I got like a magnetic pull to her personality most people I believe say is like attraction, kind of like something from pheromones. This is leading me to believe I'm straight I guess. 

If I am straight I want to find a life partner at this age and start dating to see if there is attraction or not. If I am into it sex can happen later, but emotionally I'm far from ready for something like that now.   


I've looked at Tinder and liked a few girls on it but I can't find what happens to the likes you select with the green star. Is this something you have to pay for to access?

What other apps are out there for formal dating? Ones where you start out as friends and just take it slowly.

He displays autistic behaviors and seems quite sad but is otherwise a nice guy, we have a few running jokes between us and have worked together on assignments a few times. Today we ended up sitting together at lunch, and I asked him how everything was going.

He opened up about his depression (and first warned me that it might be a heavy subject before asking to tell me) and mentioned his lack of success with women. At first, I was somewhat repulsed, but I decided to lend him an ear because he had never said anything misogynistic and genuinely had a good personality.

I asked him about his lack of success with women, and he attributed it to being 5'6"", Asian, and autistic. I tried to think of other reasons why he might be attractive to at least someone and couldn't come up with anything, he genuinely is a really honest guy and communicates well.

I asked him about his opinions on women, and he said he really doesn't care about how they look and just wants someone who's fun to hang out with. He doesn't hate women or view them as beneath him.

Unfortunately, I slowly began to understand where he was coming from. Many of my male and female friends growing up had made unsavory jokes about Asians and ostracized people with autism. In addition, my female friends considered height to be a non-negotiable feature for their boyfriends.

I had to dig deeper.

Unfortunately, I found sources corroborating all that he was saying. Being short, Asian, and autistic was a triple whammy for this guy, especially during COVID when Asian hate crimes are at an unprecedented high. I really can't think of a solution for his single state, but at this point, I'm fairly well convinced that not all insells are woman-hating men. It's unfortunate, but some of them may really have physical features or mental conditions that the majority of women find undesirable and therefore face loneliness despite being good people.

I feel bad for him but have no real solutions for him. He really is a good guy, but I have to admit he is physically not what the majority of women find attractive.

He also caused me to reflect that, despite being an Asian female, I've never had problems finding a boyfriend. And, admittedly, all of them have been white although I had never considered the implications of this.

I have a potentially-controversial question as well: could involuntary celib\*cy be a form of natural selection? I would really not like to think this way, but it makes sense from a evolutionary and hereditary standpoint why certain features like autism and short height are undesirable.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1133400,public,self,I met a nice lonely guy who has made me understand why they are the way they are,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ravce3/i_met_a_nice_lonely_guy_who_has_made_me/,no_ads,0.0,,,

Hi, so first of all I’m new on here and idk 100% how this works but I need some feedback and thought. So for everyone that will take out the time of their day to read it and tell their opinion thanks a lot.

So to start of ill tell you a little back story and put the parts where the weird stuff is happening separate so it’s easier to read.

So me and my gf have been dating for over four years, I’ve known her for much longer same goes for her friend. In the first 3 years of our relationship we would hang out with her from time to time (she doesn’t live that close so we usually met up every 3/4 months). In those first 3 years everything was normal and chill the vibes were good but nothing special.

So this last year we have been hanging out together a lot more then we used to do. (once a month sometimes even more) the 3 of us would have sleepovers and it was all good. I would sleep at the outer side of the bed


Because obviously my GF wouldn’t want me to sleep in the middle. But things changed I noticed that the vibe between me and her friend changed (like I said I will note all the stuff separate down bellow so it’s easier to read)

But over the last year my GF really changed her way of behaving when it comes to her, as if she knows what’s happening. She won’t let us be alone ever, whenever I mention her name I will get a dry response and stuff like that. Them 2 never talked about it with each other but I can tell my GF is very jealous.


- I noticed her friend would look at me and seek eye contact all the time.
- She laughs at all my jokes and is on my side in every argument
- She is always calling me out (“bullying”) being annoying. Basically just seeking attention to have convos with me or have a laugh at stupid stuff
- One time we were in the bathroom alone and she was standing next to me with a oversized shirt with no panties on (not nude or anything just a regular sleeping shirt), and we were laughing brushing our teeth and she said something (can’t remember what) grabbed her panties of the radiator, politely slapped it on my arm, walked away looking back at me and laughing (I was shocked and froze hahaha)
- She told me and my GF (separate) that she’s into guys who have a girlfriend and that she knows it’s bad but she likes to play the games (which she is playing with me ig?)
- When I post that I’m in the gym, on Snapchat she will respond with stuff just to talk to me.
- Last time we were together the 3 of us parted ways and after 10 mins she sends me a stupid snap, also just to talk to me again.

Basically she just want to have contact and have my attention with me (IRL) even if my GF is there. The affection and the connection between me and her is something that is super dangerous.

The things above are just a couple of situations summarized as this has been happening for over a year. There has been much more thing that happened which I either forgot or I’m not gonna say here cuz it’s already kinda long and I don’t wanna stretch it to much.

Point is, I’m a guy that has a good intuition and I can usually tell when someone people me or not and how the vibes are. But this is different, this is my GFs friend and it feels weird. I want to believe she’s into me but I also don’t because it’s messed up. 

- also she never did anything that went to far or said anything that is like crazy, but I can just tell by the way she acts and behaves and looks at me that she’s into me (I GUESS) 

Anyway I would like to here u guys opinions on this and how I should handle it and if she actually likes me or am I making things up?

And what do you guys think she wants from me, I am acting kinda cool about it not responding to everything but like I said I’m not 100% sure if I’m making stuff up, like usually I know but this situation is different. And I’m also thinking like, if she’s into me why wouldn’t she just tell me or go a step further?

Also I was thinking of contacting her friend in private and just ask her Whatsup and what she wants from me, and also if she has been noticing some weird behaving of my GF to her, because this is having an impact on our relationship. But I’m scared because I think the affection will be to much and we will do more then just talk..

I'm still recovering from a situationship I had with someone for over a month. I met someone on Hinge and we hit it off right away. 
He was texting me at all hours of the day and night and would constantly try to make sure I knew that he wouldn't hurt me and that he really liked me . He would also go out of his way to make sure I was secure about some other things in his life as well and would ask for my opinion often.  He was always vocal about how attractive he found me and how he never thought he'd get someone like me to match with him. 

He made 6 figures, I didn't. I've always been rather independent and when I dealt with car trouble he wanted to pay for my 950 dollar bill , I refused and I thought it was sweet that he offered but I had only known him for a month and I wasn't comfortable taking money from him. I don't like taking from people like that in general. 
He would always pay for our dates and he ended up driving an hour to fix my car for me . 
He was talking about making a trip to Europe and wanted me to go with him and offered to pay for everything too after telling me that he pays for all of his friends . 

A couple weeks later, he ended up leaving to the next state over and within a matter of days the tables flipped . He started becoming distant and he turned around and said that he wasn't in a place for a relationship and that there wasn't anyone else, that he's still very interested etc etc but he might move.  
I ended up removing him and talked to him about it a few days later and he told me that he was ""scared"" of how fast he was falling for me. I told him that if he liked me as much as he said he did then why back off? 

He turned around and said there was a difference in how much we liked each other and that I WAS more into HIM and how off putting it was to him. 
Like he wasn't blowing me up telling me and reassuring me how much he liked me and was excited to see where things went for weeks before he said this...
He had also said that he had no intention of pursuing a relationship and just wanted a fwb thing..except that we talked about this multiple times and he told me the complete opposite.  He told me that he couldn't wait to see where things went and he enjoyed me and really liked me outside of sex.

There's more to the situation and I have multiple posts with updates including me confronting his bullshit and being left on read for over a month.

Im really not sure about whether this is healthy long-term. I've read a lot of online articles and other reddits. Some think even up to 100 hours a week could work (Im not sure if they are being honest or not), others think 35-40 hours a week is an absolute max.

To me this is really not what I expected some people to work that much, especially when they are young (she is 30). Because we are both looking for someone to marry to have children with, I personally really think it is pretty weird to be working that much. If its only temporarily, its fine to me. However, when its for say, at least a couple of years, I really wonder if it can make a marriage work. In the Netherlands, people are legally only allowed to work a max hours long-term of about 40 hours during the week. Only if people **really** want to work more, they can do so in the weekend or so.

Dont forget: everyone needs time for themselves, for exercise, to eat healthy et cetera. I personally only eat between noon and 8pm (Ive been praciticing intermittent fasting for years), whereas if Im correct she eats dinner around 9pm. Not even to mention the fact that I'm vegan and she is flexitarian. Maybe in the future she is willing to go more vegan, but I personally dont think Im ever turning away from it. It simply suits me too well.

Now what I really want to ask people is: how much work (from yourself or your spouse) are you willing to put up with? What do you think is healthy long-term (especially if you're young and want to reserve time for exercise and such)? And I'm a perhaps a bad person for doubting a relationship/marriage where one spouse works about 70 hours a week?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1133420,public,self,How much hours at least should someone have in order to make a relationship/marriage work?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ravycd/how_much_hours_at_least_should_someone_have_in/,no_ads,0.0,,,
