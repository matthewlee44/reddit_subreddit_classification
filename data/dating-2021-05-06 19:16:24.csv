0,n6lt0b,1620346630,"Being preferred by taller, physically strong women - any reason?","Hi!

Perhaps a bit peculiar question. I am a male, 30 and have noticed a pattern in the dating world. It is that physically 'strong' women seem to have statistically higher preference for me, in fact they constitute as the majority of my relationships while there have also been exceptions but clearly less than average.

With 'strong' I mean that these have been taller than the general female population, being the same size or slightly taller than I (5'11 - very average in my country). All are normal weight and a degree more athletic than people on average. However, they have been traditionally feminine in other physical traits, such as having long hair and in body shape. Case in point, I complimented my last girlfriend that she has the physique of an attractive Wrestlemania-type female athlete (a compliment I knew she would appreciate, given her sense of humor and putting the effort to maintain a sporty physique). Typically, the women have approached me first, because I am socially pretty shy and awkward at first.

Has anyone had experiences with a similar dynamic, from either perspective?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n6lt0b/being_preferred_by_taller_physically_strong_women/
1,n6lw6i,1620346916,There are different styles of dating: get over it.,"This is mostly a complaint about people on this thread who get mad at sex on the first date, mad at people who date multiple people, mad at people who expect monogamy early, mad at this , mad at that.

Think of all the couples you know and all the different ways of how they got together. No one is right or wrong unless it intentionally hurts or manipulates people and misleads them. If you have a problem with someone‚Äôs style of dating, assert your boundaries! If they don‚Äôt want to honor those boundaries , you probably have different styles of dating, and you can find someone new or put up with it. Your choice. 

But everyone needs to stop giving their opinion on how dating SHOULD be. 

Good luck I hope you all find love soon &lt;3 buy a rose quarts and become the version of you that feels most lovable to yourself and you‚Äôll attract like minded people - hard to hear sometimes when things don‚Äôt work out, but at the end of the day at least you‚Äôll always be someone you love.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n6lw6i/there_are_different_styles_of_dating_get_over_it/

EXCEPT for men over 40, and especially married ones. I meet them thru work, as customers (my job entails texting customers for communication), vendors,  friends family members, some approach on online dating sites. It always starts as acquaintances.

I'm not saying I think I'm some great catch or anything but I'm cute. I'm short and redheaded and guys seem to like that. What I don't get is quality guys wanting to date me. 

Back to this guy... he is VERY convinced that he will be my boyfriend and it kinda turns me off.

Telling me he wants me to spend the weekend at his place already and I barely know him. He's constantly freaking out in me like telling me I'm so gorgeous and stuff and like way better looking than anyone he's ever dated. A girl likes compliments and stuff but why is it freaking me out that he's so so into me? I don't think I will be able to date this guy.

 I've told him I need space and I kinda like being alone. He told me he doesn't think I should be alone at my house. Like, WHAT? Why not? What's wrong with having my own space? Am I broken because I want to date and want a guy who wants to spend time with me, but NOT every second of the day? 

Like, aren't there some decent guys who want a girl who values her own space too? Maybe I just don't understand dating at all.

29,n6os07,1620356420,I stood up for myself and still got burned....feels bad...,"Sighhhhh, hi guys. I (27/m) need to just vent cause I'm honestly feelin pretty sad about this one. I matched with a guy about a week and a half ago and we had great convo for the first week. I thought he was cute and he actually seemed mature/serious about looking for someone to date, so I was pretty excited. Anyway, he asked to generally meet up, to which I agreed, then he began replying less frequently. It took about 3 days just to arrange the day and time that we'd meet because of his infrequent replies.

I spent Monday - Wednesday trying to arrange the logistics, getting about one short reply per day. Then, he gave me a one word response on Wednesday, which really rubbed me the wrong way. He'd proposed we meet, but I'd done all of the organizing up till this point with zero effort from him and now he's giving me one word responses? The old me would've looked past it and just clung to the hope that the date would actually happen. I think I've matured slightly, though, as I decided he was being disrespectful. So I stood up for myself and told him that a one word reply wasn't doing anything for me and if he wasn't interested, he could just let me know and we could be on our ways. I didn't want to waste his time if he wasn't about it.

I was sad because I had genuinely thought that he was a good guy, but I was proud of myself for having some self-respect. Alas, he responded super quickly being very apologetic and explaining that it's been a very hectic week and that he still really wanted to meet up. Seemed genuine enough! So knowing that he's busy, I look up some bars we can go to and send them over Wednesday evening, asking him to pick one since we're meeting on Friday evening and need to solidify the plan. Crickets.

It's now Thursday night--haven't heard from him. I got played. Normally I'd just be like okay, whatever, but I think this one was esp painful and confusing because I confronted him and he reaffirmed that he wanted to make it happen. Like......why? Why not just say you're not feeling it? I gave him an easy out. Not to mention I wasted my time coordinating the whole thing thinking he actually wanted to. I'm feeling pretty demoralized that people will lie to your face even when you ask them directly. :(",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n6os07/i_stood_up_for_myself_and_still_got_burnedfeels/

33,n6p2yx,1620357478,Not exactly ghosted but I'm certainly not feeling motivated to continue,"Met this girl a few weeks back. We talked and shared a lot of interests so I decided to ask her out. She said yes and we made plans.

First date went pretty great, we continued talking about our shared interests, and what initially was meant to be a quick meetup ended up spanning the entire night. The initial awkward ""interviewy"" conversation turned into a much more in-depth and engaging one very quickly, we had drinks, she got a lot more physical throughout the night and even ended up reaching for my hand a few times when we went for a walk after drinks. We ended the night simply because where we live there's a curfew. I dropped her off, we hugged and she mentioned wanting to do it again sometime soon, completely unprompted by me.

At this time, I figured all the signs were there that it was a good first date and there would almost certainly be a second one.

Since then, it's been pretty much the same. I initiate a conversation, ask her out, she says yes, even says a day when she could, and then the day comes and something comes up that forces her to cancel. Hell, even the first time we went out, it was meant to be a Saturday but she canceled and moved it up to Friday because she got busy. Nothing like that since, however. 

It's frustrating because there was a connection, and I feel like if I insist too much it'll kill any attraction that may even exist at this point despite us not being able to set up date in two weeks. When I text she responds, and she writes quite a bit, she seems happy to talk to me and responds positively to the idea of dates, it just doesn't happen.

I dislike it and at this point I'd rather just hear a straight no or just be ghosted because trying to make an outing work with this woman is driving me insane. 

This is part vent/part advice-seeking. I don't know if I should keep insisting, and that's part of what frustrates me.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n6p2yx/not_exactly_ghosted_but_im_certainly_not_feeling/
34,n6p74n,1620357861,Do you guys even like us?,"I have a feeling this is going to get me into trouble.

There was a post this morning about ‚Äúwhy do men not take dating advice from women?‚Äù Attracted about 250~ish comments. And while some people were making cogent points, a huge amount of hurtful, even hateful comments on there are making me question whether you guys even like women at all?

Because I suspect this bitterness is connected to your inability to hook up with a bunch of attractive women, NOT because you can‚Äôt find relationship with a woman.

Comparing us to children for wanting ‚Äúthe spark‚Äù/attraction to a partner? Saying we all want to be treated like trash and that‚Äôs what we find attractive? Calling us by numbers like ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt wanna settle for a 6/10?‚Äù And shit like that? I mean, you know we have worth outside of our looks right? Or are we meant to settle for you, even though you deserve a super hottie?

I don‚Äôt know, man. Y‚Äôall clearly want to have sex with us, but you don‚Äôt actually seem to like us as people. And we can sense that...we‚Äôre not half as stupid as you seem to think...I went on a date with the oh-so-clever RedPiller type and clocked him almost immediately. Negging &amp; manipulative tactics are quite easy to spot for any person with a semblance of self-respect.

Maybe the crowd on this sub is off, but if I met men in real life and heard a fraction of such things, they‚Äôd be ghosted with a quickness.

I‚Äôm going to get flamed for this, but before you go off, ask yourself this question: Is it possible that your overwhelming bitterness and frustration with the opposite sex has anything to do with your lack of success in dating?

I mean I get it. It‚Äôs a pandemic and we‚Äôre all lonely and horny and miserable. But JFC...a lot of hostility toward women you purport to want to attract.

Anyway. Back to the gentler dating subs for this 6/10 üòÇ",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n6p74n/do_you_guys_even_like_us/

36,n6peqh,1620358597,I doubt I'll ever find anyone loyal/into me,"A little background: I'm a 26 year old guy that lives in a somewhat rural part of Pennsylvania, a small town about an hour away from the big city, but very little in terms of a local dating pool. I can't find anyone local willing to even go out with me, so I've been dating girls about an hour away, thinking they'd be better, but it's the same old 2 dates, take advantage of my wallet, then ghost me. I'm honestly tired of this ghosting game, I'd rather someone honestly tell me they don't like me/hate my guts than pretend to like me and *poof* gone, at least I'd have some closure or an idea of what I did wrong/can improve upon, but when I get ghosted I have no clue, I'm just the same old me that isn't getting anywhere with dates, still feels lonely in the presence of others because I have yet to form a true connection or bond with a date in recent years. I know it's 100% my fault, I'm somewhat short, don't have ripped abs, wasn't a jock in high school (still am a nerd). I'm just a geeky computer guy, girls naturally never really took an interest in me all throughout my life until after college, and I was so God damn lonely, mentally broke down and had to go to the guidance counselor so many times just because I felt so alone and frustrated, still go to therapy today, but I'm no less lonely. I've been with 2 women officially, and 2 unofficially, I have very little dating experience for my age, most people get their first sweetheart at like 12 or 13, I lagged 10 years behind, and think I still do socially/dating wise, I'm now at the level of a high schooler, but am dating in an adult world, I'm guessing 99% of everyone has more experience than me, I have no game and it sucks. I just wish I could find my ""soul mate"" and get over all this dating shit, it's tiring, I'm lonely, and I've been alone way too God damn long for my liking, something about myself needs to change, because I'm obviously repelling women away for some reason I'm oblivious to, and I'd like to know what it is, I'm pretty good looking (aside from the height) and mostly well mannered, though can be a hothead sometimes, but I've made a lot of progress in therapy with my anger problem and it's rarely an issue anymore. Something else is hurting my game, or maybe it's just the lack thereof, but I have had sorta successful relationships before and I did it just fine back then.

37,n6pg70,1620358743,Feeling defeated after 4 dates,"I (23f) met this absolutely wonderful man (24m) a couple weeks ago off bumble. We totally hit it off on our first date over sushi. We have tons of common interests, made each other laugh so hard. We have friends in common. I have walked away from every other first date feeling meh, but this one I walked away from not being able to shake the feeling that it was going to be something special. 

We set up a second date and went for a hike. We kissed and I felt absolutely on cloud 9. I‚Äôd never felt such passion with anyone, even people I‚Äôve dated long term. He brought me a bouquet of hand picked flowers and my heart absolutely melted. 

He came over for a third date to my place and we made pizza. We had a wonderful time again and were able to go into some deeper topics. He opened up about some heavy stuff about his life and me about mine. He told me that he wants to take it slow, which I am 100% for. We kissed, nothing more. No feeling up, sex, or anything else. 

I went over to his place again tonight. I helped him pack for his move in two weeks. I immediately sensed that the spark was fizzling out. I‚Äôm still so into this man and want to continue to get to know him. 

At the end of the night, I asked him if I could see him next week. He said, ‚Äòmaybe, I‚Äôm not really sure when.‚Äô

39,n6poj6,1620359568,* NSFW * I (F20) think my fwb (M19) lost interest because I tend to ghost ‚Äî help me get his attention!,"So I‚Äôve known this guy for a few years now, but we live in different cities (hours away from each other). 

We met online, grew to be into each other and it eventually developed into some sexting here and there. We met twice (I drove both times in the bast year) and he was supposed to come over, but because of C19 restrictions this has been halted. Important part: we‚Äôve never had sex, but it was supposed to happen this time. 

Now I was in an unhealthy relationship (my first real relationship) for 6 months. He (M25) was my first consensual partner (full intercourse) and while dating him, I made it a point to cut any NSFW ties with the fwb. Towards the end of my relationship, my ex made me fee extremely unsexy and undesirable (he had an emotional affair with his ex). We split and shortly after, I contacted my fwb. 

Everything seemed nice up until the energy felt different. He knew I was in a relationship and he had said a few kind/sexy things, but they were never reciprocated until I broke up with my ex. I had a hard time getting back onto the flirtatious pony and sometimes I feel like I might be overstepping when I say something inappropriate that would otherwise lead to hours of ‚Äúvirtual fun‚Äù and the desire to link up again. 

I had my finals recently and I disappeared from social media, allowing only my immediate family and best friends to contact me. I know that dipping in and out of conversations isn‚Äôt ideal, but I want to make sure the interest isn‚Äôt fully gone because I quite like this guy. I enjoy being physical with him, but he‚Äôs cool af as well and he‚Äôs like a hotter &amp; much nicer version of my ex. I know inconsistency isn‚Äôt fun, but I‚Äôm trying to communicate better and hopefully it‚Äôs fruitful with him. 

I want to know how I can get him to be interested again (without just exposing myself and using my body to entice him) and figure out if it‚Äôs worth investing more energy.

I consider myself to be a nice guy, yet for some reason nice guys truly do finish last on dating apps. Finding a genuine connection is absolutely exhausting, now I will say I have had some luck on dating apps, but I can‚Äôt handle the rejection. One person rejects me and my self-confidence goes in the fucking tank. It makes me feel so worthless and like I‚Äôm not capable of having a genuine connection with someone, I try to be so nice to people but at the end of the day it means nothing. What is the point of actually being a decent human when no one appreciates it? I try to genuinely get to know someone and so often it results in absolutely nothing coming out of it. I really do hope I don‚Äôt go back to dating apps cause they are so same toxic, I think everyone can agree dating apps are a negative experience, yet no one does anything to try and make it a more positive experience for others.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n6rnuf/dating_apps_make_me_realize_how_awful_society_and/

61,n6rxl0,1620368238,Describe the worst first date you ever went on,"I‚Äôll go first. I have two bad dates that are pretty much tied, so I‚Äôll just tell *one* of them:

I had a great first dinner date with a guy. Total sweetheart, great conversation, and a ton of laughter. But at the end, when he was in the bathroom, I put my credit card down and paid for us both. (Bold gender bending move.) When he came back he was shocked and upset that I paid the bill. He insisted on taking me to a fancy steak restaurant immediately. 

Like...literally immediately. After we‚Äôd just finished our first dinner. I laughed and playfully said, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry...I only got the check *this* time, you‚Äôre getting it on our second date.‚Äù I was being genuine. I was looking forward to another date. 

We got into a cab and I tried to give the driver directions to drop me off at home,  but my date interrupted and told the cab driver the name of the steak restaurant instead. I enthusiastically protested, but he wouldn‚Äôt take no for an answer, and I was too young and naive at the time to stand up for myself as I would now. 

So there I was, totally full from the first dinner, pushing my steak around my plate for an hour, trying to humor the situation. 

At the end, when the check came, he immediately handed his card to the server, then smirked at me and said ‚ÄúNow let‚Äôs go back to my place.‚Äù 

I politely laughed and joked, ‚ÄúThis is only the first date! What kinda girl do you think I am? Hah, how bout we wait a little while for that.‚Äù

He pushed it. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs technically the second date now. We‚Äôre having our *second* dinner of the night.‚Äù 

I stayed firm on my answer. ‚ÄúSorry, but I‚Äôm just gonna call it a night.‚Äù 

That‚Äôs when his face totally changed. The smile melted into a scowl of disgust, and he says in a downright menacing voice, ‚ÄúYou women are alllllll the same. Just take and take and take, and no give.‚Äù

My jaw drops in shocked amusement. I didn‚Äôt know what to say and I just sort of nervously laughed. 

He continues, ‚ÄúI just paid for you to have a really expensive steak dinner, and you still won‚Äôt put out. So fucking typical. Fucking prude.‚Äù 

That‚Äôs when I just started laughing at him wildly. He continues to berate me and the server walks by and overhears it. He starts laughing at him too and points at him and says, ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs laughing at you because you‚Äôre a pathetic prick.‚Äù (‚ÄòTwas a great moment of solidarity.) 

I walk out of the restaurant and the dude follows me. I tell him to stay back, and I start trying to hail a cab. He starts yelling. Going on and on about I-don‚Äôt-know-what because I stopped listening. 

Just then a group of bros walk out of the bar next door, and witness what‚Äôs going on, so they they yell at him ‚ÄúLeave her alone, you fucking psycho!‚Äù So, my lovey date turns to them and starts shouting obscenities at them instead, and they all burst out laughing. (This guy was giving everyone in his path a serious case of the giggles.) ‚ÄúGet therapy, dude!‚Äù 

While he was distracted by them I hopped into a cab, and figured I‚Äôd seen the last of him. Years later I started to see his picture online. A bunch of people who work in his industry came forward about his misogyny and sexual assault. üëèüèº

after that relationship i thought that i would at least meet someone new after that but no.

Last time we met up, (which was a planned date) one thing led to another and we had sex. Immediately after fucking she pressed the question, ""what are you looking for?"", and we all know what that means. I was honest and told her I was looking for an exclusive relationship, I'm not afraid of commitment. She hit me with the typical ""I'm just seeing people rn..."" Fill in the blank. She followed it up by saying, if something developed into a relationship she wouldn't turn it away, which I thought was a good sign and gave me some hope. Since then she directly suggested that I switch shifts so we can work together, and I took that as another sign, I work graveyard, she works days so our schedules were not in sync, shes also a full time TA so shes busy to say the least. I put in the request and sooner than I expected I'm transitioning to day shift. I start my new shift this Sunday.

I've never gone cheap on a date where I'll choose the cheapest spot to go or try and spend as little as possible but I don't throw my money around trying to show off either. 


Now I haven't been on a date in almost a year and most of the girls I've met since high school has been through tinder (I never had much of a social life while studying and my dating options were limited to say the least). So recently I met a waitress and we seemed to hit it off pretty well to the point she even agreed to go on a date with me. So obviously my over excited dumbass of a brain wanted to make sure I at least make a good impression with this as I don't know when I'll get this sort of opportunity again. So I planned this whole thing of dinner, a movie and stocked up my card to play around in the arcade (I know this sounds pretty atypical but there was a lot more to it that I'm not getting into). The amount I spent wasn't to a point that I blew my bank account, but the effort I put in to make sure everything would go flawlessly was more than I ever put into any other date.

74,n6tgqz,1620374973,[20M]Dating while being an engineering student and living with your parents.,"The title says it all, I'm currently a second year engineering student living with my parents. I haven't had any dating experience before. I don't have a car, so I have to commute to school on the local bus. The commute takes 4 hours in total every day.(Monday-Friday)

I've had many females interested in me in my first year of college, I also get many glances from girls, so I assume I'm somewhat attractive(not trying to be cocky). I've even had some girls ask me out. But without a car or any extra money, I feel like I have no chance in the dating scene. Engineering workload is very heavy, so I'm unable to get a part time job. My parents pay for my tuition and give me their credit card to buy food, books and supplies. 

Second year has been all online and my third year is about to be in person. I feel like I'm wasting my 20s as I watch all of my other friends be in relationships. They all have different majors and have much more time on their hands. They hang out a couple times a week and have 1/10th of the workload I get. I study basically 7 days a week and I feel like I'm slowly losing connections with my friends as well.

I was passionate about my current major but I now I wish I could just start over and choose an easier major. I'm about to turn 21 soon and will likely graduate when I turn 23/24. From there I guess I'll be working a full time job. I feel like at this point I won't get into a relationship until my 30s. 

I thought about switching majors but It sounds so stupid to restart just so I can date a girl. I'm not too sure what to do with myself.

77,n6ttxw,1620376558,My Sugar Baby Likes to Go Opossum on Me!,"I have been in an infrequent Sugar Relationship (SR) with a Sugar Baby (SB) in her early 30‚Äôs since November of 2018.  My SB works professionally as a Class Action Settlement Project Manager in Minneapolis and even has her own private office.  She sugars, I believe, to make up the gap in the luxury lifestyle she has cultivated for herself.

We have picked up the steam in our dates since late winter of this year and, thanks to the pandemic and working from home, she has been going on plenty of walks with her dogs in the city and has lost weight and looks pretty damn hot now compared to when we started our SR.  On our last two dates, my SB has actually shown up with her long blonde hair fully coiffed and primped (as opposed to in an up-do) and as she drove into my community for our last PPM date (I live in a distant suburb that has a small town feel), she told me she had numerous men waving at her and honking at her at the local intersections.  Score one for her (and me). üòç

Early in 2019, my SB asked me for an advance on her allowance when her Jeep Wrangler went TU (back before she sold it and switched to borrowing cars when needed from her neighbor and her sister).  After which, she decided that she didn‚Äôt have to really deliver a date for the advance I paid her and it almost ended our SR... we didn‚Äôt talk for a good long while.  So now we get to our trying to have our latest date.  We meet at my place on Thursday mornings.  We had to cancel twice due to this or that.  Then my SB puts the squeeze on me again for her allowance in advance.  Like a fool, I fell for it.  She promised to use part of it to buy some new lingerie from Soma to model for me and now she has gone largely opossum on me.... again!  I am just going to see how long she will keep up her routine before she finally figures out that she has to deliver on our date before she can withdraw more $$$ from her Sugar Daddy (SD) ATM. ü§£  What I find amazing is how my SB‚Äôs mom and sister have not figured out that she must be doing something to make up for an obvious financial gap in her lifestyle, unless they believe her when she low balls the rent figure she pays and/or she inflates the salary she makes at her Class Action Lawsuit Project Manager job.

Lately when we are together and we are talking in a general way about our lives or politics (we are both progressives)... it feels to me that what we have is a true SR.  But outside of our dates, Joanna is distant and even goes opossum on me when it suits her and I find myself questioning if we are really just transactional.  As an example, I will send her two or three line texts that are admiring of her and funny and up beat... only to receive one word answer from her hours or sometimes days later that simply say... ‚ÄúSame‚Äù. ü§ï

81,n6ultd,1620379983,Dating Tips,"Just some tips I've picked up over the years I felt I'd share.

&amp;#x200B;

1) People don't care about strangers.

Back in my  teens, I put on some weight and went to the gym for the first time, but I was so nervous about people watching me in my ""Unfit"" state, I couldn't get myself to do anything. I opened up to one of the personal trainers, and he simply pointed at some random guy, and asked me what I thought about them. I told him, nothing. He pointed at a fat man, and I repeated the same thing, and then a woman, and mostly the same thing.

""If you don't care about them, why do you assume it's any different for them?""

People do not care about strangers. That feeling of fear you experience when you want to go up to hit on someone, or simply to talk to them, that you'll humiliate yourself so much that the earth will swallow you up? Fake. Just think of it like this. Picture something funny, amusing or humiliating you've ever seen or heard from a stranger. How much of their appearance or identity can you actually remember, outside of the situation?

Sure, you go up to someone, you fuck up. They laugh, walk off. Now that's a story they'll tell their friends when they get drunk, but you? They've forgotten you, only what you said / did. Don't worry about making a fool out of yourself, because as far as you need to be concerned, only you think that way.

&amp;#x200B;

2) Pickup lines / Greeting.

Whether it's online dating or meeting people in person, how to open the conversation has always been the point of contention. One of my usual pieces of advice, is simply to say the first thing that came to mind. The first thing that comes to mind is usually based on who you are as a person, how you think, what you like, your sense of humour. 

Granted, you should still think before you speak to avoid saying anything rude. In cases where you expect they'll receive that comment or intro a lot, you can alternatively say the same thing, all the while asking if they've already been told that a lot. The point here is, if they don't like the comment, maybe they aren't the one for you?

The overall point of this tip is to stop trying to come up with the ""Perfect"" witty pickup line, and focus more on something that's actually from you, and not something you read online. If you aren't the person who has that wit, don't pretend you do or it'll fall flat. If they like a band, and you quote a line from one of their songs, without knowing anything about their music, you will run out of them quickly.

&amp;#x200B;

3) Settling

This one is a more personal decision. Fundamentally, you're making a ""Quality"" over ""Quantity"" decision. Would you rather have one perfect thing, or many imperfect things? If you are able to function single and be happy, then don't hesitate to be picky and have standards when dating. If you don't want to be alone, and aren't willing to risk it, then take the risk of dating people you aren't particularly as keen on, just because being with ""Someone"" makes you happy in and of itself, but you pay the price if you don't.

&amp;#x200B;

4) Emotional Baggage.

You know when someone says ""Hey, How've you been?"" and the correct answer is, ""Fine, yourself?"" Yes, keep it that way. You only answer honestly to that question with someone you know, and you know is fine accepting some ranting / baggage. Don't dump your problems on someone you've only just started seeing, unless they actually want to know.

&amp;#x200B;

5) Honesty.

In almost every situation, honesty is always the best policy. I've always lived with the motto, ""Any secret I have, has to be a secret I can live with being revealed, because no secret lasts forever.""

I don't keep secrets that would destroy my life if they got out, rather, I'd prefer to be the one to reveal them early and do damage control myself, because chances are, there are other people / things that can out such a secret.

&amp;#x200B;

6) Communication.

Talk. It'll solve so many of your personal problems. Don't bottle it up, don't delay it, be upfront about it. Don't be afraid to say or hear ""We need to talk.""

If you want to kiss someone at the end of the date, and haven't had that perfect moment to lean in, just ask ""Can I kiss you?"" The worst they can say is No.

&amp;#x200B;

7) Be yourself.

Stop thinking you aren't good enough, stop thinking they wont like what you have to say, stop thinking you have to keep getting things to say from the internet. This doesn't build a stable relationship, it makes a relationship with the mask you've put on, and is most likely deemed to fail when the mask comes off. Yes, be your more charming version, as they get to know you, put on your best side, but don't be fake.

If you're really into something, then use that enthusiasm and drive to put yourself forward, find someone who finds it endearing, whether it be a mutual love of that thing, or just an appreciative look at how driven you are by it.

Be confident, be yourself. Better you find someone that appreciates you being you, than the alternative.

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, what you want to get out of life and a relationship is up to you. You need to decide what is Mandatory, and what is not. Don't hold yourself back with insecurities, find something you can do or say to convince yourself to take that leap forward. And if you decide that what you want is something you're not likely to get, and you are fine with that. Then do so!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n6ultd/dating_tips/
82,n6uuzo,1620381138,Extremely weird date!,"Hey guys!! 

So I want to tell you a story from my dating life when I was in my 20‚Äôies. I don‚Äôt know why but I have been in some super strange situations dating wise and this is just one of the stories. Might share others later! 

(I am now 31, have a child and live with my partner, all good)

Here goes...

I was young (20f) and out partying with some friends in a big city in Europe where i lived at the time. This very cute middle eastern looking guy started flirting with me. Lets call him Yus. His eyes were very intense and he was very good at keeping eye contact. Yus was kind and gentle and I ended up giving him my number. He called the next day and asked me out on a date. I said alright. We texted some in the days before the date and during these days he started calling me ‚Äúyellow‚Äù instead of my real name because he thought my personality was yellow. A bit odd but okay. We agreed to meet up around 14.00 and enjoy a walk in a public park. Sounds good and casual for a first date right? Yeah...

So i show up by one of the entrances of this big public park at 14.00 and text him i am there. Yus shows up from one of the bushes (??) and says i need to put this blindfold on because he has a surprise for me. It was daylight, a lot of families in the park so i wasnt afraid or anything, just thought ‚Äúoh no whats this‚Äù. He guided me through the park and at one point he stopped me, turned me and took off the blindfold. 

The first thing i saw was this blanket on the grass with a picnic basket and i was very relieved lol. Then he asked me to turn around. I did and was very surprised. He had set up a full dinner table with beautiful cutlery, 3 different wine glasses, candles, flowers (yellow of course) and he had prepared a 3 course meal which included caviar and what not. He even had a waiter serving everything for us. Apparently it was his cousin and he just stood there. I tried to be like ‚Äúhi how you doing‚Äù but he didnt respond. So awkward. There were cushions and blankets and it was all very extravagant and strange. On my side of the table there was a wrapped gift. I was very humbled and thanke Yus so much for everything. During the whole meal he called me ‚Äúyellow‚Äù and spent a lot of time just looking into my eyes. Cousin still standing there. To be fair i was a little uncomfortable lol but we were outdoors and there were people around so i was not unsafe. 

After this crazy lunch and wine and everything he asked me to open up the gift. It was seriously crayons in 10 different shades of yellow and a colouring book with all sorts of things he wanted me to colour. There was also a small roll of paper that i rolled out. It was very narrow but extremely long like tose rolls of paper for card receipts if it makes sense. He had written a HUGE text on this crazy long piece of paper about me and the sun and yellow flowers and how i was in harmony with it all etc etc. It was SUPER weird!!

I said goodbye around 17.00 i think. Cousin packed everything while Yus followed me to the train station. I gave him a quick hug and thanked him before hurrying onto a train.

I went home to my parents after this date and explained them everything and they advised me not to see him again lol. And i never did. He tried to call a few times but i was young and very uncomfortable so i just sent him a text thanking him and saying i felt it was best not to meet up again.

84,n6w0wp,1620385836,When you find out your intuition speaks volumes! Players are just that players,"We spent December-March or a good part of March seeing one another.

On our first date, there was something very yucky about being with him. He was super kind, but lacked boundaries of all kinds. I thought this feels familiar. 

I had to have surgery and he let me stay with him while I recovered in January for three days. While I was with him, he would disappear at random times during the night. He later claimed a female was texting him and could not get the message that he was just not that into her. 

His excuse for continuing the conversation was, I dont want to hurt her. 
I finally said, ""I thought we were dating exclusively!"" ""We are, I just dont cut people out!"" 

In retrospect several times, felt like this person was not honest. 

He blew me off, after we made plans twice. He stated, ""I have crippling anxiety."" So, crippling that you cant say, ""Im sorry something else came up, like I dont feel well?"" This speaks volumes about being a player. 

At one point before he admitted to speaking with this other female. I stated, ""Your talking to someone."" ""Yeah, I dated her for six months last year.""

We tried to step back and just be friends 

Every single moment became about him. I couldnt make a statement that he didnt personalize it. 

He represents my IMAGO. Anotherwards, my Dad was incapable of being faithful, until he met my stepmom. 

Please, if you dont have self respect, dont bother dating until you find it.. 

We have been broken off for six weeks and he is claming he has a urinary tract infection and I stated, have you seen a Doctor. He states ""No!"" I said, you might want to before it makes you terribly sick. Then I said ""Have you been sexually active?"" ""Yeah!"" I stated, you would definitely want to wear protection, and if you didnt, you need to be checked..

Although,  I respect complete honesty, this is not a road I wish to travel with anyone ever.

In his defense, I have male friends. They are like brothers to me, they guide me alot 
 on conscious dating. 

I understand the need for human connection and I have been single for 8 years. Ive dated briefly a few times,  but now I know why I steer clear of players..

Im convinced that there are honest, forthright,  faithful, loving men out there, Im just not sure they see me.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n6w0wp/when_you_find_out_your_intuition_speaks_volumes/

I liked him since we firstly talked and he didn't show much interest in me beyond friendship. I was so much anxious with my feelings for him and couldn't keep talking for longer so I told him I like him. He told me can we go on a date and see how things are going to lead us? I was suspicious because I doubted that he really likes me and I was going to end our friendship before he told me about the dating thing. After that we went out twice, and everything was apparently going well. But after the 2nd date I wasn't comfortable with many things, but I continued as I thought we have to CoMuNicate more and all that. Until some day (week ago) he sent me after 2 days of no contacting that he doesn't want to keep the dating thing going for any longer. I was shocked and confused. Long story short, he told me he doesn't feel that spark and he isn't emotionally attracted to me (I don't know what is supposed to mean) and I agreed that it's better to end this thing. But the last thing he asked if we can stay friends and that I am a dear friend to him.

94,n6xdpa,1620390649,Was I in the wrong?,"I am a 23 year old male who recently started to go into the dating scene after spending some time in the work environment focusing on my career for a bit. I had a real experience with a date I met at a dating event. It was meant to be at a speed dating event, and I only talked to her for 5 min where I asked her for her number. 

So when we were texting, I asked her if she wanted to continue this and go on a coffee or dinner date. She accepted and I took her to a semi decent restaurant. Nothing that breaks the wallet, but not something that looks like McDonald's. And no, it wasn't olive garden. We had a nice talk, and I personally enjoyed it. When the bill came up, I paid it in full, which I planned to do the whole time. But I saw what seemed to be a red flag. She not only did not attempt to pay for her half (I would not have let her, but I saw no attempt to reach for the bill or to ask for 2 separate bills or such), she sat there with her legs and arms crossed almost looking like she expected me to pay for all of it. 

I kept that in the back of my mind, but didn't think much of it after. I asked her later via text what she thought of the date and if she is open for another. She said she isn't interested in dating anymore. And I want to make it clear, her exact quote was ""I didn't feel a spark, and no longer wish to date you"". My friend who was sitting next to me saw that response and said she came to get a free meal, and bounced bro. I wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt and said she might just be in a bad situation and I don't want to pressure her into anything. So I sent a text saying okay, thank you for your time then. She messaged me back saying you're not even going to attempt to rescue this? You just give up? 

I was shocked by that message because I always thought that no meant no. I told her this. I told her that once she said I am no longer interested in you, and I still approached her with sexual intent, it is getting into criminal territory and I do not intend to be used as a fleshlight by some 6 foot 6 prisoner. I told her it wasn't me giving up, it was me respecting the clear boundaries she stated, and no man with self respect would pursue a woman after she clearly states she is not interested. I told her that if in the future any man who still pressures you even after you tell him no is not worth it. This must have pissed her off because she blocked me after I said this.

97,n6y30a,1620392849,Is it bad to kiss someone else during the 'talking stage',"I hate using the term 'talking stage', but it's the only possible way to describe what this relationship is at the moment.

I have been talking to this person for around 5 months now, we have met three times during this time and I'm planning on seeing them again soon. We both live quite far away from one another so it's more of a long distanced thing than anything else. 

We both have made it clear we like one another, and talk about places we can go in the future sometimes, so it seems as if it can lead somewhere more serious. However, we have never really established what our relationship is, I tried addressing this last time we saw one another but he kind of shoved off the question. 

It feels a little more than casual, but like I said we have never really spoken about what we are, and after the last time I tried bringing it up and being shut down in a way, I'm too scared to ask again. This leaves me a little in the dark I suppose.

So, since the last time I saw him (last month) I have been faced with a couple of tempting situations. The first time was with a guy who was clearly into me, and I allowed him to flirt but we never kissed, so that doesn't really count. The second guy we flirted quite a bit and we did kiss, and the third guy we made out a couple of times in his bed (woops). And yes, I was drunk on all of these occasions. So yeah, I kind of feel bad about the third situation. 

I don't know whether to tell this to the guy I'm actually talking too however, but at the same time I have no idea what he's doing when he goes out. For all I know he could be doing the exact same, but at the same time I feel like he wouldn't... I don't want to tell him as I'm worried he will break things off, which I don't want because I really like this person. I also don't know whether it's something I should even have to say, considering we haven't established whether we are official or not.

What I wanna know is whether this is cheating or not, as relationships like these are always so confusing and life would be so much more easier if there wasn't such a stigma on the 'so, what are we' questions.

98,n6y4c5,1620392962,A guy out of my league. Please help,"So I'm turning 18 in a few months and I met someone who's going to the same college as me. We've snapped (on Snapchat) for a while now and I'm slowly starting to like him more than a friend. But I'm not sure if he feels the same way. Due to my high school being different from his, I graduated at 11th grade instead of 12th and took a gap year before college. He's currently in his last year of high school(graduating in a few months). So the problem I'm facing is that we used to snap a lot, whenever I would snap back, he would usually reply with a snap in a few seconds/mins. But nowadays, he hasn't opened my snaps and he would do it for max 2 days. The other day, I noticed he read our college group chat's messages and snaps (he doesn't often snap in that group as much as he does with me) but not so much as open my snap. I'm not sure if he's busy or already found me boring. But he would snap back to me eventually. He has been sending me mirror selfies of him in the gym and most of the time funny or sleepy selfies. I've asked some of my guy friends for advice and most of them told me if he didn't like me, then he wouldn't keep replying to me. Figured I would get everyone's advice at this point. Does he feel the same way?

The second question is: do I have a chance? We are both completely different people who do completely different things. He's really out of my league. He loves sports, food, playing with kids and working out while I like playing video games, reading books and cringy wattpad stories, and watching movies. I'm not as fit as him that's for sure and I'm about 58/59kg, slim thick. I'm worried he would want different things or he wouldn't like me cause of my weight or how I look in general. Is that a thing? Does it mean something? I have a few body issues like my thighs, stomach, etc, and told myself many times that he wouldn't like me if we were ever together because there are many things I couldn't do, many things that I couldn't wear that look better on many other gorgeous girls he could date.

Also, I can't meet him in person yet because the distance between us is super far away.

99,n6ybmh,1620393572,"""You should be toxic, women love that!""","I just think it's hilarious when male dating coaches advocate for other men that the secret to getting woman to fall in love with you is just ""be toxic and treat her like sht, it works trust me"".

That isn't to say it can't work in the short term, getting them to reluctantly date you, but it just results in a mutually unhappy relationship which probably won't last. 

I don't think they seem to realize that women (and men for that matter) will only be ""addicted"" or stay in toxic relationships if the partner has positive arbitrary attributes (i.e. physical attractiveness, financial status &amp; wealth) that make the toxicity worth tolerating.

But if you have all the toxic traits and zero positives, the relationship will either never happen or they will...

A) Leave you for someone also toxic, but still has desirable superficial traits.

B) Leave you for someone with all the positive things (assuming you had any) about you and none of the negatives.
