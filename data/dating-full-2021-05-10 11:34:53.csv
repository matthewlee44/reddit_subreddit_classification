We’re 9 years apart and I don’t notice the age difference. 34m, 25f. We get along like a house on fire, always laughing together. He tells me regularly ‘I laugh so much with you’, I know his friends, his family know about me but we haven’t been able to meet due to Covid. He used to call his parents every Sunday but since we’ve been dating, it’s become less and less. We normally see each other a few times a week, sometimes less or more depending on our schedule. He invites me to all the 'big' things in his life, for example, we were going to go to his medical ball together (he would've been seen with me in front of other girls if there is anything nefarious). When we drive or hangout in different areas together, he likes to look up the prices of houses. He's also said in front of me how cute kids are and that he can't wait to do that one day. Signs to me he's testing my reaction and seeing if I want that as well.

A few months into dating, he asked to make sure that we’re not seeing other people. He isn’t into casual sex and I think exclusivity is important to him. A few months ago I was anxious about what we were - he hadn’t asked me to be his girlfriend and I thought this is something that he would’ve wanted to do. He’s traditional, wanting something serious such as marriage/family. We had a few talks about the direction of our relationship, he said there were a few things he was a bit concerned about, a few things we maybe didn’t have in common (he’s very risk-averse and overthinks everything).

He’s studying so after that conversation he said he would decide at the end of his exams, his exams have finished now. He went away recently with some of his University friends, he was unsure of whether to go (seemed like he wanted to be with me, haha) and wanted to see me before he left. I’ve felt good about everything between us post-exams as I had a feeling he was going to slowly contact me less and less and try and see me less - due to his uncertainty.

One night on the phone, I told him that I wasn’t quite sure whether continuing to have sex with him was a wise idea as we aren’t boyfriend/girlfriend. He was confused that I said it was casual. I said ‘well, we aren’t in a relationship’ and he said ‘you are my girlfriend’ I’m certain he went onto say ’I thought we’ve known this since we started dating’ so I then asked him ‘well if I was to meet a new friend of yours that I haven’t met, would you introduce me as your girlfriend? And he said yes. Unfortunately, he has to repeat his exams so I may not be able to see him for a while, I do need to clarify that he actually meant this.I just wonder why he had this hesitancy a few times when we had the discussion a few months back though? There was even a point where I suggested we should end things because he wasn't so sure and he agreed. Maybe this is natural though and a reflection of his risk-averse attitude about things. There were just some uncertainties on his part. He said he could've been overthinking it. As a result, it sort of made me more anxious and I suggested we should end it.

He said it’ll be good to have a proper chat about things as we’ve both been putting things off, as so he said.

I got to his house, he said yes I have been his girlfriend all along and he doesn't know why I would think otherwise. He said that he feels it’s not going to work because of our age gap and he claims we're very different people. I personally do not see this as I feel like we share the same values, we're compatible in a lot of areas etc. He told me that he finds me beautiful, loves my sense of humour and that we get along and have fun together. I did mention that we handle conflict differently but our only arguments have been over text/call and since that's such a poor form of communication - it's hard to tell.

He started to cry (this is the most emotion I've seen from him), saying he won't be able to cook me any more dinners and our memories shared together. He then went back and forth and said he doesn't know if he's making the right decision, that he will never find someone like me, I am out of his league etc. He said maybe he's just one big idiot after all and he's made a stupid decision. I was calm in my response and he said ""why don't you get angry? this is making it more difficult"" in a somewhat cute way. He just kept saying that lately everything has been solidified in his brain that it's probably the most responsible decision. He asked me if I thought he was being unreasonable.

Now I feel like since we've been arguing quite a bit the past few weeks and he's been stressed, possibly his decision is skewed. I hadn't seen him in 2 or 3 weeks due to exams and I asked whether maybe we just got cold feet because of us not seeing each other. I remember months ago he said he sometimes questions us in absence.

We spent over 4 hours talking and it was like he didn't want me to leave nor did I. He then asked if we should go to dinner together. He finally walked me to my car and he couldn't stop crying.

Something in me decided to message him the other morning after I left:Me - Morning 📷 I don’t know if messaging you is the best idea, but I hope you haven’t woken up too sad. If you ever want to catch up on neutral grounds, a coffee or lunch, don’t hesitate - I still consider you a friend. Even under these circumstances, it was nice to see you last night and I am saddened I won’t be able to have more of them with you. That’s all 📷Him - Morning! I was in two minds as to whether to message you with the same sentiment 📷 I feel very much the same. Like you say it’s always nice seeing you, and it’s hard for me to think we won’t be sharing more moments together. I really hope you’re feeling ok today 📷 Enjoy the rest of your weekend 📷Me - Aw, well if you’re keen to catch up in a week to come or a few months, let me know. I’m trying to not make this any harder for us but it is difficult. I didn’t react with anger because that’s genuinely not how I feel about us. I miss you, enjoy your morning eggs 📷Him - Will do 📷 miss you too, at least you can have your eggs with olive oil today 📷Me - These thoughts are best discussed in person but I’m not sure if that can happen and they’re weighing heavy on me. I do think we could work through the issues as I feel there are more positives than negatives. I am aware that the past few weeks have been pretty nasty for the both of us but I’ve been particularly harsh on you. If I don’t hear back from you, I will, of course, assume you do not feel the same way and will accept your decision.Him - I thought I did explain that although the last month or so has been really difficult, it hasn’t been the main reason why I reached the decision I did. Of course I’m always really happy to talk to you about anything though, so if you still want to talk things through naturally I’m happy to do that 📷He went onto say that he hates that he's upset me and that it's all really difficult for him but he **thinks** it's all for the best.

We caught up and went to the beach together. We had a good time, he just feels at the moment he thinks it’s the best decision, although he isn’t fully confident he’s doing the right thing. He said maybe in a year it’ll make more sense and we realise we’re fit for each other. He said that he told his mother we broke up and she got really angry. Something was quite odd, he told me his friend (who I know) broke up with his girlfriend but they’re back together. We then went back to his for a cup of tea and we talked a bit more. He admitted that he does get in his head a lot and could be overthinking things. Said again that he's scared he's going to lose someone amazing but feels it's the right decision **right now**. Again, I feel because I've been arguing with him over text lately and he feels overwhelmed. When I left, he said he wants to see me again in a week or 2.

We spoke on the phone and I told him it’s really painful catching up with him and I don’t want to feel like an option to him or being left on the back burner, he said that wasn’t his intention and he would never do that as he has too much respect for me. He said it was hard catching up with me recently as well. He said he agreed to catching up because he felt like it was something I wanted. We spoke a bit more and he said that if he has a change of heart in the future, he won’t just sit on it. He’ll tell me. He told me he hopes I know how beautiful I actually am.

He ended up calling/messaging me over Christmas and NYE. I do feel like I am the one who predominately initiates contact with him first, I’ve been sending him sort of lengthy messages and he claims he’s overwhelmed by it. Recently we’ve been having an hour or so conversations when we usually would never have that as he was never one to speak on the phone. He expressed doubts about our break up as per usual and said he’s probably one big idiot after all. He told me he’s been on 2 dates with 2 girls as I asked, said he’s sort of interested but it hasn’t gone anywhere. I was quite upset and he assured me he wants to stay single for a while, he also said it’s not like he even wants a relationship with them. He said to give me some context that there were girls before we met that he was interested but it didn’t go anywhere. I was quite offended because he went on dates with girls that he basically broke up with me for. He broke up with me over an age gap but then went on dates with girls my age? Makes no sense. He said it’s all really regrettable and then told me that it's not that he wants a relationship with these people and said they’re just friends he wanted to get to know better. He said he wishes I could see his phone. Near the end of the phone call, he got teary about the fact he thinks I'm so sweet and don't deserve this.

He said over a month ago that a catch up would be good to clear the air. He also wouldn’t directly answer the question when I asked if he just sees me as a friend. I’ve decided to pull back, but it seems like he wants to catch up. At the start of this month, he offered to call about something, I think he was sort of surprised by that as I usually am jumping at any chance for us to speak on the phone. He sent me a message about the date/time tba (which I didn't respond to) and then he sent me a follow up message about a week later saying “Morning, when works this week for you?” with a smiley face. He then said whenever is fine, to choose a day/evening and let him know. He then said he hopes my mother is doing okay. This was 2 weeks ago and I didn't responded. He sent me another message 2 weeks later saying he hadn’t heard from me in a while, was wondering how I am and asked if my mother is okay. I replied and I was friendly, but brief. He replied and said a few things and then said ‘we never caught up in the end, let me know if you would still like to’ we talked a bit more and then I told him that I feel he just wants to catch up to free himself from guilt and that we can only catch up if we both feel it’s best for us to be together. He responded with saying that he understands and he didn’t think it would still be really difficult but he understands and there is a bit of truth in wanting to free himself but he thought it would be healthy in general. Apologised for the pain he’s caused me and wished me all the best. I told him that I just felt him talking about clearing the air was ominous and I just wanted to have dinner with him and not talk about us. He said that he understands how that could have caused it and apologies and said it’s the furthest from how he wanted to make me feel. I didn't respond and almost 2/3 months later, I sent him a message telling him what I wanted to tell him if we had cleared the air. He positively responded to it, told me things have been really difficult on his end, he still thinks and misses me all the time. That he basically feels the same, it’s just really hard and he doesn’t know what to do and doesn’t want to mess with my head so he tries to leave me alone. He also said he misses laughing at dumb things with me/times we shared.

Advice? What do you think he would benefit from telling me he still thinks about me all the time/misses me.

I feel a bit upset and get upset time to time because my current boyfriend he’s amazing and a great boyfriend but before we started properly committing to each other , I had feelings for him for years and he always “never wanted anything serious” and when I finally moved on and started seeing other people he basically wanted a proper committed relationship.

But it annoys me because prior to that I was all about him and he’d message all these girls even though he knew I had feelings for him but it’s not like just cause I fucked someone else he “suddenly” developed feelings like he would’ve had them prior because that seems odd. 

So what I want to know is if he did have feelings prior and obviously had this mentality of yeah she’ll never leave me so I am gonna talk to all these girls then like why would you not want to be exclusive with somebody you have feelings for? I really doubt just cause I saw someone else would make him suddenly form feelings.

• LGBTQIA+ RELATED
I’m going to start from the beginning and hopefully I get back some helpful answers. Preferably not rude ones. This is my first post. 

My fiancé and I have been together a year and a few months. When we first started talking he had told me about how he was non-binary and was wanting to transition. I was perfectly okay with it because I thought I was bisexual but a couple months after we started dating, he told me about how the feeling of wanting to transition was no longer there. I didn’t really feel a certain way but as months went by I realized I wasn’t actually bisexual because I had done things with females sexually before BUT I was never able to commit to one and I don’t think I would ever be able to commit to one now. I have fallen in love with my fiancé as who he is now. I feel like transitioning adds a whole new level of stress and anxiety for me because I worry for his health &amp; safety. I told him if he was to transition from male to female that I would no longer be dating him but I would still be his friend and support him 100%. However, he will not let me break up with him and wants me to stay with him even though I don’t feel comfortable with dating females. I have however expressed these feelings to him so he knows how I feel so I wasn’t sending mixed signals about how I feel.

I just need help/advice because I feel like such an a-hole of a fiancé but I know I’ll probably get hate &amp; that’s okay. I’m just trying to figure all of this out.

My bf (24M) and I (23F) have been dating for about a year and 5 months… About 3 months in, my best friend of 9 years (23F) and her boyfriend came to visit me, and they all met for the first time. We all had a really nice weekend together, and she told me how much she approves of my relationship.

Flash forward to September 2020, my best friends boyfriend (they had been dating for 4 years) broke up with her out of the blue. She was obviously devastated and I ended up cancelling several plans with my boyfriend to support her. My boyfriend was very empathetic (he even helped us redecorate her flat, mount her TV etc.) in the weeks after, but he did start to get frustrated about our lack of one on one time, which I can understand. We had already been doing long-distance through the first UK lockdown (which was very hard on both of us) so the fact that we could finally be together in person was obviously important to both of us.

I tried my best to compromise between the two of them (ie: seeing him on days that she had plans with other friends or bringing him w me to see her), but as this went on I did notice that my best friend was being a little passive aggressive/rude to him. For example, if he’d come with me to her flat she’d shut herself in her room n refuse to really interact with him, despite her being completely okay with me and our other friend before he’d show up. I tried to dismiss this as her just lashing out after her breakup, but obviously it did upset me a little. 

I have a complicated relationship with my best friend. She has a lot of flaws, she can be self absorbed, selfish and ungrateful sometimes, and we do have a difference in maturity… But she’s been with me through every high and low I’ve ever had, and she’s family to me. When we first started being friends (at age 14) I was diagnosed with panic disorder and anxiety, and she was supporting me with my daily panic attacks/vomiting etc at school. Throughout the years my MH deteriorated (I attempted su*cide when we were living together) and I’ve been diagnosed with depression, self harm, ED, OCD and a mood disorder. Her and her boyfriends visit that I mentioned earlier was actually to support me following a r*pe. She’s been there with me through it all. As much as we’ve had problems in the past, she is one of the very few people I know I can rely on if I ask.. But throughout the early days of her breakup she was especially awful to all the people who cared about her, and my boyfriend saw all of this first hand. I know that he didn’t really like how she was treating me and our other friends, especially because he knows about my MH issues… I was also angry and resentful. I kept comparing her behaviour with mine at my worst (saying that I was never mean to anyone after my attempt etc), but as time has gone on I’ve forgiven her as I do understand that she was in the worst place that SHE has ever been in and everyone copes differently.

Since those first 2 months of her breakup she ended up taking time off her post-grad studies and moving back home to stay with her family during covid, and my boyfriend and I were back on track. She was coping better away, and bc of time differences etc we were keeping less in touch. But as the UK went into lockdown again my boyfriend and I started having more and more fights, and struggled with long distance. After one big argument we ended up breaking up and didn’t have any contact for a few days… My best friend was face-timing me and supporting me through it, but was getting frustrated that my boyfriend wasn’t reaching out to resolve anything. She ended up posting a story on her instagram alluding to us both being single, and that evening is when my boyfriend finally spoke to me and told me he wanted to work on things.

Since then my boyfriend and I have patched things up, but after that post he basically blocked her off of his social media. Months have passed since then and he still hasn’t undone it, which is now making me feel uncomfortable. He keeps saying that hes not mad, he just doesn’t want to see her posts and that social media shouldn’t matter, but she’s mentioned to me that she feels upset and uncomfortable that my boyfriend has cut her out. I know social media is not that important, but given the fact that they have no face-to-face interaction, I do see my best friends side that it creates tension. I’ve begged him to smooth it over but he’s stubborn and just refuses to, even though I’ve told him that he’d be doing it for ME not for her… I can’t deal with the fact that I’ve been basically put in the middle of both of them for more than a year now… My best friend is planning to move back to the UK very soon, so I really don’t want tension between the two of them, especially if I want all of us to spend time together. 

Sorry if this was a really long-winded post, but theres a lot of layers to the issues between them… Does anyone have any advice on what I should do in this situation?  I feel like things would be easier if my boyfriend just unblocked her, but he refuses to see my side.

Little backstory: I was in a  relationship with a girl (let's call her J), which was my first love. We  broke up around 1.5 years ago. After a few months I met M (F26) and we  started dating. We had an amazing time and it was all going really  great, with a lot of passion from both.

It  all went well until J contacted me again and again trying to get back  with me, which I refused, but where I also didn't completely block her.  After a while though, because of her being my first love probably, she  got back into my feelings a little bit and it felt I couldn't continue  with M. A while after, I got back together with J, but after some time  we also again noticed why it didn't work out and why we just didn't fit  together. Looking back at it, I should have known and it was a bit  against advice of people, but I guess I had to learn it this way.

Now,  a few months after again breaking up with J, M messaged me to just send  me happy birthday wishes. I already had a little bit in mind that I  fucked up and should have stayed with M, because everything was so  amazing with her, and I guess I was blind.. But then last week it was  her birthday and I send her a happy birthday message and in between we  talked a bit every here and there after not having contact for months.  Now I went to her place for her birthday just to talk and have a fun  day!

So I went there, we were  talking updating each other, having fun, got some food for us, drank a  bit and it was just all fun and laughing, making a little walk etc, all  just pretty much like it always was. At one point she mentioned she just  started dating someone again, which she said was going very good. From  the one side, I was very happy for her, also realising that she was hurt  in the past mostly by a guy that cheated on her etc. From the other  side though, I wanted to ask her that day if she wanted to try it again  with me, and it was a bit of a bummer also hearing that she started  dating.

Because I was happy to see  her feeling good and not trying to get her confused or something, I  didn't mention that I wanted to try it again with her. However, the rest  of the night was also just very fun, and I also slept over at her  place, in her bed also. She always was just okay with that and said it  was no problem, but I also kind of sensed she was feeling very good and  comfortable with me.

Now, what I'm  struggling with a bit is what I should do. I want to respect her  (that's also why I didn't mention that I wanted to get back with her  explicitly, and I didn't try anything with her that day), and I want to  see her happy. On the other side, I just would have liked to start  dating with her again.

So reddit..  Should I just let it go a bit, get some time over it and maybe next  time when we meet that we talk about it? Should I just text her that I  didn't want to tell her at first, but it's something that's just what I  want? Or should I just not tell her about it and see what happens if it  continues with the new guy she's dating? I am just looking for some  opinions, or advice.

Tldr: should I tell my ex date that I want to date her again, while she's dating someone new?

And such feelings are of different kinds too. The toxic feeling in a relationship is one of them --which alot of us is mostly familiar with. I'll try to make this short and brief as much as I can. I dont know how to specifically express everything to stress out the main points but.. here it goes. 

When one has been through a toxic relationship from the past, things can be at times challenging with them.. if you're gf/bf has been through one before, know that they have (1) Trust issues — being lied to/cheated on hurts, a load lot. Which will lead them to feel insecure, resulting to them protecting low self esteem.  They have self doubts and they'd feel like they're not good enough for someone. Heartbreaking as it already is, it's one of the toughest things they are trying to overcome. 
May you be patient and genuine enough to make time, to reassure and remind them of their worth, that they are loved, they are enough, and you are proud of him/her. (2)Trauma, they hate it when flashbacks keep popping out of nowhere in their thoughts from the things that hurt them the most. Those that they wish they've buried for the rest of their lives. Most of the time, they will never tell you — and that's painful.
May you never get tired of giving kisses, cuddles and snuggles everytime you are next to them. Basically, just treat them right.  (3) They overthink ,(so) sensitive, and (or) has the need to say sorry everytime. A common result from trauma, their system will automatically think that if something is wrong or when you have misunderstandings, it's always their fault. 
They cry or walk away out of fear that they'll reexperience the amount of pain they have felt from the past. To them, they would choose that over hearing things that would make them feel worse. 
May you be able to set aside pride, reach out and comfort them, if you are in the middle of something — stop! Stop at what you are doing ,if you can, and talk to them. 

Being in their shoes is harder than you think. Most of the time, they get misunderstood. I'm not a relationship expert and I'm not saying this applies to everybody, but just want to share what one would mostly encounter or feel when he/she has been from a toxic realtionship. I experienced it too and I understand, a couple of years had already passed by but I'm still struggling to overcome some of it.

I'm dipping my toe back into dating after being in a 4.5-year relationship that was very toxic, so I'm wary of the people I talk to and their behaviours. 

So I've been talking to this guy for just under a week now, we met on Tinder and have been talking every day. We've arranged to meet up next weekend.

I feel like I'm overthinking this, but yesterday I went to check his Tinder profile (my friend wanted to see a picture of who I was talking to) and noticed that he had uploaded a new picture. 

Obviously, this in itself is totally fine, we're not committed hell we haven't even met IRL yet, but he keeps talking about how much he's into me and all the cute dates he wants to take me on and whatnot, and how 'perfect' I seem to be for him, but why upload a new picture the same day you're saying all this if that makes sense?

I don't mind if he's talking to other people, but I would just want to know. I personally don't like speaking to multiple people at once, I don't have the energy. The things he's been saying don't seem like something you'd say if you were also interested in other people.

I'm one of those that's ok being a single independent female and like to keep things casual. I'm lucky enough that I can go in and out of wanting to be alone and needing pp without a lot of effort so I just go get it when I need it. Before Covid, I did OLD for a few months and found a few pp for FWB type and had fun. I worked a lot and that worked for me. Then the pandemic happened, my area was pretty strict and to be safe I stopped casually socializing.

Now, I moved and in a new area and after being vaccinated etc. I got back to OLD and meeting pp again. But after the year we all had, it feels different. I have more time to reflect on what I'm doing and I dunno it's confusing me lol. I met a couple of pp so far irl that didn't go anywhere except ONS but found a FWB last month. FWB in that we keep meeting up still. We vibed pretty well from the start and met up 4 times now. Once a week we spend 5-6 hours together ""dating"". He might have been opened to meet more but I'm busy and told him I'm only free on weekends. We don't text much in between, but comes Friday, he'll check in and we starts again and making plans to meet up. I'm not a texter with him and prefer irl so it works. So what's the problem?

I guess I'm feeling self pressure to keep looking for other pp to ""date"" so that I don't get emotionally attached. Is this a thing that's healthy when there is not pressure from either of us to want more or to commit? I know most of you guys are going to be like if it works what's the big deal. Why am I tripping? I don't want a deeper commitment to or from anyone and I learned that ONS is too much effort for not enough return and too empty for me. So why all the confusion now?

For a starter, he has a wild past (Fraternity/drugs). He wanted to kiss me and invited me to his place on the first date. I told him I don't do hookups and asked him if that's what he wanted. He said, he's done it before and was up for it if there's chemistry.

Then he asked me out again. I was on the fence but I found him interesting as person so we did go on other dates. After the 4 dates, now I really like him. I think he's cute and has a great personality.

But only thing that makes me still skeptical is that he doesn't put much effort into the dates. He usually wants to hangout indoor, and I suggest outdoor activities. And he's really flirty. So whenever he says he can't wait to see me or he misses me, I can't tell if he's joking. He texts me everyday -good morning/goodnight.

We haven't done anything physical because I like going slow and getting to know the person first. And he said he's okay with that and didn't make a big deal.

They helped me out with my profile and this is the advice they gave (for context I would say I am a pretty average looking guy, and am short, but I still had a pretty high success rate mostly because of the photos I choose):  
1. Make sure that you include a pic of your whole body, not just your face.   
2. Make sure to have at least 1 to 2 group pictures, and make sure there are girls in those photos. It makes you look more sociable and shows that you have female friends.   
3. Show some pics that demonstrate you are fun to be around. I had a photo of me in a big pink onesie as my first pic, and at least half of the girls I matched with mentioned the onesie is why they picked me.

That means if you get a ""no"" most of the time, it doesn't mean you're doing anything wrong. This is hard because we learn that most of the time if you're getting mostly ""no's"" you need to step back and reassess. 

In dating, getting mostly rejection is not a sign of a problem...probably. Like looking for a job, or auditioning for a role, most people get turned down vastly more than they get picked. While you might feel like you're compatible with everyone, you're probably only really compatible with 5% of people you encounter in dating. So being turned down isn't a sign you're doing it wrong...it's a sign you're doing it!

Your past failure doesn't predict future success. 

Good people still struggle to know whether the common denominator in dating rejections is them. If you're wondering for some signs of whether your lack of dating success is about you, or about the fact that you just have found your compatible people yet, here are some things to ask yourself:

1. Do you have other good relationships in your life? Good friends, a healthy friend group, decent relationships with co-workers, and/or family if your family is nice and normal. Many people who complain the loudest about being alone, it turns out don't have any relationships and are wanting to put all of those needs onto a romantic partner. Making friends as an adult is HARD. But so is a romantic relationship! If you lonely, take some time to put some focus on your non-romantic relationships. You don't need a BFF, or to be close with your entire high school friend group. But you need people in your life you can talk to about hard things, spent time with, who appreciate who you are and treat you well. A lot of my friends who struggle with dating also have a long history of cutting off friends, huge dramatic friend breakups, and all that bitterness and anger is poured into dating, so that they can find their romantic partner and not ever need friends again. Friends are not a placeholder for a romantic partner. 

2. Do you have a support system? A romantic partner should be one thread in the safety net of a support system. If you put all your weight on one person, they will break. A support system can be family members, friends, mentors, online communities. Ideally at least one person you can text and say ""I'm having a hard time"" and get a healthy, welcoming response. This people don't fall into your life. You need to be that person for other people, and make sure they are also that person back to you. If you have never had a supportive, healthy non-romantic relationship then therapy is a good starting point. Therapy can be the first thread that you build the safety net around. 

3. Are constantly moving the goal posts of what it would take to make you happy? It's okay to be lonely as a single person, to wish for a relationship, to miss physical closeness. The same way it's normal to be unhappy in a bad job, or in a crappy apartment, or horrible roommates. But it's a red flag if you find yourself thinking ""If only for X thing, I would be a happy person."" ""If only for X thing, I would be the person I want to be."" If you have a horrible roommate, or a crappy apartment, or a bad job, or are unhappily single it's fine to think ""I am pretty happy expect for X thing, which I wish I could change."" But one's happiness shouldn't be tied up completely in one thing. If you think you are only unhappy because of X reason, and your life will totally turn around if X changes, you have an unrealistic idea of how happiness works. Happy people know how to be happy even when things aren't going well. Unhappy people are unhappy even when they get what they want. They just change the goal posts when it happens, and blame their unhappiness on other things. 

4. Do you know and talk to people of the opposite sex outside of romantic interests? (for hetero folks, clearly). If the only time you ever interact with a woman/man is when they are a romantic pursuit, you risk both idealizing and objectifying the opposite sex, and only seeing them as a means to an end. You're susceptible to this if you find yourself grouping all women/men together. If a woman dislikes you because you wear the wrong shoes, do you think ""All women care about shoes and now I have to care about shoes too if I want a relationship."" Or do you think ""That one woman sure cares a lot about shoes!"" Don't extrapolate about half the people in the world from a handful of experiences. And don't be a person who frames everything you like as what ""all"" men or women like. 

5. Do you have a combative attitude towards dating? If you approach dating as a conflict between you and the sex of your interest, then you will turn off a lot of people. Having a romantic partner means having a teammate. You can't find a teammate while hating everyone who's picking teams. If your only emotional response you can have to being rejected is to hate on the person rejecting you, then you aren't ready to date yet. 

6. Lastly, do you smell good and look clean? It merits being said. So many people are failing at dating because they do NOT smell good or do NOT look clean, and no one is telling them. Wear clean clothes, shower regularly, wash your sheets (at least one a month) open your windows to your bedroom so it doesn't smell like a gym. I should not smell anything when I'm a foot away from you, and I should smell nice things like laundry soap and shampoo smell when I go in for a hug. You don't need to go to the gym if you don't want to, you don't need to get in shape, you don't have to spent a lot of time or money on what you wear if you don't want to. But you need to smell nice, and look clean. (And wearing clothes that fit properly also helps). 

If you read through these five things, and say to yourself ""that's not really an issue with me"" then just trust that your success level with dating is a reflection of the reality that dating is majority rejection and your past failure isn't a prediction of future success. When you get rejected, that means you're dating! If it hits too hard, step back and take care of yourself. It's okay if rejection stings, it probably always will, but please don't take it as a sign that there is something wrong with *you* and examine everything you do and say to find the problem.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,766051,public,self,How to tell if it's you or not.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n9by6c/how_to_tell_if_its_you_or_not/,all_ads,6,,,

But even after being more direct, having more open conversations, being very direct and explicit with my boundaries and needs, I still feel he’s contradictory, evasive with his answers and not being straight with me.  I still have this overwhelming feeling that he’s not genuine and that he’s just telling me whatever he thinks I want to hear.

My gut is saying run but my mind is saying “he’s not a bad guy, you’re overthinking things” and my mind is making excuses for his contradictions.

I've known her since September last year and we did meet up on a friendship base from time to time. She liked some boys at that time, tried a relationship but failed (only lasted 1 month) and I've been there kinda in the background. I didn't think about it more, but lately I did catch feelings for her and started to meet her in a more date-ish manner (going to the park , drinking a bit together, having fun, dancing etc. a bit cringy ik but it is very enjoyable for both of us :) ). Last time we even watched the stars and philosophized about stuff. 
I've been trying to make a buildup to ultimately ask her to be my girfriend, but even though I was close to doing it, I believe it needs some mlre time and 'dates'.

Now I do believe I made some mistakes too:
1. I never really explicitly asked for a date, just asked if we wanna see eachother
2. The second thing is that I've been doing some moves, like puttin my arms around her, she put her leg over mine while laying down, I touched her leg and held her hand. It all sounds nice but the thing that I never asked for consent because it just happened really buggs me out totally
3. This is not a mistake more like a question which is that she said that it was nice meeting me and stuff when I asked her the day after (I am kinda insecure if she really thinks the same about me)

Feels really weird coming to Reddit for dating support, but I don't want to go to some weird forum or something like that so here we go... :)

So, I've had a crush on this girl for 1,5 years now. I decided that nothing good was going to come out of it a few months back, so I told myself that I hated her, I talked shit about her, I changed the heart emojis to some Chinese food and chopsticks on her username on snap. It worked, but now we're back here again (yayyyy). I have a theory why I might have come back to liking her. The thing is, my social life is very limited, and I don't have many friends. Not because I do not have the option to, I just don't trust people enough to begin a friendship. The friends I do have are very toxic and I feel left out most of the time. So yeah my lack of friends played a roll in my setback, or what do you think Reddit psychologists?

She's by far the prettiest girl I have ever seen, she's intelligent, funny, charming, hard-working, passionate, athletic etc. This is the first time I have ever felt this way about someone, and I hate it because it won't evolve into something.

Help me please, anyone :)

To anyone who comments, please state yes or no as to whether you personally think they work as a 'situationship' kind of deal. And also if you have been in one before and how did this play out.

For a solid definition, I would define a perfect FWB as both parties involved are friends, they have set the ground rules that they can't take things further (for whatever reason) and that no feelings will get involved. Just casual sex whenever they need it. And they can walk away whenever they need to without any emotional attachment or hurting either person.

For me personally, I have been involved in two and they didn't end well. Feelings got involved. The first FWB the other person caught feelings and I resisted, whilst my second FWB was the opposite, I caught the feels (ahhh karma). Both ended with someone being hurt.

Which begs the question for me, can intimate relationships of this kind last?

I know her Twitter profile and I see her tweets to know information about it. I find that 2 months ago she was about to get married when her ex told her ""I don't love you anymore, bye"" i mean she had the engagement ring. And then she tells me ""it's better not to keep talking, bye"" And I thought ""no way, We talk as if we were a couple"" and I stopped talking to her for 10 days, until we meet at a party with friends from college, and as a good gentleman I went to say hello. The party passed and all my friends started dancing, and she came up to me and said ""can you give me a kiss?"" I kiss her, we hold hands and start dancing. And since that day we have not stopped talking, she has her job and I do too, so most of the time we talk at night. She clearly told me that she is not ready for a relationship yet, and I fully understand what she went through. But I know that she likes me, and I try not to talk to her much but we have been talking (since the party) for 2 weeks in a row. 

Any advice? I really like her a lot, and I understand very well the situation she is going through, my friends tell me ""give time to time""

I can’t go anywhere or do anything that I don’t have to be reminded I’m too much of a freak for a relationship.

When I’m in public it feels like everyone has a partner. Everyone is holding someone’s hand, no one is alone but me. When I turn on TV it’s all shows that center around some relationship. I started watching The Boys on Amazon and romantic relationship and sex are massive parts of a show about killing superheroes.

If I go on to Instagram all it is are just my friends all happy in relationships and in love. When I first opened TikTok today, the very first thing I saw were tips on hooking up for 18 year old college freshman and literally all the comments were about how they hooked up with people a week into the semester and their parties and all of that and it’s so fucking depressing.

We share similar ambitions career-wise, have a very similar type of humour, and in general mesh well personality-wise. We would speak often and plentiful over text messaging.

The third date that we had was just the same: incredibly fun and good with each other. It was so good we lost track of time and we could not leave due to curfew. We ended up sleeping the night together, fooled around a bit but since we both had to be up early for work we didn't escalate it further. In the morning I noticed, however, that she was particularly cranky. Now this could obviously be typical morning crankiness, so I left it at that but it did make me wonder. Anyways it still was pleasant talking and I was really enjoying it, and she seemed to still really enjoy talking to me.

Anyways, up to this points our dates had been relatively infrequent, every 3 weeks or so. I asked, also partially due to the crankiness, whether she would like to meet up more frequently. After an hour or two however, I got a text back saying she did not see the relationship going further than friendship. So, I thought, right, she friend-zoned me, good excuse, time to move on.

However, as it turned out, she did want to be actual friends. About a week or two after that text, she met up with me with a bunch of friends of mine and it was really good. We had fun, my friends liked her, she liked my friends. It was a fun day, and I was at peace with just being friends.

However, my friends were quick to point out the next day that whilst I still seemed to show some interest, she also was still showing interest through her body language and how she interacted with me and was still fairly huggy. Two weeks later, she came over again, with one of those friends, and I realised she was indeed very physically close with me and touchy-feely, and at the end of the night (albeit quite drunk) she gave me a peck on the lips before leaving. The next day I had to visit her for something else, and I spoke to her about it because she kept being fairly physically comfortable with me. Now, we were both again fairly drunk so it was not an in-depth conversation or anything, but she reiterated wanting to be friends and that she is not in a place right now where she feels like she can date because she values her alone time and feels like career-wise there isn't a place for dating again.

A few days ago she came over again to chill with just me this time, and I noticed that again, she was very huggy and touchy-feely, and, before getting too inebriated, I decided to initiate the conversation again in-depth. She again reiterated not really feeling a chemistry from her side between us, but that she did really wanna invest in our friendship.

Now, that might seem fairly evident by then, but I noticed that after that talk she got even more physically comfortable and at the end of the night, as she was leaving home and we said our goodbyes, she opened herself up for a kiss again, but I ended up just giving her one on the cheek. The last week or so, the text conversations have remained very positive and happy between each other.

So on the one hand I have a person, who I both like a lot as a person and romantically, say she does not feel a romantic interest in me. But at the same time, I get these signals from her, that my friends also pick up on and recognise and point out to me, that she still wants a bit more than a regular friendship entails (particularly of the opposite sex). This cognitive dissonance, in a way, is really starting to mess me up as if it were actual heartache, and it's affecting me physically and mentally. I really like this person, and would really want to invest in a good friendship with her, but the way she continues to behave really leaves me in a confused state. My friends have all these differing theories on the situation, but all seem a bit 'too' out there.
