My fish photo is a joke about the pics of guys holding up their fish. Several women have told me how annoying it is.


I had previously had the headshot of myself in the green hoodie as the main pic, but idk if I'm making a weird smile or not. Maybe I'm overanalyzing.


I don't have my friends or daughter blurred on the apps, but I'm doing it here for obvious reasons. I'm a great dad and she's very happy in those pics. She's a big part of my life and I don't want to hide it.


Any suggestions are appreciated. Thanks
