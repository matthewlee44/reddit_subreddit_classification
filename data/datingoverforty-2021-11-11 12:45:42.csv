Her birthday is this weekend, I still will not be the 1st to break silence since she asked for the break.

A few conversations have gotten flirty but stay respectful &amp; reserved and we havn‚Äôt been been physical. 
A few weeks ago he shared with me the reason he hadn‚Äôt tried to kiss me yet was that although he could see himself in a relationship with me, he wasn‚Äôt ready for a relationship, wanted to focus on kids and so he‚Äôs just kept it at a friends level.
A week later, we went out to dinner, afterward sitting on my couch he started to cuddle with me &amp; ended up kissing me. It didn‚Äôt lead to heavy making out, more cuddling &amp; occasional kiss and eventually left so I could go to bed.
I want to spend more time together. I‚Äôm fine taking it slow but don‚Äôt want to get too physical if he‚Äôs not ready to date.

Recently, I asked my gf of 3 months on her thoughts about marriage and if she was ever close to marriage with her past relationships. Immediately her whole body language shifted to defense then attack mode. 

To give you a bit of background, I am late to the dating and relationship game and most times I'm just flying blind. To help myself out, I read relationship books mainly from Gottman. Anyway, the books all said to ask about your partner's past so you can have a better idea what the future may look like. 

Anyway off I went with the question and then she chumped my head off. Why the fuck are you asking me about this and why do you want to know about it. I wasn't expecting her to become an attack dog. Later on through her angry responses she said that she went through several bad relationships and men cheated on her. Later on she said she hates drama and claims that I don't know what I want in my life. All the time I was thinking I asked you one question about your past.

Anyway long story short, a week later we were having  dinner. I refer back to the previous conversation. She said I had lied to her that I was happy with my life and I had brought baggage to the relationship and wanted her to solve my problems. There were other things and I addressed every one of them. She apologized for making wrong assumptions about me.

The thing is I get the sense that she got really hurt by her previous relationships and my problem is if I say anything that reminds her of something from her past and she is going to react badly.

I have a strong interest, and a really strong chemistry with a M48 that I knew through my work for quite a long time. We are both divorced, but his life is chaotic at the moment with an older teenager, and a stressful work life (which I understand as we are in the same business), as well as ailing parents who need a lot of assistance. We have a flirty friendship, but we live in different places and a relationship isn‚Äôt feasible for all those reasons. We have never dated or explored ‚Äúfun‚Äù benefits, although we had talked about it in the past and ended up not following through for the above mentioned reasons on his part.

I was on tinder for a couple weeks a few months back but I wasn‚Äôt really ready to consider a relationship and I had a couple casual encounters. Overall I felt the tinder experience was a bit overwhelming and I hate the idea of wasting someone‚Äôs time or accidentally leading someone on. 

My question is, knowing that I have this unrequited ‚Äúcrush‚Äù at the moment, is it disingenuous for me to be on an online dating site? My two thoughts are that are on the one hand, I may meet someone I connect with more than the guy I mentioned, who is available to explore more with me.

He then invited me to dinner for the first date. We were both nervous and neither of us had dated in about three years or so but toward the end of the evening things started flowing a little and we even hugged and he kissed me on the cheek.

Fast forward to this weekend and he invited me to cook out at his house. We ended up talking for a very long time and I started feeling very attracted to him and I sensed it was mutual. But then saying goodbye by my car it was like we were both paralyzed. I gave him a huge hug and then suddenly felt so shy and mortifyingly told him I felt shy and he said he did too but he was trying to kiss me. So we exchanged a few pretty nice kisses and then o felt tongue toes even firth so said goodbye and got into my car.

Here‚Äôs the thing, I‚Äôm nervous that he might have interpreted my shyness as not liking him or pushing him away. I did text him o enjoyed the evening when I got home and he agreed. We had previously said that we would get together next weekend and I even left a couple of items in his fridge (he suggested) assuming that will happen. We had also discussed not really using texting a lot to catch up but to use phone calls.

Ideally, you should be around my age or older than me, say 35 to 60, and in the US and Europe.

I love her and have no intention of leaving. I never stopped loving her even after the first time we had to say goodbye.

So my question for you kind strangers is how you have coped with knowing you could end up heartbroken, but doing it anyway.

My bf of just over a year changed his mind about spending the weekend with me on a Saturday morning, then ignored me the whole weekend, then the next day and the next including not answering my call.. until finally he answered one of my messages asking to talk and agreed.  So after five days of ghosting me, he rang, broke it off, then said let's talk in a week.  Never called. Wow.  Is it normal for adults to treat each other like they're nothing?  The 'how' was worse than the 'what' in this case, in that I felt mainly relief about the end of the relationship, but jeez what a cold way to treat me.  Ouch.

99,qv7wmq,1637069714,When your love interest is in a failing relationship?,"I recently left a job where I worked with someone i was fascinated in.  I was never inappropriate but after leaving I discovered I have a crush on her.  We are both early 40s, I have a teenager, she has a 2 year old.  Over the course of the last 3 years, we became pretty close, shared a lot of intimate details, etc. She is always super interested in me, asks a ton of questions, etc.  We have both talked about our dating lives.  I‚Äôm free right now, but she is living with someone she‚Äôs engaged to.  They‚Äôve been engaged for like 8 years and she won‚Äôt marry him because they don‚Äôt see eye to eye financially (she‚Äôs the breadwinner and responsible one).  She never wears her engagement ring. 

To be honest, I know it‚Äôs shitty, but I want to express my interest in her.  I think we would get along great and we have had a ton of chemistry that maintained itself over the course of 40 hour work weeks.  Her situation was what it is prior to her even meeting me, and life is too short.  

I understand what I‚Äôm suggesting though goes against moral codes.  Is this something i really just need to stay away from?",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/qv7wmq/when_your_love_interest_is_in_a_failing/
