I(M23) found out that my girlfriend(F21) has a second facebook account for over a month now at least from the public posts she has and i can see, she uploads constantly, unlike her main account where she hasnt post a photo in like 5 months, it's almost like if it was her new main profile. She's hiding her friend list but judging by the reactions on her posts/photos where its only girls, I assume its only girls on her friend list, I also noticed that she has no family members reacting and i think that not even her best friend. (In the account that I thinks its the main, her family and her best friend are almost always there)

Maybe she just want to be able to post freely without nobody jugding her and nobody knowing about it, but it makes me a bit curious, should i ask her about it? and if so, how?, or should it just pretend like i never notice it.

I'm on the dilema because if maybe she just want to be herself without somebody judging her i'll feel bad for disturbing that ""happy place"" of hers and also she'll think that I dont trust her or that I dont respect her privacy (which right know may be a little true because I been looking even on the reactions and stuff). I have also consider that maybe its not her and someone is using her photos but i doubt it, it really seems to be her.

Maybe I'm overreacting and it's not even important, but im just curious on why? Maybe it's something that girls are doing and i dont know about lol

Lately, we've been talking more about sex. We talk about a large range of things, but it's been more towards sex recently. We talked about maybe having sex in October if we were both comfortable since we are virgins. We've talked about sex pretty explicitly. What we like, what we don't like. I've seen his penis. He's seen my boobs.

I'm moving my entire life 12 hours away and starting a new job in the next two weeks. I'm moving in with my family. I have two anxiety disorders. My car broke down. I don't really have a lot of funds. I'm packing up my whole life in one week essentially. I thought it would be a good idea to see him in September over labor day since it was on the way home.

This would be our third time meeting in person, but we talk all the time over the phone about 6 hours everyday.

He started booking the hotel for labor day weekend. It was a really nice hotel with a hot tub and he said, ""we can get nude in the hotel room.""

I told him I wasn't comfortable with that and wanted to keep my swim bottoms on since he hadn't seen my vagina and there was no going back after that. I didn't comfortable quite yet because I didn't want to have sex in September.

He completely shut down. He started started crying, saying I was playing with his emotions, etc. I tried asking him if he felt disappointed or rejected. He didn't say yes, but later in another call explained that's what he felt.

I apologized and said that I was ok with kissing and making out, but wasn't sure about going further since we had only met twice in person. We hadn't even had a French kiss yet. Only one peck on the cheek. I told him that, though we had talked about sex, I thought about it and wanted to make sure I was comfortable physically with him before agreeing to try anything because I didn't want to feel obligated and because I didn't want him to shut down because he felt rejected or disappointed when his expectations weren't met.

I told him that not wanting to go further was because of my anxiety and life events. I'm moving, starting a new job, living with family after living by myself for four years, have OCD in the middle of a pandemic, my car broke down, etc. I'm having a lot of stress inducing things in my life and that I would be ok with kissing, making out in September because I thought adding a sexual relationship without being in relationship would cause me a lot of emotional stress. He said that maybe we shouldn't meet and that how did he know I was not going to do this again in October?

He said that I was causing him emotional whiplash after agreeing to try to have sex and changing my mind after thinking about it. I told him that I wanted to make sure I was comfortable with him in person (we had only met twice) and that I'm a virgin (he is too). I also told him that I wanted to make sure we weren't moving too fast and that I didn't want to be a checklist of action items to check off. That's kind of what I felt like. I told him that and he agreed. He know told me that I caused him a lot of emotional whiplash and he needs to think about us.

TLDR; talked about sleeping with a guy I've been casually talking to for 8 months in October. Wanted to visit him in September. He assumed we were going to have sex/do other things. I told him I'm only ok with kissing/making/boob stuff.

Both left the state (separately) shortly after graduation, and all three of us got married and had kids, and have been living our separate lives. Fast forward almost 20 years. My female friend, whom I will call Ruby, is still happily married and out of state, and the guy (Jason) and I are both long divorced. Jason recently moved back to our hometown, and when we met to catch up, we clicked, and have started dating. We recently took a daytrip together, and we posted some pictures. Most could have been ""platonic friend"" pictures, except a candid he posted of me with heart and fire emojis. Immediately, mutual friends of Ruby's and mine started private messaging me about how terrible I am for dating my best friend's ex. I should mention that Ruby was my bestie throughout childhood, but we fizzled after graduation, and our only contact for the last decade has been the occasional FB comment. Truthfully, I have never viewed Jason as ""her ex"" being that he is my childhood friend that I knew separately from her, and their relationship was short and relatively insignificant, even for high school. They weren't each other's first love, first kiss, first time, or anything. So they aren't linked in my mind and her feelings really weren't on my radar when I started seeing him. But these mutual friends insist she's upset, and I should have asked her permission to date him, or at least given her a heads up so she wasn't ""blindsided"". She hasn't brought this up to me at all. Jason discovered that she unfriended him on FB, but he has no idea when it happened, so who knows if it was before or after this. With how ancient their history is, was it really advisable to ask Ruby's blessing? Should I reach out to her now and apologize? I don't know if I even trust these friends who say she's mad, and I think if I approach her when she really doesn't care, it will look like I'm trying to create drama where there isn't any.

I've been in school for 2 years finishing a post bacc program and I have 1 more year to go to finish my last 3 pre-requisite classes. I'm taking the GRE in December and have been studying for it since June. I'll be applying to grad schools (Physician Assistant Programs) beginning in April 2022.

My GPA is solid, I'd have to really drop the ball in order to tank it below a 3.6 in my post bacc. I'm very much positive that I'll get into a program for the 2023 cycle which would put me done with grad school in 2025. 

I've now been single since the end of February / beginning of March. I'll be 37 in a few weeks. I don't have kids but I do want to start a family eventually. By my estimation the most responsible way to approach starting a family would be to put it off until I finish grad school (taking that with a grain of salt because birth control can potentially fail). That being said I'll be 41, pushing in on 42 when I get out of grad school. My preference would be to date a woman closer to my own age, however that could lead to complications with starting a family. I fully get that biological clocks are powerful when they kick in. My fear is that I won't be able to provide for a family adequately until I'm done with grad school. I'm no stranger to finances being a central source of strain on a relationship.

All of this is to ask, is it worth dating? Being single is incredibly lonely but my free time can be very much limited by my need to work and the obligations of classes which. And, if it is worth dating, am I too old to be approaching women in their mid to late 20s? Obviously I'd be 100% upfront and transparent about all of this with any woman I'd potentially talk with. Part of me is thinking that with the way people are more career minded and prone to putting off starting a family these days that it would be best to meet someone who would be in  her early 30's when I'm projecting to be in a career stable period of my life with markedly increased income earning potential.

I'm not looking for a fling or fwb, rather a potential wife with the expectation that a wedding would happen some time soon after I finish grad school.

This would be our third time meeting in person, but we talk all the time over the phone about 6 hours everyday.

He started booking the hotel for labor day weekend. It was a really nice hotel with a hot tub and he said, ""we can get nude in the hotel room.""

I told him I wasn't comfortable with that and wanted to keep my swim bottoms on since he hadn't seen my vagina and there was no going back after that. I didn't comfortable quite yet because I didn't want to have sex in September.

He completely shut down. He started started crying, saying I was playing with his emotions, etc. I tried asking him if he felt disappointed or rejected. He didn't say yes, but later in another call explained that's what he felt.

I apologized and said that I was ok with kissing and making out, but wasn't sure about going further since we had only met twice in person. We hadn't even had a French kiss yet. Only one peck on the cheek. I told him that, though we had talked about sex, I thought about it and wanted to make sure I was comfortable physically with him before agreeing to try anything because I didn't want to feel obligated and because I didn't want him to shut down because he felt rejected or disappointed when his expectations weren't met.

I told him that not wanting to go further was because of my anxiety and life events. I'm moving, starting a new job, living with family after living by myself for four years, have OCD in the middle of a pandemic, my car broke down, etc. I'm having a lot of stress inducing things in my life and that I would be ok with kissing, making out in September because I thought adding a sexual relationship and doing sexual activities which I had never done before without being in relationship would cause me a lot of emotional stress. He said that maybe we shouldn't meet and that how did he know I was not going to do this again in October?

He said that I was causing him emotional whiplash after agreeing to try to have sex and changing my mind after thinking about it. I told him that I wanted to make sure I was comfortable with him in person (we had only met twice) and that I'm a virgin (he is too). I also told him that I wanted to make sure we weren't moving too fast and that I didn't want to be a checklist of action items to check off. That's kind of what I felt like. I told him that and he agreed. He know told me that I caused him a lot of emotional whiplash and he needs to think about us.

TLDR; talked about sleeping with a guy I've been casually talking to for 8 months in October. Wanted to visit him in September whilst moving my entire life and changing jobs. He assumed we were going to have sex/do other things. I told him I'm only ok with kissing/making out/boob stuff.

First 3 times were quick and casual (drinks, walk around the park, and a museum), but the 4th time was dinner, an interactive museum, and drinks and what I thought was going to be just dinner (she's busy applying to grad school) and at most 2 hours turned into almost 8 hours with me driving her home at almost 2 in the morning. She invited me up and I went with her but I left shortly afterwards because I was pretty tired. Looking back I probably should've grabbed her hand when walking around the museum or something. She kept giving me hints like punching me gently when I say something stupid but I've been out of the dating game for so long I only see these things way after they happen HAHA FML.

the most recent one she invited me over to drink with her 2 close friends and she told me to stay the night because we were all drunk. She offered the couch or her bed so naturally I chose the bed (yes, because I could sleep next to her but also I have chronic back pain lmao). No funny business happened because we were both drunk and I don't like making the first intimate connection with a new person under the influence, and maybe she was just being nice and thoughtful.

However, during the night (when we were drinking, not in bed) she told me she's just been out of a relationship a month (or 2?) ago and I'm kinda scared because that's fairly recent  (I'm looking for a relationship).

I really like her and next time I definitely want to ask her what she's looking for when she made a tinder, but I just dont know how to approach it. I'm super anxious af in general and awkward, but I think(?) she likes me? But if she says that she's just looking around for now or just casual then I'm scared that the disappointment would show on my face and in my tone of voice.

For me it proved that cold approaching girls was better and easier and it made me feel alive. But at the same time it can stress the hell out of you and it could make you hate cold approaching. it was because 80 percent it doesn't really work and 20 percent it works. thats why so many guys end up giving up because they cant handle the rejection and sometimes girls can be really nasty to you especially in the night when you go to night clubs or in bars so you have to put up with it.  and when cold approach works it does make you feel so happy. especially when you are going on dates and you're getting laid. Obviously getting laid was never important for me but it became one of the benefits.  for me getting into a relationship is the most important. either through friends or through a romantic relationship.

online dating just doesn't work for the average guy. every girl says im cute and attractive but nothing has been done about it. As a guy i don't believe in looks. you can be the most attractive guy on tinder and not get a single girl on a date. i didnt even get matches in a month and when i did get matches not even a single response. very disappointing especially for the average guy.  So i have no choice to go out and cold approach again. im going back this Saturday. yes!! im gonna be that creepy guy approaching girls at the mall or in the city. society hates me for it  they always try to make me look bad but i really dont care. im on my own journey.

 the reason why i stopped cold approaching this year is because i took a boot camp in April of this year. im not going to say which coach but he definitely changed the way i view life especially with girls. he  told me to get hobbies and to work on my self instead of just going to work everyday and not do nothing afterwards. When i was in the bootcamp it was incredible how i was getting laid every week with girls. Most guys in the world cant even get a single girl in bed in most of their lifetime. its sad. I chose the right coach for cold approach it was incredible. but after the bootcamp my job was to get my life back together. work more hours, i joined golf, badminton, and salsa which are things that i love so much. I got so busy that i didnt have any time to hang out with my friends. I hanged out with my friends but like once a week which was not bad.  I completely left cold approach for a while. i was already burned out from all the years that i cold approached.  so i felt comfortable and decided to live the normal life.

(for any of you who doesnt know what cold approach is. it just mean we approach girls in the streets, could be in malls, parks, cities, universities, bars, night clubs anywhere it doesnt matter. )

I was living a normal average life so i got really bored. there is really no excitement to it.  sure i was doing all these hobbies but it gets boring after a while. also im becoming more shy. less social. Now that im even more busier i even joined school again. Im having a hard time talking to people in general. its so sad. Now because of this im am gonna go back and talk to humans again in the street. im going to live that abnormal life that no normal human being will ever experience in their lifetime. 

 I remember the most beautiful feeling of just talking to girls and getting rejected, it was beautiful. ( I bet the girls who rejected me went home and called their friends to tell a story about a creepy guy who approached them, funny). It feel like shivers are running through my spine i would get chills. but even better when the girls would agree to go on a quick coffee date and talk for a while.  it made me feel alive. of course i was never one of the lucky men. Who just has it easy in getting any girls they want through social media or through there social circle. Im not a lucky guy with girls. I have no choice but to go out and start all over again but with better communication skills. i have evolved and i keep getting better and better each year. I know this works because of the results ive gotten from it. i just need to keep cold approaching and to keep getting better at communicating with females. 

What do i have to lose? its either die and never ask a girl out jack off every day watch porn and just stay locked up in my house and maybe die of a heart attack cuz i ate to many cheetos and pizza and got fat or die and have no regrets. Whats my choice ? as i observed my life it looks like cold approach is the most funnest and most rewarding thing i could ever have. its a path i will continue doing.

 I don't care if girls or guys sees it as creepy. Asking girls if they like justin bieber or if they would date him is not a crime. its just a question. Than you create a conversation. many guys think that its wrong and that its going to get them in trouble for even saying hi. 

Well yeah !! if your sexually harassing them or youre physically hurting them than yeah of course youre going to get in trouble and its something no guy should never do. Also catcalling is so wrong. i dont know why dudes do it but they just have the wrong intentions. those men ruined it for the rest of us because now women think that any men who tries to talk to them are bad. 

Anyways that used to be my limiting beliefs but after taking so much action. most girls in the day are friendly. Some want to talk to you or some just dont have any interest. IF they reject you than i just move on. theirs millions of girls in this world. We will never run out. Not every day a girls gets approached in the street with good intentions. i was getting complimented by them by how bold i am. they even thanked me for it.  Im going back and i will start again. i will get coached by one more coach this saturday and i will begin my journey again. of course i will never drop my hobbies i will continue to do them and work and cold approach at the same time. you can all  say a bunch of negative things about me i dont care. but yeah feel free to comment below.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,975087,public,self,Im gonna go back and talk to girls in the streets.

I sat and thought about all of the women I know personally over the years that I was heavily attracted to, and interested in and either got flat out rejected numerous times, or friendzoned. So far I've counted 58. And that includes recent women I've tried shooting my shot at.

Sometimes I get frustrated with myself liking and being interested in a woman, all of those 58 women I've watched them end up with someone else, one in particular that I care about heavily ened up not only friendzoning me, she went after one of my old supervisors, and now they're married with twins on the way.

It's been great and I'm definitely going to treasure the time together.  I've learned a lot about myself. I'm insecure, possessive and more socially anxious than I care to show.  When I met Tim, I was in a bad place trying to get over a cheating/lying ex of 7 years and spending time with Tim really brought me out of that funk. While I believe and think that I should be the one making myself happy, nothing really beats intimacy with a nice guy. Over time however, I found myself getting more attached and it really messed with the dynamic. I met with Tim not expecting to catch feelings and knowing he wasn't looking for anything serious, only to get caught up being enamored and forgetting how Tim felt. I hated how overwhelmed I would get when he would message me out of the blue, or when he would go days without talking to me.

I've been doing my best to manage it by myself and not give off the vibe that I need a lot out of fear of rejection or thinking I'm crazy desperate. I've learned that I'm pretty shit at that, because the more I try to spare others my emotional state the more I swell with anxiety, fear, and fantasy. It's lead to some pretty awkward exchanges, and I feel like a huge burden for having so many feelings. Both Tim and I have recently gotten out of an on/off LTR, but we approach dating differently. While I prefer one on one and exclusivity, Tim prefers casual dating and wants to explore a poly type situation. I get attached quickly because I get caught up in the good time, whereas Tim can stay pretty grounded and independent. 

I recently asked if we could see each other exclusively and have more intimacy and contact together, and Tim shot that down saying that wasn't what he was looking for. Even though he enjoys spending time with me (or did, cause I've made it a little weird since the first few dates), he didn't want to jump into a relationship or any sort of commitment, even the monogamous casual dating kind (I'm not ready for a relationship or commitment either, I don't want to call someone my boyfriend, but I also don't want to share the guy I'm having great sex with). He also let me know that he was going to start looking for others to play with, and I appreciated the honesty. It's been tough accepting that, and I've been trying to sort myself out and where my boundaries lie. Recently I've accepted that I can't enjoy the dynamic the way I want to, and told myself that I'd rather see Tim on his terms than lose him. Spending time with him is pretty valuable to me, so much so that I'd still be up for it even if I'm not the only one sharing his companionship. I wanted Tim to experience life the way he wanted to even if it would make me feel uncomfortable or hurt.

My life is a little complicated. I do travel work in healthcare, and while I love being able to pack up and go wherever, its pretty lonely especially during the public health crisis and especially since I'm a homebody. I have been out of work and living with family for a while by choice, and was interested in picking up a contract close to the guy I'm seeing so that I could spend more time with him and have the opportunity to get to know him better. Its the primary reason why I asked if we could keep things one on one during the second month. Truth be told I really hate that I wanted to do that (and almost did as I was offered a job close by) because I felt like I had weak character and was simping over someone I had only known for less than 3 months.

Today I sent Tim a text letting him know I was feeling pretty vulnerable and wanted to talk to him so I could hopefully sort myself out and feel better. I was done trying to wrestle my feelings by myself, and just wanted to sit down with him and hash it out and be happy that I did something instead of bottling it up. I feel bad doing it because from what I gather he seems to be a rock for a lot of folks, and I don't want to be like his ex who still reaches out to him trying to work it out. I was going through it because I downloaded the dating apps again, and saw that he updated his profile which really upset me and sparked my reaching out to him.

I've deleted the apps, and I know that for now (with the exception of Tim, who I just don't wanna cut myself off from until I'm on an airplane) I'm not at all ready for dating. When I get my new travel job somewhere on the west coast soon, I'm going to do whatever I can to make myself happy. Spoil myself rotten with self care routines and femboy clothes. Work on my confidence going out dressed as a femboy and perfecting that look. Build a better mind/body connection by working out, rollerblading, doing yoga, and picking up pole dancing. Build my interests more and feel like I have something to contribute other than sex, personality, and a career.

I have yet to hear from Tim, but after typing all this out I feel a little bit better.

    To describe the most recent incident, I went to another city for vacation and met another guy who quite honestly, might be the highest quality guy I ever went on a date with/hooked up with.

We went on a date the following night then we had some AMAZING sex at his hotel (he was at that city for a summer as well).

It just sucks that I will likely not live in the same city as him so we could never date. I think about him more than I should and it just makes me miserable bc I just wonder if he‚Äôs hooking up or dating other girls (which he is totally allowed to IMO). I don‚Äôt obsessively check his social media like I use to when I was younger, but I still pay extra attention to it.

My best friend recently got out of a relationship of like 2 years. During those 2 years we hardly talked cause I didn't want to intrude on her relationship. I have always thought she was a very beautiful but nothing more than that until now. We have been working out together at the same gym for a few weeks now, we see each other almost every day. I really like her personality! we are always joking around and flirting. I dont know what to do ! My feelings for her are growing everyday! I am just so confused! I am not the typical guy she usually goes for tho. whenever I tell her I am gonna out with friends she sometimes acts like she is jealous and if I dont go the gym she seems to be bothered and wants me to go. The other Day we were doing squats and she admitted that she looks at my butt and I said I look at hers too, I know its nothing significant but we do flirt and I feel like a sexual tension between us. 

She tells me that she is horny and I say I am too but its like she does this thing where she tells me about other guys that are trying to hook up with her. She asks me if she should smash them or not, kinda like she is trying to get me jealous but idk she might just want my opinion idk. To be fair I do the same thing to her to make her jealous. Sometimes it seems like she cares and other time it seems like she is not bothered by it at all when I talk about other girls which confuses me even more ? ? ? ? The thing is that she is a very flirty girl she flirts with other guys too, so I dont know if she likes me or she is just being flirty. I don't know what to do anymore we have been friends for like 7 years we have been through thick and thin together SHE HAS ALWAYS BEEN THEIR FOR ME . I am just getting to that point where I feel like I should just tell her  about my feelings and just see how she reacts. The problem with this is that her break up is only like 2 months old and it seems like she is still not over it. I am scared that I will tell her how I feel and that she will not feel the same way which would probably end up making our relationship very awkward and end up ruining our friendship which I don't want!

I (31 F) have been sending my son to him for private lessons for almost 4 years now, and honestly I‚Äôve always had a small crush on him but was always too scared to do anything about it 

Lately, I‚Äôve decided to be a little more brave and show more interest to see if he bites. I had noticed he seemed to give my son more attention in his lessons than others I‚Äôd observed while waiting for my sons turn. Again I still thought maybe I was reading into it due to him being a super attractive guy taking up time with my son. 

I started out by starting a movie marathon of a series that he likes, that my son also showed interest in. I would text him what movie we were on, and he‚Äôd text all the way up to 10:30-11:00 about movies. He bought my son a tee shirt from the movie series for his birthday that I later realized matched one that he owns and wears regularly. 
I continued to text him little things here and there, mainly about movies or what my son‚Äôs coaches were telling him at practices so it could tie over...and he would always answer, but looking back, I realized he would never text first. 

This went on for a month or two and I finally decided to be spicy and take the plunge. One night I told him we were having a movie night and that if he wanted to come provide expert commentary, he was more than welcome. Really thought I was being super cute...but he didn‚Äôt respond. 
 
I decided maybe I was just reading into things and that if he wanted to come, he would. Lessons continued as normal, and I didn‚Äôt text. Neither did he. 

2 weeks of no texts later we‚Äôre in a lesson and I notice he‚Äôs taking a long time to vent. Venting about his work stresses, his family, his frustrations with this coed softball team he‚Äôd just joined. Little things that he‚Äôd never opened up about. I knew what some of his interests were, his family stuff and a few other little things. But he‚Äôd never opened up like that. So I listened and took it in.  
At this week‚Äôs lesson (today), he notices that I have a walking boot on my foot (work related injury) and asks how it happened. He continues the lesson and doesn‚Äôt seem too into talking about much. He walks us out to the front door (which is new) and holds it open for me before saying that he really wants me to go home and put my foot up and take care of myself. He also recommends a Disney plus show to binge that‚Äôs related to the series we‚Äôve been watching. 

I‚Äôm home, watching the series, and I think why not break my weeks of text silence. We text back and forth for 2 hours about movies and which ones he prefers and which ones I like. And which one he‚Äôs excited to see in theater and which one I should definitely take my son to see when it opens. 

Am I reading too much into it? This is a lot to read, I‚Äôm aware. It‚Äôs just like it constantly keeps developing. I can‚Äôt decide if I‚Äôm just a single mom that likes seeing a man be there for my son, if he‚Äôs a super shy guy that might actually have an interest, or if he‚Äôs just being polite/professional and I‚Äôm reading into it. Or maybe he‚Äôs just playing games because he‚Äôs bored and likes the attention. I literally can‚Äôt tell and I‚Äôm starting to feel like a stalker for thinking this hard about it.

Fair enough. I've heard this before, but it's never fazed me until now.

I've recently been going through mild depression. Every day, even every hour of the day, is unpredictable. Sometimes I am completely fine. Othertimes, I lose my appetite, I feel numb, and I'm sure I am less fun to be around.

I had a first date with a woman I met online. I was feeling reasonably OK. The date was average, maybe a little above average. I thought we had potential.

Our second date coincided with a low point in my depression. We went to a restaurant and I couldn't bring myself to eat. I felt compelled to explain to my date my predicament, assuring her that it wasn't Covid (I'm vaccinated + tested negative just a few days earlier). I ordered an appetizer and nibbled on it. Throughout our meal, I sensed she was very worried.

We went for a walk after the dinner. No longer embarrassed/nauseated by the idea of food, I felt I presented more of my usual self. I sensed her worry abated, and by the end of the night, we were tentatively planning a third date. I told her we could work out the details over text.

A couple of days later, she texted me asking if a specific weekend day/time would work for our third date. I replied, I would love to, but I'd best get some rest and the weekend to myself. How about the next weekend, I asked?

She said she had another obligation next weekend, ""so let's take a raincheck?""

Fast forward to today, and that raincheck will never be cashed. I can't say I am terribly surprised, as I knew the 3rd date she agreed to earlier was unenthusiastic. Given the state of my health, I know if I'd gone on that 3rd date, it would have been a disaster and there would've been no 4th date.

What I am struggling to grapple with is the idea that my health interfered with all this.
