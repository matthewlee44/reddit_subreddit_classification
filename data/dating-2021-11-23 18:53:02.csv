0,r0s5s1,1637715298,19M I have absolutely no idea how to go about dating.,Hello I'm 19 years old almost 20 and I have never been in a relationship and when I say that I mean like never kissed never hugged and never held hands with a girl. I have no idea how to get into a relationship or how to even treat a girl. I'm afraid because I see all these posts girls dumping their boyfriends because they were too nice. I feel weird because I'm so sad but I really want a girlfriend so I can just love her and cuddle her all the time. I've only ever told two girls how I truly felt and both of them rejected me. I also would really not like to be taken advantage of. Feel like I would have no idea if I was being manipulated or not. I fear that I wouldn't even care if I'm being manipulated as long as I finally had somebody to love me back.,dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r0s5s1/19m_i_have_absolutely_no_idea_how_to_go_about/

We had a great night last Wednesday and I texted her the next day saying “I had tons of fun with you last night. “ didn’t hear from her. The next day I texted her asking if she wants to hang for a little bit Before she had to work and I had to leave town for a whole week for family. and she said she was hanging with family before her shift.

5,r0scf6,1637715820,All I want for christmas is ... a girlfriend.,"I am in my mid-20s and still an unkissed virgin. I have been trying to find a girlfriend for a good two years. But I hardly get any likes on platforms like Tinder and Bumble. Most of my dates end with ""the evening with you was nice, but the spark is not there"". I'm at a loss by now. All I want for christmas is ... a girlfriend. 

I can't think of anything else that I could do. I have optimized my photos and even paid for Tinder Premium. Neither has brought much improvement. I don't know what I'm doing wrong with the meetings. I've tried asking the women for feedback, but have never gotten a useful and honest answer. 

Things are no better in real life. My circle of friends and my job in the tech industry are dominated by men. So I signed up for bouldering. But most of the women are already taken. 

I don't understand why I have such a hard time finding a partner. 

I'm certainly not a handsome man, I had to learn that the hard way on Tinder. I've tried chadfishing. Suddenly I had more than enough matches and the women wouldn't have been averse to a first date at their house. While I always have to keep the chat alive with questions and come up with a creative date idea. 

On the other hand, I am not ugly, I would rate myself as mediocre. In any case, not worse than all the men who stroll happily with their girlfriend over the Christmas market. In addition, I am interested in many things, according to my degree  not completely stupid and earn quite well. But all that doesn't seem to be enough for women nowadays. No woman has shown interest in me yet. Although my standards are not high. I don't want a model, just an intelligent and slightly nerdy woman who feels like going to the theater with me, cooking and watching Netflix.

Do you have any more ideas to make my dream come true? Or is anyone in the same situation?

I honestly thought I would be completely over him by now! It’s been years and I see him all the time but UGH I find him JUST as attractive as I did the first time around.

Everytime all my friends and I go out I wanna hook up with him (we have drunkenly made out once in the past) and if I see him talking or flirting other girls I get so jealous. Even though I don’t act it, internally I want him to act that way only to me and I want him to myself.

9,r0skdv,1637716473,Update: should I ask her out? (15m),"You may have seen my OG post, although its now delated.

For those who hadn't seen it, ill just write a quick summary.

The girl I wanted to ask out is my brothers girlfriends sister in july. We didnt really interact until around a month ago. We spent the weekend at there house sense my parents went out for the weekend, we all ended up going to a amusement park,and we ended up splitting up and i thought we had a good time. Then last week we all went to the boardwalk at the beach (4 of us plus another couple) and We spent like 3.5 hours together, shopping and playing minigolf. I had a good time and I thought she did too. I was advised to ask my brother about it

Now onto the update:

I told my brother about it and he said no. When I asked why he said that wouldn't work out. Thats all he said, and that was the end of the duscussion.

So yeah thats not gonna happen.

I kinda understand where he would be coming from but idk what I can do from if I’m even able to do anything 

TL;DR My brother said no to asking her out.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r0skdv/update_should_i_ask_her_out_15m/

13,r0t2o5,1637718018,Is this normal behaviour for someone in his 50s?,"My friend is an older lady, she’s been like a second mother to me for over 5 years now. 

She recently opened up about her relationship she’s in. She’s 49 and dating a man who is 51. He’s wealthy and has his own business and has a good social standing. 

This last weekend she got a call from him to pick him up at his friends office. Police were there when she pulled up saying that he was left alone with the key to the friend’s office. His friend hooked him up with a girl who’s 15 years younger than him, apparantly something happened and she ended up calling the cops on him.. no details were given. 

At the office, they typically “party” there with weed and a lot of drinking. They do it every weekend and my lady friend is never invited, but she’s met his best friend and people who are closer to him, like family. 

He doesn’t have a good relationship at all with his son. His son avoids him.

So I’ve been on a few dating apps for maybe 4 months now, at least consistently. It’s done a number on me mentally because I’ve had probably 4 matches in that time, 1 was a past fling that went nowhere and only 1 of the other 3 even responded. Some of this I attest to the fact that I’m just not great looking, about average at best. But I feel there’s also something to be said about my account not being a great representation of me. Like most guys, I don’t really have or take pictures of myself. I currently have 3 that are usable for OLD, but still I don’t think I look all that great in them.
I’d like to take more and hope that if I represent myself decently, I’ll actually have some success, but since I never take pictures I don’t even really know how. Anything I try to take just ends up looking awkward as fuck, I’m struggling with staging pictures. And nobody else is really out here taking pictures of me either.

So I guess my question is simply, how do you take good pictures of yourself? I always have the angles right, and I don’t get lighting, and like I said sitting to stage a picture just feels so awkward and it never turns out good. And i don’t really know when to take a picture, or like what else to have in it if that makes sense. I don’t want 10 pics of me in different outfits around my house, y’know, there has to be some variety in there but I’m clueless on how to set up a quality picture in general.

We’re at this weird stage where we go on multiple dates and hang out a lot but there is no title. I do not have much experience dating and have never had a boyfriend so my perception is definitely skewed and i’m not sure if this is normal. 

While i don’t think i’m ready for a relationship and don’t know if i want one with him yet as he will be leaving for work next year, i do like him a lot and can’t shake the thought that he might not like me the same or just wants me for sex. i’ve mentioned that i do not feel comfortable having sex with him yet as we are not in a committed relationship and he has been understanding of this. He mentions how much he likes spending time with me but part of me is also hurt that he does not see the possibility of a relationship with me. Is this normal? Do any of you take awhile to enter a relationship or are you pretty decisive early on. I realize a lot of this indecisiveness is also on my end but if I felt that he wanted a relationship i might be more open. I guess a lot of my own indecisiveness is due to insecurity and inexperience.

Mainly because I was an ass. The past 3 years I’ve spent working on myself 100%, not one date, not one romantic/sexual conversation, no pursuing anyone.  Now I’m established in my career, I have my own apartment, two cars, a cat, and 3 years of therapy (still in it too) helped me become a much better person. 

The only flaw here, well maybe not only, but the biggest is I gained weight because of a medical problem when I was 24. I started losing weight when I was 25 and I still have about another 40lb - 50lb left. 

I want to start dating and stop putting my life on hold but I feel like the weight is going to overshadow all the good. So do I just say whatever and start dating again?

He was really into his friend Jane, but she turned him down (kindly) when he asked her out. Their friendship cooled but they have mutual friends so bump into each other now and then

John in recent months decided to lose some weight, cut his hair, dress better. He looks great. He was average before, 9.5/10 now. If i were straight i would.

Anyway, apparently he bumped into Jane recently and since then she's been reaching out to see him again. I told him great, you were so into this girl before and now you have a chance! Dream come true! He says no, she wouldn't date him before so she doesn't really like him, she's just shallow and into him now for his looks.

I told him he's being stupid, attraction matters and she just wasn't attracted to you before. He says what if he gains weight, gets wrinkles, etc.? He would always worry she would leave him

I'm a bit flummoxed. I think he's being hard on her and unrealistic, but am having a hard time explaining why. Am I wrong?

38,r0v01t,1637723858,I dated my best friend,"Hello! Sorry for my english and grammar, I'm not quite good at it. I just wanted to ask on what to do if I ever encounter a situation like this again. I confessed to my best friend a few months back, we we're best friends before we dated so I thought dating her would be a blast. The first few days are just your typical lovey dovey scenario, just getting to know each other and all of that stuff. 

Then she had a problem with her family making our relationship sour. I tried my best to cheer her up and be there for her like I did back when we we're best friends but it didn't work. Things go sour between us, we cooled off just a bit but after a week we got back together again. 

Things we're back as it used to be but I felt like something's not right. She won't talk to me that much anymore, she's busy playing games. I thought that this is her way of coping so I supported her and gave her space because I thought she would need time for herself and only she can solve her problems and that I was only there to be by her side and support her. 

One day I was playing resident evil village when she texted me that she wanted to be best friends again, that she wanted for us to break up. I talked to her that it's just probably a heat of the moment type of thing that we can maybe get through this together but she insisted that she didn't want me to be hurt anymore. At the end I go with her decision and we broke up. 

It's been a few months now, I'm starting to feel better. But I'm still stuck at the thought that what if I could've done better, what if I was more capable, what if I didn't confessed that I have feelings with my best friend, what if I just suppressed these feelings and eventually forget it. I miss the closeness we had back then

We didn't go back as being best friends just like she said. We're just strangers now. It's fine by me at least I know that she's kinda happy now, she found new friends, a new way to cope and all of that stuff.

39,r0v35r,1637724128,Help! I don’t really know how to go for the kiss,"
I (24 M) have been going out with some women for the last two or three months, and it’s been awesome.
But the idea of going for the kiss actually scares me a little, not because I haven’t done it before (I’ve kissed a lot of women, and I’ve had a very sexual period in my college years) but this is the first time on my life that I’m only going out with women I really find attractive both physically and mentally, normally I played it safe and just went for whoever gave me attention regardless of me reciprocating, after a lot of therapy I decided not to do this because it’s not fair for all of these women, I won’t be able to fully reciprocate their feelings towards me, and it’s not fair for me because I’m not respecting my self worth, and I ended up feeling empty and broken after this.
Normally what worked for me was verbally asking if I could kiss her, but I don’t feel that goes with the proactive, risk taking man I want to be.
Even if this gives me the chills I really want to do it.
Confidence it’s not actually the problem because I see myself as a good looking, smart, good hearted successful man, I take care of my health and image and I’m proud of my achievements.
So, my question here is how do I go for the kiss while also being respectful and prioritizing consent, but also not asking for it verbally, and how do I know if the moment is right?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r0v35r/help_i_dont_really_know_how_to_go_for_the_kiss/
40,r0v816,1637724537,I am terrified about getting back into dating.,"Heres the thing, I had one serious relationship in high school. And the rest of my relationships since then haven't lasted long. Truth was I thought I was in love with the girl I dated in high school, and like an idiot I was hoping she woudl eventually come back....and I waited four years for her to come back. 

When I finally got over that, I tried dating again, but it was really hard to find someone I was compatible with who I could connect to on the same level. So i took a break from dating.

Well now I'm 26 and I just moved into my own place, and I want to start dating again, but the truth is I'm scared.

It was easier for me to get into a relationship before in high school and college simply because you could meet people easily through class or extracurriculars. 

However here in the real world, I'm constantly scared of coming off as a creep if I start a conversation with anyone. So I just don't. It doesn't help I'm constantly being pressured into blind dates, which you think would help, but it honestly makes me more anxious.

I really don't know how to meet people in real life without coming off as weird.

THING IS, he has gotten romantically involved (?) with me, like he sends me cute texts and on this last date he held my hand and hugged me. It felt nice but I wasn't that excited as I thought I was when I first started talking to him and right now I don't feel the same way as him.

I like him but not enough for a relationship but at the same time I'm thinking of giving it a shot but I also don't want to because I enjoy going out without the commitment but I ask myself if I should give this guy a chance but I also want to keep myself sane(?) DOES THAT MAKE SENSE?

45,r0vskt,1637726269,Asking my lab partner out,"I tried asking my lab partner out casually for lunch or coffee a couple of months ago through text, and she never responded to me. So I didn't say anything and tried to continue as nothing had happened. 

It was a bit awkward after that. I didn't say much and was a bit short. She seemed a bit flustered too. After another week passed, things eased, and we started to speak/text again. It was strictly business, only to talk about the lab report. When she talked to me about the reports, though, she constantly thanked me and used my name. I think it's cute how she uses my name so often; I try to use hers often as well. Also, she will send me smilely faces with her messages too. I have only seen her once without a mask, and she did smile at me then too. 

Once, when I asked her a question not wholly related to the lab, she quickly messaged me, “that now is not a good time. Ask me another time, for sure.”

This is her first semester in a Ph.D. program. She has mentioned that she is very busy and that her schedule is crazy. She typically would tell me this when she couldn't get enough work done for the lab reports or work last minute. I had to pick up the slack a few times for her, which bothered me a bit, but I bit the bullet. I did mention to her that my schedule is also busy. However, generally, she has done great work, and we will both end up with a good grade. She carried us a few times, and I did too. 

I can be pretty intense when it comes to doing laboratory. I'm not afraid to be critical of other people's work. I was critical of my lab partner's work, and I can tell it occasionally rubbed her the wrong way. She would still accept my criticisms, and I would take hers. When things looked good, we would complement each other too.

I typically over-communicate. I have sent her many messages about the lab. She sent me a lot less. Sometimes I think she is just putting up with me and being kind 🙃. My confidence has not been high lately, and I’m sure she has noticed that in my interactions with her.

My time with my lab partner is coming to a close, and I find myself wondering

Should I try asking her again? I feel like she has sent me signals all semester long.

46,r0vvza,1637726549,Bruh. This guy rocked my world.,"For context, I’m a young college girl who loves intellectual competition. 

Tonight I met a guy that was just a straight up dick but thought he was like funny doing it. Anyway. He kept bashing on me for whatever reason and was really getting under my skin. But I kept being nice to him and teasing him back in non insulting ways (which is a skill in its own right let’s be honest). What really turned me onto him was how stubborn he was. He was so fucking stubborn. So steadfast in his ways. And that’s so hot to me because I haven’t managed to hang onto many beliefs long term and am constantly redefining life as the open minded person I am. 

So I kept being nice to him. And I asked him about himself and his life and his family. And he answered every question I asked. 
And he stopped being a dick. And I melted his little arrogant stubbornness and got him to open up about why he was so angry. I got him to laugh. And man did he have a beautiful smile. 

Then everyone was making jokes about us and how we were “gonna go make out” or “lovebirds.” And that’s how you kind of know it’s not just in your head right? When other people notice and call it out? Idk

Towards the end of the night he was just a ball of mush. He told me about how he got rejected from the schools he wanted to go to and was really lonely at this school. He really softened up and even apologized for being so rude at first. 

But it’s probably not going to work out with this kid. It never does for me. I mean I told this kid I was sort of seeing someone which is an exaggeration at best but not an outright lie. I don’t know why I said that but it was probably because I’m insecure and was scared if he thought even for a second that I liked him that he would reject me immediately.

Date 1: Drinks at a bar/restaurant about 30 mins from mine, but somewhere closer to where he lives (I’m not sure of his exact address, but I know he works at Harvard and lives nearby). He invites me back to his place at the end of the date, and I politely decline. We hug and he goes in for a kiss and I coyly suggest that he offer a second date and that we’ll see how it goes from there. He texts that night asking what I’m doing the next day, again inviting me for drinks. 

Date 2: Drinks at a bar/restaurant about 30 mins from mine, but again somewhere closer to where he lives and only a couple miles from the last place. We meet earlier (5:30ish instead of 7:30ish), and I’m expecting drinks will lead to dinner. He orders water and I get a drink, declares he’s “good” for food, but that I can get some if I want to. I say that I’m not ordering if he’s not, and he says that he “feels bad now.” We move past it and have another evening of amazing banter…only for him to again invite me back to his place. I laid out my boundaries gently (dating with intention - not marriage, but not hookups either), and I suggested going for a walk. He said it was too cold out. We chatted for a bit more, then I asked if he wanted to brave the cold with me. We walked to my car, shared a hug and a warm, soft, but brief kiss. No pursuit for a third date yet.

52,r0wjsg,1637728635,Am I just not ready?,"Hello guys!

It’s currently 5am the day after a first date and I can’t seem to stop thinking about this one thing.

Little context, I’m 19M kissless virgin but have no problem getting dates or attracting girls, the issue starts with the type of girls I get attracted to. They usually end of being really distant and have bad communication, always have some kind of family/mental health problem. I’m a very logical thinking guy so when I see this I know I shouldn’t be pursuing further but I still end up having feelings afterwards. Last girl I was actually interested in told me she ends up hurting people so we decided to be friends since this is what we started as. 

Went on a date yesterday, she’s great but not my type and at the end I knew she wanted me to kiss her but I couldn’t, even though she’s attractive and I could at least get some experience I still didn’t have the urge. 

I really hope it’s just me not having met the right person yet because if it’s just the classic “I want what I can’t have” scenario, then oh boy am I gonna have a rough time. I’m getting really tired of this. Finding a girl I like, turns out she’s bad… it’s pretty demotivating.

So now my question to you is, should I be working on my self more before trying to find a relationship? There must be some reason why I am always attracted to these types girls.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r0wjsg/am_i_just_not_ready/
53,r0wjup,1637728640,Dating when shy and during an pandemic,"I (19 F) have been trying to OLD for about 2 years now and have been unsuccessful. Meeting people IRL is hard after being in online school. 

I have decided to delete all my dating apps. Because nothing positive comes out of it for me. I only used them when I felt lonely. 

So now I’m slowly attempting to meet people IRL, I’m going to a community collage at the moment, my first semester classes didn’t really have any possibilities. Hopefully next semester will. People seem to just keep to them selves. As do I, but it makes it 10X harder to start a conversation.

Plus I’m more mature for me age (I know I probably still sound like a child to some of you, but I have always gotten long with people older then me) so the people in my classes don’t really have the motivation and values as I have. Finding someone’s who’s older in typically freshman level classes is going to be difficult.

On me being shy, normally I become bold, outgoing and funny once I get know someone. But I have some deep routed insecurities. Most of my life I have had a speech impediment, I spent 12 of my 19 years working through it. I have “graduated” from speech therapy, and I have clear speech (according to the people I tell) I’m trained to here even the smallest mess up in my pronunciation of a word, I also stutter when I’m nervous, which is a lot when taking to new people. So I tend to keep quite and not strike up conversations. So lots of missed possibilities 

One more thing is that I have a medical condition where a benign tumor has ate away part of my jaw 
So I have an asymmetrical face, it’s not horrible, but it’s noticeable enough for me to be called a “squash” (Iv learned to laugh at it , it’s a stupid joke though)
Despite that I still think I’m decently attractive.

Wearing masks have been away for time to hide and feel more confident. But I feel ashamed when people look at me or of I get a “checking you out “ I feel like they would be disappointed if I were to take off my mask .

Overall, all that has made me hand my head down, and avoid eye contact, so I’m hesitant when entering the dating world.

So any advice on getting the courage to  attempting to strike up a conversation irl, and trying to seem like a person who wants to be approached",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r0wjup/dating_when_shy_and_during_an_pandemic/

Someone who is authentic, able to communicate, and just be a mature human being. And it’s so hard to find that. Every girl I know just loves to go out, have options and gain validation from multiple guys, etc. And the girls who aren’t are already in a relationship. It’s so hard. I’m a pretty mature, well put together guy. I have a good career coming out of college, take care of myself and work out, and I’m pretty personable and kind. But it seems that isn’t what’s “attractive” for girls my age - they want the guy who is disruptive and chaotic - or in their eyes, “exciting”. And honestly, I don’t have the time to entertain that.

65,r0xj7r,1637731965,What does it mean when my fwb says he wants to take a break,"So he said, quote, “I had a good time with you but I think I need to take a break”……”I could see myself dating you”……”I’m just too depressed rn that I can’t fully enjoy it”……to which I fully understand and have no issues with, I was ready to say goodbye 

But then he said “…just give me 2 months”, “check in in a few months” when I left, later texted me saying “let’s keep in touch and see where we are at in a couple months”…which got me really confused cuz I thought we were over and I was ready to let it go. Then he said 2 months? Like this specific?? What does this even mean??? What does he want?? 

A little bit of contexts: 

* We met in August and has been maintaining the fwb situation for over 3 months (met up for 7 times in total, so not that often) 
* We started things in a fwb way but it eventually became more like a situationship in the latter months 
* I made it clear in the beginning that I don’t want relationship. We get along pretty well on bed but I don’t want to go further
* We once had a casual convo about things that are considered bf/gf stuff and he said “taking cute pics together” and “introducing to my friends”, which he initiated doing in the last month. I was confused at the moment but it all happened naturally so I didn’t communicate my thoughts (maybe I should have) 
* I don’t like pure hookups so we usually do a lot activities like hiking, dinner and movie when we meet up. Sometimes I spent the night(3/7)
* He said he thinks a situationship shouldn’t last longer than 3 months, which I’m fine with 
* I’m 25F and he’s 26, doing his PhD rn

Ps: If you are person I’m talking about, please pretend you never saw this lol, or you could leave a comment answering my questions using an undercover account 👀

We had a deep conversation when he brought this up(in person), he seemed genuine and I think I can understand and relate to what he said. But I’m usually the gullible type so just wanted to see how other people see it

On the surface, it seems like nothing's wrong with me. Physically, I'm 6'1"", 196 lbs @ around 12% body fat, I work a remote job where I make 70k plus/year, I am well spoken, I play musical instruments, I read, I enjoy hiking/working out, so many different things. But I've never seen the sexual side of a woman.

It's a combo of different things that added up over the years, like dominos falling: trauma from childhood divorce, no real guidance from an older man on how to romantically talk to women, going to an all boys high school, having low self-esteem in adolescence/young adult years/college, all sorts of stuff. Either way, it's just an experience I've missed out on. I just can't relate to most of my peers and I'm well aware of that fact. Most of my friends are married/engaged/in long-term relationships and I'm just...here.

I also know at this age, women will be looking for something somewhat serious and will be surprised/shocked/maybe even disgusted at someone who doesn't know how to get down in bed. My sexual history (or lack thereof) isn't something I'm necessarily proud of, I've never explicitly told anyone (not even my good buds) and it hurts that I've missed out on so much.

I missed out on that period of 20s experimentation where it was ""kinda, sorta ok"" to be inexperienced and just figuring things out. But I'm going to be 30 soon and I'm running out of time. I know I need to take massive action, but just getting past the first step is hard. I know I need to develop confidence, get over fear of rejection, and other things that make me masculine.

75,r0yfah,1637735139,Boyfriend told me he needs space," Im 24 F and my boyfriend is 26 M. We have been dating for 6 months. We recently got into an argument, and afterwards he told me he doesn't want to see or talk to me for a few days. I asked him if its about the fight we just had and he said he doesn't need to give me an explanation. He said its personal and he's dealing with a lot and that he's been meaning to tell me this, but I find that hard to believe since he said that right after we had a fight. He also said that me asking him why he needs space is making this about me and not taking his feelings into consideration, but I think that's unfair when its affecting me too.

I called him last night after he told me that, but it was pretty much a dead end conversation. I asked him if he still doesn't want to speak to me and he said we can talk tomorrow (which is today) but its the evening and I haven't heard from him.

I feel like guys tend to retreat to themselves and require more space in relationships, and its frustrating because I am the type of person who likes to communicate and deal with the conflict. Its driving me nuts knowing what he's thinking. I want to respect his request to give him space, but I also can't help but think he's leaving me in the dark.

77,r0yimv,1637735471,Jealously monster,"Good evening world. I got a weird problem. My girls is literally the woman of my dreams. She has her faults i am sure if I just haven’t found them yet. The only problem that bothers me is 2 things. One her friendship with this guy who she always jokes and says she related to. She told me something about how he’s not quite 100% with it (privacy) but I’ve been around him enough that he just seems like a guy that instead of being at a normal 5 all the time he is always at 7 or an 8 in terms of energy. He is not related to her in anyway as much as I wish he was. 

The problem I have with him is he is so engaged when talking to her and the way she talks back to him. I don’t see her talk back to any other guy like she does with him. I don’t have any doubt when she told me she views him as a cousin, but he just says things and does small things that I would never do with the girl best friend that I just stopped talking to (for good) because we both finally got into a real relationship. 

But of course my girlfriend won’t take my hint or see it my way in that I don’t think having close one-on-one friendships with the opposite sex if you are in a serious relationship with someone is wise or beneficial unless their gay or you ARE related to them. Because it can makes people jealous whether they admit it or not. 

What would you do if you were me? She has already said she has never hung out with him one on one alone before, BUT that on more than one occasion grown up adults like in their 50’s (she’s 23, I am 26, her friend is 24/25) have asked and were like what is going on with Jessica and Kevin or has said are they together? (names changed for privacy). And she was shocked, but I see it and I know other have because she admitted they thought that. 


I HATE being like this, but it bothers me. Because yesterday she dragged me to another group date and he came and two times he in his flirty teasing way of talking to her said she should come over to his house and watch a football game. (I don’t know the details of whether or not he lives alone or with his brother and sister who she is also friends with or whatever) she said she is busy hunting (she told me like 2 days before she’s never hung out with him alone before) with her dad then he teased her about not knowing anything about hunting.

Then I was like lol I’m the one that knows nothing about hunting if anyone. Because I don’t. 

My point is with my ex-best friend because of circumstance I would NEVER invite her to do something at my house (alone or not) and I ESPECIALLY wouldn’t do it in front of her boyfriend. Like I wished I hadn’t heard it. Because I knew it would drive me crazy. And it has. Any time I know he’s coming to something I’m always inwardly pissed. All her other guy friends are normal and treat her in a non-flirty way. 

I don’t know what to do because I have already warned her that in my past relationships I would get jealous a lot. And it’s a red flag I know. 

The other thing that bothers me is her brother. He is like 13. And he constantly feels the need to climb on her and sit and basically just hug her when she is sitting right next to me. Her parents are always like hey so-so get off her or etc. but she doesn’t mind. So I’m like well I can’t say anything about this ever either.

I just remember having a 15 through 20 year old sister and I never would hug her or be overly affection like that and (or the chance I was wrong and did) if I did I definitely didn’t do it in front of her boyfriend because that’s just FREAKING weird. Like maybe I have a bad problem but I don’t know what to do or say about either of these problems. The problem with her friend bothers me more because he’s grown and is not related to her. And he has said in front of me to her

“I love you best friend” 
“Wanna come over to my house and watch the game”
And he just teases her in a way that I would never with my past friend. Who I can promise you I had a better relationship with than she does with him. Like I know I did. We were friends constantly since 2013. We would always talk about who we liked alot among normal things but I kept it platonic because i would always bring up some guy she may have liked at the time. And I know I never told her I loved her and tried teasing her in a flirty way like he’s done in front of me. 

He never asks her about me. Which a NORMAL platonic friend would do! I mean like come on. It’s EASY. I don’t need or want any of his attention but in like the 10+ hours I’ve been around him he’s not one time asked her about me or tried to tease me in any way about her or asked me about her or her about me. Not once. Her other friend (who I like) it was the first thing he said to me. And he’s done it more than once which I adore. He’s normal.

To use her words “I am much closer to Guy than his brother.” She is also close fiends with his sister as well but she has told me that the guys sister gets mad because the guy will listen to my girlfriend for advice over his sister. Hearing that didn’t not make me feel better at all.

She has no freaking idea how much it pisses me off. And I know that sounds super controlling. I’m sorry okay! 

Please give me advice on what to do especially with her friend. I’m sure her brother will one day grow up and not need his 23 year old sister to TUCK HIM INTO BED. And constantly feel the need to sit her on lap and semi hug cuddle her in front of her boyfriend.

82,r0zarl,1637738311,Am I overthinking?,"Ok, apologies up front for the long story. I am an American (23M) living in Central Asia. I speak the local language, went to a good university and people tell me I am really good-looking. Still, we all have our doubts...I have a large crooked nose and am skinny and I think about this a lot. Anyways, my friend and I were out at a bar and I was introduced to a girl there that he likes (26F). I thought she was super cool and beautiful (turns out she is a somewhat famous dancer) but I wanted to be respectful and give my friend space. My friend and I and this girl bounced around a couple bars and stayed out till 6:00 AM together. The whole time, I was trying to give him space, but she (albeit inebriated) grabbed my hand once or twice and I felt a connection. The next day I asked my friend to tell me how things work out with the girl because I'd be interested in asking her out at some point. To my surprise, he told me to go for it, even though he clearly told me before that he had a thing for her, long before I had ever met her. 

I was elated and a few days later I asked her to get coffee one evening. We met for coffee and towards the end of our time, she suggested going for drinks. At the bar we sat close to one another, we shared a few beers, cigarettes and put our hands on each others' arms, hands, shoulders at natural points in the conversation. We went to two more bars, and at the last one, we danced a little bit (no grinding or anything) and had great conversation before the bar started closing down around 5:00 AM or so. We sort of beat around the bush figuring out what to do next, I mentioned getting a taxi home (not clear if I meant my place or to our own homes). She said she had to go to the bathroom, when she came back she suggested we get food, on her (I had been paying for all the drinks and taxis up to that point). We walked to get food, and she put her arm through my arm, it was an amazing feeling...that closeness and trust with her. We got ramen and drank tea at a busy all night Korean diner, and then around 6:00 AM she got a taxi for us and it dropped her off at her place then went and dropped me off at my place. 

We have a second date tonight at a restaurant and I just don't know what to think. My gut tells me there is something here, but I have been on probably 50 first dates in the last few years and and not that many second and third dates (90% of the time it is me to end things) and I have never been in a relationship. I don't think I have a typical personality, and I think the age difference is a big deal to her.  I like this girl more than I have liked the vast majority of women I have gone on dates with so far, and really want things to work but I am afraid that she may not really like me. I am not always the best at reading the signs. Any advice or support you can give would be great.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r0zarl/am_i_overthinking/

He promised me that he would never hurt me. Until that one night in 2018, He said that he cheated on me when he was drunk. He broke up with me but I begged him back the very next day. Since then, I've been acting like I don't care that he cheated. But I do care and it really bothers me. 

The other day I brought it up to him about his unfaithfulness 3 years ago and he said that he was thinking of me while having sex with her. At this point I don't know what to say or do. I just froze and sweat. The only time him and I have a genuine conversation is when we are sexting. Any other time, he is playing video games with his friends. I've been thinking about breaking up with him but I don't know how. 

6 months ago he was suppose to pick me up to move in with him. We are in a LDR btw. He doesn't have a education or a job. His room is nasty and when he sends me pictures of himself, in the background you could see the dirty carpet with crumbs/stains. He has bottles under his bed. He doesn't clean his fingernails and when he sends me sexy pics, it looks like he is wearing the same underwear. 

Idk if this is normal or not, he is my first long relationship. I should also add that he follows many women in his area and that makes me feel uneasy. He liked one of her sexy pics on instagram. He also complements his really hot female friend on facebook. She already gets enough attention and complements, why does my boyfriend gotta complement her?

1. Extreme introverted and can't stand being around strangers for more than an hour or so before getting really, really tired
2. Let's state I'm part of a very odd group in terms of personality traits. In high school, I was considered by a clinical psychologist to have a mental age of 40 at the low end.  This causes gaps with my own age group or even those upwards of 10 years my senior. 
3. Issues with severe forms of mental illness. Let's just state the last thing someone was around me during ""certain issues"" on the low end of the scale they had a hard time with it.  It's not dangerous just emotionally draining.

We started messaging each other, with hearts and everything (like: ""Good night baby🥰"", baby because she went to sleep at like 9 PM). We are hugging, for now, not holding hands (not sure because is it because I didn't initiate it or it's because we are both really good Christians). So basically, we are going out tomorrow (I said we will go take a walk somewhere). This is my first time in this stuff, and sometimes I question my feelings, sometimes I feel so strong love, something hardly describable. Should I make a move and ask her to be my GF? The other day, I dreamed of us cuddling, and IT FELT AMAZING. I really am confused by my feelings.

I don't want to make the wrong move that would lead to hurting me or her. Needing advice asap (Before tomorrow afternoon at least). Cheers everyone!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r0zvmq/questioning_my_feelings_for_a_crush/

90,r10451,1637741379,"Great IRL and on the phone, but text game is lacking - anyone else feel the same?","I've been dropping some great opportunities lately due to this, and it's starting to bother me. I've always asked girls out relatively fast. But I often also get the impression that most women prefer to build comfort through text before meeting up. And this is the dilemma I face now. What is the best approach? Women, what do you prefer?

IRL and over the phone I get great results, but I struggle with texting, I just find small-talk boring and shallow. I would much rather learn more about her when I sit in front of her, and I can't wait to get off the phone and meet the person IRL. And I struggle with being present in text interactions, as I overthink the messages too much which makes me a rather slow responder, whereas IRL and over the phone, I'm really smooth and confident and the conversations flow naturally. For me, texting is just a tool for quick messages, not a media to build rapport on. All my successes with women on online dating have been where we met up soon after matching, and in those instances where that isn’t possible, I fail.

\- Is it the lack of sub-communication (eye contact, body language, charm) that makes texting hard?

\- Am I failing to create enough comfort/security for her through texting prior to meeting up?

\- Is it my texting ""skills"" that are lacking? Am I supposed to be some kind of entertainer on text?

I honestly don't understand where I'm dropping the ball. And it bothers me, cause I can't fix something I don't understand.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r10451/great_irl_and_on_the_phone_but_text_game_is/

I went on a date last week with a woman whom I knew within an hour is the woman of my dreams. I cannot stop thinking about her. She said she isn't looking for anything super serious. What does that mean? Should I try dating her anyway? I'm just trying to save myself some pain since I know for sure there exists no one like her.

92,r108h7,1637741836,How can you say dude get in the gym?,"Is there a way to tell a person you’re dating that they need to rev up their weight loss. This person has his own interest in wanting to lose weight and when we met was going to the gym somewhat consistently, but he’s fallen off.  Now he barely goes, is only lifting or chilling in hydromassage chairs when he goes.  How do i kindly say:  dude you need some consistent cardio, if you’re trying to lose weight, thirty minutes every two weeks isn’t gonna cut it, you still have a good fifty pounds of weight to lose.

96,r112us,1637745232,What are the signs I should give to my guy friend to make him realise that I am interested in him?,"So, there's this guy in my friend's group whom I really like. I have heard from one of our friends that it's possible that he is interested in me given he compliments me on certain occasions and also teases me more than others. I am a shy person and I really fear if things get awkward if he doesn't like me back and I confess to him. Recently, I called him to go for a smoke with me alone. We didn't call our other friends and went for one. He was being good to me. Asking me how I am and telling me to take enough rest. He also got a bit protective when a guy who has a crush on me came there and he tried to show this guy that we have something going on. We were discussing about relationship and stuffs and I asked him out of the blue if he is interested in a friend of mine and he said no and he only has one person in his mind and he said  and I quote, ""I will show my side of feelings only when the other person is willing to risk hers"". He also told me that he believes I am smart enough to choose the right guy and somehow, he was giving subtle signs that he is interested in me but very playfully. I am not sure if he feels the same way for me as I do and I also don't want to risk this friendship.

98,r11gf1,1637746787,Being courted/the passive party: Do it actively.,"Most of you, after thinking about it for a sec, will probably think: ""no shit"". Doesn't matter who you are, you should obviously play an active part in the date and be funny and charming. 

As a guy that have dated both as the leading and passive person, I've noticed that I can fall into the trap of believing that I'm more active than I really am during my dates. I think that a lot of people that usually date as the passive party, fall in this trap as well. I think it's the leading party has a vested interest in making their partner feel like they're contributing more to the enjoyment of the date than they really are, so they forcefully try to have fun without their partner - not with them. Because of them handling the logistics of enjoyment, it might take them a while before they realize that they actually aren't that into the other person - sometimes after a lot of time has passed. This can lead them to distance themselves or break it off well into what's normally considered be the ""relationship phase"". 

Something that I try to do more now, is to question if my date finds me interesting or if they're putting effort into seeing me as interesting. 

**If I weren't there, would they have as much fun as they're having when I'm around?** 

It has helped me greatly and my dates and partners have really responded positively to it.

Just a suggestion that I think a lot of people might benefit from.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r11gf1/being_courtedthe_passive_party_do_it_actively/
