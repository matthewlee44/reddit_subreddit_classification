This weekend we went out for drinks and he went to show me something on his phone. I actually saw that he still had a dating app installed. I questioned it and he said he must’ve forgotten to delete it and then showed me how when he selected the app, he actually had to enter his login details-it didn’t actually open automatically. He then apologised for any concern I had and deleted the app.

I feel uncomfortable having seen that. I haven’t had any trust issues up until this point. Do you think I’m being played?",datingoverthirty,t5_34cyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/pn17da/am_i_being_played/

65,pn1bg1,1631481327,Mutual ghosting: healthy or is there a better way?,"I’ve noticed that my relationships that don’t make it to the exclusive stage generally now end with a mutual ghosting of sorts. We both seem to conclude that it’s not working around the same time and both stop initiating contact. No one ignores any messages or calls so it’s not textbook ghosting, communication just stops on both ends so there’s nothing to respond to.

I’m a straightforward communicator so if someone wants to continue seeing me and I don’t feel the same I clearly and kindly end things. The mutually ghosting situation is obviously different so I’ve felt it doesn’t make sense to reach out and clarify things as it risks unnecessary hurt or backsliding. But it also leaves us with no closure and I have mixed feelings about it. 

In some cases I’ve gotten to know these guys well over weeks or months and we’re often in touch daily. So it’s a bit sad and jarring when contact stops. I understand it’s a reality of modern dating and OLD in particular but I’m starting to question whether this is a healthy way to end things or if there is a better approach.
