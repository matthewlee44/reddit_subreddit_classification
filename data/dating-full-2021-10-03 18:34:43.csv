I (26 M) wanted this to be a discussion and inputs from people who've got dating figured out. I know this sounds stupid but I feel dating is too complicated right now for this generation. I don't know why that is. There are so many people who feel alone and single and yet never seem to find someone easily.

Is it because we have unrealistic expectations of what a partner should have? I know I have been guilty of this where I felt unattracted towards someone because of one small factor. I have also faced this myself where an above-average conversation or date never lead to something more because they probably moved on to someone else. Dating apps suck especially for men who aren't perfect.

People always advise to work on yourself and meet people doing what you like. I don't know how that works either. I like working out and being active. I have been going to the same gym for many years (obviously not just for meeting someone), feel very happy with my health rn but don't know a single person there. Same with other activities, been on many hikes, classes in college, never made lasting contacts doing any of these. I don't know at this point how dating should really work. I guess I am just trying to understand if I am doing something blatantly wrong or this whole generation is sort of in a mess.

Any opinions or discussion is welcome!

I've NEVER had any success with online dating, mostly because I find the whole process of early dating exhausting and strange and can't make a connection. This guy though felt different from the jump and I have been interested in keeping up with dating him. We've been out maybe 5-6 times in the past three months only because we both are working a lot with opposite schedules and he and I have both been out of town a few times. I was surprised that he kept in touch with me so regularly when he was out of town. I realize in retrospect that maybe I seemed somewhat disinterested because I wasn't reaching out more thinking a month apart and my terrible schedule would mean he'd lose interest, but he didn't! 

All is pretty good - good connection, I think we're attracted to each other and the sex is good when it happens, dates go by really fast and are fun, he's so easy to talk to and I feel like I get so swept up in having someone to talk to so easily about all sorts of topics that I don't get around to being more direct about what's happening with us and only realize how I could have done that when I'm thinking about our dates the next day or something. The problem for me is **WE ALWAYS GO TO A BAR**. Always. It's getting boring. And always something in my neighborhood. I feel so socially awkward trying to flirt or get us back to bed when we always have this chunk of table in between us in a noisy place. He pretty much always suggests the same place, which is just a few blocks from my house. That led to him coming home with me twice - once because he walked me home and once because I invited him back on an innocuous pretense and it worked. But every other time we've hung out, he hasn't tried to invite me to his place and I'm so socially inept and clueless that I can't seem to figure out how to ask him to come home with me consistently, especially because we usually have to hang on nights when I'm not working but he's working early the next day.  

I don't normally have this issue, but mostly because when I start seeing someone romantically/sexually I've already known them and so we're already hanging out in some way that isn't something like Tinder dating over and over again. And I'm actually a really direct person, but feel kinda lost in this one. I feel nervous he's going to lose interest because we're not able to make this feel like more of a friendship (which I'm fine with, I just want to know if that's what's going on) or because he thinks I'm disinterested (I'm very interested - he's hot AF and cool) or because he finds someone who's easier to date/sleep with/flirt. He's been texting less (maybe just busy, but I dunno) but responds readily to my messages still. I've invited him hiking or to just come over to watch a movie and it's never happened. It's always just going to a bar! I don't know how to put us into a position where I feel better able to make a move and feel more comfortable then having a talk about what we want with each other. I don't want this to end just because the two of us are too awkward to do anything about it.

We agreed to grab dinner this weekend and he picked me up. He was polite on the car ride to the restaurant, but things took a turn before we even got our food. He was just sorta sitting there staring at me awkwardly, not saying anything. I say “so what do you like to do for fun?” He literally says “eating, drinking beer, watching tv.” Just bad from the start. 

As the conversation continued he began to get argumentative. For example, he said he has been watching this cooking show and they recently grilled possum and raccoons. I said “ew, how gross” because well, we are sitting having dinner. And he goes on a tangent about how some people live in poverty and only have access to roadkill to eat. I said “well I just think of them as dirty, I get why they would need to eat them but on a cooking show it’s kinda gross.” He goes on about how there’s a whole culture and blah blah blah. I just nodded my head and listened to him drone on but when he finished he just sat and glared at me.

Ugh he was a jerk. He argued with me about like 3 other stupid things until I said “I’m ready to go home now” we had finished our dinner so, I was ready. He said “leave if you want to then.” I got up, went to the bar and paid for what I ordered and left. I didn’t want him thinking he bought me food and then I ditched him, so I paid for the shitty dinner. 

I’m still mad I even went. He was so smug and totally thought he was correct in every situation, like there is no talking to someone like that. He was like talking to a brick wall, never even listened to what I had to say. He just wanted to make a counterpoint no matter what I was talking about lol well idk why I feel bad, I guess because he was just super rude to me the whole date and I haven’t been treated like that in awhile by a man.

I sat down and started to eat when a girl, who was talking to a friend of mine, came over and tried to feed me my food (weird…. I know. She was drunk). 

I pulled away and went somewhere else. Once I finished, I went to clean the dishes when she came into the kitchen and started caressing me and trying to make out. In the back of my mind I knew she was with a friend of mine and that I genuinely wasn’t even interested. A bunch of people saw what happened and for some strange reason it became the talk of the night… I have no clue why…

First of all, I'm noticeably overweight. I know what you're gonna say and yes, don't worry, it's a serious WIP.

No one I know, including me, takes good pictures (or any pictures, for that matter) so I had to resort to using the best selfies in my capacity, but honestly I don't look good in any of them and trust me, I tried.

It appears to me than to stand a chance in finding FWBs, I have to look great on my profile. Of course, I meant it when I said that just finding friends is fine and I won't push further if I don't have a chance, but people won't magically start to swipe right if I say that on my profile either.

We had been friends for over 4 years and met at the gym, we had a lot of mutual interests and shared the same outlook on where we wanted to be in life as far as marriage, family and children etc…

He is from another country and has different religious views that made things tricky sometimes, things that at first didn’t bother him about me grew to be the things he hates the most. I recognised the pattern and attempted to leave a few times but he would always try to draw me back in with the promise of potential.

He &amp; his family are incredibly wealthy, something that I admit initially made me even more excited about our future because I did not come from money. I am finally in a place where I have all the things I’ve ever wanted and everything I have for myself now has come from me working, really, really hard. He promised to double it and would go on about how much more I could have which began to warp my perception of what I was already fortunate enough to have.

I was promised whichever house I wanted, my dream car and a literal crown from the MIL should I give her a grandchild (specifically a son). After one particularly bad fight which went on for hours of him berating me to the point I secretly voice recorded his words for my own safety, I decided this was the final straw. We ended, not amicably and didn’t speak for a few months.

Fast forward to now, he called me a few days ago to say he was going to be dropping something off and that he wanted to talk. I felt like enough time had subsided that we could do so without tension. I was still in contact with his Mother up until this morning.

We spoke, he told me he thinks we could do it and succeed in a good long relationship if we work hard and recognise our flaws. He showed some introspection about things he did wrong and why he feels he acted the way he did. He began talking about all the things we could have if we just made it work, he said in his heart it is only me and that he can’t focus on anything without me by his side.

I thought about it real hard and told him how I felt, honestly and without any self serving agenda. I told him realised over our separation that I was in love with the potential of what we could have rather than the present moment of what we had. He agreed and said this might’ve been what he was doing too but he loved me as a person, I admitted in all honesty that despite the fact that I truly loved him, I didn’t actually know why. 

We weren’t compatible the longer we stayed together so many things came to light that changed my perception of him and the type of person he is. Part of me was just waiting for the day that things got better and all of a sudden our relationship was easy because we had X, Y or Z.

I told him that waiting for me to be ready was denying him of finally grieving and moving on to potentially find someone who is perfect for him. He cried but agreed and said he will ask God to protect me and that he prays I will be with someone one day who can love me without making me cry. We hugged and he left, I thought I was fine until I got back inside and I just balled my eyes out, funny because I’d already accepted the relationship as being over and had no intention ever being with him again, but this time it really felt like whatever was still keeping us stuck was lifted and we both had closure to finally move forward.

I (21 Nonbinary) am in my senior year of college and have recently struck up a new friendship with a sophomore (19 Nonbinary). They’re incredibly friendly, cute, outgoing, friendly with many in my year and seemingly non-avoidant when it comes to intimacy with those they fancy. I immediately had an interest/crush on them when we first met and we had 100% been flirting (as perceived by friends as well) also lots of light touches/touching each other, eye contact and being overly friendly. 

They made a comment to our mutual friends about having “accidentally been flirting with me and not sure how to feel about such.” I let a week go by before texting them to clear the air and letting them know I have been flirting / wanting to get to know them better but was anticipating straight up rejection. At this point it seemed like that had been texting a bit less (and it didn’t seem like the REALLY wanted to follow through) but they are taking an extremely difficult class who I’ve had the professor for and have been very stressed with such and gender identity.

Their text back was interesting — they told me that they “do feel more like a friend vibe than romantic ig but honestly more like soul siblings??” Soul siblings…. and “ig” what kind of friend zoning is this?And that they’ve felt very connected to me and have wanted to get to know me more and spend more time with me?? I began putting aside any of my feelings I had bc this felt / seemed like a “not interested.”

However the next time we saw each other in person they immediately came over and asked for me to feel their hands (specifically me) / held my hand / were very touchy with me and gave me a lingering hug (all of which my friends confirmed to seem like flirtatious behavior, especially because they instigated the touching which felt weird bc I had said I liked them)

However later I saw them being a bit touchy/in close with a guy/ a friend who they were kinda swinging hands with and so maybe this is just the way they are with others? Later we ended up bumping into each other when they were with the guy from before and them seemed to be in an odd space (they had also had a bad drunk sexual encounter the night before to be fair). The guy and I ended up chatting while they stayed relatively reserved in the conversation (I wasn’t sure if they were bothered by me being there)? We all broke off from each other and said we might hang later.

I FaceTimed them later in the evening to see what they were up to and they (were shirtless lol) said “I have these two plans but maybe we can hang later later tonight” but I knew it was kinda just them saying that bc they seemed to be rushing me off the phone.

The next day I asked them to hangout / walk the dog and have been met with radio silence. Did I do something to bother them/make them uncomfortable, are they playing games (or am I?) and should I stop reading into the vibe / tension I feel / the touching and just move on. We're still getting to know each other but at this point I'm like am I driving you away?

She's a little shy. She's abstinent (which I respect). And she's been single for 6 months.

She said she liked me from the day we met in class. We kissed, cuddled, and watched netflix together.

At the end, she asked if she could come hit the gym with me next weekend (ie spend more time together). She also offered to pay for my milkshake which I declined lol.

We haven't messaged each other 2 days since then and I'm wondering if that's normal. 

I'm used to moving very fast with most girls. Usually because we have sex on the first date and then make it official very soon after.

There's a lot of sign telling me that she wants to eventually make it official but a part of me doesn't believe it.

I’ve been hanging out with this guy that I met from work. and everything seemed normal but my gut is telling me something is a little off. I’ll explain why. So at work everything was pretty chill and after a while of just conversing he eventually asked me out on a date. Normal right? But the way he texts is a little…eh. So after exchanging numbers and almost a week of texting he had already started to add “beautiful” “love” and other pet names to his texts. I thought it was kinda cute but now it just feels insincere and kinda odd since that’s not the energy I give out. This person also says things that makes me cringe as well or at the least makes me question their self awareness. There are times I may not even respond simply because I’m busy at the moment and they’ll have no problem with double texting or calling with a “you ok”. He even said one time that “I feel like you’re pushing away from me 😪.” Mind you I’m in school and I work so I’m very busy and tired, which he’s aware of. It just feels suffocating now and it’s almost like I’m being put on this pedestal and I’m just waiting for the other shoe to drop tbh. They also mention missing me even tho we could’ve just hung out the day prior. It’s too much sometimes and I don’t want to be rude or ungrateful because maybe he’s just a “hopeless romantic” or maybe this is dating life and I’m just not accustomed to it but idk. And one incident that kind of made me suspicious is when he wanted to drop off a gift he had won for me but I had already mentioned that at that time I was hanging out with my friend and it was late at night!

For a few years I was looking for someone to be in relationship with. Nothing ever worked. Never had as much as a boyfriend. Always got sad and disappointed and extremely sad when a possible something lead to nothing. It happened every time. And every time I’d ask myself “Am I lacking something or in some way..?” “Why all people around me are in relationships..?” and so on… 

As I said, I came to terms with the idea that I’ll spend my life alone. And tbh it’s not actually that bad. I can develop myself in multiple ways and live the way that is suitable to me without worrying it might not be something that would sync with my partner’s lifestyle or with the family we’d create further on.

Yes I agree, the biggest drawback will be not having a family on my own - not having a loving husband nor children… Those are the dreams I wished came true one day. But now since I understand it won’t ever happen or more like I’m just tired and want some peace of mind without giving myself any pressure about it anymore, I feel inner peace within myself after letting it go.

Maybe but only maybe some day I will come across someone that will change my mind again. But tbh - I doubt. And yeah Ik I’m still young but some things you just know.

I just say what the fuck. She looks at me crazy. So it turns out she had slightly bigger arms and bigger legs (which I thought was muscle) and the just a super fat gut that she had been hiding. It made me not want to have sex with her and I felt like I was catfished.

Now I’ll fully admit I’m not some Greek god in terms of physique(not yet at least) but I have a flat toned stomach and she made it look like she did too.

To introduce the situation, I am a mid-20s male. I currently work for a Member of Congress, am a USMC vet, have a nice apartment very little debt and a college degree. I recently got a divorce earlier this year for which the reasons I have totally owned. It was 90% my fault that it led to that. Mid-September I decided to maybe try dating again after a friend suggested I look into Facebook Dating. I decided to join and was very impressed with the types of girls I was seeing and matching with. Within the first day of joining I matched with a girl who basically was everything I was interested in. Beautiful, smart, ambitious, et cetera. What I saw in her she would go on to share she saw in me as well. Essentially, we checked all of each other’s boxes.

After a couple of days of chatting, I offered to take her on a date. It went extremely well, we ended up getting ice cream after dinner at a very renowned restaurant in our area and decided to see each other again. During this first date I confided in her that I was previously married which that did not deter her at all. The second date was 4 days later, we had a nice lunch and then spent hours at a park just talking and getting to know each other. 

The third date was 2 days later. We had dinner at a Thai restaurant, nothing fancy. I’m still relatively new to this city I live in so she offered to show me around. We ended up at her apartment and kissed and held each other for hours that night. We tried sex but not to flatter myself I was “too big” so we abandoned that plus we acknowledged that it was still early to do that. We continued to talk and kiss and embrace each other until I needed to go as I had work the next morning. She confessed to me that it was in her plans to somehow get me back to her apartment which I do not expect to happen that night. I really wanted to take this relationship slow as my previous marriage was the result of things moving too fast, but I really had come to like this girl and if she was okay with it moving this fast, then I was too. The next night I came over to her apartment again and we embraced each other and then eventually made love, I ended up spending the night and the next morning before I had to leave for work she made me breakfast as I threw my suit on and was out the door. That same day we had dinner at a spot near my place and then she ended up spending the night at my apartment, we did also have sex this night again. We had also decided together that we would be exclusively dating each other, it made me very happy. I told her more about my past struggles, especially with pornography, which led to the demise of my previous marriage, and she told me about hers as well. It just seemed at the time we were two imperfect people perfect for each other.

The morning after she spent the night at my apartment I made her breakfast and we enjoyed each other’s company. I walked her back to her car and then we briefly spoke on the phone until she had to go into work. While I was at work she texted me and asked if it was okay if we were not as physical; I told her it was absolutely okay and I did not want her to be uncomfortable. From there we had a conversation on the phone later that night and we decided that we would be less physical but we would still be exclusively dating each other, that we were boyfriend/girlfriend.

The next day communication was simply not there. She was distant and short with texts. We had spoke on the phone later that night for about 20 minutes and planned for the next day what we would do, which leads us to today.

Today we were supposed to have lunch and go to a museum. She told me she had to cancel those plans, and with how distant and uncommunicative she was, I could tell that this was going to be the end. I texted her how I felt about the situation and asked if she would call me, she did almost right away. I told her that I really liked her and that I thought we were in the beginning of something special, but that I knew that she was having second thoughts about us together, and she confided in me that she was. She stated that she thinks I’m a terrific guy who checks all of her boxes, that she appreciated me being open and honest with her, but her feelings changed for reasons she attributed to being in toxic relationships in the past. That basically the fact that I was a genuine, honest guy for some reason made her reverse her feelings. I told her that I was sorry and that it was probably best that we go our own ways, and we today split amicably. We are more or less remaining friends, but we haven’t known each other for a long time so I don’t expect really for us to be a significant part of our lives or even to even talk anymore.

I decided to reach out on here because I don’t really have people I can confide in or talk to. I know that we dove into things way too fast and that she’s not going to be wanting to revisit where we are. I have no illusions about that. I just don’t understand why she feels she can’t have a relationship with me because of the way she was treated in past relationships. It really breaks my heart. This isn’t the first girl I dated that also had issues from previous relationships, and I’ve seen it happen to friends as well. 

I know it is probably stupid to be so heartbroken after dating a girl for only two weeks, but I really dug her and after going through a very painful divorce earlier in the year, it was refreshing to meet someone that I could invest myself and my time into. I know that she could have entirely different reasons for wanting to end things as well, I am just relaying what she told me her reasoning is so please don’t beat me up on that too much. I really thought I have been doing everything right, especially in terms of being open and honest, especially about my addiction I had to pornography which is one of the most embarrassing things for me to talk about. Having my heart broken big time twice in one year has really discouraged me from wanting to date. It just really sucks that I put my heart on the line so early and it didn’t turn out. 

Tl;dr I met a girl after getting divorced earlier this year, fell in love and she changed her feelings because I wasn’t toxic like her previous boyfriends (her words essentially not mine).",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1042479,public,self,Big-time Heartbreak 😔,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q0rpf9/bigtime_heartbreak/,all_ads,6,,

The last time we had the talk was about a month ago. Dude had just gotten out of a five-year relationship, and I was uninterested in serious dating because I was starting to like my freedom as a single lady and I just need to work on mental health stuff some more. We hung out several times a week and even went on some things that resembled dates. He told me he cared about me and wanted to support me. But, due to no fault of his own, the time came when I needed support and he couldn’t offer any—because it reminded him of his previous relationship. 

I got the signal when he ignored me for three days. And that hurt, since I believed that he cared for me. Now that I have some distance, though, I understand. 

So I told him I was going to take a trip for a couple weeks and that I would catch him on the flip slide. That didn’t feel rash—it felt right. 

But on said trip, I met a guy. We hung out for about five days before things progressed to romantic territory. And when that happened, I felt guilty, since I was still thinking about the other guy.

Pretty soon I was calling her out on her stuff too. At first I thought she was an a$$ but I took her comments to heart and started being brutally honest about everything. I am a little bit goofy but a lot of it is a self-defence mechanism so I tried cutting that out.

Contrast this to a date that I just had today [F28] where she was really agreeable. I noticed her saying ""that's awesome"" and ""that's cool"" even before I finished explaining what I was taking about. She agreed with some things that I KNEW she didn't understand. It felt inauthentic and imo less attractive.

I always thought it's best to slowly introduce your real self over a few dates because your opinions/beliefs/values/preferences/idiosyncrasies can shock the other person and be a little off-putting (as in, they'd be OK with them if you showed it to them slowly over a few dates vs. just coming out strong right out of the gate), but these 2 experiences make me almost think I should just be me right from the get-go.

Just focus on yourself man. Stop chasing women… we don’t chase them over here. Learn a martial art, go back to school, work overtime (60+ hours a week), save up some money, invest in yourself… invest in a business. Invest in real estate.

If you’re not content with yourself, then start making a change now. If you’re a fat fucker, monitor your diet and get rid of all the sugars and fats. Get more active. If you’re ugly asf or not happy with how you look, save up to get that plastic surgery. As shallow as it may sound, just do it. 

I’m not encouraging you to be a shallow dude or a stuck up douchebag, just make changes and discipline yourself to not put them on a pedestal and get on your shit. Im sick of logging onto Reddit and reading all these posts about “what happened?… I’m devastated” or “i give up” and all this other blah blah blah worrying about women bs.

I get it. We men have testosterone and a sex drive. If you’re like me (high sex drive) stay BUSY!!! Workout, go to school. Ifff you simply can’t live without having to talk to women or wanting to meet them, download a fucking dating app, and ONLY like back the girls that like you and that you like back physically (we all know that tinder and bumble gives away potential matches with the blurry pics and names). This works for me and I’m average looking. You don’t have to be a very hot dude. This saves you a lot of time and it works for me. I don’t even swipe on women that I find attractive. Just the ones that I like back from the blurry likes.

Be honest with them. Have a good convo and then tell her what your intentions are. If it’s not really a match, move on. Don’t do anything else. Idc how hot she is, or how good the convo was, I’m not wasting my time. I’ve dated and slept with a good amount of women (for someone who doesn’t chase them) and trust me… women that truly like you WILL NOT say shit like “Idk I’ll let you know” or “let’s talk more first”.. believe me. 

Could I have slept with or dated more women if I chased and tried ? Maybe, but like I said earlier “we don’t chase em over here.” I gotta upgrade to be a better man and you should too. Watch how they will chase (hotter ones) once you upgrade just a little bit. It’s like passing a new level in a video game and unlocking a skill.

I'm still quite young, so I've only been in one relationship so far which ended... not very well. It was traumatising, put simply. It didn't even start well either; our relationship was toxic from the start but she hurt me more than it hurt us both- anyway, I won't go into details. 

But that's not the only reason I'm scared of dating. It's also very hard for me to be vulnerable in front of people - whether I'm interested in them romantically or they're just friends - to the point where I don't even know if there's anyone who truly knows me for who I am. It makes me feel alone at the same time, and it's all my fault. Someone once even confessed to me but I had to reject them because it wasn't /me/ they liked, but the façade I put on to everyone around me. It may sound edgy or whatever, but it's true. I can't let anyone in out of this fear of being hurt/rejected.

However, I have had people like me. I was quite oblivious at the time, but now it's very obvious, but that probably stems from the fact that I didn't believe it was possible that someone would even think of me that way, right? Like, why me? I'm a nobody. These thoughts also led to me being uncomfortable with being liked. If someone shows genuine interest in me I get uneasy and threatened, to some degree, and I don't know why. Why am I so afraid? 

Despite all that, I still want to try dating again. Maybe this time it will go well. Maybe if I'm in control, if I'm the one approaching, then it will go well... but that comes with the risk of my feelings being one-sided and ultimately getting rejected... which is another one of my fears.

 I don't even know where to start and how to meet people- although, I won't lie, there is one person that comes to mind, but there are so many things that could go wrong with that. We met online a few months ago, we barely talk due to both being busy with school (we watch shows and movies together regularly, though! I don't think this happens exclusively between us, though)... Buuut, we are kind of close friends I'd say, they definitely showed more vulnerability than I did (my fault, again), and I know they trust me enough to vent about their hardships to me. That's still something you can do with a friend without it being romantic, though, so I shouldn't feel special- I don't even know if I should pursue this small crush or like or whatever it is. I don't even know if I have the guts to make any moves in the first place. Do I even like them that way? Or am I just hyperfixated on them? 

Why is this so complicated... Anyway, I didn't plan on writing this much, but if anyone reads and/or replies with advice or any kind of words- thank you.

I’ve been dating my gf for 3 years now.  Like all relationships when they start we couldn’t wait to talk, message/call each other, hear from one another etc….  As time goes on I understand the honeymoon phase eventually ends.  Cool, no issues there.  However we rarely see each other for various reasons (distance being the main factor). I still look forward to her calls, texts, conversations everyday, just as much as I always have to be honest.  I don’t post much on social media anymore because honestly, I’d rather just send it to her.  I like keeping things just between us and not feeling the need to share it with the whole world.  She however is a little different. She is on it all the time, posting all the time, quotes, pics, selfies, motivational stuff etc….  She mentions people she talks to on there, groups she’s in etc etc….  Honestly it’s getting annoying.   I went a whole week without even looking at her page because I just couldn’t take the story posts.  Specifically the quotes about healthy relationships.  Which she seems to rather post about then practice. This morning I sent her some sexy pics.  We don’t send those to each other a lot so I thought I’d change things up a bit.  She loved them, but right after that, she updated her story with what she was wearing for the day captioning “good morning” to the whole world (everybody but me) and the only reason I saw it was because I checked her story.  She never even sent them to me.    

My question is, am I being stupid?  Part of me is posting this because I’m hoping I go back and read it and think I’m being an idiot. Another part feels like I’m really not being stupid and that focusing more on communication through social media can really be unhealthy in relationships, taking that time away from the real people in your life that matter.  I actually brought it up to her that I was upset, and her response was “sorry my posts make you upset”, and then sent me another pic of her in the same outfit she never sent in the first place while updating all her followers first.  I know my feelings are valid, but is this something that isn’t as big as I’m making it out to be?

She said she wanted to stay so I was like oh, okay great. We kept talking and I tried to make two subtle attempts to suggest a second date by asking her about food options in town (I just moved) and she seemingly shot them both down. No big deal, but it gave me the impression that she wasn't interested.

After the date we parted ways, hugged, and I was like yea that was a dud, but it's all good, ya live ya learn. 

I didn't text her (I should also mention that I gave her my number and after she still kept texting in the app, I thought it was a safety thing which I understand but now idk...) because I assumed we were done. This morning while I'm on another date she messages me on the app thanking me for showing her a new donut place and  mentions that she had fun. No suggestion for another date or that she'd like to see me again.

She's still messaging me on the app (though she has my number) telling me about her day. What the fuck is going on? She hasn't suggested seeing me again but keeps talking to me and I 100% thought after we hugged and parted ways she was going to unmatch me (I almost did it myself but got busy).

TLDR: Had a very okay date with a girl that has my number but won't text me. Thought we were done and she keeps messaging me without suggesting another date.

I will try and keep this short but really need some advice. I started dating this girl about a month ago but have known of each other for a little while. Our first date was amazing, ended up lasting.two days. Instantly felt super comfortable around each other, since that first date have been spending lots of time together - 2-4 times a week., texting lots, amazing chemistry and sex. But It all got a bit emotionally intense the last week or so and we both said some pretty intense things in the moment; stuff along the lines of 'I really like you' 'Haven't felt this way in ages' 'I hate sleeping without you' etc etc.

A couple nights ago she came to a party I was at. She had been acting kind of off the whole night. Not physically distant but emotionally. when we get back to hers she opened up to me about some stuff in her past and said it had been on her mind all night, I listened and hugged her. She then said she didn't want it to change how I felt and I assured her it wouldn't at all. Come the morning we are both super hungover but she's still acting weird. We spend the day in bed then later she just says randomly 'I really don't wan to rush this'. That then opens up into a convo about our situation. Where she says that she feels like everything has got a bit intense and some of the things we've both said has been too much too soon. I agree with her because I had also felt like it was a lot when we've only been dating for a month. She said she wants to keep things causal and 'reel things in' a bit. I felt kinda shot when she said that because I felt like she was pulling away. I just said I am sorry if I came across too strong and that I agree with her and feel the same. She told me it was nothing I did wrong and that she doesn't want me to worry or overthink the conversation.

 But in the same convo she said she wasn't speaking to anyone else and asked if I was, I told her no and we both agreed to just communicate with each other if anything changes. She also said she wants to spend more quality time together going forward, as a lot of our 'dates' haven't even really been dates but just hanging at her house and spending nights together.

After the convo I felt super confused and kind of shot down? Felt like I have done something wrong or have made her feel bad which I never want to do. Part of me now feels like I want to run away from it all; I guess I feel embarrassed. Since our talk yesterday we have texted a bit and she said she was feeling really good about everything and felt really happy that we spoke about it? so I guess it was weighing on her mind. I know she's had a bad relationship earlier this year and so is still dealing with that, and I don't think she's had many positive dating experiences. I just told her there is no pressure and I just want her to be happy and enjoy herself.

I just feel super confused now. Like we became exclusive but also slowing things down at the same time? Just really feel like Ive done something wrong. I feel super vulnerable now as I really like this girl and for some reason I've convinced myself this convo means she doesn't like me?!

I’m gonna go ahead and say this EVERY GIRL IS DIFFERENT AND WE ARE NOT A HIVEMIND.

I know lot of you are insecure about your penis so I’m gonna give some light on why you shouldn’t be insecure. And I’m talking about all sizes cuz I’ve met some dudes with the biggest. One of them was huge and he told me he wished he was bigger and I didn’t really understand why cuz if it was it would’ve probably went up my cervix. I think a big problem about sex is pornography and our sex education. Please don’t compare yourself to men in porn :( that’ll just make everything worse. Also don’t let the women who suck shame you get you down sex is so much more than the size of you’re penis and to the ladies who have dick shamed men SHAME ON YOU YOU ARE WHATS WRONG WITH SOCIETY.


Want to know something? Most of us can’t orgasm from PIV alone.

I’ve been with guys with small, average, and huge and wanna know what? When it comes to being with the bigger dudes they think that massive shlong is all they need to bring to the party and at the end of the day your cervix will hate you. Being huge can be a curse. I’ve seen the outline of a dudes boner and I became very VERY afraid and got the hell out of there.

Im gonna talk about the big guys first. I know you must be proud of you’re member down there and good for you if you are but you can really hurt us if you are not careful and just because you’re big doesn’t mean you’re talented in bed. Make sure you do lots of foreplay on us first so we can get as wet as possible. There are many sex positions and I think for big guys doggystyle is one of the best IF YOU ARE CAREFUL, AND USE LOTS OF LUBE. Missionary is a great position but not with my legs on you’re shoulders I’ll hold them myself. Also reverse cowgirl is good because I have more control to how much dick goes in me. Also big dicks are harder to give blowjobs it’s not always fun and if I give you a bj I expect you to reciprocate and eat me out fair is fair.

Now I’m gonna address the penises on the smaller side. When it comes to smaller guys I have a bit of weight advice for ya. You may think you have a small dick but if you’ve got some pounds on ya those lbs in the pelvic area might be hiding some extra inches and if you lose weight you might see those inches I’ve known some guys who have lost weight and I noticed that their dick was bigger than it was before. With a smaller dick try putting a pillow under her ass when you are doing missionary because you can give her that full feeling this has worked for me plenty of times and it feels great. But before you put that dick in her please please please do lots of foreplay as it makes us really want you and beg for you. Now every girl is different but I love it when my neck gets sucked, kissing all around my breasts, pinching my nipples, rubbing circles around my nipples, kissing all around my belly, rubbing softly down the side of my thighs, kissing and sucking my thighs, I love being eaten out and fingered you gotta grove the clit lots of attention. Whoever you are with ask her what feels good to the clit and listen. Communication goes a long way :) also cowgirl is a great position. EXPERIMENT EXPERIMENT EXPERIMENT.

And now for the average dudes :D
If you are average then you are literally most men. Small and large are the minority. I’m going to be honest I believe I have had the best sex with guys who are average. So please don’t be ashamed that you are average and never EVER compare yourself (this goes for small guys as well) to a massive dick remember what I said at the top. For average the scissor position is great look it up and learn how to do it. For this size doggystyle is amazing because it’s not to big and not to small and if she has a big butt spread her cheeks for more insertion or have her do it. Cowgirl and reverse cowgirl are a great positions for this size. Oh and btw if you want to do anal bigger really isn’t better for that average and smaller is better in that area.

A few last things that I forgot to mention. One of those things is called girth. A girthy penis can be nice however depending on the size just like length there can be to big and to small so just like I keep saying no one is the same. 

Also I really wanted to touch on the subject of sex toys. I’ve heard a lot of stories from my friends and friends of friends. And a lot of those stories involved boyfriends getting upset by the fact that their girlfriends want to use or are using sex toys. And I’ve had partners who didn’t like the fact that I had a dildo and a vibrator and they didn’t like that I masturbated with them. When it comes to masturbation I get off easier than with a partner and I think that goes for both genders because during masturbation you don’t have to tell anyone what to do and you are doing it yourself and you know yourself best. So here is what I’m gonna say A SEX TOY CANNOT REPLACE YOU. I have had a few guys that like that I have sex toys and during foreplay a few of them were happy to use my dildo and vibrator on me and boy oh boy it was HOT. Again a toy can’t replace human intimacy so if you’re partner male or female wants a toy please don’t let that upset you it can totally spice up the bedroom.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1042743,public,self,No guy should ever be ashamed of their penis no matter the size!

The problem is that I’ve never dated anyone, I’ve never even had my first kiss. I guess I wasn’t even really ready in the past but the biggest problem for me are my parents. More specifically my dad who doesn’t let me date (I know I’m an adult now and he doesn’t have to *let me* and blah blah blah but it’s not that easy with strict parents). He never let me date when I was younger and he made me feel really shameful this one time when I just slightly smiled at a guy and he happened to notice it. He also made me feel like girls who have sex in high school are slu*s who become pregnant and he was always really scared that I would get pregnant in high school for some reason. So my parents made me go to an all-girls high school and I now I literally have 0 guy friends. I don’t know ANY guys except from my dad and my brother. It sucks because even if I wanted to start dating, I don’t know how or where to start. I don’t even know how to act around guys.. 

Plus I feel like it’s completely unrealistic when I’m living at home because every time I leave my house, my dad is always like suspicious of me even tho all I do is hang out at the shopping mall with my friends or alone. Like every time I stay out a little late (I mean like past 7pm), he doesn’t believe me when I tell him who I was with or where I was at (even tho all my life I hang out with 2/3 of the same friends and at like 3 places). I’m pretty sure he would flip the hell out if I told him I had a date or something like that. 

Does anyone have any experiences with dating and strict parents? If yes, did your parents ever overcome this or did their attitude ever change? Share your experience please if you ever had to / have to deal with it.

Anyway, I’ll be moving to another city for university in a couple months and I’m not really planning on dating until then because I’m hoping it’ll be easier to date when I’m there.
