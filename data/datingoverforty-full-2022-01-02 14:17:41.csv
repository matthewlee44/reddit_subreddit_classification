Him with surprise: you’re not friendly are you.

Me: glaring above my mask and take out my phone

Him: pretty thing like you should be more friendly. I bet you just haven’t had a good time in a while

Me: death ray glares at him them move to the other side of the sadly empty room.

Him: how about I take you out to dinner and we get you in a better mood.

Me: glaring again I say, “no thank you please leave me alone”

Him: moves closer and says aww come on, you could use a good time

I have such a difficult time making decisions.

I've been dating this guy since the summer, and throughout the time there were a few things here and there that bothered me a bit. I let them go because he seems generous and kind. We also have a language barrier - and I feel like I'm not myself with him, especially as the relationship gets deeper, I feel I can't express myself in a way that he understands. 

The things that irk me - he has diabetes - I don't know much about it - (type 2) - and he eats candy and he eats badly (cake, danishes, muffins), and drinks diet drinks all day (like 2-3 a day). He drinks wine I'd say most evenings, sometimes a full bottle on his own. This seems very bad for type 2 diabetes...

I have mentioned it before - but he tends to joke about everything a lot. Like all the time. So a mention of his sugar levels is met with a joke. I thought at the beginning of the relationship, the sugar thing was just a problem here and there, (it was high occasionally) but it's consistently bad.

I guess what I'm saying - is it okay to let him go for this? there are a few other little things (how he parents and his jokes about other serious matters)- but I guess I've reached a point where I am no longer comfortable.

That was like 10 years ago and none were from online sites which probably made it easier to be monogamous from the get go since we met at a meetup or volunteering and started dating that way. Neither of us were actively looking or dating which is what I’m trying to say. Now that I’m using online dating I’m finding the guys I date are also dating others (which is fine) but they are sleeping with them too. So far I’ve been waiting until they aren’t with anyone else and that’s worked great because I find it very hard to be intimate with someone i don’t have an emotional connection with. So the time we spend outside the bedroom while they are sleeping with others works for both of us.

The problem came recently with a guy (45M) I’m really feeling a connection with, and though he is sleeping with one person right now, I was willing to let that go since we discussed birth control and STD protection. The problem came when I asked him to get tested with me and he said sometimes him and the other girl have sex without condoms if they don’t have any. He said it’s not often but he asked if I need him to get tested every time he sleeps with her with no protection. I told him I understand some STDs have a few month incubation period so it’s always the possibility he can test negative before something shows up so I asked him a few more questions. 

First I asked him what does he need before he can see if he wants to be exclusive with someone. I was trying to understand the timeline of how he saw things going with me and the likelihood that he would continue sleeping with her and me at the same time for much longer. Then I asked him if she was sleeping with other people too, and if they had gotten tested/shared results at anytime. I was shocked when he said I was the first woman who has ever asked him to show test results before sleeping together, and he said him and this other woman never discussed getting tested, they slept together on the very first date and it’s never come up after that. He also never asked her if she was sleeping with others. 

He ended up asking her and when she said he has been her only partner for the last month now, I asked if he wanted to be exclusive with either of us . I appreciated his honesty in saying that he wanted to explore our sexual compatibility before he made that decision but something was still making me unsettled. We tabled the conversation when I said I was having hesitations- I explained it as my body is saying yes I want to do this, my heart is saying I want to feel this connection in a new way, but my logical mind is like proceed with caution. 

The next week when we went out to dinner he handed me a print out of his test results that showed everything was negative. I was happy and I even made the joke “someone is going to get laid tonight” lol. But then he was like it was weird, because he asked her to get tested too, and her test came back positive for HPV. I just put my face in my hands because it turned out my logical mind was really my intuition. He didn’t understand why that mattered for us, and I told him that there is no testing for men for HPV unless they have physical symptoms, so he may have it and if we have a condom mishap he may give it to me. He kept saying that’s a lot of maybes, and we shouldn’t worry about that, but I told him that some types of HPV can lead to cervical cancer, so this is a big deal. I work in pharma and the medical field so I’m not speaking out my ass or being unnecessarily paranoid. 

No surprise nothing happened after dinner lol and it turned out when he brought it up with her again it turns out she knew she had HPV, but she was hoping it would have cleared away by now. She said that almost everyone has it or gets it so it’s not a big deal, and when he mentioned the cancer thing she said that it’s rare and hers isn’t cancerous. They stopped dating because though it takes two people to agree on having sex without protection, she engaged in the risky behaviors knowing she potentially had an STD still. 

Since then we also stopped dating- we ended it the night we were going to have sex lol. I had to wait until my appointment for birth control before we   could do anything, so it was like a few weeks he ended it with her. He was supposed to come over that night, I cooked a really nice dinner and we were going to watch the new matrix movie on HBO. After about 30 minutes when he hadn’t showed up, I sent him a text and he immediately called me. I knew something was up lol. A couple of days prior he got drunk at a bar and ended up going home with a girl he met. He said it was just a one night stand, but he felt so guilty about it he didn’t think he could come over. I was  like, we aren’t exclusive so you doing that is on you, but did you wear a condom? He couldn’t remember and they didn’t exchange contact information when he left in the morning.

Married for 15 years with 3 kids.  I have been recently separated (last year) and moving forward w a somewhat confusing divorce.  I probably shouldn’t have jumped to OLD but, curiosity got the best of me and honestly at first, I really didn’t even picture myself going through with an actual date!  I’m very young looking and talkative, my most accounts I think men find me attractive and maybe I was just looking for a confidence boost since it’s been soooo long!

Fast forward to meeting someone, lots of online communication, setting a meet up. Really didn’t see any red flags at first, not that I would have known anyway.  Gave my phone number per his request before we met.  Date was a little more wild than I anticipated.  I was very nervous, he was super outgoing and talked more than me (which I rarely come across), drank way way too much and should have seen the red flags.  Kissing, lots and lots of compliments on my physical appearance, invited me back to his place, etc.  I did not oblige but sort of just thought he was outgoing/silly/over the top.  Ended up hanging out again the next night, at his place (again, please go easy on me).  Texting all day, etc.  

Basically, this continued on, although we usually only get together once per week.  He has said many times he’s uncomfortable that I’m still married, which I understand but as we are coming up on 2 months, I’m started to think….this is a narcissist and how have I been so stupid!!!  We text everyday but if he expresses annoyance at my still being married and then I respond w something mature like…let’s talk and get together…it’s met with comments like “you’re getting weird on me”. We have very sarcastic banter but occasionally he will say something “you’re joking right?  Bc you sound psycho”. Even if it’s something silly like “oh you took 7 hours to reply….hmmm”. Now, if I don’t answer him in a few hours he will text w a sarcastic “I see how it is”.  He’s also referred to his ex wife and ex long term GF as “psycho” but won’t elaborate much on what he might have done wrong.

None of this was CRAZY to me for a while.  For one, I attributed his hot/cold way of making plans to him wanting to keep a distance bc of my “marriage”.  I respected that.  Now I’m realizing I was just being played!  Our times together were always fun and don’t get me wrong, I didn’t do anything I didn’t want to do.  Our overnights were fun and intimate really with lots of cuddling and good talks.

The stress of waiting for texts back on some days while getting floods of them on others or not being able to express any actual feelings for fear of sort of being made fun of or made to feel like I’m seeing this as something it isn’t is getting to me and I’m feeeling like such a moron for not realizing I’m most likely dealing with a narcissist.  

So my experienced ones, am I crazy?  Is this just part of the inevitable learning process of adult dating?  And what do I do now?  It feels weird to block and if I call him out he will say I’m crazy (he says all woman are crazy).  I can’t continue.  The further I go the harder it is to not care.  Right now I figure it’s been 2 months, I can get over anything that only lasted this long.  It’s my ego more than anything else.

Things I’ve been lied about in the last year 
1. Residence: still living with ex husband, lives abroad and looking for a partner in other cities/countries, lives abroad but has a apartment here they visit once or twice a year 
2. Dating history: says they’ve been a devoted wife for 10 years but really been in an open marriage and performed BDSM acts with strangers for two years while still married. Shares story of a ONS without seeing if it makes me uncomfortable 
3. Security: say they’re trusting and in love but accuse me constantly of cheating, spying on them, drugging them… with me doing nothing to raise such suspicions. Hides social media accounts from me
4. Dating goals: claim they’re looking for a serious relationship but still check their OLD profile while dating me. Claim their looking for marriage but can’t let go of their previous relationship/marriage name/feeling for ex 
5. Work habits: claim to enjoy frequent communication and contact with me but as soon as work gets a little demanding will abandon plans or show up much later than they said they would without confirming. Comes over but is buried in laptop working despite claiming they’re here to see me. 
6. Children: tell me they want more children when they don’t (or aren’t ready)
7. Status: hides the fact they are divorcing their spouse on social media. Doesn’t tell friends, even “close” friends that we are dating despite putting their face on social media 
8. Gaslighting: says something mean or hurtful then blames me for it. Says something unflattering then claims they didn’t say it. Whenever I voice a concern she says it’s due to my anxiety or something else 
9. Rudeness: says they’ll call you in a hour but doesn’t call back for a day. Says they be over to see you at 6 but call four hours later saying they haven’t left yet. 
10. Intimacy: demands sex to be more rough and kinky without asking if I’m ok with it
11. Quality time: set up time to see a movie or cook a nice meal and they are staring at their laptop or phone.

Went on day with younger woman never married and never had kids.
Went great both agreed there was chemistry. She asked for my number and asked to kiss me. She mentioned she was aggressive which I’m fine with.
She texted that night she had a great time and wanted to do it again.
Well the next text conversations got kind of more personal nothing to sexual. We talked about pillows on the bed, fans on or off , how we slept. She mentioned she slept naked and was aggressive at cuddling  and-her pet didn’t cuddle as much as she wanted. My comment was clothes get all twisted and I can see the reason for sleeping naked and maybe she’s overworking the pet and he needs a break. She asked if I wanted the job position, I said I’m a hard worker and great at cuddling and will work for free.

I have kept in contact with an ex from 3 years ago (37m) who had broken up with me 4 months into our relationship because he had only been divorced for a year and wanted to play the field before settling down again. 

Through our talks, it sounds like he's ready for commitment. I've told him that I feel like I'm too boring for him. He says that he wants ""safety and stability"". I've told him that I'm broken right now and need to work on making myself happy again before I get into another relationship. He has also just gotten out of his first ""relationship"" (dated 2 months) since we broke up and understands that it will take time...or so he says.

I've kept in contact with him because he is an AMAZING father to his 3 girls. If he put that same effort into a relationship that would be one EXTREMELY happy woman. 

My therapist asks what my hesitation is. What's the worst that could happen? But I find myself holding back from him. He asked me to come over tonight for wine and cuddling. I get the feeling like he just wants sex. (Our sex life was amazing but I'm not craving it right now after my breakup.)

He can sense my hesitation and the tension between us is thick.

I'm a 43f and have never been in a relationship.  Long story short, I was born almost fully deaf. Deaf in one ear and severe hearing loss in the other ear. I spent years learning to speak and read lips with the support of a hearing aid in the ""good"" ear. I grew up in a hearing family and, as a teen/kid I didn't have much of a social life in public school. I am not part of the deaf culture and don't use ASL. I spent many years focusing on school and have a good career as a public school teacher. Therefore I feel like I'm a bit behind the curve relationship-wise as I didn't have access to same communication tools. 
 It was hard work navigating hearing loss in a hearing world, especially with communication.  It wasn't until texting and instant messaging that I started to form friendships and meet others. I've tried OLD with mixed results. I'm told I'm quite attractive and many people are surprised I'm deaf as I speak fairly well, albeit with small deaf accent. I've been on different dates over the years but it's been a while at least 8 years.   I just got upgraded my hearing aid for a cochlear implant a few months before the pandemic. It's been fantastic. I'm very self-reliant and fine with my own company,  but lately, maybe it's age and  it's probably due to hearing much better with my new cochlear implant,  but I want to see what I'm missing out on.  This includes sex as I'm not very experienced in that field at all. 
My question is, when past relationships are asked about how  could that be answered? Or sexual experience? Also how would you want to know that someone has a hidden disability? In a profile or in person? Through a casual mention? I've got a lot to offer and hiding in my shell (though not entirely by choice) isn't working well.

I spent a lot of years traveling for work, so meeting someone serious didn't seem practical. A couple months ago I accepted a different position in a new city that doesn't require much travel. Now all my friends live far away; I don't really know anyone here. It feels like I'm starting over.

New Year's Eve, I got an unexpected call. A good friend's teenaged daughter drove eight hours to see someone nearby, but he ghosted her, so she had nowhere to go. She asked to crash at my house. She showed up, and we spent the entire night talking, catching up, and walked around a nearby ocean pier for a couple hours in the morning. The following afternoon, she took off to go find the boy she came down to see.

Since this is reddit, I feel obligated to say that nothing happened between us. I'm a close family friend who's known her most of her life. My best friends are my family, and that's exactly how I see her.

But after she left, it surprised me that I missed her. Not specifically her, though. It was so nice to have someone here with me. Someone to talk to and share things with, someone to help explore this new area. I've been alone for a long time, but the whole thing made me realize this is the first I've felt lonely.

I'm a social person, and don't have problems meeting people, but I haven't really connected with anyone here yet. It's making me consider online dating, but I haven't done that in about ten years. I did fairly well in my early 30's, but I didn't enjoy meeting people that way, so I'm reluctant to try it again.

A big part of me thinks that dating isn't the answer, that I need a core group of friends here, and the rest will fall into place. But I'm sure you all know that making close friends can be pretty challenging in your 40's. Meeting people is easy, meeting the right people is hard.

But at the same time, am I wasting time by not actively looking? Until now, I've been perfectly happy by myself.

I could really use hearing some other viewpoints on this, because I'm catching myself in a crazy cycle of insecurity.

I (M/early 40s) have been dating a woman (F/late 30s) for almost a year. I'm in the late stages of divorcing my ex (and have a few kids). We met via dating app about a year ago, and we've been pretty much inseparable since then (we've basically been texting every few hours since our first date). We started seeing each other once a week for a month or two, then twice a week (at least). Our personalities are kind of different, but we really get along, and have a great time with each other. 

We first had sex about 6 weeks after our first date, and it was absolutely mind-blowing (at least for me). Since then we've been having sex pretty much every time we see each other (sometimes twice a day), and started having overnights a few months later. We didn't have the conversation about exclusivity until a few months ago (although I was exclusive since we first met - not that I necessarily expected her to be, just that I didn't want to have to deal with the weird emotions about seeing multiple people, and I found this relationship very promising from the very beginning). I told her I had feelings for her about six weeks ago, and while she she made it clear she had feelings too, she ""wasn't ready"" to say the words just then (she did a few weeks after that, and regularly says she loves me now). We've formally been BF and GF for a few months.

I've had a handful of insecurities since we started dating (all resulting from my poor marriage). These insecurities generally relate my performance in the bedroom and overall sense of self-worth. I had a really poor sexual relationship with my ex (who was never all that into sex, and had some very specific things I needed to do in the bedroom to satisfy her, so it was always completely clear when I was ""getting the job done"" with her). This woman doesn't seem to have specific ""requirements"" for what I need to do in the bedroom, and she seems to enjoy sex. A few months after we started having sex I mentioned this insecurity to her and asked her how I was doing. She sort of laughed it off and said that if I wasn't getting the job done she'd ""let me know right away."" I didn't bring it up further because I wanted to take her at her word, and didn't want to appear completely insecure (and figured time in a healthy sexual relationship might cure this insecurity).

We had sex a few nights ago and it didn't seem all that fantastic for her. It was a bit rushed, she wasn't as into it as she usually is, she didn't want me to go down on her (which is something my ex required to orgasm, but she doesn't seem to like all that much, strangely). Basically the opposite of how she usually is. My insecurities started to come out right away, and I brought them up as we were still lying there. She didn't laugh them off this time, but she said ""you're good, don't worry about it"" (but it seemed like she was blowing me off). I told her this was important to me and if I wasn't taking care of business I'd definitely want to know, wouldn't be offended, would welcome any advice she had, etc. She sounded like she really didn't want to talk about it, just told me not to worry about it, so I left it there. 

This insecurity is starting to bleed into other aspects of my feelings for her. Because I was married for close to 20 years, I'm fairly sure she's had many more sexual partners than I have (and this isn't a problem for me at all). This insecurity is starting me down a path where I start thinking that she's comparing me with other guys she's been with and I don't measure up, I start thinking that she's likely to jump ship the moment an old boyfriend comes back into the picture, she isn't actually in love with me and is just settling for me, etc.) 

Was it possible she was just having a bad night? How do I (and should I) continue discussion on this topic? If she tells me everything is OK, I'm inclined to take her at her word, but to me the difference between getting the job done and not getting it done is obvious, and if she tells me I'm getting it done when all evidence says otherwise, it's going to continue to bother me. It's at the point that while every single thing she does and says should objectively tell me that everything is good, but I'm starting to convince myself it's all going to fall apart suddenly.
