I've noticed a  lot of guys I meet on tinder are overly aggressive about sex and intimacy. It's like the idea of just exploring friendship isn't possible. I've had many guys block me because I wouldn't send nudes or do other bs. Most recently I had this experience with a guy that started out fine but quickly became really uncomfortable. I tried to establish a friendship with this guy and at first we really hit it off well. It seemed like we had a decent connection. However after a few hours or so of conversing he started to become very very persistent about sex. Telling me how much he likes me and how he wants to cuddle and all kinds of ""seductive"" stuff. I tried to play it cool and basically tell this person that I'm not looking for sex. They didn't get the message and kept on going with messages about how much they want to be together. Now I don't know what to do. I find it a bit overwhelming and somewhat of a turn off to be consistently propositioned for sex. We could just hangout but now that I know they are super intent on having sex it just feels a bit uncomfortable. Part of me is upset that we won't be able to establish the same kind of friendship with this forced tension. I think it's not fair to just expect sex from everyone you're friendly with.

I got into a relationship with a girl a couple weeks ago. We matched on a dating app mid August, and began dating early October. We had met up a couple times, and would call and text quite frequently.

I was definitely very interested in her, and cared a lot for her. But at the start, I had to ask her slow down, as I didn't want to rush a relationship. Once we began dating, she would say she loves me, and it was very hard for me to say it back- I liked her a lot, but love is a strong word. 

I felt strong bouts of infatuation, but I didn't want to say it unless I was really sure. To my fault, I once replied with ""I love you too"", but using the word felt very uncomfortable. 

Over the next couple days she would occasionally say it, and I would say I liked her a lot too, or just continue on with the conversation. I mentioned that constantly saying how much I like someone isn't something I find comfortable, but that didn't change. 

About a week into 'officially' dating, we had a disagreement as she asked ""why won't you say it back? Are you not sure of me?""

We ended it the next day as I couldn't keep up with the speed and intensity she wanted, and didn't see myself catching up soon. 

I still follow her social media, and I know I should stop. It's been a couple weeks, and there's still stories that are definitely pointed at me, which often are to the lines of ""the guy made a mistake, and doesn't deserve the love"". 

It's hurtful as I definitely cared, and still do care about her. But I felt two months of just knowing someone was too soon to genuinely feel love.

I am interested in a guy at my school, but I recently learned that he has been on a break with his gf almost 3 years; they started dating their freshman year of college. 

I see him after my class and don’t usually say hi because I feel a tad shy. He is my first crush in 3 years. Though I still maintain confidence, and I believe that shows in my body language. I’m not sure if I’m right on this, but I think he thinks I’m pretty?  

I would like to express my interest to him, and I finally had a conversation with him not too long ago. I don’t think he wants to go out alone with me. At first, I suggested that we go out for a meal along with his friend (which I want as well ofc, but I hope to go out with him alone), which he agreed to. Before I left home, I mentioned it again but said just the both of us. He then mentioned the new friend (his friend) I made coming along. Also, he is popular around campus and is very involved. 

I still didn’t meet him and his friend, but I wish I could tell him I’m interested in him. I go to a small school, and I worry his “ex” might do something, as my other friend said she might do.

There’s been a shy coworker of mine who’s pretty cute and after a month of hesitation, I decided to go talk to her. We found a common interest (anime) and I got her Snapchat. She is super shy like she doesn’t talk to anyone else at the workplace unless someone talks to her first. Even when someone is talking to her she just answers the questions and doesn’t really ask the other person questions about them. I’ve experienced these as well. She’s so shy and introverted that she’ll avoid eye contact with me if I walk by her even tho I’m clearly in her view. 

I’ve lost quite a bit of interest due to her lack of communication but still have a sliver of hope because she did say that I’m the only guy in the warehouse she talks to like this and I’m just trying to ask her out.

We had had 3 very intense dates with heavy makeout sessions, we'd FaceTime every time and he'd tell me how he adored me and liked to talk to me. And he knew I'd only have sex with him in a committed relationship but he decided to carry on. So on Friday we had decided we would go out on Sunday and he always confirms the date and picks me up at my place and this time he just stood me up.

On Sunday morning he sent me videos and pics of him on a Halloween party he attended on Saturday, he was Spiderman because everybody says he looks like Tom Holland and he likes to emphasize it (very immature to me, but anyway). I said a few things about the pics he sent me at 11am, he left me on read then didn't say anything else. At all.

Sunday evening came, and I realized I had been stood up. I thought he'd ghost me and never say anything to me ever again, then yesterday, Monday, he texts me at 2pm saying

""Oh, I thought my message yesterday had gone through. Yesterday I was very hungover and because I had to work today I decided to take a rest yesterday. Sorry. How are you?""

What a pathetic excuse. We talk on WhatsApp and he had been online all night and in the morning when I woke up his last seen time was 2am. He was definitely not taking a rest and I am pretty sure he would have had 10 seconds to text me a"" I'm hungover, can't see you right now"" message.

So 4 hours later I replied to his message and said ""That's alright. Got it."" and said ""I'm fine"" to his ""How are you?"" (definitely did not ask ""and you?""). So my texts were basically ""That's alright. Got it. I'm fine"". 

Then he left me on read again and didn't say anything else. My question is: why do people do this? Why even text an apology if it's not even a real apology? Why do people take other people's intelligence for granted?

What did he really want with this apology? He wanted to reconnect? He just wanted to feel good about himself? He's immature and because I sent him a cold reply he didn't know what else to say? Is this kind of attitude common? Am I dating a man child? Are things going to end this way? So many questions in my mind, but I still don't understand the modern dating world.

We used to text all night.. and it would go on till 3-4am... But he would never text back during the day time... I used to crush on him soo hard- it was unhealthy  I know, but yeah...

We tease each other and give each other space... He replies to my texts... He motivates me when I'm down- He makes me smile...❤︎ I like him.

Guy Y is in my class

I moved from guy X to Y in a few weeks... (haven't dated either of them just crushing...) Do I like Guy Y coz he's treating me right?

When women give dating advice to men, they often say things like, “you want it too much”, “just live your life and it’ll happen”, or my favorite, “stop looking and you’ll find it”. They also push the idea that confidence and a good personality is the most important quality a man can have.

Now it’s not like this stuff is wrong. It’s just misunderstood by men.

First with confidence and personality . When women say things like this, I think I’m their mind they’re picturing a guy they would already be physically attracted to, but  not attractive enough for them to overlook a bad personality or lack of confidence. So in their mind for this theoretical guy to get a date with them, he’d just need to be confident. Man hear this as that if an ugly man is confident and has a good personality he can get any girl. Which is obviously not true.

When women give the advice to stop looking or that it’ll come when you least expect it or stop trying to find it, I think this is more a misunderstanding of how men have to date. Man cannot simply just wait. Men have to hunt or they will find no food. Women are hunted. A Hunter will come find them eventually if they stop looking so hard. This will never be the case for men, unless they’re very attractive. If an average or Belle looking man tried this strategy it would lead to him being single for years to come.

I think because of these misunderstandings, both genders find themselves frustrated with each other.

Quick question, I went on a date with someone that went really well, but I’m no longer interested in pursuing the relationship (we both expressed that we were dating with an intent for a serious relationship).  


He seems too busy for a relationship right now since he’s currently in school pursuing a demanding career.  From what I gathered so far, he’s the type of person that neglects his friendships and hobbies to fully focus on his schooling/career.  This isn’t an assumption, he specifically told me he doesn’t have time for friends and won’t participate in some hobbies since he studies all the time.  While I respected his obvious commitment and dedication to his studies/career, this was a red flag for me.  Again, I think it’s very important for a person to be dedicated to what they do, but this made me fear that he would not be able to give me the quality time and communication I need in a relationship.


He never texts me and I always initiate conversation.  I canceled our “second date” on the day of because I was exhausted from traveling and I didn’t say anything about rescheduling.  Part of the reason I canceled was because he hadn’t talked to me at all in the week leading up to the date and didn’t give me any details/plan for the date.  In his last message to me he told me he had a very busy week and he hoped I had a good week, he wasn’t offended that I canceled.  He hasn’t attempted to reach out since.


In this situation, do you think I need to reach out to him and tell him this isn’t going to work out?  He’s not even talking to me anyways so he might have also lost interest on top of being busy.

Last week i (m21) told my neighbor/closest friend (f21) that i had feelings for her and that i'd like to give it a shot and go out with her , i kinda said it because we were gonna go to a halloween party the day after and didnt wanna say something while drunk.

The response from her at the start was shocked face but then she started talking how she noticed stuff from me and that she thought about me before bur didnt make a move cuz we both live in a students dorm and didnt want it to be weird if it doesnt work out but she also said that she is also recovering from a FWB situation that ended last month and she is still attached to the person and overall with a bunch of other said stuff that were clueing to a positive answer afrer i told her that i didnt wanna put her on the spot and that she doesnt have to give an answer now and so the subject changed.

Fast forward to halloween night me and her we wanred to go out chec some partys so we go to party no.1 and the host there was kind of super extrovert and took shots with us and spoke but then he takes me aside and asks me hey are u with her? Im like its complicated and his reponse was ""dont worry by tonight u will kiss her"" didnt think much of that and afrer a few mins i saw her and him talking and me not knowing anyone at the party i went there and thats when they stopped and the guy whispered in my ear ""dont worry bro im wingmanning u and talking u up just give us a minute"" i got pushed off and i didnt feel comfortable with that.

Few mins later she comes to me and says how that guy was being weird telling her to go find a guy to kiss tonight but also flirting with her adn stuff , so after that she was drunk and we started dancing. And as we are dancing she turned her back to me and didnt want to dance with me or anything (which is something she didnt do before) and when she saw rhe host she went to him but he pushed her back to me and it was like that till we got bored and decided to go to another party , at that point i was starting to get hurt just cuz of how she treated me and how she went to that guy who she barly knows

We grabbed someone we met at party no.1 and went togather all 3 to party no.2 in a club and so now its me her and another girl , nothing much happened in the club some guys tried hittimg on her but she wasnt responsive to them and one guy tried getting really close to her but u pushed him off and she thanked me for that but 5 mins later she felt uncomfortable and wanted to leave so we left and as we wanted to go home i saw a friend of mine and he invited us back to his place and thats when all of this started going dark 

At his place the 4 of us drank some more but then she started openning up about her FWB and how she was hurt and she wishes she can find someone who takes care of her and is there for her , and in my mind im just so sad cuz im thinking hey that is me 24 hours ago i told u that i can be this person for you and so i got mad drank some more and somehow idk why ended up kissing the random girl from party 1 one kiss , that somehow transpired into all of us sitting on the couch and thats when she (my crush) who is super drunk starts complimenting the girl and ended up kissing her right infront of me andd then the turns around and kisses my friend , as much as i was shocked i was so hurt by what she said earlier than the scar she opened didnt hurt further. Later thay night me and the random girl we went to bed we didnt do anything just cuddled and her and my friend were in the kitchen im guessing they made out abit more and talked

I want to note out thay my friend knew about my feelings towards her and told me he is sorry a million times but i was so mad i didnt care.

Next morning we all go home and i start realizing that halloween night was the worst way possible anyone can ever say no to someone i was super hurt but i still felt like okay i must move on and i started to , me and my friend we talked it out he said he was sorry and me wanting to move on said idc what u do with her just be careful and dont get hurt.

One day later despite me talking to her normally she felt i was hurt and wanted to talk to me about that night and so she started by saying how im unfair when i used to ignore here and be mad at her for previous stuff (she is refering to when i found out about her FWB and that it was with one of my close friends) . Thats when i told her im not mad at her but i want to move on and i explained to her halloween night from my prespective , after some silence i was just like why couldnt u just say no to me before thay why did u have to show it to ne lie that even if u were drunk.

Her response was ""i didnt want to say no to us bejng a thing and i still dont but i dont wanna go into something while im still recovering from the FWB thing , halloween night was crazy i was drunk and i should have never done that with that girl or ur friend or the host at the first party"" we ended up talkinh it out and the current situation stands in 

me still trying to move on but also not knowing what she thinks.

My friend wanting to be a rebound to her and wanting my premission and me telling him i need timr to get over her then idc

That random girl well we didjt talk after and she doesnt play a big role in the story except me and her kissing once


What do you think i should do , i had feelings for this girl for months and i care so much about her , she says she wanted to process her feelings from her last FWB but then she does stuff that hurt me at halloween night so bad and after that she says she shouldnt have done that and she still doesnt wanna say no to us being a thing but she needs time to get over the FWB

we see a lot of worst first dates (I love those, all the drama including for mine which was shite at the time!) but what was your BEST first date?

I’ll go first! I did Tinder for a long time and had done everything from laser tag to paint ball to dining at a fancy sky scraper restaurant… even once a hot air balloon first date, but at some point I only did coffee dates (after really bad experiences on first meeting that ended up being the worst date so I wanted to be sure there was never a historical repeat).

I decided “coffee” after initially matching on an app and chit-chatting for a very short time so our mind didn’t form an inaccurate version of someone before we met, is the perfect meetup for OLD. 

Basically I could figure out if there’s an attraction whilst sober and have a quick and easy out if in person doesn’t align with digital version. 15 min with someone I’m not into (or who perhaps isn’t into me) is more than enough time.

So I met up with this guy fairly early in the day for coffee at this local artsy coffee house I hadn’t ever been to. He wasn’t super attractive or anything, he had braces, dark eyes and dark hair (like I like it) and a nice smile even with braces… pretty instantly we vibed and had great banter. He was relaxed and not hyper (hyper guys on first date = 🚩for me). He was super intelligent &amp; actually nice, which is just the most sexy thing a guy can be.

So we talked for several hours and it was great… I thought we were wrapping things up and then he was like “what’re you doing for rest of day?”… I told him I didn’t really have any solid plans so he asked “how do you feel about going on a road trip?”… we had been talking about places I hadn’t been to yet since moving to this city and on the list was this quaint mountain town…. So I was like sure! It was several hours away, we jumped in his car and took off. He was so chill I didn’t have any reservations about going.

We talked the entire time we are driving there and then walk around this quaint-somewhat-tacky 😅 mountain town. We hold hands, explore artsy trinket shops, eat at this cute restaurant and as the sun is setting we are near the mountain summit and he kisses me while my innards danced and it was cinematic.

We drove back to my car that night and while our second date things were revealed that were dealbreakers for me, I’ll always cherish that first experience with him even though I forgot his name 😂

I could fret and micro-analyze every text I sent and mentally review every mistake I made, but to be honest, I don't think I did anything wrong. She just didn't seem to like me all that much. She seemed distant, not wanting to text much, didn't like physical touch like holding hands, didn't spend a whole lot time together, didn't go to either of our houses to spend time privately. I was almost on my way out anyways because I really need quality time with someone to feel like I'm in a relationship and I wasn't getting it. I guess she beat me to the punch though.

The good news is - I'm not blaming myself and I'm not wallowing in self-pity or remorse.

The bad news is - the search starts all over.

Tinder is a shit-show that has a lot of people but not very many relevant to me. Hinge is more relevant but not particularly great sometimes.

I’m not saying I need years of dating someone for me to want to move in with them, i’m just not interested in that right now.

It's a great town and I love it, and it's led me to be very creative with my sex/dating life. I'm almost going fast with certain girls and slower with some girls since it follows a vibe. Basically I get around a little haha.

Anyways a few of this girls really catch my eye (literally you'll see haha), and I'd like to share with y'all how I'm feeling with this. It's been a. Very comfortable thing for me and I'd like to share my findings with my situation to help y'all struggling out there.

Actually I'd like a discussion with this one.

So we had a really long ""Halloweekend"", as a Communication major, my fucking weekend starts at 5 on Wednesday, I live the free time I've set up.

Anyways I was going to get a munchie (I smoke a lot of pot, it centers me), and these girls (Both F 18) (who one lives down the hall from me), passed me in the stairwell. Well I can tell her friend was taken, but this girl (F 18) has the smokiest 'fuck me' eyes I've ever seen. Really caught me eye (see I told you it'd come through).

We were chatting up for a few and I made a real smooth move with her phone (made sure it was ok for here to add me on sc) and went for a kiss. 

GOT FUCKING COCKBLOCKED. (thanks roommate ((M 18 or 7 I can't tell) you're a homie 😬🙄🙄🙄)

But since neither of us were sober it was honestly a blessing... So I texted her, ""hey if you're around this side of campus a lot, hmu I'm down to chill with you, just text me when you're sober ;)"" (paraphrasing but this is the jist)

Anyways she bites and sends a nice reply about how she's very much interested. Anyways, my problem is this:

I really like this girl, but I don't want anything serious right now bc I'm in a heavy way (in life's scheme, I'm doing amazing, kinda wanna live like this for a while. 

So, What I WANT to do, is hookup or go out together and see where it takes me. HOWEVER I am really not trying to catch feels since she's a fun person, and I don't want anything serious. She seems very much my type of girl and I think she's v interested in me. She's just home this week, so I've got some time to strategize.

However, a while ago i started to feel emotionally closed off towards him. My therapist and i established that it's because of a fear of commitment. The feeling passed and i was head over heels again for a while, but now the anxiety has returned.

I just want to know if anyone recognizes this feeling, because it feels so different from anything else i read/hear about fear of commitment.

I know i love him and i know i have an incredibly healthy relationship with him, but i can't seem to connect with him emotionally. Nothing has changed in our relationship, so i know the problem lies with me. I feel so so guilty all the time, because i want to be able to give him as much love as he gives me. But for some reason i just cant. At the same time I want some space, but i'm scared of him leaving. i'm so so conflicted. All i know is, i don't want to break up with him. A relationship like we have, doesn't come along very often. Yet i feel so axious about our relationship.

And i think that might be the cause of my anxiety. My ex and i had a very toxic relationship, with extremely high highs and extremely low lows. So i think i'm just not used to being in such a healthy relationship and my body is in fight or flight mode.

I feel like everything i hear or read about fear of commitment is running away and dumping your s/o and both ending up getting hurt. overall really toxic behaviour, but i don't relate to that. I want to get through this, because i know how good this relationship is for me.

I have already posted this in other related subreddits, but thought it would be interesting to get some advice on here. For some more context, I (25) am a gay guy though not sure if that makes any difference to the potential advice I may get.

As a childhood survivor of sexual and physical abuse, I am at point in my mid twenties that after years of intensive therapy, I have developed a more concrete idea of what I want from life. I feel even more ready to settle down and have a relationship.

That said, I have been in two previous relationships including 4 serious dating situations, one which ended recently after 5 months. I still attend therapy regularly and because of my recent break up, I have been analyzing things even more carefully. 

Ultimately, my last dating situation made my realize more than any other time before how much of the dynamics of my childhood trauma has seeped into my dating life. 

For context, I was abused for a summer at age 8 by a much older relative. At age 5 and 6 I was also physically abused by an aunt. Both accounts were quite graphic and severely changed me. 

That said, according to my therapist, it seems that the dynamics and feelings I had of being neglected and invisible during my abuse and the aftermath of growing up, continue to show up in my romantic life.

It is frustrating since my family and friends know about what I went through since I told them a few years ago. They have been supportive and caring. Recently, my older sister mentioned how there seems to be a disconnect in my regular life and romantic life. In the former, I am confident, know what I want and who I am, and can stand up for myself; however in the latter, it feels like all of that is thrown out the window

I especially have come to terms that sometimes it is easier to assume what my partner can’t and can do instead of asking them for the things I deserve. I have also come to terms that I do deserve more but I get scared to ask these things of my partners with the risk of getting disappointed. 

That said, I wanted to know how my fellow survivors deal with these kinds of dynamics and ultimately finding love. It feels like such an already impossible task. I want to be able to communicate to my partners what I deserve, and when I say deserve I am talking about the things I am willing and capable of doing. I don’t ask of things that are superficial, yet it seems it takes a long time for me to accept my partners for who they are and are not. I know this does not make them inherently bad, I just want to be able to get to this point quickly so as to identify who is willing to give me what I deserve…",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1116995,public,self,Dating as a survivor,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ql6qvn/dating_as_a_survivor/,all_ads,6,dating,,,,,,

Hey everyone. So I’m not a total noob to dating in my life I’ve had one relationship that lasted just under a year in 2020. Beyond that 8 month period of being in love and being dumped, dating has been a dumpster fire for me.

I’ve been getting a number of connections and dates online. Many times it seems to go well via text and phone call but then when we meet up in person they end up ghosting me after. That is if thet don’t ghost me before the meet up.

Background on me, I’m gainfully employed with a number of side hustles in events and I would say I’m a 5.5/6 out of 10 in the looks department being bald but in decent physical shape. 

I’m also an extreme extrovert and an open book. What people find to be a great asset I wonder now if it works to my detriment. I tend to be an open book and befriend people very easily and I’m loud and a joker but I wonder if I’m giving too much away too early and they get sick of me too quickly ?

It took me a long time to really internalize or care that one night stands made me feel like crap about myself. I also got into my first serious relationship when I was 16 via a one night stand so for a while I was trying to recreate those circumstances by sleeping with dudes I wouldn’t mind dating (it did not work haha). I also do enjoy sex so by the time I turned 20 I had slept with about 16 people. Now my number is equal to my age. Despite this I’ve only had two actual boyfriends and four guys who I’ve had longer flings with. I’ve never cheated, don’t have any sti’s, and have never been pregnant. Just taken 21 dongs :(

The strategy I’ve been planning on using once I realized guys care about body count is to just keep it private, but I don’t think either of us would hypothetically be better off for that so I think I’m gonna have to tell the next man I date it all

I wouldn’t mind it if the next guy I sleep with is my husband but does that mean I have to wait a few years for my history to be further behind me in order to be seen as cute / innocent / valuable for a long term partnership? Is this a REAL concern for men looking to date and if so how do I counter it?

We both expressed that we weren't looking for anything serious before we both went off to college but still had an amazing time and talked and talked for hours post movie date. Nothing really came of the date due to covid and we spent a couple weeks talking a bit but it dwindled out where I eventually un-added him from my snapchat. Fast forward almost a whole crazy year he went out of his way to find my socials again and reach out (march2021). I was surprised he still wanted to talk to me especially because we only met once prior. We began going on dates here and there and he made it a point to tell me that he was a different person from the one he was before (don't know what he was implying). We began actively hanging out but never put an official label on anything. We did a lot of couple activities on top of hooking up. I even made the drive to see him twice at college when I was doing college classes from home from covid and he wanted to see me. We spent the whole summer together. He even brought me to meet some of his friends (which were two other couples) where we spent the night there and had a good time. Summer came to a close and this left the question of what would happen when I went away to school finally. He was coming up with ideas on how to see each other and was looking up distances between our two schools and how long drives would be to see each other. This really began to confuse me because we never talked about what we were and to most of my friends on the outside it looked like we were just “friends with benefits”. We both went to school and still talk here and there. He continually talks to me and tells me how he can't wait to see me again or how he misses me. I would be lying if I said I wasn't still on tinder but mainly just looking for a dealer. I have gone on a few dates/ meet ups since being at school. But I have this overarching feeling of cheating. I know I am not and we are not official and that I have no idea what he is doing at school right now. I am just worried about hurting feelings. Even though we are not official it has been a significant amount of time where I need to address the situation. I just hate the idea of putting a damper on holidays and home visits and the talk to end things. I have never been in a relationship before so I especially don't even know where to start on ending things with him. Am I blowing this up way too much??

So I have met my first serious boyfriend when I was 18. He was not a king of romance but he have been trying to learn.  He would ask me out on dates and give me some little gifts time after time. Ok, I fell in love! I started feeling very passionate around him which I have never felt before. But I was scared about our first time. And I decided to tell this to him. I told him I was never with a man before and that I am scared of pain. He told me that he started dating me for one reason that I have never been with anyone before and he was ready for this. To be honest that sounded a bit weird. So he offered me to drink some beer and then try. When I relax. I did not relax even a bit after that beer. But I knew it was time, otherwise I will never be ready. 

And it happened...

For me it was nothing but pain. I have heard that it usually how it is for all girls. For him it was ….disappointing…. For some reason. After he finished he felt angry. I did not understand why. I asked him what happened. He said that I lied about him being my first. although I did not lie. I asked him what makes him think I lied. He said that I had “some moves”. I mean what?? ”Some moves”??? I had no idea what I had to do and I was just dealing with lots of pain. I told him that I had no moves and what about blood and pain I had. He said there was only a little blood and had to be more. This was ridiculous!!! I wish I could turn back time and not do it with him!!!! I felt really disappointed that my first, such a special time was with him! He would find any reason to convict me of lie. Now I have to live with that fact that my first time was not any special!

Well, I asked her this morning if she’d be interested in going fishing with me on one of our mutual days off, and she seemed excited about it, and said it sounded like fun. Then I got her number and after I left, texted with her for a few mins about fishing. 

Now my minor dilemma is what else I could do when we’re fishing. Like, what I’ve got stuck in my head the most is if I brought lunch or lunch makings, like an unopened loaf of bread and some store bought egg salad for egg salad sandwiches (I say store bought because I make way better than that myself, I just don’t know what people think about eating food made my someone they don’t know). 
But THAT really turns it into a date if you ask me, and I never used the word “date” with her, just asked if she’d like to go fishing with me. If she sees it as a date on the other hand, I’d like to at least take care of whatever lunch we have together, on top of hopefully surprising her with it. The other problem with that is if she’s allergic to eggs or something, it wouldn’t go so well. 

I’m an over-thinker, I know. I’m more inclined not to do anything I didn’t say I was going to do, and be as predictable as possible before really knowing anything about each other.  But I also want to meet expectations because I can. 

Thoughts? Suggestions? 

Sorry for the grammar.

&amp;#x200B;

I matched on tinder with this girl (20M) and we talked for a month before meeting (this meeting was two weeks ago). She was always saying how I was an exception to other guys etc etc. How she didn't meet quickly but she was happy I did not push her to meet. The conversation was initiated 50-50. Flirting was on both ends. We met at my place, everything is lovey dovey, we talked, kissed, had sex, slept together, cuddled together, had breakfast together etc. We both expressed our desire to see each other more.

&amp;#x200B;

The week afterwards we met two times more, although shortly and outside, and walk hand in hand, kiss and hug almost like a couple. During the week we also videocalled in the evenings to work on our own projects together. We talk about how everything is so amazing and we agree that we are going to start 'dating'.   
We were supposed to meet yesterday and have another date night, however this weekend something at home happened and she couldn't come anymore. Over the weekend she became colder and we don't talk a lot anymore. The flirting is absent, she doesn't respond to my attempts to rekindle the flame. I don't even know what the vibe will be if we meet again.   


I get that a weekend is too early to decide but this exact thing has happened to me before a year earlier and it took me a year to get over it too. It's just so unlike me that I can't wrap my head around it. Once i express a desire to explore a connection I do it and if it's not what i want i communicate that. It just sucks that people i feel enough connection with to continue dating them are so few and far in between. Oh well, good gym motivation i guess..  


Am i the only one encountering this? How do you people handle it?

Many times I've heard guys I know refer to girls with no dad as having ""daddy issues"" despite barely knowing the girl in question. And many times I've heard girls I'm friends with use similar terminology to refer to guys who are in similar scenarios. 

I myself have been rejected on online dating, on the basis of, and I quote, ""mommy issues"" before the girl even got to know me. We spoke for less than an hour, mostly about basic, common stuff you'd start any conversation with. 

At some point, she asked about my family and I said moms not around but I got a great dad and I love my niece to death. When I naturally asked about her family next, she just said something like ""oof mommy issues"" and unmatched not long after.

So I guess what I'm asking is... are things like that normal? I mean is it really commonly seen as such a bad thing to have split up parents? What about people with older parents or recently divorced parents, where one or both parent(s) moves in with the kid? Is any such scenario with your family thats less than ideal going to be judged, or only some of them?

To sum it up, I'd basically restate the title: are people in perhaps non-traditional situations like this generally judged quite as bad as I've heard and seen? Or is my experience the uncommon one? 

Sometimes I think maybe I'm looking for an excuse not to try, something to rationalize not having to show or build up my low confidence and put myself out there.
