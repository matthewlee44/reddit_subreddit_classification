She's also super into science fiction movies, which I've never encountered before with a woman before, and she introduced me to a hardcore waitress at the club who is super into science fiction books and Renaissance Fair type stuff as well, so I may have not only scored a potential girlfriend, but a new friend as well.

She also agreed to text me again outside the club and confirm plans for next week, and check in to see how I'm doing. I don't want to get my hopes up too much but I think I found the one y'all.

I knew this girl (f27) for a pretty long time online and we spoke alot but couldn't meet in a long time because of the distance. We used to flirt a little bit over phone and face time. When we finally decided to meet she wanted it not to be a traditional date setting, because of her previous bad dating experiences and her self proclaimed fear of intimacy and her need to take it slowly. I don't have lots of dating experience and also want to take it slowly to begin with, so we agreed on this. It felt good for both of us to lower the pressure.

Story:

I travelled far to a place close to hers where we met. We hung out for 8 hours and had the best of times. Given what we had agreed on, i did intentionally not make any attempts on her other than some small compliment. However as the hours past her behavior drifted away from our agreement and she started to become close and flirted the heck out of me. (This was not under alcohol). She was spinning around me, touching me, pushing me as she joked with me, put her fingers on my neck, leaning towards me, spontaneously throwing her arms around me hugging me very intensely, putting her arm around me as we walked, looking deeply into my eyes alot etc. I found it very nice but it also got me confused given what we had talked about before. I interpreted this as she was interested in me and liked me. When we left she once again hugged me intensely and for a long time.

Some days past by and i decided to call her. On the phone she was ice cold. She nervously ran on to talk about her job immediately and it felt like she didn’t even want to recognize that we had met. I tried to redirect the conversation as i was curious about how she perceived it. I thanked her for the time and said it was a pleasure meeting her. Her only reply was ”oh ok, how good”, and then proceeded to talk about the city we were in. I said that we would have to meet again to do all the things that we talked about this time but didn’t have time for. She didn’t really answer that. She then said that it was nice ”not being any different from speaking on the phone”. Like what!? She literally flirted the heck out of me and was very physical. I told her that i perceived some mixed signals referring to her behavior around me. She said that she was just experimenting to see if it was something there, but as soon as she got home she felt nothing. She stated that it probably had nothing to do with me. She told me that she had a crush on me some 2 months ago, but then had developed feelings for her ex and was recently rejected and heartbroken. However during our date she told me that she was going to her ex for a birthday party later the same weekend and that they had such a good friend relation now. I hadn’t heard anything about that story before either, during our plentiful calls. So i don’t know what to believe.

This got me kinda hurt as i started to really like her after our date. I also feel confused and upset as i think this was dishonest. Is this normal behaviour? Or why do people even act like this? Am i overreacting? Just some second opinion on this would be appreciated.

But, it's gotten too stressful to maintain and here's why. When I first got into a relationship with her, she'd told me about her past abuses from ex boyfriends and the molestation she received from her previous ex. I've listened to her, and comforted her as much as possible on this. We live over 100 miles apart, so it's a long distance relationship. We really liked each other when I first came over to her home back in last December after talking to her on the phone and on a dating app. We hit it off, and things are going very well. Then, when she came over to visit me and my brother over in our apartment in March, my brother immediately did not like her. He didn't say anything rude to her, but it was made obvious to her.  Then, she looked through my phone the next morning while I was showering and locked me out of my own room.

When she finally opened the door, she saw a long list of acquaintances and friends who were female and started accusing me of cheating. I told her that these were people I'm friends, acquaintances to, or hardly know them at all. Then, when she left the apartment, she kept asking what my younger brother really thought about her, and I spilled the beans because I'm a brutally honest person, I guess. She gets upset and a grudge forms between the two and her insecurities start to build up from her past significantly. She'd ask me constantly if I was going to leave her, or if I was just using her for sex, which I've explained many times to her that that is not how I feel. Those are things she'd even tell me well before she met my brother. I'd sometimes travel a couple of hours just to come sleep with her and spend time with her family during the school week and during the summer, she'd come over more often. Now, at this point in time, the feud had gotten so bad between her and my brother that she started asking personal questions about my brother, (18M), like why isn't he paying more in rent, or that her car was somehow better than his because hers was brand new and that his was a used car, stupid shit like that. She started saying that I loved my brother more than her, and I felt she'd cornered me into an awful scenario. Keep in mind that I'm on the autism spectrum, and I do not react well to stress or anxiety most of the time, and she understands this very well. This made me realize that no matter the fact I'd call and text her every day, and how I'd take her on dates, tell her she's amazing, come visit her when she's over 100 miles on days where I felt comfortable doing so, no matter how many times I'd convince her to seek therapy or other professional help for her sexual and relationship abuses, she never worked on herself and used me to distract herself from her emotional baggage.

Nothing disrespectful but when me and my friends go out we don’t sit in the corner of the party/bar/club. We get dressed up, dance, socialise and someone ends up posting it. If you (as someone who’s interested in me) are bothered to that extent, is it that hard to tell me?

We met at our office. She had a crush on me. She asked me out. We went on a few dates and eventually got into a relationship.

Now, this is the first relationship for her. She's just had distant crushes before. Whereas I've been in both serious and casual relationships before. Our kiss was the first ever kiss for her of her life.

Initially she used to tell me after our first kiss that she was scared. Eventually she started trusting me more and felt safe with my touches.

We haven't had sex( and I've never forced or pressured her). We've just discussed it.

We've gone till the third base (fingering+oral) but we stopped afterwards due to various reasons (lack of time/circumstances etc)
But she used to tease me around that if we get enough time ""she'll know she'll end up wanting to have sex"" or she teases me like ""I thought you'll go further"".

She comes from a conservative family and our nation in general has a taboo attached to sex and women's virginity in general.

She has told her parents about me and they're fine with us dating. However, last week, her mother discussed with her ""Whether you've done something with your boyfriend"" and proceeded to give a talk about how ""it's not the right age, etc"".


Now frankly I've never made my girlfriend feel uncomfortable or do something which I know she doesn't feel comfortable.

However, I've gotten enough hints that she was sexually willing. However, after the talk with her mother she started having doubts. Not just for sex but even for things we've already done before (fingering etc).

She tells me she still loves it but she's trying to curb those thoughts.

I've been trying to tell her ""Do what makes you comfortable but also don't start thinking these are bad just because elders tell us"". I love her and have no intention to force her or ditch her.

However, the fear of Sexual Intimacy, if stretched, might cause issues. Specially if she has second thoughts on stuff we've already done. I'll be fine if she doesn't want to do it because she doesn't like it. However, forcing to not do it because parents think it's wrong causes issues.

How should I balance this issue? I want to make a fine between telling her to trust her gut on what she feels comfortable and not forcefully stop herself while not coming off as someone who is talking his way to get into the bed (because I'll always want something fun done consensually).

When she does meet me, she says she can't stop herself from touching me but her mother's thoughts start making her doubt her morals.  

Would time be able to sort things out?

I am actually new to Reddit and have never posted so please excuse any lack of decorum. I think I just need to vent and this is literally the only space I have…

I (28f) just got out of a three year relationship. I am trying so hard to get back out there but it feels like there is no good way to meet people anymore…so I turned to dating apps. 

Oh my goodness. Never in my life have I ever felt so worthless. I don’t think I’m unattractive. A solid 7 for sure, maybe even and 8 with the right style. But the girls on these apps are 12s (a male friend of mine let me see his account.) I am competing against literal models. Even when I do match and start a conversation, I have never once heard back…

I also feel like everyone is looking for a travel partner with major ambitions and an active lifestyle…I am absurdly normal. I want normal things. I want someone who will watch AFV under a fuzzy blanket and create a pro con list about pasta or tacos for dinner…

I have been wanting to date seriously because I am about to turn 30 and want to get married. I’m aiming for a fulfilling relationship and intimacy is very important to me but also attracted to my partner. That’s all I’ve ever really asked for. 

I have noticed a lot of people saying, “What is going on with dating and why does it seem like no one is willing to be vulnerable enough to give a real relationship a try when they meet someone they click with. Then suddenly, you will notice they are into you one day and then the next day be distant. 

I have had enough of being the one who has to do all the work and always assumed that role when talking to someone new. I have always been met with no effort and been the one to have to keep the conversation going. 

Even in assuming that role, I always get people who do not give you anything. They will let you sit there and give all the effort like it’s some confidence booster to them. And then keep the conversation very dry. If I back off even just a little bit, I will never hear from them and the conversation will dry up. Most of the time, the conversation dries up after the first day of texting. 

All I do is ask about them. They never ask about me and don’t seem to care about me. They are just entertaining the thought and then seem to move on without any remorse. It’s every single person I have talked to. 

I stopped looking altogether because I have tried everything and in the end, I felt like I wasn’t being myself when I took advice from others. I have come on to forums like this and took their advice. I believed the problem was me because everything I asked advice for didn’t work and left me feeling like there was something wrong about me. 

And I would mention the fact that I only ever ask questions about the other person. I never double text. I try to give it time to get to know them and to try to come across as confident as possible. 

But apparently to Reddit, asking questions like: “What kind of hobbies do you enjoy” shows that I am too codependent, desperate, too easy, and ingenuine of me and I have to change every single thing of me to have better dating life. Okay??? Since when did asking questions become unattractive and so repelling to so many people?

I'm your store bread virgin fresh wizard graduate guy who never had luck with women, but I also never really tried. I had grand total of two dates during university and later two from OLD, they were all the same deal, we chatted, talked, it was nice but zero romantic or intimate atmosphere, got ghosted afterwards. On OLD my luck comes and wanes but I pretty much never match with anyone I find truly attractive to me.

Frankly not there or anywhere else I felt anyone is interested me romantically. I get it you arent supposed to get married after the first, but I never felt a spark or deeper interest and the feeling was I assume mutual. But I also have a very low sample number (other people have this much dates in a month) so it'd be stupid for me to make wide judgements. But in general coming from my interactions with women, my impression has been that no one ever tries to get closer to me, and vice-versa I never try to approach women. This stems from long list of self esteem issues - but contrary to what some might judge just reading this, I'm a fairly social dude who made conscious effort to expand my circles during college and after, so I get invited out fairly often, I have plenty of friends, pretty close ones too, I have my share of hobbies, I live on my own from a decent income in a large city, I regularly exercise yadda yadda, from outside I have everything reasonable and I think (in fact, know) several of my friends don't quite get what am I'm missing that they never see me with girls.

This summer on two occasions at separate festivals I had good friends girlfriends come up to me and straight out ask why am I not approaching women? While I'm deeply insecure about how I look I'm apparently not ugly, and I even had people tell me I should be a radio host with my voice lol (on the contrary many many years ago a girl slipped out a less than nice remark on my voice which made me feel bad about it for years).

But it's all so pointless if you don't act right? And after a recent tinder profile review, plus other half-infos I picked up over the years and just introspection, I'm starting to accept I have a vibe thats just not attractive. Its not bad per se, but boringly neutral. Not just my look but my act too. You know those guys who sure, are there but not in the zone? Thats that like to talk and do stuff but it all just feels so forced or selfish? Who don't feel natural? Those that are loud and quickly feel too much?Yeah I think that's me. But where do I go now that I realized my whole emanation is so unattractive? When your very being is so-so? And it feeds back on you like a death spiral, you feel no connection so you feel like, why bother? All my effort would come off as forced, inexperienced, weak. Even if I try, they won't like me.

It feels so trapped. Like, it doesn't matter if you self improve so many 'stats', you think you too will change but you don't. Fuck, I felt exactly the same 10 years ago, I'm still at square one, amazing. It sadly neatly explains why despite putting myself out so much, I never had the numbers smile on me, since i'm constantly multiplying my chances with a big fucking zero.

I don’t know how to make someone feel something. Like what am I supposed to do? You tell me about yourself, I tell you about me. I don’t know what questions to ask.
