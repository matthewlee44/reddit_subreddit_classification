2,p4i3g9,1628982205,The age gap double standard makes me (33M) feel undesirable and insecure,"A guy(22M) in my group of friends just started dating a woman(46F) who also hangs out with us. Despite this being a *huge* age difference, nobody really has anything negative to say about it and my friend(39F) even says she thinks they are cute together. Tbh, big age differences don't bother me personally, but I can't help but notice the double standard. If the genders were reversed, it would be considered grooming. Even I, a super young looking 33 year old, don't think I can get away with dating a 22 year old. In fact, this particular guy derided another guy(38M) as a ""groomer"" for dating girls in their late 20s. 

Unfortunately, I feel like this double standard has unconsciously rubbed off on me. Honestly, a young guy(even a teen) dating a much older woman comes off to me as exciting and fulfilling for both parties. Meanwhile, an older man dating a younger woman automatically registers in my brain as imbalanced and maybe even domineering. I don't consciously think this, but it's just my automatic feeling. And because of this, I can't help but feel undesirable because of my age and envy guys who are younger and have the opportunity to have fulfilling and exciting relationships with older women. Yeah sure I can still date older women technically, but it's not like at 23, where I could enjoy that dynamic with hot women in their 30s. To emulate that dynamic now, I'd basically have to go for women over 45-50, and even then it's not quite the same since I'm ""mature"" now. When I compare it to that experience I could be having if I was younger, dating just seems to bland and pointless right now. It's sad, because I'm matching with lots of women around my age and a bit younger and older on dating apps whom I feel very little excitement about but can't help but think of how much more exciting it would be if I was matching them as a 23 year old.

We've always had fun and great vibes, she's awkward as fuck, as am I. We kissed once at a party (both pretty drunk) and after that, we barely spoke because of COVID, but also just ""not having time"".

Recently one of my friends (that hangs out with her) told me she's still pretty in to me. After days of nervousness I finally texted her, asking her on a date for upcoming monday. She happily agreed and we decided to go to an arcade (we both love that stuff). But now I'm thinking: what the hell am I supposed to talk about? I really do not have interesting to talk to her about. 

And here's where the overthinking happens...
""She's awkward too, if I don't say anything I'm putting all the pressure on her.""
""If this doesn't go right I'll never see her again""
""What if .....""

My dating history is virtually nonexistent and I have a tendency to make stuff up to keep small talk going. With her, I don't want to. I REALLY want this to work. I have serious feelings for her and I truly feel a deep connection with her.

So, I guess what I'm asking is some tips about how to get a conversation started and keep it going smoothly. I'm sick of my pathological lying and want to do better with her. I've actually been hesitant to text her, because I feel like I get everything out before we even meet.

Great personality, extroverted, life of the party, overly generous, caring and loyal. I make north of $300k a year. I have no kids, never been married. No addictions, bad habits, or bad decisions. I  have a 3 story 5 bedroom house and I live in it alone. 


I've had a couple ""serious"" relationships that ultimately failed. All I want in life is someone loyal, good looking with a career and a brain. I'm on dating apps, I've hired professional match makers (paid well over 10k for this), been on 20-30 first dates, and still single. 


My concern is that I'm growing resentful. For example, I feel less bad for a girl in an abusive relationship than I used to, because I feel like that's what girls want. I've had many girls tell me they're attracted to a**holes and then expect me to feel bad for them.

Okay.  Rant over. Are there still decent women out there that want to be spoiled, are loyal, and want a serious, anxiety free relationship, who don't have any kids or serious issues? Seriously asking. If yes, what are you looking for that we're not providing?

Hi everyone, i’ll try to make this short. I’m very unsure about my future: i’m at the last year of high school, and i’m feeling stuck cause in 18 years i’ve never been able to make friends. 

Plus, i’ve got a very big problem: i’ve never been in a relationship. It wouldn’t be a big problem but it crushes my self esteem and knowing that my first time hasn’t come yet ( and might never come ) really makes me anxious. 

I see couples everywhere and i often ask myself “how did they get to know each other? Why does it always happen to others, and not to me?”

And i’m kind of starting to find out why. It’s probably related to my looks too ( pics on my profile ). I’m balding pretty badly, but my parents keep denying. I don’t have great looks, and surely being bald at 18 won’t help with girls. Let’s not lie… looks matter in attraction. If i knew a certain girl was attracted to me, and if i liked her back, then it’d be easier. I’m very very shy and i often stutter. Plus, my physique is not a great one… not bad either ofc.

I’m just in a dark period of my life. I see guys changing girlfriend every week, and i’m still here. Also because i don’t know where to meet girls.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p4j9a9/m18_im_very_unsure_about_my_future/

25,p4k2qw,1628989801,"He wanted to take the pressure off, stopped messaging frequently, and now that I'm reciprocating he's messaging me a bunch of random shit all the time??? How am I supposed to proceed?","I’ve (23 F) been talking to this guy (27M) for six months. We’re at a bit of a distance right now (8 hours) and from the start I’ve been saying we shouldn’t put pressure on each other in case it doesn’t work out in person etc. We have mutually expressed feelings and attraction for each other (came up quickly and intensely) but we’re waiting to establish anything committed or serious until we’ve met in person (a mutual decision...neither of us is open to an LDR without an end date). We’ve never met but even though we’ve had video calls (hours at a time) and were initially texting religiously all day every day that obviously couldn’t keep up and communication has significantly lessened. Not a problem for me – I hate being on my phone and texting isn't a big deal to me.

I was supposed to buy a ticket this week to fly out and meet him in September (have been discussing this plan for months now, repeatedly, mutually discussed and he was telling me over and over he wanted to meet me/wanted me there/asking how things were looking price wise and restriction wise and urging me to send him updates) but I held off on purchasing because I asked how he was doing this past week/if anything was on his mind. We had hardly spoken/messaged (which was a drastic shift from the week prior) and he wound up telling me he’s feeling overwhelmed with his life right now and doesn’t want us to hype anything up or put pressure on anything, acting like it was something I’d never said before. I reiterated what we’d already agreed on after he expressed concern at “long distance”. And then I gave him space because it seemed like his stress from other areas of life was bleeding into his feelings towards our interactions.

I stopped messaging him if I hadn’t heard from him, only texted him if he messaged me first. This was not to be petty – he said the upcoming week was going to be ridiculously busy and said he would try to call next week because he needed to talk to me about something (didn’t specify what but made it seem like a big deal). All of a sudden a week later from that ominous message this weekend he’s been messaging me a bunch of random, silly stuff? And when I don’t respond, he’ll tack on something else unrelated. Not asking questions or trying to have convos, just drunk texts or photos of him drinking and visiting with his friends. It’s not entirely out of the ordinary (he would drunk message me before/send pics of his days) but I just have no idea what’s going on. The tone shifts have been awkward and confusing, and it just seems like I’m waiting around until next week when he finds the time to clue me in on what’s happening.

I don’t know what to say to half of the random texts he sends me and so my responses have been minimal. He’s not asked after me in over two weeks. When I ever did volunteer what I was up to he’d almost immediately move onto another subject. Not initially but as time’s gone on that’s how it’s been. I’m annoyed already and we’re not even anything. It’s getting to the point that I don’t even know if I want to fly out because it feels like I'm just someone he's trying to get attention from than someone he's interested in getting to know anymore. I’m just not sure what to do because there’s been no communication going on and his difficulty managing all the stress in his life made me feel like I couldn’t bring up anything remotely serious until next week if he deigns to make space for that conversation he mentioned.

33,p4kvkx,1628993092,I like a younger guy and I'm not sure if I should act on it.,"I (26F) currently have a crush on a guy (19M) that I work with. I didn't know he was that young when I first took notice of him. I'm certain that the crush is mutual, however I'm not sure what to do about it, or if I should even act on it at all because of the age difference. We don't work in the same department or anything so there's no major work related power dynamic that comes into play, but I'm definitely currently more established than he is (not looking for marriage or anything like that so I'm not too worried that would be an issue, at least not on my part).

The main problem is that I look younger than I am so I don't think he's realized what my actual age is and I only know his because some guys at work want to throw a surprise for his 20th birthday next month. I don't know him well enough to know just how different we are in maturity and he seems pretty mature outwardly for his age, but at his age I wouldn't be surprised if the difference was major. I'm not sure if I should acknowledge his feelings and give it all a go to find out.

And to make things worse, there's a 20yr old woman at work that likes him and seems pretty jealous whenever she sees me with him. He's flirted with her before in front of me but it's always been friendly and I've never felt jealous or insecure about it because 1) we're not together and 2) I have a flirty personality as well so I don't see any deeper meaning behind it. But there's been instances where we would be talking and she'd place herself right in the middle of us like a jealous gf. She also follows him around a lot and is always glaring at me when he brushes her off to talk/hang out with me. She essentially tries to give the impression that they're dating/in a relationship through her actions towards him, which he's apparently admitted to the other guys in the office makes him uncomfortable. I only know this because they've talked about it in front of me and I have a feeling the guys keep mentioning stuff like this specifically when I'm around because they know about his crush (I've seen them whispering and nudging him when I walk by and stuff like that).

He's a really nice guy but idk if the age difference + the drama of a potential one-sided cat fight with a girl is worth it. I've previously only ever dated guys my age or older so I don't even know what to expect when dating someone that much younger.

34,p4kwfe,1628993191,Longing for a connection,"Hello, I am a 24M who just graduated college. I’ve been in 3 serious relationships and a couple of FWBs in my life but recently I’ve hit a dry spell. Especially with COVID it’s insanely hard to meet people other than dating apps. My last relationship was 8 months ago and it only lasted a month so I don’t really count it as significant in any way. I feel like at where I’m at in my life, it would be nice to have someone to share it with. I do still shoot my shot at any girl i find attractive but they usually turn out to be not what I expected or it just isn’t reciprocated. My family lives far away and my friends are usually only free on the weekends, and since I work remotely I spend the majority of my time alone at home. My only other activities are hitting the gym after work and a gaming session with my friends so it would be nice to have some of my abundant alone time shared with someone I enjoy being with and care about. I honestly feel lonelier than ever, and even though I would never show it I’m starting to sense the desperation creeping in. 

P.S. I’m using this as a means to vent and I wanted to talk about it somehow, I’m not much of a redditor.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p4kwfe/longing_for_a_connection/
35,p4kyg9,1628993410,It's so weird. Is she interested or not?,"
TLDR: Matched with a very interesting woman, left our first conversation halfway, i deemed she's not interested, i try to engage again smoothly to which she responded, then went offline again, and responded to my instagram stories, and left the conversation again without opening my DMs. I'm not sure if she's busy, disinterested or playing games. 


I'll try to summarise this as much as i can

So i matched with this girl who i found really interesting. So far the most interesting match I've gotten. Getting a match itself is rare in it of itself so this one seems like a catch.

I started the conversation, asking her about her dream job in her bio, to which she replied. I then went over to her linked Instagram account and introduced myself as her match. Conversation went pretty good. 

Red flags (?):

She smokes

Her page is focused on her. An entire highlight of just her pictures with filters. She obviously knows she's pretty

Prefers hanging around guys because girls are drama

When i talked about other girls in a particular workforce that I'm in, she went ""wow they must be really pretty right?"", Which is something i believe only girls who are jealous of their boyfriends do after a few months into the relationship. Is she just trying to find some validation from me? Is she expecting me to say that she's pretty? Or is it a genuine question?


I'm not sure if these are red flags but they're interesting pointers to be made.

So i decided to still go ahead with the conversation because she seemed quite cool, and engaging in the conversation, which some girls aren't. 

Suddenly halfway through the conversation, from instant replies to my texts, she went offline. I took it as her being busy, which is fine. She didn't leave my text on read, so which really most likely means she's genuinely busy. 

Fast forward to the next day's afternoon, i thought to myself ""can't be she's not awake yet and can't even reply to yesterday's text"". 

I decided to ""poke"" her with a ""my flirting was so good i made her speechless"", which is way way way better in my opinion than a ""hey good afternoon, why aren't you replying?"", Which seems really desperate. 

So few hours later, she sent a laughing emoji and said good afternoon. I asked her, ""were u on night shift last night?"", as a joke as she's still a student, but she said she has a dream job as a night shifter, To which she went offline again, for the entire day. 


I went on with my day, went for a haircut and had a crazy day where i fell in the saloon in front of all the customers. I posted this in my Instagram stories which she still follows. She then replied ""I'm so engrossed in your stories 😂"", to which i ask ""which part is the best part?"", To which she went offline again. At least she didn't leave me on seen which i think is possibly worse as it shows disinterest and that she's ignoring me. 

I'm really confused whether she's interested or not, as she seems to still be engaging in my Instagram stories, even having voted on my poll regarding a haircut i should get. But she keeps going offline often and not responding to my texts, but sent me a text regarding my Instagram story, and still follows me. She also said that none of her okc matches talk to her and in the end called her a catfish. 

This morning, which is my third day of text with her, i asked her out to which she didn't open the DM again. My first text which was a ""ikr"", to a reply to her text regarding my story, she left on seen. The following texts regarding asking her out, she didn't read but went offline. 

I'm not desperate nor insecure, there's many possibilities that are in my head such as her maybe having other matches, being busy, being disinterested, or even possibly playing games with me. I'm just really confused as she complained about matches ignoring her, but is doing the same thing to me. At this point, I've accepted the fact that I'm just one of her followings (I don't follow her anymore to make sure I don't get distracted thinking about this whole thing, and checking her account again and again to see if she's online). 

I watched a video on woman psychology and an interesting point that could be a possibility of what she's doing is something women do which is to ""test"" the man to expose his insecurities or desperation, usually by pulling away and not being engaging. 

Of course life still goes on no matter. My self-worth doesn't depend on whether this one girl deems me worthy of her interest. She has the right to choose who she wants to be with and spend her time on",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p4kyg9/its_so_weird_is_she_interested_or_not/

So, I'm just casually talking to the two bartenders because it's the start of their shift and the bar is pretty empty other than me and my one coworker.

58,p4mo88,1629000728,Feeling like I'm trash and worthless and will never love or be loved and I'll die alone,"I feel dead inside, I feel tired, I feel weary, jealous bitter and resentful. I'm 31(m), never dated, never had a relationship and never had sex in my life, and now I'm just a big 'ole walking red flag because of it. I feel ugly all the time, I'm short and bald and I don't do beards or facial hair at all, I shave clean daily because it feels much better to me. I don't have much money, I work a retail job and I never got the chance to go to college so I missed out on the college experience and I obviously never went to grad school, so now I'm uneducated and stupid for my age and feel looked down on because of it. I die on the inside when I see couples at work daily, it makes me sad and jealous and bitter that they get to shop and spend time together and have fun while I'm stuck at work on the weekends as per usual.  


I even tried to hang out with coworkers to try and get out more, but I didn't feel any happier or better being with them. I still felt lonely and I felt like a creep because they were younger than me to boot, not to mention that I started crushing on one of them, but knew it wouldn't happen and it shouldn't because she's too young for me(She just turned 21, I'm 31), so now I can't even hang out with her because it hurts too much  


As a guy, I resent being told the same old, that I have to be outgoing, confident, have a brilliant personality and have 8 billion friends and hobbies. The pressure and burden to initiate and approach is completely all on me and I'm also expected to shrug off the dozens, hundreds, possibly even thousands of rejections like they're nothing, I'm not allowed to be vulnerable, to show fear, vulnerability, I'm not allowed to be human and cry over things or feel anything about everything.  


I've recently come to the realization that I'm a submissive man, I'd much rather my partner take charge, be the confident and assertive one in the relationship while I'd fall into a more supporting role where I help and support her in anyway I can. The expectations thrust onto me are ironically the traits and qualities that I find appealing in women for a potential partner(assertive, dominant, confident but still loving, sweet and empathetic and patient), I no longer want to be seen as a macho dude or assumed that I automatically have no feelings or emotions just because I'm a man. I recently made a thread detailing these feelings in this sub and I was constantly insulted and mocked by both men and women, called a wimp, a loser, a sissy, the male equivalent of their girlfriend PMS'ing, it was extremely upsetting and hurtful to me but I have no where else to unload this emotional baggage, so here I am again.  


I've never known what it's liked to be touched, to be desired, to be wanted, the feelings of sexual and romantic intimacy and it's left me feeling deeply shamed, lonely and disgusted with myself. I'm so tired of people acting like being single is this fun and liberating thing, I'm sure it is after dating someone and knowing that you'll just end up in another whenever you want, that's how it is for many but for me it's been a deeply lonely experience. I'm tired of being told that sex and relationships aren't that big a deal when clearly they are or else people wouldn't want sex or be in relationships in the first place, people frequently proclaim that they couldn't have made it without their partner being there and supporting them, why do they get to have that but not me?  


I've been treated like shit my whole life by most people, I was poked fun at, teased, laughed at or shamed for crying or showing emotions that weren't considered manly, I've been depressed since I was 15, in my early 20s I was traumatized by a group of people I thought were friends but they also made fun of me, poked fun at me, talked about me behind my back etc.  


Everyone else dates, everyone else has relationships, everyone else has sex and love and intimacy, meanwhile I still get shamed daily, told that I need to fix all my problems, move on and just 'deal' with things like they were no problem at all. As a man I can't ever just get validation and support, instead I have people acting like my emotions and feelings are just fun little puzzles to solve for their amusement.   


I get told that I'm not entitled to love or sex....by people that attain the very same things. I get told to learn to be happy on my own and fix all my problems before dating and seek therapy. Alright, so let's first assume that I can even afford therapy, because as we all know, mental health in the US has been famously well funded, extremely affordable and very accessible. But even if I do start seeing a therapist, it's literally 40 mins every week, what am I suppose to do in the mean time? Stare at a wall? Twiddle my thumbs until my therapist has proclaimed that I'm healthy and cured enough to go out and seek relationships? I wasted over a decade of my life being alone and lonely and now I get told to continue living alone and being lonely until I'm happy and stable. Why do I have to tackle all of this alone and by myself while everyone else has SO's and a support network, it feels extremely unfair. I know life is unfair and in a capitalist system like the one we live, unfairness is systemic and by design to boot, but It feels like I got the short end of the shitty stick.  


I have no hope for my future, I have no self-esteem right now, I have no reason to feel valued or valid, I feel weak and pathetic and I know that I'll likely get razed on by trolls or given patronizing and condescending and unsolicited advice. I'll get told to get over my pain, quit feeling entitled and just stop being all of this, I know it's coming

63,p4n3lz,1629002652,How to ask girl out after 'work' related coffee catch up,"So, there's this girl who's studying at University, she reached out to me for a coffee catch up (shes 24 btw)over linkedin, we caught up over coffee and discussed her career aspirations etc. I basically asked her to send through her resume and cover letter so I could send it off to my manager (Im 28 btw).

During our coffee, I gave her several pointers on improving her resume, however once I received it, it still had a few missing things. I kindly asked her if it was okay if I modified her resume (fixed some errors in grammar etc, put in some key phrases) and she accepted them thanking me. Anyways I sent this off to my manager about a week ago... But I dont think it'll eventuate to anything because we're pretty full in terms of workers there. 

I like this girl, she's sweet and appears kind, but I'm afraid she might have just wanted to catch up professionally. Now I'm stumped on how I can properly ask her out, considering shes expecting to gain a 6 week internship at the company I work at... Is there anyway of properly asking her out? What would you guys recommend? I was thinking of giving her a call and just asking her if she wanted to catch up again for coffee? But its awkward because she may think I won't get her into the intership if she says no.

Tricky situation.. But I think I really like her (like want ger to go out with me long term type of thing)

For a longgg time it was related to my intelligence, my personality, humor, etc., but for the past 10 months it's almost always been about my body. I've been going to the gym for a while, but only took it seriously within the last year. I've built some respectable numbers for my age (210 bench, 425 deadlift, 395 squat), but I can't get over the insecurity around how I look. I can even vividly remember when it started - last year, I was with a few friends one guy (who's my gym partner and one of my best friends) and two girls, one of whom I had had a massive crush on in the past, but got rejected (strangely the only real crush I've had to date, which freaks me out a little). They ended up using my friend as a model for an art piece since he has visible muscle definition/abs, and I just remember thinking how worthless I am that I don't have those things. To me, it feels like I need to look better and be more aesthetic just to be worthy of being allowed to have love, like if I don't look like a Greek god I should just be eliminated from the gene pool. I know that this is super toxic and harmful to me, and what's even crazier is I don't believe that for anyone else, but it's something that sticks with me. I feel like until I'm perfect, I'm not worthy of being loved, and so I have to keep getting better before I finally find the person that makes everything worth it. What the fuck do I even do about this? It's honestly incredibly painful, when all I want is to have feelings for someone and actually have a reciprocative, healthy relationships.

I went through my last breakup 3 months ago where the woman was NPD and the discard was brutal. Because of what I felt was a demonic experience with this person overall I became religious. My religious belief now has me abstaining from sex until marriage and only getting married if I plan to have children. I worked hard in my 20s and lost my wealth in marriage from my early 30s. Now at 37 I have very little wealth. So now I would need to build wealth all over and risk it with a new person if I was even lucky enough to meet a great woman. Women were ruined in my 30s and if you ask if I’m salty I absolutely am. So faced with this reality I am trying to decide the fate of the second half of life.

So…to the point, I’ve dated about +or- 15 women since the divorce. Out of those, I have noticed one thing (Keep in mind, I’ve ended it with all of them so this isn’t a sob story) excluding four of them. If I am genuinely myself, no not a pushover, just truly myself, it goes well and I get laid and all that bullshit. But here’s the kicker (a majority of them), when I sort of set them aside they lose their minds. Text me constantly, want attention and generally throw their clothes off. I hate this. I want to just be myself and love on them, tell them how I feel and most importantly, love how I know how to love someone . So I guess what I’m saying is..well idk actually. Maybe I’m just venting or maybe I haven’t found the right girl. But I hate that girls enjoy being treated shitty. What happened to human beings.

72,p4nvon,1629006337,I’ve been on dating apps for a little over a week and I’ve already unmatched so many guys I’ve lost count,"Am I in the wrong here/overreacting?

I’m a woman in my mid 20s who is trying to dip her toes in the world of dating (after some…tough experiences/anxieties in my earlier 20s) and yeah…it’s really tough. While I don’t have a hard time getting matches, they’re not panning out. Like at all.

Here are the experiences that I’ve had that ultimately made me decide to unmatch…

* Matching with someone on Bumble and sending that first message, but then getting one word responses (seriously…why guys do this???). One of the conversations was literally like this:

&gt; Me: Hey how’s your weekend been?

&gt; Him: Good

&gt; Me: That’s great to hear! I see you went to Spain last year, what was your favorite city?

&gt; Him: Madrid

&gt; Me: *unmatched the dude*

* Guys suggesting we meet up, then making vague date plans and flaking when trying to establish the logistical details of the date

* Guys stopping any sort of response after the first couple of messages or so

* Guys pressuring me to come over to their apartment like right then and there and ghosting when I suggest an alternate time/a public location 

Variations of this scenario has happened so many times that I’m honestly disheartened. I feel like while I don’t have a hard time getting matches and a few superficial messages with some of these matches, I can tell I’m not really “number 1” for any of these guys. I just get the vibe that they like me enough to not “let me go”, but that they’re holding out for something better (probably someone more conventional looking and blonde maybe?).

Anyways, any tips to not lose heart? It’s really been affecting my self esteem, especially because according to Reddit as long as you’re fit and young and reasonably attractive you should be drowning in “prospects”. But that’s def not the case. I also see Reddit dudes often say things like, “Maybe you’re not good looking enough for these guys.” But that makes me wonder…what can I do except literally get plastic surgery at this point and make myself look like those Instagram girls (while I’m pretty I def don’t look like an influencer)?

83,p4p9rh,1629013435,"Becoming sexually and romantically attracted to people who ""let you"" be yourself","I’ve been reflecting a lot recently. I’ve always known that I’ve struggled to be myself and to let people really know me. I suspect I’m insecure avoidant – I find I’m constantly not wanting to “burden” others with my feelings and problems, being vulnerable is hard and I’ve generally built a façade of pseudo-independence.

It gets really draining, feeling like I cannot be vulnerable or open up (even though I want to). I’ve noticed that with all the people I’ve felt an emotional connection to and therefore become attracted to (I also think I'm demisexual... so many labels haha), they all had something about them that made me feel like I could “drop the performance” and that I’d be safe to be myself around them. It’s a rarity that I find people I feel I can be myself around. These people tend to have traits of being laidback, non-judgmental and sensitive. They also tend to be slightly odd or endearingly awkward in some ways, similar to me. And then it’s like a chicken and egg situation – the more I start liking them, the more I want to be open and myself around them, because they deserve to see that side of me. And then the more I can be open and myself around them, the more I start liking them. With some other people, I think to myself “they don’t deserve to know me like that” and “I’m not safe to open up to them because they’ve shown they are judgmental” and so I’m forced to perform when I’m around them and maintain a certain façade which gets draining, and this in turn makes me dislike and resent them, and the dislike and resentment of them makes me want to remain closed off.

I started to chat with a girl on Bumble and quickly it was intense and cool with her. We send each other a lot of messages and everything seem truly great with her.  We talk for 1 week before plan a date and it was yesterday evening.  


So we took a drink in a nice bar at 18h30, because she has another party after that. The date was perfect, she seems happy, laughing, sharing a lot of things. During the drink, she saw my over-shirt and start wearing it for the joke and ask me if she could keep it for tonight, she told me that she will bring  back the shirt at our next date, so I said ""Yes"", I would be happy to see her again.   
So it's 22h30 and she leaves me to catch up her friends with my jacket. She sends me a message 10mn after to say to me that was an excellent date and she will be happy to see me again with an emoji red heart !!!!! So imagine, I was already imagine so much things with her.  


BUT NOW,  the saddest part... At 3AM she sends me a image, first I didn't identify what was the object, and it was a hair pin that she founds in my over-shirt pocket and it was definitely not mine and I had no idea why it was here, I didn't wear this jacket for years.  
So I message back :  
""Oh that's akward ! I have no idea why it's here. It piss me off because you will think I'm not a serious guy now""  


Since that message, I have no news and I don't know how to repair this mistake and to have her trust again.

90,p4qixt,1629020601,Relationships or Therapist?,"I (30M) have been on dates with a fair share of girls, most of whom I have met online in recent covid years. The reason for the high number is I am not emotionally attracted to those girls which talk about themselves all the time and it seems to be a constant theme. The most recent being a (26F).

I live in Berlin but I'm pretty sure it's like this in most places as I've seen posts about this often. It seems most woman out there just needs someone to asks them questions about themselves so they can begin talking about themselves and invest very little in return, forgetting that there is actually 2 people in a relationship. Now I only say most woman because I've only dated woman and most of which are like this. 

Regardless of gender, it seems as though there is a burning need to talk about oneself without any provocation of doing so, meaning even if I don't ask her any questions she would still constantly talk about herself. On the odd occasion where she does ask me a question, she interrupts my answer to answer her own question about herself. I've heard that this might be a way of getting the guy to like them but I assure you that it is not. It is actually quite the opposite and a massive turn off. 

Now I would rather someone be real with me and not be fake and pretend like they care about me when they don't, I mean someone's true colours will show in due time so I don't see the point. But it wouldn't kill to ask a question or two about the other person, it doesn't even need to be good question, just something like ""how's your day?"" Or ""what have you been up to?"" to show that they care. God forbid the girl gives a compliment. Maybe I'm too old fashioned and expect some affection from my partner.

I actually brought this up with the girl I was recently seeing and she said that she just expected me to share this information. But first of all I'm not that kind of person and I think alot of guys aren't good at sharing emotions or talking about themselves (granted, some definitely are). Second of all it feels like I would be treating the relationship as my personal therapy sessions. I agree that a healthy relationship is one where both parties share intimate things about themselves... Eventually. However I've always thought that it would be through actually caring and asking questions rather than forced rambling about their lives and experiences.

93,p4qs9c,1629021949,"Improving yourself doesn't guarantee you won't get rejected and you shouldn't continuously ""improve"" yourself in order to date people","I am so tired of this. I understand a lot of people don't work on themselves and that may be a reason they get rejected. But whenever someone posts anything online about rejection or literally anything wrong in their dating life they get the advice to improve themselves even though nobody actually knows the person who posted and if they actually need to improve something. If you are someone who is actually working on themselves and you have been doing it for years you don't want to hear that because it's like basically saying ""you are never good enough"".

Firstly, everything is subjective when it comes to dating, including improvement. If you change your hairstyle you could see it as improvement and lots of people may love it, but for a lot of people that will be a turn off. The same thing applies to every other thing about yourself. So, you can never be liked be everyone. And the people you are into may like different things, so there is no point to change yourself, because you can't match everyone's type anyway.

Secondly, you should never change yourself to be liked by anyone other than yourself. If each time you get rejected you believe it was because you weren't good enough and you must ""improve"" you are basically using someone's approval to value yourself. You shouldn't do that. You have to understand that what you consider to be the ideal version of yourself will not match what other people may think that version is. 

And if you continuously get rejected even if you are actively working on yourself can mean that you didn't make enough progress, but it can also be that you are attracted to people that are into different things. Maybe you are blonde and the guy you like prefers brunettes. Does that mean you should change your hair color? Maybe you are adventurous and the girl you are interested in likes guys who are not like that.

95,p4r8gr,1629024361,Fed up of mindless texting!,"This might just be me, but I’m very people orientated and read and pick up vibes quite well. 

I find most people I match with, or even meet in person and then exchange numbers just end up wanting to me pen pals. I’m sooooo fed up of ‘what you up to today, how’s your day been, what you got planned for later’ literally just mindless conversation. 

I want to know if there’s a spark, and it doesn’t matter if there isn’t, but I’d rather know sooner. Plus, I find conversation goes to die in texts before meeting. 

I’m quite forward and I’ll usually say, I much prefer conversation in person, would you like to go for a coffee? And most men are okay, but some put it off and then want to keep incessantly texting. I’m sorry if you’re lonely or not sure or whatever but I literally have no interest in mindless conversation!! At least after you’ve met, there’s more investment in the conversation and there’s more to talk about. Until then, I reaaaaaaallly don’t care what you’re having for tea.

Anyone else feel this way or am I just hella impatient?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p4r8gr/fed_up_of_mindless_texting/
96,p4rgfn,1629025516,Should we [19M][17F] start our first relationship ever if I'll [19M] be moving abroad to study in two months?,"Hey guys, this is the story. 

I met a girl through mutual friend and we really enjoyed our time at this party in a club. I noticed that she likes me, and to be honest, I like her too. 
The biggest problem is that I'll be moving abroad to start my university in two months, and thus am uncertain of whether or not to pursue a relationship with her. I'm 19 and never was in a relationship (mostly because I wasn't mature enough until recently), she's 17 and also never had a relationship (age of consent is 15 in my country). 
My philosophy since I got more mature (since 18 yo) was not to date until I move abroad so I don't catch feelings and regret it later, but with this girl, everything got messy and I started to think about a summer fling, enjoying my last two months before departure. 
Have in mind that we're both virgins, and in this case, if it ever comes to this, we'll be losing it to someone we don't love (unless relationship develops at an unimaginable rate). As of now, I don't see a future for this potential relationship when I move abroad (since I'll be coming back 1-2 times a year), but I'm afraid that we would catch feelings since we're inexperienced and new to this, and start a long distance thing.

I'd really appreciate your advice of what to do.

98,p4rhu4,1629025715,I’m moving for work and things just started getting serious with a guy,"I (24F) and this guy (27M) have been seeing each other casually since November last year. In the last 3-4 months things have started getting more serious and we’ve admitted that we like each other. About 2 months ago my dream job was advertised and I applied for it not thinking I’d get it. He told me to apply for it and has been really supportive through the whole thing. Now that I’ve got it and have to move, I’m not sure what to do about us. We’ve said that we’ll miss each other, that we still want each other in our lives and that we’d like to see each other when we’re in town (it’ll happen now and again) and he said that he would have thought about moving with me if he hadn’t just started a new job. Even though we’ve said all this, I’m still not sure where that leaves us. I don’t want to ask for anything more because that’s just me being selfish and not fair on him, which I’ve told him. Should I just see how it goes or is that just going end up being too hard?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p4rhu4/im_moving_for_work_and_things_just_started/
99,p4riev,1629025801,She says we are not a couple.,"I started dating for a month with this girl who had recently ended a 3-year relationship that ended quite badly. At first she didn't pay much attention to me, but after we went on vacation with mutual friends, things started to evolve. She often takes me in her arms for no reason, holds my hand or even kisses me in front of our friends and she behaves as if we were a couple. But when I asked her if we were together, she replied that she needed a break from relationships after all the suffering of the last 3 years.

I don't know if I should give her more time and continue what is happening now or end ""this relationship"" between us.

How do you think it would be fairer to proceed in this situation?

 Honestly, I don't feel good living with uncertainty.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p4riev/she_says_we_are_not_a_couple/
