I’m in no rush for one, and so I don’t pressure any guy I’m seeing for it. However, I’ve noticed a trend with guys I and my friends date. They want the “girlfriend experience,” but without the commitment.

What this means is that they want you to just see them, have sex with them, date them, etc., without being in a relationship. Essentially, this means you have no commitment, and they could go be with other people with no problem.

These guys are not “alpha males.” They can be short, average looking, whatever. In fact, the average guys seem to be the worst with this!

What’s maddening is that they don’t understand why I won’t date them for three-six months and give them sex with no commitment. 

I’ve only fallen for this once, with a guy I was seeing post-breakup. He wanted to take it slow and get to know each other before dating, which I agreed with. However, soon, he began whining and whining to have sex. For six months. I never did, but as soon as I said no deep kissing or other intimate things (no oral sex, but heavy rubbing) until we got to know each other better, he said we’d be better off as friends. Then immediately tried to be FWB.

Earlier this year, I started dating someone who respected my personal beliefs, and began a relationship with me after we got to know each other. Even though I ended things after two or three months (he had some financial issues), the experience with that was SO much better for me and him than if we had gone back and forth for four to six months.

There was so much less risk this way. Every time I chat with someone on a dating app who wants to hook up “before” a relationship, I block.

2020 was rough. I dated a toxic guy who treated me like shit. I let him ghost me 4 times and each time I fought for him harder. Now that I think of it, I don’t think I even liked him that much. However, the fact that he didn’t treat me well, made me fight for him even more. I felt undesired and disrespected, so I wanted to prove to myself and him that I was worth it. Sadly, he ended up sexually assaulting me one day. 

Fast forward couple months, I finally felt ready to date again. Thank you therapy and my wonderful friends. I am now dating someone I love deeply. Not only is he reassuring, he respects me in a way that I have never felt before. He had easily become one of the most important people in my life. When I opened up to him about the sexual assault, he was surprised, but simply accepted me and listened. Furthermore, when I had a mental breakdown about it, he just listened to me. Outside of that, he is such a good listener and makes me laugh like no other. I’m meeting his family this weekend and I am nervous but so glad I get to meet the people who made him to be today. I am so full of love and feel so loved. Life works in mysterious ways people. Don’t close yourself from good people. And if someone makes you cry, run from it.

I realized that being anything but sales person, manager or a ""CEO"" (read self-employed ""hustler"" with no employees) puts you in an unenviable position on dating apps. At least here, girls want consultants. Sales guys with ego bigger than their brain.

I am an avarage looking woman at best, but I am not ugly, like most girls do, I get a lot likes, anywhere between (10 to 100 per day althought the 100 happened a few times only tbh I was surprised) anyways, most of them were from creeps over 40, but I did found some interesting guys in that pool, I tried to never match with more than 5 guys at the same time so I could maintain personalized conversations and not feel overwhelmed. Anyways, from what I have read in here, I tried to be proactive, not leaving all the burden to the guys. When I talked about shared hobbies it wasn't like ""oh I enjoy that too"" I explained why I liked it an my opinions in the matter, how I came to like or find such and such, and conversation wise it seemed to be working, my first date was amazing, we spent the night together but that was a mistake on my part, a few days later I asked him out again, we went out, spend the night together again and the morning after he dumped me, cool times. I tried to shake that off and kept going, mostly the rapport I build with guys was about videogames, they were honestly excited I liked a lot of the same things and actually knew what I was talking about. Music and movies was a great hit as well and I tried to keep comversations short 3-4 days before I ASKED THEM OUT for a coffee, and they all said yes. Each time I was super excited because conversations were easy, fluid and they all seemed happy I had asked them out, one even said to me he was coming back home after getting a haircut and buying a new shirt because he was THAT excited about it...3 days before the date he stops replying, then the following 2 attempts I made literally blocked me the day after I asked them out and they said yes. The 4th one also ghosted me, this shook my confidence and self esteem pretty badly, I erased all my profiles (2) and have been feeling like crap for a few days now.

I feel that might be my case and I just can't see how the hell I manage to scare this guys off  so quickly that I don't even get an explanation.

I never kissed her during that time. I know, I know. I'm an idiot, she thinks I'm gay, etc. But I resolved to let her set the pace with kissing and being intimate. 

Here's why: In my past relationships I tended to move too fast with physical intimacy, and my relationships often turned into fwb type situations before fizzling to nothing. We had the physical connection without the emotional one. With her I wanted to build an emotional bond before establishing a physical one. I overcorrected. Also, she's religious and a virgin. So I wanted to treat her respectfully and move more slowly. I thought that she would appreciate that - I was wrong. Long story short, she never made the move and neither did I. Then she broke up with me because she didn't believe that we have as much physical chemistry as we should.

But the thing is, I'm really attracted to her. I was just way too hesitant to make any moves. I think that she was very attracted to me as well, but she's a more submissive person with this type of thing. Things are now over between us, but I still have a lot of strong feelings for her. 

So I guess I have two questions: 

1. If you were in a relationship with someone who was a bit passive when it came to physical intimacy, would you make a move yourself, or would you walk away? I know that this will be different for different people. But I'd just like to hear some outside perspective. I expected my ex to make a move herself. 

2.

The night rolls around and I'm on my way to the restaurant we agreed on. I arrive on time and I see her but as I begin to approach her outside the restaurant entrance I notice she has a weird expression on her face. I don't think to much about it and just assume it's her anxiety. I giver her the typical greeting and hug, tell her she looks incredible and compliment her prada heels that were honestly works of art. I'm about to suggest we head in to sit at our table and she stop me and tells me that she has somewhere else she needs to be. I'm a bit taken back but she says she wanted to tell me earlier but I was already on my way and she felt it better to let me know in person. 

I'm not an idiot so I ask her ""look, do you really have somewhere to be or am I not what you were expecting? because if there's somewhere you're needed then I don't want to keep you but if it's me, we should just not waste each others time."" She takes a couple seconds to reply but admits that it was me and I wasn't what I looked like in my photos. I thought this was odd since they're normal photos but I don't let it get to me and take her at her word. I let her know it's fine and that I also feel bad for making her come all the way here after taking the time to dress up. I ask her how she got here, she says uber so I ask if I can pay for her uber ride home. I truly felt bad. 

She hesitates to accept my offer but then accepts and I summon the uber. As we're waiting she says a few times that she also feels really bad for this and that she hopes I'm not annoyed. I remain honest as I'm a pretty chilled guy and reply with ""I'm a little gutted. You're very beautiful and it would have been nice to get to know you but I'm not your type so it is what it is."" She doesn't reply and just looks kinda sad. The uber pulls up and as I open the door for her to hop in she gives me this weird look but this time it's an anxious, hesitant look as if she didn't want to go but it was definitely too late to go on with the date. She hops in nonetheless and I jokingly tell the driver to ""keep her safe precious cargo on board."" she smiles and the driver laughs. As I close the door, I keep thinking of the hesitant look she gave and say ""text me when you get home so i know you're safe"" she replies with ""I will"". 

I get back home, hear my phone buzz. I read the text ""I'm home, thank you for getting me a ride back. I'm sorry for tonight."" I reply with a simple ""No worries, time to rethink my photos I guess."" I go to sleep but the next morning, well late morning for me. I wake up to another text and it's her asking if I'd be willing to meet up with her again in the next couple days. I don't really know what to say as she did express that I was not at all her type but at the same time after talking I did sense she was hesitant to leave but at the time thought this was just be inhaling large amounts of copium.

But please. I don't things like laughter or say anything like I am only complaining... I really seek helpful advice.

I broke up with my ex 4 months ago. Our relationship lasted only 4 months....

I had until now a really hard time emotion wise. I could overcome my sorrow thanks God. I tried to date again, but I am introvert and really shy. I don't like to speak with girls that just pop up on the street. I tried online dating and got many matches. From German girls or Romanian(m nationality) girls, but it seemed that I am really boring or at least this is what some girls told me. I am more the humble, modest and quiet guy. I like to enjoy the time in peace and have a relaxing chat.

But many didn't write me back after 1 day. I don't fear speaking to women, but I really have a hard time to keep a discussion alive with women. Physically I speak with women only by opportunity like when more people meet or most of the times online. I also saw that with many I didn't have any type of resonance. I like to read about IT, but also feed my thirst of information with facts from different topics like history, theology, geography or languages. I am a nerd I guess....

I also don't to drink and smoke at all! I don't go to nightclubs, disco, pubs or clubs. In my honest opinion I think I should spend my time with the nature by biking, taking long walks with a backpack with water and a snack.

I wish to live my life with moral values like being helpful, honest, respectful, friendly. I have this thirst and hunger to always reach my goals. Right now I am unemployed because of COVID-19; but I succeeded in achieving my technical degree in IT and now if I am unemployed I used my potential to make some Sysadmin courses and find another job, even better paid!

I know I have my downsides as well and I am not perfect, but I really don't in finding a fitting girlfriend for me.

I can tell you how I treated my ex(she was my first love). I always watched her in the eyes, smiled, hugged and told her what a huge treasure she is for me, that I loved her and always offered emotional support on phone or by being with her physically. I never went empty-handed and always brought her something. Never forgot about her. We used to close the lights, wait for the night and turn the radio on playing music. We hugged and slowly danced.

When I see this, I recall the mistake I made when I got settled into a relationship my early twenties without any significant dating history, and eventually got married. Although I don’t regret it, we were together for 15 years and had several good years where we were in love, looking back my lack of experience at times made me (and likely her as well) dissatisfied, and was a factor in my eventual divorce.

I met her when I was 22 and she was twenty. I had only had sex with two girls prior, and no true relationships. She was the first attractive woman who paid any significant attention to me. After we had been together for several years, I proposed, because I thought that’s what you did if you are with someone who checks most of your boxes. If I was honest with myself, I wanted to date more women.

As I got older, this itch became greater. I stayed faithful physically, but mentally I was constantly lusting after other women. It was unhealthy, and didn’t help me be the most present and best husband I could be. I also needed to do some work on myself, which I didn’t realize at the time.

This wasn’t the sole reason I got divorced, but this pervasive emotional distance was a factor.

I’m not advocating for throwing away a good relationship so you can sleep around, or be a fuckboy seeking constant validation from as many women as possible.

However, I do believe that everyone should have an extended period of their lives where they date for just for fun, to see what they like, to gain sexual experience and confidence, without a serious relationship as the objective.

This way, if you enter into a relationship with someone, it’s because you are genuinely excited to be with them, not out neediness or a belief that you won’t find someone else.

Additionally, you wont be as eager to please and be a pushover, because you have confidence you can find others out there if things fall apart. An abundance mindset is much easier this way.

We've known each other for 3 years and we always had some sort of chemistry. At the park she was giving every sign in the book that she liked me. She would get within my personal bubble and would look at me constantly without saying anything and always find a way to touch me in some way. I texted her and told her the next day that I was having a party on Sunday and told her that I hope to see her there. She responded and told me that she was going to a cookout that day with friends and family, but said ""We should plan something soon."" and she left it with that. 

I decided to text her on Monday and ask her out to the movies for Friday. She took hours to respond and said, ""That's so sweet of you, but I'll be at the beach."" She left it like that and I just told her no worries. She is very flirty with me and only me in person when we hang out. And a few days before we went to the amusement park, I went over to her house with her brother and her brother left us and said, ""I'll leave you love birds talk."" as he went to go get a shower, leaving the girl and I at the dinner table. She was shy and awkward and we went inside to put dishes away and then she showed me her room and then walked me out the doors to say goodbye. And then later that week I asked her if she wanted to go to the amusement park.

My question is, sounds like she's interested in me a lot and it doesn't sound like she's just being nice. Does she like me? Or am I just reading into things too much? I haven't talked with her for a few days now and I plan on asking her out again next week. Should I ask her out again and be more persistent or should I wait for her to make a move?

We went on 4 dates in 2 weeks (I know this was quick and a bit against my instincts, but it really felt like we couldn't get enough of each other) and our dates were ending with us talking on my couch until 3am.

On our last date we almost had sex but didn't because I started getting really in my head wondering if it was too soon, worrying the dynamic would change etc. He was cool about it and didn't pressure me, but I am afraid my behavior came off as wishy washy and insecure.

A few days later I texted him to let him know that I had gotten in my head but would love to see him again. He said he was up for it but had a busy week (2 events he had to travel for back to back) but definitely after. Since then we've exchanged a few playful texts (initiated by me) but no plans have been made. I feel the ball is in his court and I guess it's a waiting game, but I find it a bad sign that he didn't really make an effort to text or check in after our last date.

I find this tends to happen a lot with me, where it's like guys seem really into it and pursue me so heavily in the beginning and then suddenly I feel something shift. It's like I can have fun on early dates but ultimately don't know how to cultivate something with longevity, and then I get in my head already expecting it to end. I wonder if maybe I should be better at pacing out the dates to once a week instead of jumping into seeing each other so often in the beginning, but it's hard because of course it's exciting when you really connect with someone. Or maybe i need to get better at identifying and communicating what I'm looking for (???)

I guess I just needed to vent. I don't even know if this is over, but just disappointed I haven't heard from him.

The first strange thing was that I was quite into her before we became romantically attached and afterwards I started to have doubts.

Maybe that's because of my previous relationship that lasted about 8 months. In the first months I was really into her as well but over time my feelings became less and less until we broke up. So maybe that's one reason why it became difficult for me to just enjoy the time together and see where it goes. Another reason is that dating a girl who is in her thirties as well makes me feel pressured in regards of founding a family. It feels impossible to just date and see where it goes. If we split after one year that sucks but for her it could even mean she wasted one year before its becoming difficult to start a family due to biological reasons. Now I'm unsure if my lack of feelings and doubts is due to us not being that into each other or because of some fear of commitment due to past experiences and feeling pressured overall.

In addition to that we texted about the future today. She said she would like to marry within the next 2 years (and probably starting a family soon after). For me marrying within 2 years and potentially starting a family soon afterwards seems quite early. Seeing all the divorces and unhappy marriages I'd like to spend more time together before marriage and family. On the other hand I''m in my early thirties and dating girls in a similar age does not leave you with that much time. So we talked about stopping to meet today as we have different plans for the future and will meet on the weekend to make a decision.

Now I'm a bit unsure what to do. On the one hand I think we just met and after such a short time it's difficult to say how much potential the relationship has. On the other hand I'm not fully into her or even in love. Though I'm not sure if that's more because of some fear of commitment. Also for me it's difficult to imagine to marry someone within two years. I also don't want to play any games. I like her and want her to have a happy future. So telling her marriage within 2 years is a possibility just to continue seeing her would not feel right. Continuing to see each other and to strengthen the bond just to split some time in the future would makes us both unhappy.

I asked her to just let me know when she’s free another time and she kind of just shrugged it off but she still texting me about little things. I really just don’t know if this girl sees me as somebody she would like to get to know as a friend or as somebody that maybe can become her boyfriend. I definitely think she finds me physically attractive because she made out with me for 10 minutes and was super close to me the entire time we went out. She did tell me she just left a relationship so I’m not sure what to think right now in terms of whether or not she’s just not ready for relationship and she sees that I want one but regardless should I just kind of continue on trying to get with her even if some of the conversations we have seem to be more friendly instead of intimate?,True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,886036,public,self,Pursuing a girl,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oggeyz/pursuing_a_girl/,all_ads,6,dating

I’ve only ever dated one person, and that relationship was a bit unconventional as well. I’m trying to figure out how to enter the dating pool now, and seem to have no idea what I’m doing. I don’t have anyone to discuss this stuff with, so I’m counting on your wisdom, kind Reddit strangers. 

A bit of background: I met my former girlfriend in third grade. I had just moved to town and she was the star child in our class. I’ve always been good at studying so we ended up becoming fierce competitors and got into arguments almost every day. When we were 14, (after a series of events) she told me that she liked me — I did too, but didn’t really have the guts to tell her myself — and we started dating. For the next 3 years, we were almost inseparable. We had all our first together. Things were going perfectly well, but right before our final year of high school she got diagnosed with leukaemia. She did not survive it. I went into a really dark place after that. I don’t have much family to begin with, and even stopped talking to the few friends I had. I retreated into a shell, and after a few months of debilitating depression, I managed to get myself to work enough to get into a good university. 

At uni, I continued to avoid people for most of my first year. Thankfully, a professor noticed this and connected me to a therapist who has been helping me deal with all of this. I’ve made significant progress since then — I eventually built a small social circle and was doing fairly well in school. At the suggestion of the same professor, I applied for a transfer to a much more prestigious program. Because they offered me a very generous scholarship, I ended up accepting it. It was right about that time that COVID hit. I ended up spending last year in the same city. But now I’m moving to a completely new place where I don’t know anyone, entering my final year of uni, and I’d like to try dating again, but I don’t know how. 

If you’ve made it this far, thank you so much for reading! I’m really sorry if this sounds a bit awkward and forced — this is the first time I’m openly talking about this, outside of my therapy sessions.

I’m so much out of my depth here that I don’t even know what advice I’m looking for exactly. I welcome anything you folks have to offer!

I was just wondering if I could get some help/advice on planning a second date. Met someone last week from Hinge and we hit it off pretty well and we are planning another date for this coming Sunday. For our first date we went to grab some dessert and then played mini golf afterwards and just had a ton of fun. Unfortunately I am really limited in my time for the next week so the only time I could meet up for a date is after 5:00 PM. So I was just wanting to run some date ideas by you guys and if you have any recommendations I am all ears.

I was wanting to grab dinner with her since I will be pretty hungry coming from work and on our last date she jokingly mentioned that we should have got dinner as well since we survived the night on beer and ice cream. I really wanted to go ice skating, but our nearest rink is a little far so might have to save that for a different time.

So I think I am set on getting dinner, but I would like to do something afterwards as well. There's a cool historic spot in a nearby city that is right on the river and it has some interesting shops and restaurants. It even has a smaller ferris wheel that would be kind of cool to check out. But I am worried about this cause it would literally just be dinner and walking around. It is also a little bit of a drive and I have not been there in a while so I'm gunna have to rely on google haha.

Was also thinking of some of the following activities, either after or before dinner. We could go to a wine and paint night, play board games somewhere (no idea where though haha), or do an escape room. There is an escape room in the old area of the city so it would work out well.

She said that she wants to see me again and explicitly stated that she isn't friend zoning me, but that she doesn't know what she wants right now, and I don't exactly either. She seems happy with how things are going though, and I'm just kind of getting to the point where I'm starting to like her a little bit. I guess that's a good thing based off what she said?

She told me she doesn't sleep around. After our last date she said she was down to go back to my place, but wasn't ready for sex. All 3 dates we have had some pretty intense make our sessions. This last date after golf/smoothies we danced in my living room to country music then cuddled and watched a couple movies. We hung out for almost 6 hours. 

Whenever I'm stressed out, she texts me the next morning wishing me a better day. She's also mentioned that she wants to take a trip to Austin and sends me tik toks of stuff to do down there. She's texted me at night before saying that she wishes she was with me, we've been talking for over 2 months now so we have plenty of calls, FaceTimes, and texts between us in addition to dating. 

The last few days we just briefly chatted it up on snap. Flirty at times and other times just back and fourth selfies and usual normal snap convos. 

From here on out I want to play my cards right. Tell me if I'm reading too far into this, but we have a 62 day streak on snap and I sent a message to all my streaks this morning and she opened it 2 hours after I sent it and didn't reply when she usually does. I've never double texted or overstepped but for some reason it seems weird but I'm probably just over thinking it. 

What're some good tips to keep her guessing and play it cards right? I like where things are going and don't wanna mess this up.
