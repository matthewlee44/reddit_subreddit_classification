I need help being that I'm 30 and only dated a few times in my life with women who were aggressors (just too easy to hook up) which never went anywhere because of no similar interest and nothing I found attractive.... I don't have the energy to go out dating a lot.  

-

I'm always a gentleman, I pay even when she insists to pay, I open the door for her, tip waiter or whatever.

-

This girl and I had chatted for 2 months prior to the actual date, so we covered things like our likes, hobbies, interest, religion, etc... and we have 100% in common and was mind blown!

When our first date came, I hugged her from the start and gave her a compliment when we walked in.  We mainly just touched up on topics we talked about and I even made one sexual innuendo without even noticing until now that I've been reading things up.  It only lasted an hour because of work.  She was all smiles throughout the date and I even picked her up for a photo.

I attempt to kiss her at the end of the date (I lunged at her saying ""come here"") and she gave me the cheek.  However, after a few hours had gone by, she wanted to see me again on that weekend with a smiley face with hearts.  (I learned that it's best to mess with her hair and slowly get close to her, tease and then quick kiss)  So I learned something.

-

At this point, I got too comfortable...

-

The second date came and she had her hair down, I hugged her and (DID NOT compliment her at all) we went to play some games at the arcade and just talked about last time being at the arcades and just playing games beating each other scores... that's it, nothing sexual, interesting, just hanging out like friends.  After an hour went by, she pulled her hair up, we played bowling and had alcoholic drinks which we shared.  As last time, we played bowling with nothing sexual... just cheering each other on... high fives and that's it... when we left she gave a sexual innuendo, which I just smile and nod because I wasn't sure what she meant or how to respond... I asked if she wanted to go in her car and she said it's messy, which we decided to play pool... half way the game she seemed annoyed and said she was tired.  I walked her to her car and hugged her and she left.

-

The next date was almost 2 weeks later due to a cancellation.

-

Again, too comfortable.  However, I texted her a sexual reference of golfing which she liked and sent me kiss emoji face and a devil smiling face and said we'll grab drinks after.

-

On this date, we hugged (DID NOT compliment her again) made a very short talk about an event which we then went to play our mini-golf and I tried to make a short simple story of something that had happened the last time I played golf with the family and which I asked if she had any siblings... she was hesitant, but answered... we played normally, I asked her stuff like what's music she's into and she said ""anything"" and we continued playing normally... when the game ended, we walked to play some arcade games and when I asked to grab some drinks she said she was tired...  as we left I asked if we can go to her place and she said ""what, noo""... and we hugged and that's that.


-


I didn't hear back from her after two weeks and a half, which after the first week.  I first wrote the day after the date, which then I waited a week for another date, which then a few days later I told her what I wanted to do during the date which then I waited another few days and said if everything is ok, which then I started to text her I didn't mean going to her place sexual, just wanted to hang out and watch a movie since we had talked about that prior to ever meeting. 

She eventually said she wasn't in the right headspace for a romantic relationship and that I deserve someone better who can communicate daily since she's busy with work.  But she had fun with me and enjoyed the time spent.

I then bombarded her with 10 paragraph texts, even telling her I like her and asking for another chance....which she still hasn't replied to.  

It's been a month and I think it's game over...

So, please for the love of God.  What killed her attraction and what should I've done to fix it because clearly she was interested and she eventually gave up.

She is great, and we have excellent chemistry, great conversation and sex. She seems smart and mature about many things but there are few things that have been making me worried and I'm not sure how to process that. Overall I like her.

We seem to have completely different environment. I was always a nerd, barely partied or got laid, but have been quite fit and make really good money ($550k) since I've been out of university and made great career moves. She meanwhile, seemed to have exactly opposite experience -- of being in parties almost every weekend, having several casual partners, not sure what to do, and currently makes 7 times less than what I do.

I've not dated much as I was working hard (but always took care of myself), and among the limited experience I've, I've great chemistry with her and I do like her. But certain things do bother me (either due to my limited experience or a bit traditional thinking).  

- She mentioned she did coke, psychedelics (limited number of times). I did mention it is a dealbreaker for me if that is something she wants to keep doing and I couldn't get a read about whether she is still ok doing that. She said she is ok, but I couldn't tell if she meant it. 
- She has had many more partners (17 vs 4, which I guess I can live with), but it makes me worried about trust. She still seems a bit impulsive about jumping to sex.
- Financially, we decided to do 70/30 split. 
- She also seemed a bit closed off, and less vulnerable (which she said it takes time for her to). Sometimes her answers are rather vague or don't make sense to me, like reason for last serious relationship breakup etc.

I think I'm also being insecure here with my inexperience with dating, and maybe the concern I've is very common thing (e.g. trying psychedelics once in a while). Based on the people she has dated who seem like very different from me, I'm anxious that, I'm probably the safe/stable choice that one can settle for. I'm not sure how to process that, build trust or make a decision on whether to continue this?

I feel it's all a mess in my head atm

Basically( I'll try my hardest to make this as short as possible 😔)
I had a guy I've been friends with since April. We had been hanging out every week or fortnightly. Watching films together, going for walks or getting food.
There was interest on each others side when we met and started hanging out, as we originally came across each other on a dating app. And we've expressed things a bit before to each other in terms of interest being there, but we both said we don't want to rush thing (I had been cheated on, so I was worried of rushing anyway). Now, I know my interest was stronger than his (from what I've now figured out) And the more we hung out the closer we got, as when we would hang out we'd hug/cuddle or have very close conversations when together. He said once while cuddling that he's a bit worried of his feelings towards me as he felt things were going a bit quick and he didn't want to hurt me by rushing stuff Incase things didn't work out. but when he said that I remember saying to him that we don't need to cuddle if he's uncomfortable or worried. But he said it was fine and continued to cuddle me and then everytime we'd hang out, we would cuddle, get touchy.

We ended up a couple months ago, sleeping together and it happened on 3 separate occasions when we hung out.
About a month ago was the last time we spent time together and I actually spent the night at his for the first time, as normally I'd go home very late. But since then he's hardly spoken to me. He is currently going through something as he said that to me a week after we last hung out, but he never fully said what. I think it could be depression and stresses of work, as he has loads of working hours, which change constantly. So I've always tried being understanding and caring as his work is demanding and sometimes it's very obvious he's tired or needs a break. But the lack of communication, talking and general openness his side has been very hard to deal with recently as we used to talk almost everyday and now it's nothing.

The last month/few weeks I had noticed the slowing of his messages and constant replies in the evenings of ""I will be going to bed soon"". so our chats then would be cut short or that he'd say other things like: ""I'm busy that day sadly"" or  ""I plan to do that with my family"".

My main issue is, is I can't fully figure out why he's cut contact. And I know no one else other than him can answer. But I just don't really get what I've done wrong and he's not actually said or saying anything either. he's only said about him being too tired, busy or wants to have an alone day on a day off, which he's always done since we met. 

I'm trying my hardest to move on and leave him be. But at the same time I wish to know what's wrong as I do really care about him, so I'm wanting to make sure he's okay, especially if he's not okay mentally. But I just feel hes now avoiding me, not wishing to see or speak to me anymore. 
My last message to him was me reaching out seeing if he's okay and if there's anything bothering him and that when he's ready to reach out and talk to me, I'm open and there. But he's not responded or even read my last message. 
I do like him, maybe more than he actually liked me and he's such a lovely person. He also constantly puts himself down, which I wish he didn't. But I feel we got on well and there was a bit of an emotional connection as well as a general connection in terms of our views for things, interests or stuff we like etc.

Any ideas how to move on and if I should reach out after a few weeks/in a month maybe? or just completely leave him?
Just the thought of us no longer speaking or our friendship gone with no explanation is sad. 😔 I really don't care about the sex side of things, and sort of wish we didn't do that, but at the same time I think it was more a curiosity thing with each other due to conversations we've had more than anything.

Sorry for the length of this, I really don't know what it all is tbh. I've cut so much out with what I wrote. But I needed to get this out as I can't stop thinking about it and it's taking up too much of my thoughts.

In February my GF at the time broke up with me (27M) because ""we're different people"" and ""we need a break"". She's a traveling nurse and I can only assume she probably met someone on the road. She would also frequently make comments on the amount of money she makes vs me (i'm a retail manager).   
From March to May i've rebounded with a recently divorced 22yo. Everything seemed to be going well until she ghosted me out of no where. In hindsight we both came out a relationship respectively. We were good distractions for each other.   
In July I dated my GF (24F) at the time for about 1.5 months before making it official. we would constantly spend time together and celebrated her birthday with her family. A week after her birthday she texted me while at work and said ""we moved too fast"" and should ""take a step back"" to become better friends. After that she made no attempts to communicate to become ""better friends"" and ignored all my calls and texts.   
In October I dated a  21yo for about a month...She ghosted me after we made plans to go to the fair.   
Currently single and had 2 relationships for the year. 

I'm currently single and taking a break from dating. Dating apps has made it easy to meet people and makes it hard for people to truly commit. I do enjoy the process of dating, the courting, the getting the know each other.

You did read that right. I'm a 39 year old man and I've never had sex nor been in a relationship with a woman.
So, that's why I'm here: for advice and guidance. I do understand how everything works though. I'm not that sexually illiterate!  But my sexual and dating confidence is zero.

Firstly, let's put this into context as I'm sure you're curious as to why I'm still a virgin. So, why am I? Well...
1. Up until comparatively recently, I'd never had that much interest in that side of things. (Or at least, I convinced myself I wasnt. I suspect it to be a psychological cop-out). Even when I was a teenager, when most guys were first noticing girls and asking them out, I was more interested in other pursuits.
2. Always thought I was more focused on my career. (Much good did that do me, either!)
3. I'm a bit of a loner and extreme introvert and often prefer my own company and rarely go out, so that tends to put a bit of a crimp on things. (Although, I think if I did have a lady in my life, someone to go out with, I think I would be more outgoing).
4. Lack of confidence and self-belief.
5. Low self-esteem. I have genuinely believed that nobody would be interested in me. That I'm not attractive enough, not interesting enough, not confident enough.
(Funnily enough though, I've never had any problems talking to women-on any subject other than romance that is! I can make conversation and small-talk easy enough. Nor am I some horrible misogynist and have any issues about women. In fact, I prefer the company of women to my own gender to be honest. And I've always got on well with women. I was once the only male in an all female office and we had some great laughs and worked well together. BUT if I had to make a romantic overture to a lady, my mouth would stop working and I would go into full-blown panic attack mode. Ridiculous, isn't it?)
6. Talking candidly, I'm not particularly well-endowed, to the point that I have developed a bit of a complex about it, so that can have a crippling effect. If you don't feel sexy in yourself, you're not going to convince others that you are.
7. I'm not somebody just after a quick roll in the hay. I could only sleep with someone that I have genuine feelings and affection for. So, when you don't go out much to meet people and have never been in love with anyone, it's going to be a challenge.
8. Laziness. I've always kept my life to what I feel I can manage and never take myself out of my comfort zone. An attitude that has made me suffer in all aspects of my life.
9. I've mostly always lived with others and so would feel weird sleeping with somebody with other people around. Even if I was to spend the night at somebody else's place, I would still be embarrassed because everyone would know what I've been up to
10. Maybe I'm just too neurotic.

So, that's the whole sorry story. I look back on my life with bitter regret and get quite angry with my younger self. I also feel like a failure. And yet, I now realise I would really like a lady in my life. And not just for sex! I'm talking a proper loving relationship. Companionship, friendship, intimacy. Someone who'll be my best friend and my lover rolled into one. I would like to meet my soulmate.
BUT, I come with a great deal of baggage, don't I? I would be scared to admit I am a virgin to any woman I'm dating because, let's be honest, it's not going to inspire much confidence, is it? Would me still being a virgin and never having been in a relationship be too off-putting? Would I be thought a weirdo? Have I left things too late in life? Has my lovelife and sexlife now past me by? 

Please note, this is not a subtle personal ad. I'm not baring my soul like this because I'm hoping to attract a woman's attention and hope that she'll sleep with me out of pity. This is a genuine call for help and advice. So any guidance, advice or suggestions that anyone has-Woman or Man-on any of the issues raised in this post would be greatly appreciated.

She responded with an absolutely not and we continued seeing for 1 and 1/2 month. Halfway through planning another date, she hits me with, ""This isn't going to work out, I need someone on my level of faith."" I was annoyed and told her that I asked her if that was a deal breaker over a month ago... But it's ok... Over now.

Next was a really random one. She matched and messaged me at 12am. Asked me to come through to her hotel. She asked me to bring alcohol, food, and protection. I show up... She eats and drinks... Then says she's sleepy and I should go. I go home defeated lol. Felt used. She texted the next morning and was just texting like nothing...

Not to blow my own horn but I think I should qualify as somewhat of a catch: I am a doctor, I have a side business as a photographer, I am above average attractiveness, dress well, hygienic, I work out 3 days a week, I sail and have a sailboat, I am very well travelled and well read, I am easy going and jokey on dates, $1m net worth. Take it or leave it qualities I suppose are that I'm average height (5'10""), I'm not into clubbing/dancing and I am into BDSM as a Dom (although this has never been an issue).

I've been single and using dating apps for about 2 years now and honestly I feel like they are getting worse and worse every passing month. I get a lot of matches but 90% will not respond and of the 10% that do, the other 90% will really make very little effort to converse in even the most basic terms. My plan is to arrange a date really quick if I feel our personality types at least match on basic level, but ""yep"" ""nope"" ""mmhm"" ""huh?"" is just not gonna give me that indication. I don't need a life story but I can't offer a date just to 4-5 photographs, I need \*something\* to go on.

I just feel like women don't take dating apps seriously whatsoever. There's this mantra that relationships/commitment are old fashioned and a waste of time, ""maybe do it when you're 38"" or something, so I guess the apps are just kind of a phone game to while away a few mins on the toilet?

I am very active in terms of hobbies, in the last 2 years I: learned to sail, took photography classes, took languages lessons, took up pottery throwing, took cookery classes. None of them reset in meeting single women really.

Tbh I even moved across the world temporarily because I felt that the culture where I live was such that the local women were just not interested in the same things as me. Now I am in a new city, yes, everyone here is into the same things as me and the conversations are really great but this rule of 90% won't reply and the 10% will give one word answers and then disappear is still killing my chances.

After the original date in that post, he thanked me multiple times for a great night and it was obvious the plan was to meet again - he suggested two days later actually, which surprised me (in a good way). The next day, he texted me around midday or so that someone at his workplace got covid, so he has to wait for PCR test results and couldn't meet me the next day. I understood of course. What felt a bit weirder was that I felt like he turned more passive while texting, and replied more sporadically. I assumed he was just busy, and left it at that. 

The next day however, I heard nothing from him the whole day. Because he sent the last message technically, my friend told me I should message him first, so I texted him a meme in the afternoon. He replied after around 30 minutes, but when I replied back he took around 3 hours to reply again. At this point I'd asked about the test results, and they hadn't come in yet. I subtly asked what he'd been up to, and apparently he was playing a video game, which is fine, but after the more passive vibe from the previous day, my suspicion that he might suddenly be less interested increased. Talking about it with people kind of made it worse (I talked to my mom and a couple of friends), so I tried my best to do other things. 

Eventually I found a way to let him know I would like him to be the initiator for setting up the next time we see each other (considering he's the one who had to cancel to original plan), though I did it jokingly. I then told him goodnight, so the last message is him telling me to have a wonderful night. 

I thought I was being dramatic, but I showed my friend some screenshots and she agreed that his vibe was a bit passive, like I was leading the conversation. I think if I have to verbalize it, after such an intense week of talking via text plus a really good date, I was hoping he'd initiate contact more and make me feel wanted, like a good morning text or just checking in. But I feel like it's way too soon to ask that of anybody, since we've barely known each other for two weeks and have only had one date. So I'm trying to just let it go for now and see what happens, since he's meant to update me when he's in the clear and he said he would, but I was just hoping for more communication in between. I'm busy too, so I definitely don't expect constant texting, but just the initiative of checking in would make me feel a bit more secure, as the saying goes, ""if he wants to, he would"". So I'm a bit disappointed, partially in myself though for overthinking things to this extent.

So dear Redditors, I'd like some advice on how to chill the fuck out, and on when a vibe becomes confirmed justified suspicion. He's the first person I've had any romantic interest towards since my last relationship, so it's affecting me more than I expected it would, and I'm sad to have the positive experience of the date soured by insecurity and potentially miscommunication.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1127197,public,self,"Update: after a great date, I feel like he's turned more passive",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qvv668/update_after_a_great_date_i_feel_like_hes_turned/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,

I (30F) have been dating a guy (last 30s) for the last 5-6 weeks. We see each other weekly as I have a kid, and he’s pretty non-committal. 

For background; I have an anxious attachment style which I have done a LOT of work on in the last few months &amp; im pretty relaxed with communication &amp; space now but some things trigger me. 

I believe this is just a rebound, and I’m at peace with it being a casual thing for now (I’m really busy with working out, working on my house &amp; a lot of self improvement) so I’m content with this being casual company; and I have some goals I want to achieve etc before going back on OLD etc and if he’s still only wanting this to remain casual in a couple of months I will end up breaking things off to not stay emotionally invested. 

What I really struggle with is MASSIVE guilt at not dropping everything to go see him/stay with him when it’s convenient for him. 

He’s often unavailable; still spends time with his ex, yet when he sends me the evening text for me to come stay (not necessarily a booty call… just company) I really struggle with saying no (because I can’t just drop everything to go round) as my anxious attachment style makes me feel like it will make him not like me, even though he doesn’t hesitate to say he’s busy to me.

We decided to meet up in a nearby town, she told me she needed to bring her sister because of safety reasons. Ok fair enough. I get it, it's the first time we've met and men are creeps.

So we met in a public place (shopping mall) and her sister was quite a big, silent girl. My date girl greeted me but didn't introduce us, so I said, ""Hi there you must be ***"" she said a quick ""Hi"" then went silent.

The date wasn't really a date, as most of it was spent with the girl I was dating was going ""shall we look in here?"" about random stores like a bookstore and trinket shop. But I don't really mind as we were still talking. The sister however didn't say a word, just followed us around and was picking up EVERYTHING on every shelf and silently looking at it, then putting it back down.

I just wanted to go for a meal and some drinks really, but we were in the shops ages because of the silent sister admiring every single thing.

Finally I asked if she wanted to get some lunch, she said yeah and said there was a Subway close by. We went in and I asked what they'd both like, she told me and thanked me, the sister just mumbled her order. 

We sat down and the sister was opposite me, my date sat beside me. There was no convo and I was a little creeped out at the silence. If I tried to make conversation it got quickly shut down.

We went around a few more shops with the sister picking stuff up, and then parted ways. My date didn't seem to think it was strange at all and asked if I'd like to meet another time. I said yes why don't I come to your home town next time?

She said yeah but it would have to be a Sunday because her sister is at work.

Obviously i caught feelings for her otherwise i wouldnt be making this post haha. we originally planned to see each other in january again since i have my exams done by then and got time to travel together. now she is coming to europe again, we agreed on meeting up already a few weeks back but this time she only wants to stay 4 days out of her 2.5 weeks with me also i feel like her interest has gone down since we last met (less texting barely sending me any pictures). I told her id like to spend more than 4 days with her when we talked about the dates she would come and she said yes she wanted that too. now we called again to fix the dates and she still only wanted to come 4 days and brought up some bullshit excuses why she cant come earlier. Now i am debating if i should just call it quit since she lives that far away and it really fucks with my head not knowing where i stand with her and i also dont want to waste my time on someone im not a priority for. Do you guys think its better to just ""take what i can get"" or confront her about it and say if im not a priority we should end it.

Originally rejected him becuz he drank too much on the first date but we did have a good convo so I gave him a second chance.

We’ve had about 6 dates now. I’ve met his friends and siblings. However this past weekend we went out with his siblings and friends to a bar and he got super high on weed and drunk. He tried fighting a guy in a bar that I had to stop (and he got mad at me for stopping him fight the dude). He then left me in the bar by myself with his family to go smoke weed and when I told him I didn’t like that, he got mad at me. That night when we got back to his place he told me (while again high and drunk) he didn’t care what I thought about him and didn’t think this would work out. I still slept over becuz I knew he was high and drunk and then the next morning he apologized and said he didn’t know why he gets mean like that when drunk.

However he reiterated that morning that he thinks we might be incompatible becuz I won’t have sex with him. He also said we’ve had six dates and he still isn’t sure what he wants with me and feels like he should know by now. Somehow I ended up staying longer at his place and we ended up going to breakfast and watching YouTube videos at his place and laughing. 

He was still a bit distant and cold the morning and afternoon though. I finally left and before I left asked him if this is what he still wanted and he said yes and said he would tell me if this wasn’t what he wanted anymore. We gave each other a kiss and hug and then I left. He hasn’t called or texted me today at all and didn’t say as I was leaving that he would text or call me like he usually does.

I called him and ended it last night. And he said he agreed it wasn’t working. I said we could still be friends and he’s still going to help me go apartment hunting on Thursday. Is this a bad idea? Should I just end things and cut him off completely? He’s just the most fun and funniest person I’ve met and if he can’t be in my life romantically, I at least want to be his friend.

I (M20) matched a girl (F20) a few weeks ago on lovoo and it did not work. We had a couple of dates, but she don't want anything more than a platonic friendship with me... And because of that I just thinking what I could possibly have done wrong...

Thinking on that I asked myself, if I am showing to much interest at the beginning.  
I like to write a lot, and she seemed to like the communication too, so the first good night message came from her. I'm a dude who shows interest relatively at the beginning, because I don't like games like ""don't answer for hours to arouse interest or to show I'm always busy"".

Specifically, we wrote every day and we also wrote a lot after the dates. And in that case it just happend that we wrote a good night text almost every day (the first text was sent by her and I just  continued it).  
As our thing did not work, I am asking myself when should I generally start to sent such text on a daily basis (Good morning/ Night)? And how much should I text her per day? Do you girls like to text to someone you just met daily? If yes how much?

Me and my (now ex) Boyfriend are 20, we were in a 2 year relationship.
The first year was going great, we loved eachother, always would make time for eachother, if we had an issue, we would fix it in no time.
After that it literally went down. We would fight alot and he never understood what i said when i talked about my feelings.
A few months ago he broke up with me through the phone, I would always ask him to talk about the situation in person, he never made time for it and we got in contact again through a friend of mine. Long story short we got back together.
It was going good for the few months after, but right before we broke up I would ask him for reassurance, I would ask him why he didn't post me anymore on social media and so on. 
One day we had a fight and I said ""don't you love me anymore?"" He said ""You know what i feel about this, its not the same anymore."" He got mad when I said then he never loved me at all and we fixed it afterwards somehow.
Fast forward to 2 weeks ago. He sent me an audio where he said that he doesn't love me anymore, that he doesn't want to stay in my life anymore and that he just stayed because of my depression. He said that he didn't feel attracted to me anymore and thats the reason why we didn't have sex for a month now (Which doesn't make sense cause 2 weeks before the breakup he literally begged me for it.) and that he has been acting weird to me for a month now because he didn't have feelings anymore (which also didn't make sense because the only time he was weird to me was on weekends.)
After all that he threatened me to never contact him again and if I do it will end bad. He then wished me ""good luck"" and blocked me on all possible social media platform and blocked my number. He didn't even let me talk, he didn't even let me say goodbye.
I called him 3 times that day, it would always go to the voicemail. That was the last time I heard from him. Its been 2 weeks now and my heart has been shattered, because all of the things he said, didn't make sense to me and it hurts even more to know that it was so easy for him to block me everywhere, like these 2 years meant nothing.
After the breakup, I was still following him with my other account, I saw that he followed alot of new girls and then I got blocked. 
I don't get it, did it mean nothing to him? I miss him so much I just wish we could atleast talk, I don't want him back but I just want to say my last goodbye too.
My friends are telling me that he will come back because he won't get the satisfaction from other people, which I really hope, my gut feeling is telling me that too, but right now, I don't understand anything at all.

Sorry for this long-winded post but I need to put it out somewhere and get some advice! Probably add I’ve been single for 2 years and I’m female and 28. I have a good job, I would say I’m intelligent, funny and I think I pass as cute.

So recently I’ve been hitting online dating like it was crack cocaine. I felt like if I was ever going to meet someone I really needed to keep going even after multiple dates that went nowhere or flaky Mcflakes (there seems to be way more since covid). I finally met someone (M32) I actually liked; we had a really good first date and I felt so relaxed afterwards. No red flags and he said he wanted something serious. A few times I’ve been told by guys I can come across like I’m not interested on the first date. This is mainly coz I don’t drink anymore and have forgotten how to flirt without booze until I'm comfortable. So, I took the plunge and texted afterwards to say I was interested, and I would love to meet again if he would – he replied saying he would too.

I wasn’t that bothered about him at first, we messaged a bit he was never a big texter said he doesn’t like using his phone a lot. I didn’t mind I had another guy I was speaking to who I was very excited to meet. However, unfortunately, when I met this 2nd guy there was no attraction and I wasn’t feeling it. At this point, I’d given up with apps too time-consuming.

The guy I was interested in asked me out on a second date maybe a week later – when the date came around, he said that he had a cough did I still want to meet? I said no just to be sensible, but he never mentioned rearranging. It’s about this point my anxiety starts – my anxiety only gets bad when I’m dating someone unavailable, drinking or working in a toxic place so it’s not all the time. Now normally if a guy does this so early on, I just leave them to see if they will suggest meeting again. Since I thought I’d cancelled the ball was in my court to suggest rearranging, eventually, we had our second date 2 weeks later after the first. I think at this point there were periods where he just wouldn’t text for days after about three days I would message and check-in but I never waited to see how long he would go.

So the second date came round we chatted for like 5 hours and he asked me on the third date and I said yes. He didn’t go in for a kiss as I said I was feeling like I was coming down with something. I didn’t leave the date feeling very smitten maybe there was a couple of things he said that were setting off alarm bells – some stuff about his relationship with his mother it seems it wasn’t good, he said he could get quite moody this came up in a conversation about stars signs, and even though he had a career he wasn’t sure if it’s what he wanted to do or knew what he wanted to do. The next day he did text to see how I was and the convo kind of died quickly.

When the third date came round, I was too ill to meet so we had to push it back. Again, when I was feeling better I suggested rearranging not him. We had our third date it went well he asked if I wanted to go back to his or somewhere else. I suggested we go to the pub we chatted for ages he drops me home. I awkwardly went in for a kiss and he kissed me back, it was just awkward….. and he said afterwards see you later…..I like died inside. At this point my anxiety is so bad and I know I’ve just been chasing this guy it feels like he’s lost interest.

I text him the next day saying can I come round for sex, thinking oh well if this isn’t going anywhere, I may as well get laid. I thought I’d just come and leave – no pun intended. Instead, we spent hours chatting eventually we have sex and it’s really good and we then chatted for ages having quite a deep One other odd thing I noticed is he never like gave any positive feedback like you look pretty – normally when I date guys they tend to give you some kind of nice comments. The worst thing is I leave him, realising I really like him.

After that night I don’t hear from him for 3 days and I am panicking my anxiety is taking over. Eventually, I cave and just text saying ‘hey I can’t really gauge your interest ………..I would like to see where this could go but I don’t want to rush into anything what page are you on………… if you are not interested that is totally fine?.’ He texts back saying ‘he would like to see me again and where this could go and that we should do movie night again.’ I reply back saying ‘ I’m glad we are on the same page maybe next Friday or Saturday.’ Then he texts back saying ‘I can’t do this weekend, do you mean next?. I say yes. He basically blanks me for two days and I eventually caved and message how is your weekend? He replies back asking how’s your weekend and asking me about my weekend and just blanks me about meeting. At this point, I’m kind of like this isn’t really going anywhere so I just reply it was good and don’t make any effort to make conversation. He’s disappeared again but this time I’ve deleted his number, so I can’t message.

My questions to you guys are; what point should have I just stepped away? I know I have an anxious attachment style and I tend to pick guys who are unavailable ( they are like catnip to me)– anyone knows how or managed to break this cycle? Was this guy unavailable or did I just push him away?

I can see that many of you are complaining about not finding someone good enough who also happens to like you back. And from a moral standpoint, to all you decent human beings here, it's valid to feel like you're being wronged.

I guess it's hard for us to swallow the pill that you can do many things right and still not reach the desired outcome. It's not necessarily perseverance I'm trying to preach here, but rather some form of acceptance because let's be honest, some of the advice here is literally telling people the right one will come and that there are 8 billion people in the world to choose from. Hope is a powerful tool, but unfulfilled hope over long periods of time will just breed resentment and I'd rather not have those mild highs in the first place instead of having to pay for them by experiencing the lowest of lows when you finally acknowledge the truth.

Last thing I want to add here is that we're somewhat prone to seeking external validation, which is unfortunate because we don't happen to have full control over what others think about us. Just think about how many people would continue to waste countless hours putting makeup on, getting the perfect hairstyle, spending loads of money on expensive clothes and accessories and flaunting their wealth in general if it wasn't for this. The few moments in my life when I was able to temporarily detach from this were probably the happiest and most carefree I could ever recall.

We casually talked for around 3 months throughout the lab period. I had a little crush on her because she is pretty and looks sweet and quite. I realised she was interested in me or maybe was pretending to have interest in me haha not sure. Because since i was shy, I almost always ignored her when she looks at me. There was one day when she told her friend loudly and angrily ""he doesn't wanna look at me"". She did this while being right in front of me. Damn, it was uneasy as hell. She would stare at me from far away frequently. When I'm near her, she will be quiet. She will be nervous as well. Sometimes she gives this warm smile with blushes when I catch her staring. Sometimes she looks away when I caught her staring. Since I was a shy and nervous bastard back then, I hesitated to talk to her even when she frequently made efforts to stand at few inches away from me, doing nothing. We talked during the 3 months of lab period. After that, there's no more lab so we never talk. Her friends will always tease her when im around. Not sure what they were talking about. So one day, I got the courage to do at least something and texted her, to help me share around an event that my friends are organizing. She blue ticked me. So I thought maybe she will say at least an ""OK"" or ""sure"". But nope haha. So I thought maybe it's her style. The next day I texted her, she was literally waiting outside the class alone, for me to talk to her. She kept waiting outside the class frequently, so that I could initiate conversations. But as time went on, she never really looked like she like me. She looked like she enjoyed all the attention I gave. This is because her level of interest in me wasn't there when we were talking. But she's super excited and shy when I asked questions about her. I felt like she never kept the conversations going and  just wanted to keep me attached to her. I never felt cared about, never felt loved or anything when I'm around her. I felt like she used me for ego and attention. Even one day during texting, I initiated saying Hi, how are you? Her reply : ""Hi, I'm fine. Why?""
I was really blown away with that reply. After all these days u treated me with nothing, now you are being rude?. Fine. So I decided to stop initiating texts with her. The next day she was there waiting for me after class, all smiling and blushing. I just walked passed her without initiating anything with her. I was feeling disrespected the whole time I was talking to her. So I ignored her multiple times when she was waiting for me outside class. Didn't really look at her face. Then one day, I saw her, staring angrily at me from far. I didn't care much. Days passed by and she didn't even care about me. Then one day talked to her friend who was sitting beside her. Then the next day, after class, she was standing beside my bag outside the class. When I picked up my bag, she was still showing her back to me. Again, I didn't initiate anything with her and went back as if she's not there. Then we can't see each other due to the covid pandemic and our internship which took around 1.5 years. I saw her after that. Actually, I started to build my physique during the 1.5 year period. Together with this, I built my confidence, better posture, better communication with people and probably a better personality. I never really walked with confidence or mingled around during social situations. I was shy. But this time I am really improved and really like my self a lot. I literally saw her starting to immitate whatever the heck i do. For example, she started to talk loud like me since my social skills improved and i started to talk more clearer and louder. If i talk to someone near her today, tomorrow she talk with someone near me. Hahaha. It's weird and creepy at the same time. She even started to date her so called bestie whom she always refers to as her brother. I'm happy for her, not him. Because he never knew she is just doing this to make me jealous haha. I just kept ignoring her and her being butthurt just kept alarming me that she was never really interested in me, but her ego and pride was longing for the attention that I gave.

the situation is i lived in another country before i moved to a place i’m living now. and i sometimes visit that place bc i have loads of relatives there. so i visited that city in september. i was a bit bored and downloaded a dating app. right after i matched with one guy and i really liked him. we met on a next day. we had just a nice date near mountains and a great chat. in a few days after i left the city and the country.
we continued texting and i kinda crashed in him. i wanted to see him so bad so i even initiated a trip to that city once again. with my friends this time. they planned to go there and i joined him. so i texted him i will be there and he told me he is waiting for me.
so i arrived. we met in the evening and i was glad to see him. we had a nice chat, he touched my hands. it felt good.
we met on the next day also. he texted me he is feeling not so well and he doesn’t know if he wants a hug or be alone. i told him that if he wants to be alone it’s ok, but if he wants a hug he knows where to find me.
he was near in 15 mins.
and then i’m in his car. he seems to be sad and he tells me how he feel. we started to hug. had a kiss. like a lot. and for a long time. and then he just stopped and started to smoke a cig. 
i asked what’s wrong. he told me that everything is hurts and the only thing that will help him is to cum. and that’s why he doesn’t like kissing. i didn’t say anything to that. i was just like 😳
then he brought me home. i felt like maybe i did smth wrong. i was frustrated
i texted him is everything fine. he told me masturbated at home and it’s better now. i was like 😳 again hah.
i told him i like spending time together, but idk if it’s ok for him now. he told me he like it too but he is not sure if he wants to attach to smb now. and i told him  i don’t try to do it. im not about to push him into anything. he told me that he can’t control it and i get him so well. im special.
after he replied to my random story on a next day and it was all. he knew im leaving and he didn’t try to meet up or even wish me a good flight.

now i feel like he like me, but not in the way he wanted smth besides sex or a friend if we didn’t kiss. he is trying to be distanced. 

and i want to txt him so bad. idk if it’s a good idea. he will have a bday on weekend and it’s a reason to txt him. or perhaps it will be better to just cope with it and move on. i feel like i have this power. anyways i feel weird",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1127227,public,nsfw,i’m sad,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qw0ozz/im_sad/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,

I (F26) met a guy (M21) at his job (restaurant) and found him very attractive at first glance,  which is rare tbh.  I went back a week later just to get his number. Which was bold because I said I wasnt there for the restaurant but for him (usually Im never this bold). Texted him my name which he replied and I texted again and he responded. 


The next day I asked what he is doing for the weekend and he didnt reply. So I double texted and said I wanted to hang out. No response so I deleted his number.


 2 days later he responds ""sure what are you doing tn?"". I replied that I wasn't around but will be back later that night if it's not too late for him. Actually my first text said ""You"". I was just trying to be funny, maybe flirt a little lol and then I said I was just joking and that I'll be back in town late that night if he is still around. No response at all. Havent heard from him it's been 4 days. 


I normally would say whatever and move on especially since he is soo young ugh, but I'm soo attracted to him.. which almost never happens.. I might find a guy attractive here and there, but then I dont like the sound of his voice or something else for example. But I definitely have the hots for this guy loll 


So I'm not sure where to go from here.  Idk how boys his age act, if this is normal. I never speak to guys younger than my age, I always go older.

I(22M) had three awesome dates with a girl (20F) I met about two weeks ago. We were very physical even tho we didn't kiss. After our 3rd date, she started replying really late and stopped rescheduling when she is busy. I went on a lot of dates and I know what that means. I decided to write her a text to explain that I'm sorry if I made it seem like I don't like her or anything, and ended things in a kind way. Suddenly, she replies 1 minute later saying that she is sorry again (I hear that at least 10 times with her) and that some stuff was going on with her roommate. I didn't reply, so she sent another text saying that she loved our three dates too but she forgot to mention that she is only looking for cool friends, not romance (oops). I told her that it was cool and to have a good night, then she started asking questions if I wanted a relationship or what am I looking for.

The truth is I'm just going with the flow and I don't put labels on relationships too soon. I don't have feelings for her or anything but I still wanna see her because I loved our time together and this is exactly what I explained. She said that she def wanna see me again and that she is sorry that she didn't tell me.

I think she is not sure what she wants, I don't think you let people pay for you when you are looking for friends or getting so physical and flirting (asking someone to come over, asking if I can shower at your place). 

Before saying that to me, I was worried if I fuck things up anytime I make a move, but right now I really love that situation cuz I don't own her shit and I can do whatever I want without feeling bad or thinking about it.

When we hang out in a group she will give me all of her attention and be slightly flirtatious. She has been drunk around me and been even more flirtatious and touchy, going as far as groping me in front of her friends.

We recently have hung out individually twice more. Once we went for a really long walk (about 6.5 miles) and watched the sunset. It was super spontaneous and unplanned, we sort of just kept walking and talking.

The second time was more planned. I texted her Friday and asked if she wanted to go to the zoo. About five minutes after that (she hadn't answered yet) I walked past her on the sidewalk near where we live. We chatted for a minute and at the end I asked if she wanted to go to the zoo Sunday. She gave and emphatic yes. She seemed like she already read the text but was waiting to respond.

It was a planned event and we were both flirting the whole time. Lots of intense eye contact and laughing, plus we stood very close to each other the whole time - basically touching shoulders or whatever.

Normally I would have made a move, but I found out a few weeks after I met her that she is in a long distance relationship - which she has never mentioned to me and I have never brought it up after I found out.

It was a little awkward when we parted ways because it felt like I should make a move but she initiated a big hug, and we said we'll do something again in the future.

We would still talk a lot and sometimes he would sorta be off for some reason because he’s a lil unpredictable. I have A LOT of respect for him because he literally makes me a better person no cap. He’s just amazing. Well, we do have quite a few similar interests and ideas. We vibe a lot and we have a lot of fun.

I mean we both keep our lives very low-key and it would be this perfect private relationship. It would literally be so amazing.

i (20f) have been dating my boyfriend (20m) for almost 3 years. in the start of our relationship we were having sex pretty much every time we hung out and just this last year or so we haven’t been as much. i’ve been having lots of mental health problems and the new medication i’m on has taken a real hit to my sex drive. 

idk what’s been going on with me lately but i feel like i’m having trouble taking sex seriously when we do start getting intimate with each other. i feel the need to make a joke or just say something dumb because i feel so awkward. idk just taking sex seriously has never been something i’m good at but it’s gotten worse. 

my boyfriend brought it to my attention last night that he doesn’t feel like i’m attracted to him anymore. he said since i always make a joke of things he feels like i’m laughing at him during sex which is not the case at all. i just feel so awkward and embarrassed of myself when we’re doing stuff. i’m not sure why because this wasn’t always a thing and just recently i’ve been struggling with it. 

basically i just want to know how i can be sexier and take things more seriously. i’m not sure if it’s because of my low sex drive or maybe i’m just not as into him anymore but i want him to feel wanted. so yeah if anyone has ideas on how i can loosen up and make things more enjoyable for both of us please let me know.
