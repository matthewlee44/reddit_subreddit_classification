We're not sweaty losers though, we just have literally no social life because we've never had any real opportunity)*.

Anyway, about 9 months ago we went to the cinema with our with our mate, who brought his brother who we know, and 2 girls from his work who we didn't know (they're about 20 y/o) - we watched the film and then we all went KFC and had dinner there. Basically we fumbled the opportunity - those 4 were chatting between themselves, mostly about work banter (they all work at the same place) while me and my brother were sidelined, chatting between ourselves and later kicking ourselves about it.

Now, mainly because we have no social lives, we want to do ourselves a favour and find a mate. We have no interest in having another male friend cos we already have our forementioned mate (where we're perfect for eachother and we're all close af) and we're not the social type anyway. So we're looking for a female friend each - obviously a relationship is ideal, but the main thing is just being friends which is more than fine.

Since we live in a low-populated area (Cornwall, UK), online dating is barely a viable option (although we plan on joining it anyway cos its better than nothing). We went out for a meal with our mate last week, our social situation was brought up and he basically said if we wanted to get to know the girls then we can message them ourselves.

So that brings us to this question: **how should we go about this?** Remember we've been acquainted once, we haven't really spoke to them but they seem nice/cool and we share a good mutual friend. We're hoping we could maybe meet up with them, whether that's going for a drink, coffee or just hanging out. **So far I'm thinking the best way to go forwards would be to message them both on Facebook - basically saying** ***hi, were your mates mates, we all went cinema together a while ago, since we didnt really get to know eachother we were wondering if u wanted to meet up, maybe go for a drink/coffee or just hang out some time. what do u think?***

\-

**What do you lot think? Is this a good approach and the best way to get to know them, or is it too direct?** Ofc we could also try and arrange another day out with our mate and them (similar to when we went cinema) but not fumble it this time, but even so, the point is we want to get to know them. **Thoughts?** All comments appreciated, thanks in advance",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,794810,public,self,(M22) How should I go about inviting 2 acquaintances (they are friends with eachother) to hang out with me and my brother?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nkk9vz/m22_how_should_i_go_about_inviting_2/,all_ads,6,,,,,

So I was casually dating a guy for 2-3 months, he was so romantic with me and the moment I said once through text that’s I was catching feelings he lost interest. I took the hint and stoped talking to him that very moment I felt the vibe change. 

And I know he’s gonna come back, because they always do especially when you do an emotionless cut and dry. 

I felt like the whole grand scheme of things was kinda manipulative - saying he was not ready for anything because he was hurt from his ex, buying plane tickets that same week without telling me that he was planning to be gone for a while. Even though he still was super romantic when getting to know each other, things shifted pretty drastically.

I would like to know if that person comes back hypothetically (and I’m not gonna do these things lol) how to string them on, use them,  crush their ego and discard them.

I am a bit frustrated with 2 situations that happened during last week, with two separate people. 

I'm a young woman, but I have always been keen to show interest or ask out men if I am into them, and I think they are into me, too.

Unfortunately, I have had one terrible, and one weird experience due to what giving two men some attention, and them wildly missinterpreting the situation, in different ways.


1st: 2 Sundays ago, I had a date with a guy. I had asked him if he wanted to hang out. I knew he was into me, and I was into him. I just wanted to know him better 1 on 1, outside the gym. He agreed and planned a date himself. Well, he stood me up, appeared 4 hours later, drunk, asking me to come over. I didn't, I deleted his number. 

2nd: Early May, a guy I went on a date with in April asked me to hang out in two weeks (so, this past Friday). After our first date, it was clear there was no chemistry in that sense on both ends. I actually told him that I didn't want anything with anyone and deleted Tinder. And later told him I had a crush on someone. 

For some reason, he got really weird at some point while we were hanging out and I ended up leaving because he made me feel he didn't really want to hang out with me. 

I checked up on him the following day, and he told me that he thought it was a date, and he thought I thought it was a date? And that he didn't like me or wanted to have sex with me, and should had made things clear? No offense taken, but it made no sense in my head because I had already told him I wasn't into it.


So, my perception is that, both of these people thought I was a lot more into them than what I was because I agreed to meet them, or asked them out. When, in reality, I just wanted to hang out and get to know them better. One as maybe more than friends, and the other as friends. 

It's frustrating for me that both of them build something up in their heads about what I thought about them and behaved weirdly, or terrible to me because of it. 

I think this has happened to me before with other men, the moment I showed some interest back, they thought I wanted much much more with them than what I actually did.

She constantly tell me that I'm her favorite person to work with which idk if that's normal or not. She's always looking to see when we work together and if she sees we are working a similar shift, then she asks me to stay longer with her until she leaves. For example, on Thursday, she worked a closing shift which ends at 11:30 and my shift ended at 9 but she told me that I should stay longer with her and I did but I told her that the following day, she has to stay longer with me and she ended up staying. Almost forgot to add but after we watched the movie, we spent hours just talking in her car and when I asked her if she wanted to do something again, she said "" OF COURSE IM UP FOR IT"" which I thought  was great.

I used to feel, as a guy who’s 5’6”, that the types of dudes who complained about this tended to be angry woman hating types with no self-awareness. Men have never been oppressed in the way woman have. They’ve never had their sexuality stripped from them, haven’t had as much intense pressure to live up to beauty standards, don’t get harassed and sexualised constantly from a young age like women, etc. As a short guy myself, I’ve always felt it’s not my place to complain, cause while I’ve been treated differently before for being short (girls I’ve been really into have told me they don’t want to date me even though I’m great, then talked in other conversations about how they would never date a guy shorter than them, guys tend to not take me seriously and instantly feel like they can make jokes at my expense, etc.), it’s never really impacted my life all that much and it’s more just been something I learned to compensate with over time by being the ‘funny one’, and not letting it get to me.

But then I saw a post on Twitter that made me despair. I can’t link it here, but essentially a dude posted saying ‘where’s my short king men 5’7” and under at?’ And a load of short dudes replied to it and stuff trying to post pics and show off and be proud of themselves. I’ve seen similar successful posts for all kinds of people. The thing is, in this case, at least half of the people quoting these tweets were simply making fun of these dudes for being proud of themselves, saying shit like ‘nobody wants to see this’, ‘stop embarrassing yourselves’, ‘blocking these fucking midgets’,  ‘I promise you no girl is scrolling through this thread of boys’, ‘they look like they all get beat up by their wives’, etc. There were some people there defending short dudes, but the posts getting the most likes and attention were by and large ones absolutely berating these short dudes for having the audacity to have a bit of body positivity. That shit makes me fucking sick, and it’s far from just a few bad eggs doing it. These people think this is perfectly acceptable, and the thing is it kind of is socially. And posts like this are far from rare.

Now, I’m not saying short men are in any way oppressed and historically abused the way women, trans people, fat people, etc., are, but if any of those groups got that kind of negative attention these days I just know someone would (rightly) go viral in coming to their defence. I know we have fucking assholes who happily give these groups abuse, but It’s rightly not socially acceptable anymore to make fun of these people for their bodies, so why is it seemingly a free for all on short dudes?

And the thing is, my old attitude towards guys who complained about this, that they just hate women, that they have a Napoleon Complex, etc., is exactly the kind of shit that makes this worse. Short dudes who complain about it aren’t taken seriously, or are told to shut the fuck up, it’s different for other groups, it’s not that deep, etc., and are expected to see shit like this and just ‘roll with the punches’. For a long time I just accepted that. It’s really fucked up to see so many guys openly berating dudes shorter than them just to feel superior over an arbitrary measurement, and it’s just as fucked up to see women openly take the piss out of short dudes and openly voice that they’re repulsive to cries of ‘yes queen go off!!!’ If you’re not attracted to short guys thats totally fine, you can’t control that obviously, but have some fucking basic respect for your fellow human being and don’t try drag them down. And I know there’s plenty of good women out there who would never act like this, and I know there’s plenty of dudes who are never gonna try one up a guy for his height. I’m friends with these people, I know they’re out there. But this isn’t a small amount of people doing this, this is a large amount who think, for whatever reason, that this kind of shit is perfectly acceptable, that it’s okay to laugh at the very idea of short guys being proud of their bodies.

I personally have never had much luck with women, have always had to be the ‘joker’ in every situation and the approachable, open, funny dude, and I always thought this was just my personality, but lately I’ve started to realise I ended up how I am as a way to get by cause I’m short. And all the other shit, confidence issues I’ve had my whole life, people pleasing, etc., which I all thought was just facets of who I am that I didn’t like, are all also kind of tied in around it too. It can hurt dudes seeing this just like it could hurt anyone else on the planet. People really need to wise the fuck up and take it more seriously when someone, anyone, tells you to stop having a free for all on someone for their body or the way they live their life.

I went in a first date with a guy and honestly I don’t know him all that well. He’s an acquaintance. I thought we were getting to know each other. But he said multiple times without me asking about how he doesn’t want a relationship. He never said he’s looking for sex. He talked about himself tho and told me stuff some of which I thought was a little tmi. I was surprised he was telling me.

Anyways I felt kinda rejected bc he seems to have decided already he doesn’t want to date me. He made that clear. So part of me feels rejected. But another part of me is like what was even the point of that.

Anyways he said stuff about how we should do this and that together in the future. And since the date he has contacted me a few times and come up to me. I see him around obviously. But then since I thought we were being friendly I said hi to him and he turned around and ignored me.

Ok I don’t know what the hell is going on here. I get it he doesn’t want a relationship but I thought he was trying to be friends so then why would he snub me like that. I feel like I got roped into some mind game

Total sweetheart, easily flowing conversation, and a ton of laughter. But at the end, when he was in the bathroom, I put my credit card down and paid for us both. (Bold gender-bending move? Idk. Lol.) When he came back he was shocked and upset that I paid the bill. He insisted on taking me to a fancy steak restaurant immediately. 

Like...literally immediately. After we’d just finished our first dinner. I laughed and playfully said, “Don’t worry...I only got the check *this* time, you’re getting it on our second date.” I was being genuine. I was looking forward to another date. 

I got into a cab and tried to give the driver directions to drop me off at home, but my date jumped in and interrupted telling the driver to take us to the steak restaurant instead. I enthusiastically protested, but he wouldn’t take no for an answer, and I was too young and naive at the time to stand up for myself as I would now. 

So there I was, totally full from the first dinner, pushing my steak around my plate for an hour, trying to humor the situation. 

At the end, when the check came, he immediately handed his card to the server, then smirked at me and said “Now let’s go back to my place.” 

I wasn’t expecting that, so I joked, “This is only the first date! What kinda girl do you think I am?? But seriously...how bout we wait a little while for that? Okay?” 

He pushed it. “It’s technically the second date now. We’re having our *second* dinner of the night.” 

I stayed firm on my answer. “Sorry, but I’m gonna call it a night.” 

That’s when his face totally changed. The smile melted into a scowl of disgust, and he says in a downright menacing voice, “You women are alllllll the same. Just take and take and take, and no give.”

My jaw drops in shocked amusement. I didn’t know what to say and I just sort of nervously laughed. 

He angrily continues, “I just paid for you to have a really expensive steak dinner, and you still won’t put out. So fucking typical. Fucking prude.” 

That’s when I when I stopped being polite and stared getting real (MTV ref 😜) by laughing in his face. He continues to berate me and the server walks by and overhears it. He starts laughing at him too and points at him and says, “You’re a pathetic prick.” (‘Twas a great moment of solidarity.) 

I walk out of the restaurant and the dude follows me. I tell him to stay back, and I try to hail a cab. He starts actually yelling at me. Going on and on about I-don’t-know-what because I stopped listening. 

Just then a group of bros walk out of the bar next door, and witness what’s going on, so they they yell at him “Leave her alone, you fucking psycho!” So, my lovey date turns to them and starts shouting obscenities at them instead, and they all burst out laughing. (This guy was giving everyone in his path a serious case of the giggles.)

While he was distracted by them I hopped into a cab, and figured I’d seen the last of him. Years later, aka recently, I started to see his picture online. A bunch of people who work in his industry came forward about his misogyny and sexual assault. 👏🏼

My other coworker is also a girl and she basically said how it isn’t a big deal and girls are used to be asked out and if she shoots me down it’s not a big deal. 

And surprisingly I even felt like the weird butterflies in my stomach which hasn’t happened in awhile for me. 

And before you say to not ask out coworkers, this is a minimum wage college job so it’s not my career job. Id just ask for her social media and then maybe ask her out through Instagram most likely. I really like this girl for some reason and I think it’s 50/50 whether she feels the same.

I'm 24 years old, cis male,  straight, and have never had a romantic or sexual relationship of any  kind. I've never had sex, and never even really kissed with anyone.

The  more I think about this, the more hopeless I feel. I know I missed out  on some very crucial years of development. I know most people get good  at dating and seduction by making mistakes and learning from them early  on, when it doesn't matter so much.

I  feel that, while there surely are women my age out there who would be  willing to date me despite my lack of experience, the chances of me ever  meeting one of them are pretty low. I respect the fact that very few  women in their mid-twenties want to spend their time teaching a man how  to have sex and conduct himself in a romantic relationship. If I were in  that position, I almost certainly wouldn't want to do that either. I  would want someone who was on my level or above.

I  don't even really know how to initiate things like that. I never  learned. I have no idea how to ""steer"" a new found platonic relationship  towards romance. I have no idea what to say or do for a woman to show  that I'm interested in her in a subtle way. I have no idea when is an  appropriate time to say I like someone as more than a friend or  acquaintance. I certainly have no idea when to try and kiss someone, and  even less so, how to initiate or ask for sex in a respectful way. I  don't know when is an appropriate time to talk to someone about sex at  all really. I dread the thought of telling my potential first lover that  I've never had sex.

Online dating  has been a really bad experience for me. I rarely get matches that hold  a conversation with me (eventually I just run out of things to talk  about). I've went on a couple of dates, but never had a second one with  the same person. It's always ended with a text to the effect of ""I'm not  in a place for dating right now"", or ""I just didn't feel a spark for  you"".

While my online dating  experience has made me feel a bit shitty about myself, I do know on some  level that I am, my height aside, reasonably attractive. I have a solid  job, I have a lot of hobbies, I'm physically fit. And I have had  experiences where women have tried to initiate things with me and  flirted with me, sometimes even in very physically forward ways. But I  just don't know how to respond to these situations. I just don't know  how to flirt back, and how to build on these things to actually get  somewhere. I don't know what to say or do in these scenarios.

I  sometimes feel like a relationship is never gonna happen for me. It  makes me sad, because I love the idea of being in a relationship. I feel  I'm in the right place for one in most ways. I've been told by a female  friend that I'm ""boyfriend material"", because I'm calm and generally a  good communicator and fun person to be around. Yet I don't know how I'm  ever going to get there.

Basically, she has strict and conservative Asian parents like I do. She’s Chinese American and I’m Indian American.

She told them she was dating me and they got pissed when they found out that I’m two years younger than her and still wrapping up college next semester. They also didn’t like the fact that I have ADD. They thought that I don’t have my life together. They made her block me on everything and then delete my number after she texted me for the last time.

Also, my parents would have probably reacted the same way to her being two years older than me and not having a 9-5 job (she works as a career development consultant at home and runs her own business). Still doesn’t meant that this doesn’t fucking hurt really, really bad. Loved her. Still do.

We started talking in early October 2020 and started hanging out in person in February 2021; we’ve had dates since then and we were looking forward to having more to make up for time lost during the pandemic. Now we won’t have that.

Or they imply that somebody who maintains a good physique or seeks that in someone else is either dumb, ignorant, or not an in-depth person. All of the above is most often false. Different people embrace a life of fitness for different reasons. And I've seen a trend of trying to shame people for either embracing a fitness lifestyle or being attracted to it. I found this quote that pretty much summarizes what it actually means. So you see, a well-built physique says more about the character of the person then some shallow skin deep description. 

A well-built physique is a status symbol. It reflects you worked hard for it, no money can buy it. You cannot inherit it. You cannot steal it. You cannot borrow it. You cannot hold on to it without constant work. It shows dedication. It shows discipline. It shows self-respect. It shows dignity. It shows patience, work ethic, passion. That is why it's attractive to me.
