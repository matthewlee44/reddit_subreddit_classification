I had tried to date her at one point in high school, but was rejected. Not too long after that she started dating one of my friends. I also started dating one of her best friends around the same time. We were from the same friend group so we stayed friends. She had dated another friend of mine in college as well, but that didn’t last long. 

I started dating another girl in college, and when I introduced the two of them, I could tell she was jealous. Other mutual friends confirmed that she had feelings for me at that point…

Fast forward 6 years later. Now we are almost 30 and both single. We are both fairly good looking people looking for the same things. We have always had a flirty vibe between us, and I’ve always thought we would be good together. But, without saying it, we both know it will never/can’t happen. There is too much history. She is one of my closest female friends, and while it sucks I know I can’t be with her, I still want her in my life.

Yes, I know I’ve been friendzoned blah blah blah…I’m not hanging any hopes or dreams of being with this girl. It will never happen. But even if it can’t be me, I want the absolute best for her.

He lived in the room next to me. He told me he was single, and after 2 months he asked me out to the bar down the street to get dinner and we spent the whole night cuddling/watching movies. It was the BEST night of my life!

However, a week later ANOTHER girl was over and it turns out he had a GIRLFRIEND. When I asked him he said they were ""just friends"", but I went on his social media and he has pictures posing with her dating back 2 years.

Then the next week his girlfriend was in the hospital for surgery and I heard him on the phone saying he loved her, yada yada. Only then did he invite me into his room to watch and cuddle again (because his GF was in hospital). I really wanted to cuddle and experience those magic feelings again but I told him NO, I felt bad as he had a girlfriend. Then he said ""FINE, no one's forcing you to be in here anyway"", and I went back into my room.

Since then I kept to myself and eventually his girlfriend started coming over to our house and sleeping with him 3 nights a week....then 4 nights a week....then almost EVERY. SINGLE. NIGHT. He took her to a wedding and on a tropical vacation. They got closer and closer and I was left out! :(

I really wanted to talk to him or ask him out and I believe that if I had been more aggressive/friendly/fun, he might have taken me out on dates. Anyway, I tried to work on myself and went on dating apps, and went out with DOZENS of guys, however, they were all extremely unattractive and boring. 

My question is: Is it ONLY UGLY guys who don't cheat on their girlfriends? I ask because even though that guy was asking me to cuddle with his girlfriend behind his back, I kind of wish I went for it, and now I've moved out and am sad I will never have a chance with a guy that good-looking and fun and ""bad boyish again.""

On one hand she always texted me right back if I messaged her, and never with one-word responses. She seemed to like the conversation and was really flirty at times. Also, she made me a music mix with songs that obviously suggested she had a crush on me.

However, at the same time the above was happening, she would never text me unless I texted her first. She also never asked a single question about me (our entire conversation revolved around me getting to know her, but she never asked me anything back). 

So finally I just suggested we meet in person. She didn’t give me a definite answer - just kind of an “I’ll get back to you” sort of thing. She’s definitely not shy, so I took this as a sign that she wasn’t interested since Im almost positive she went out with at least one other guy during the time we were talking.

So I basically just stopped messaging her to see if she would text first. She did text once, but we just had a brief exchange and it stopped after that. So I guess that’s that, I just assume she wasn’t into me.

Move on to the 2nd date: we took a walk across a beach at sun set, holding hands and discussed a variety of topics. He wants a LTR and so do I. Then we somehow ended up talking about Michale Jackson’s “the way you make me feel” video for some reason. He comments any guy that tried to approach a girl the way he did in the video would get pepper sprayed and I comment that I also found it annoying. He follows up with “oh you do?” And I replied with “yeah, very much so”. He starts singing the lyrics and basically mimicking what MJ does in the video to me in public.

I'm dating a 30M who is a lawyer. He works very long hours and is essentially in an entry-level role, playing both a lawyer and PA role for his principal lawyer. He always talks about how he has a 5 year plan of becoming partner and that he wants to just smash out his career goals quickly. He still lives at home (as do I, so no issue) and has a 12 year old car. He says he'll buy a new car and his own house once he feels like he can - assuming when he feels like he can spend his money.

I'm 27F and a marketing executive, making about $50k on top of what he makes. We have discussed our salaries before. I'm financially secure and independent (have an investment property and car) so I'm not in any way a burden on him. \[Only providing these details to understand the dynamic between the two of us\]

He told me a while back that he wants to be a provider for his future family and that he just needs time to build his career. Is there an intrinsic need for a male to feel financially secure to progress in relationship?

We met at a party and she was super cute, funny, and flirtatious. We began to start talking, and after a couple of weeks, I owned up to liking her and asking her out. She seemed kinda receptive to the idea, and I definitely thought there was something there. All in all, it was nothing too out of the ordinary.

Since I had met her, however, my ex (who I had a relationship with for nearly 2 years, and loved) came back into my life. That's a whole different story, but long story short, we've had many many conversations about getting back together and making it work. I'm more or less convinced that I want to start over again with my ex. We had a happy relationship, and although there were definitely hiccups, we talked them through and are committed to seeing that they get better.

That being said, I definitely still had a ""crush"" on this other girl I met super recently. My ex and I both had set boundaries around not seeing other people, and working on ourselves so we can be with each other, so talking to this other girl, going out with her, and just having her in my life, knowing I have feelings, feels like cheating.

I told the other girl exactly what I was feeling, that I was planning on getting back together with my ex, and it wouldn't be fair or right keeping her around, knowing that I do somewhat like her. We had a few more conversations, and then a few days later, I completely unadded her and removed her from everything in order to get over her, so I can be with my ex completely.

I didn't ghost her, because I gave her an explanation, but I still do feel as if it was a little too harsh. It would be one thing to just simply not respond, but blocking seems like it might have been too much. I also waited a few days to actually do it after telling her what my intentions were. She was also under the impression that we could stay friends... but being friends with someone you're romantically interested in, while being in a relationship, makes me very uncomfortable. I don't regret what I did, I needed to remove her completely from my life, but I'm also not really in the business of making people feel like shit.

We met, he asked for my number and then started “talking” over a period of 1.5 months 

Now context on me is that I grew up fairly conservative and also used to be bigger. Because of that, not only was I a virgin but hadn’t even kissed anyone before - basically never talked to guys at all. I had gradually been losing weight since college, but really shed a lot over the pandemic. Coming out of the pandemic, I was suddenly attractive and receiving male attention for the first time and it was all really new.

So now this guy was actually pretty hot, tall, great job and had mutual friends and actually showed interest in me? I got invested pretty fast - not in the sense that I thought he was the one I would marry or anything but I did have hope that it would be something more than causal. He was my first kiss and even though I didn’t sleep with him I did tell him that I was a virgin. And while he was really nice about it he also asked me “how long it would take” - that should’ve been my first sign but I clearly I was committed to being a clown. He had never been the best about texting back quickly (would leave me on delivered 12/16 hours at a time) but would still always send memes or ask what I’m doing on the weekends, etc.

Now without getting too into the details but short story is over the course of a few weeks I catch on that he’s not seriously interested in me and was just benching me, and was also interested in the other single girl in my friend group (she’s a lot more flirtatious/always gets male attention - you know the type). It ends pretty awkwardly once this gets exposed and I stop talking to him. Since then we haven’t seen each other but I’ve spent the past 4ish months thinking about the situation every single day. I’ve tried going on a few dates here and there but nobody’s great. I removed him from Instagram so I stop trying to see if he views my stories. Now my best friend who set us up still maintains a good relationship with him and that hurts me a bit. And while I haven’t seen it in front of me, I’m fairly sure he’s actively pursuing my other friend. It’s really hard for me to understand why things switched for him but whether it was my looks/personality/lack of sexual experience it still hurts deeply. This was the first time I put myself out there and I get hurt by this douchebag who faces no consequence - instead I’m the just the bitter loser who can’t get over this situation that most adults would not even bat an eye over. 

I’m just not sure how to move forward here - I know at some point our paths will eventually cross due to our friend groups but I’m not sure how to act in front of him (cold shoulder? friendly but unbothered? Direct and ask for an explanation?) And how do I work on getting over him….and my deeper intimacy and self esteem issues? I really thought that by so many months later I would be over this situation but I still think through it every time my mind is idle and it’s become extremely unhealthy….

Do you have any tips for a first date from tinder? I (25F) recently got out of a 4 year long relationship and I’m trying to meet some new people and have casual fun. 
The thing is I have never really been on a first date, much less one when you’d never seen the person before. My ex bf was my first and we first met through uni so us getting tgt was more organic I guess. 
I’m also quite a shy person so any tips would be welcome. 
The meeting is casual too, we’ll just have some coffee and ice cream in the afternoon so nothing serious. But I’m still very nervous lol

Trying my best to keep the identities secret and my chances alive. 

What a series of unpredictable events! Where should I begin?

**TL;DR**

Back in 2016, I mustered up the courage to ask a girl, we’ll call her D, out on a date by DM’ing her on Facebook. 6 years later, she said yes. 

A bit of a backstory. 

D and I were acquaintances back in our teenage days. We had overlapping social circles in high school although we went to different schools, said hi every now and then if our mutual friends met on a social event, interacted with each other on social media with the occasional reaction to a post. We never developed a real relationship or have had a proper conversation. And just like that, I left for college in 2012. 

**Fast forward four years, it is 2016.** 

I was back in my home country for a couple of months after graduating, getting ready to move to a new country for work. When I landed home in June 2016, I mustered up the courage to ask D out on a date. It was the definition of cold messaging - I opened up Facebook Messenger and typed away. 

The message was a solid paragraph. It was a respectful/sweet kind of DM, no the “hook-up” type. It was direct, bold, and had a bit humor. And I did ask her out on a date using those words. However, I must confess, upon re-reading the text, it was, it is a bit cringe. I can feel the cringe run down my spine every time. So I typed away and hit send. Now it was time to wait. 

Predestinately, I received no reply. Absolute and utter silence.  

Ironically enough, two days after shooting my shot, I was hospitalized for 20 days with one of the worst flair ups caused by my medical condition. It really felt like a heartbreak was manifesting itself physically. Jokes aside, those were some dark days in the hospital. 

**Fast forward two years, it is 2018.** 

I’m visiting home for the first time since I left for work. I stayed with my cousin as I always do when visiting home.  Because he was busy with work, I went to the gym by myself the following morning. 

I finished my workout and sat in front of the mirrors to stretch. An older gentleman sat next to me and through the mirror reflection his shirt caught my eye.

“Your shirt! That’s a rooster isn’t it? I’ve seen it before.” I said curiously. 

His eyes glistened and his jaw dropped. I could visibly see his heart rate increase with the last breaths of my words. 

“You know \[Brand Name\]?! The energy drink?”

“Yes, the energy drink!” I replied excited to match his energy.

“How do you know \[Brand Name\]” he impatiently asked.

“I’ve definitely seen it on my friends’ social media. I grew up here but am only visiting right now so I haven’t tried the drink myself.”

“This is my son’s company! You must know my family. My name is H, H H.”

“I’m X, pleasure.”

Wait a minute. Rooster. Energy Drink. H H. H… H!?

“So how do you know my son!?”

“Actually, I believe I know your daughter. Is she D by any chance?”

“Yes! Are you friends!? Can you remind me of your name?”

Oh Mr. H. Do you want the real truth?! Will you accompany me to the bar to drink my sorrows away? Will you take responsibility for the emotional damage by your daughter?!

Unfortunately, I couldn’t dare tell Mr.H I slid into her daughter’s DMs. Especially because I never got a reply.  

“We’re acquaintances,” I said nervously. “We went to different high schools and had overlapping social circles, but I doubt she’ll remember me.”

Hoping to wrap up the conversation as quick as possible without repeating my name, I politely said, “Mr. H, it’s been an absolute pleasure. I still have a couple of workout routines left to finish. All the best, take care.”

And I was out. Please do not remember my name, Mr. H. 

Imagine the scenes: “Daughter, I met your friend Dari today at the gym!” 

Oh Lord have mercy.

**Fast forward three years and it is 2021.** 

I’m visiting home for the first time since the pandemic hit the world and I’m thrilled to be visiting my cousin and friends. My cousin was in a relationship and wanted to introduce me to his partner, S. As we were discussing our dinner plans, he nonchalantly dropped the following bomb.

“Oh by the way cousin. Did I tell you S and D are best friends?” 

“D? D who?” 

(May I clarify that by this point, it’s been over 5 years since I sent D that message on Facebook. 5 years is a long time).

“DH! DH is S’s best friend!”

Dinner went incredibly well. My cousin and S are a lovely couple but who are we kidding, S couldn’t wait to hear my story. After sharing my turbulent past with D, S pledged her loyalty to me and swore to fight for me stand by me as my wing-woman. In an attempt to comfort me in my defeat, she assured me that most likely D missed the message and didn’t see it at all. Mhm…

**Fast forward another year. It is year 2022.**

As I was aimlessly scrolling down my feed on my phone, I received a private message notification. 

“DH sent you a video. 2min ago.”

Wait, who?! WHAT?! WHO?!

I controlled my urge to immediately open the video and paused. 

Must have to do with my cousin. Maybe S. What a pleasant surprise. 

Play it cool. 

Indeed, it was a short clip of my cousin and S hanging out with D. 

After careful consideration, I decided to take another shot despite the odds. Why not? 

Well, she ghosted me last time and I’m living in a different country… 

But come on really, why not? It’s been over half a decade since the last one, she’s my cousin’s partner’s best friend, she’s beautiful as ever, and I’m single. So with the hope of showing some personality and catalyzing a conversation, I replied to her video by saying:

“I have never been more disappointed of seeing my cousin.”

“HAHAHA what do you mean?!” she replied immediately.

As much as I wish to share every bit of our exchange, I will save you the time and summarize by saying:

I’ve secured a first date with D after 6 years since shooting my shot! 

We flirted (comfortably and lightly), made fun of my missed shot, made fun of how she missed out. She even reopened Facebook to go look at my initial message. I told her I was already best buddies with her dad. I really enjoyed our conversation. 

Only problem is, I’m living in a different country and I have no clue how this will unfold but I guess I have a good reason to make a trip back home.

There was this girl I liked and I told my best friend about it, the guy I do everything with and I’ve  saved him from being kicked off the uni so many times. This girl is know for lifting heavy in the gym( will come back to this) 

I was talking to her for a while in the dms and asked for a hangout and she didn’t seem interested as she just gave the genetic I’ll let you know when I’m free which is a nice way of saying no. 

I called it quits. My friend goes to the same gym as her and I had a feeling they would meet since they both share mutual friends at the gym. So I did tell him if you ever do meet her put to wingman for me. 

This guy meets her and the first thing he says is do you know S( my name) he told me your a big boss at the gym. This like the worst thing to say, firstly it makes me seem like I gossip and secondly I’m sure no girl wants to hear that it probably made her feel Like a dude. 

My other friend said if he was to wingman he would have said dam s wasn’t kidding when he said you were pretty. My other friend said he would started bringing up my achievements like a scholarship in engineering for good grades. 

Which are much better then what my best friend said. I feel like he said the gym stuff to sabotage me. Now the things that bothering me is he asked for her insta. I already have a feeling I know where’s it’s going to go from here. 

This guys always been acting weird, he recently started talking to the guy who got with the girl that I really wanted for the longest and he knows we were both in big competition for that girl and a lot of drama happen over it. 

Additionally, It always seems like every girl I’m interested in he always somehow get their socials. He brags about it too. And sometimes he will a comment about it like he’s bragging. 

I do feel like in general im a jealous person especially when I can’t get something so I don’t know if just me overreacting or if im right in feeling skeptical.

However, I have a strong dislike for one of his female friends and I am finding it hard to accept the situation to the extent I am considering ending it but don't want to lose a nice guy. 

He is great when we are together, we spend our weekends together mostly and have sleepovers twice a week. He is complimentary, my friends like him, and he plans thoughtful dates. He has other female friends who I do not have an issue with. 

He met this girl just a couple of months before me because she lived in his apartment building. They would go out drinking together all the time and she would invite him out with her and her friends. 

It seems like he was speaking to her a lot, almost daily. On maybe our 5th or 6th date, he was texting someone at the dinner table at a restaurant, which I consider rude anyway, but then he said it was his female friend and she was asking him to go for drinks. They are both Latinx and were speaking in Spanish which I don't understand but the messages were full of 😜 😜 emojis. 

I didn't think anything of it then. However after that, TWICE when we were going out, he invited her along. Once I had rushed to meet him when I was with my friends and he did not tell me she was coming with us until we were en route to the bar. She dressed in the absolute skimpiest clothing that just felt inappropriate to meet a friend's new girlfriend. 

I told him I would appreciate knowing next time and didn't understand why this woman was constantly calling/texting/invited on our dates. He assured me there was nothing but friendship between them and he had wanted me to meet his friend. 

I just had a weird vibe about the situation and probably seemed distant after her surprise invitation. He then told me that he understood why it made me uncomfortable and wouldn't speak to her, which I said absolutely was not necessary and that I didn't mind him having female friends but there should be boundaries. He insisted that no, he just met this woman a few months ago and they were not speaking anymore. 

I didn't think anything about it for two weeks until yesterday we were together and she tried to call. He opened his phone to show me a brunch place and their conversation was open so, although I don't have an issue with him speaking to her, I don't like that he lied. He then tells me that she messaged to invite him out and he had not even replied. But I had seen the blue double tick, at which point he changed his story to say that he replied to say that he could not speak to her because I am insecure and felt threatened by her (!!) Why would he say that? 

I feel upset because our time together is amazing but I am tired of this woman always loitering around and think he should have said something to set a boundary. I don't know if I am overreacting. My ex-boyfriend was very much someone who got on better with girls but all of his friends were respectful and did not give me the same weird vibe. 

Even knowing he is with me, she messages him constantly. But him inviting her with us on dates is of equal weirdness to me. 

Last night, he started ranting to say that this was one step away from me controlling who he could and could not speak to, and checking his phone. I would never. Then he said he deleted their whatsapp conversation and changed his phone pin to end the conversation - I would never snoop through his phone and saw that out of he himself unlocking his phone right to their conversation.   


I had stayed at his place over the weekend and this morning, he gave me the silent treatment. I could not be bothered so I just ignored him right back and got an Uber home. Then he messaged me to say he really liked me, didn't like her, etc, etc. I am just tired of it.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1163603,public,self,I don't like one of his female friends,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/tebnot/i_dont_like_one_of_his_female_friends/,no_ads,0,,,,,,

We live in the same state but our cities are about 5 hours away from each other. We have a really good connection, have a lot of similar interests, and our communication is better than most of the peoples that I’ve met on dating apps. 

I brought up the conversation about where we stand and how we feel about each other and she said that she really likes me, has developed feelings for me, that I make her feel comfortable and supported, and that she appreciates how we are. 

However, when I asked her if she was keeping her options open she admitted that even though we do have a great connection and she doesn’t have a connection with anyone else, she still wanted to keep her options open and recommended that I do the same “as we’re still in our 20s and this is a time for us to learn about ourselves and see what kind of people we want around us” which is an understandable statement. 

Whenever I would bring up up meeting she says that she wouldn’t be able to and doesn’t know when we’ll be able to but that “hopefully it will be soon.” The closest time to her being “free” would be 3 months from now. 

She is in a Master’s program so she is usually busy but I feel like after talking for 4 months with someone you claim to really like, some kind of time could be made available especially when we both live in the same state and I’d be willing to make the trip. 

Recently she has become more stressed with her program and other aspects of her life. Our communication has dwindled compared to how it was before, we haven’t FaceTimed in a while and at times not even a goodnight or good-morning text would come from her.  

She acknowledges this and has apologized for being absent in regards to us. She’s stopped calling me cute pet names and the like. I’ve also noticed that even though she claims that she’s gotten even busier and more stressed she still manages to be active on Hinge almost daily.

I am still on Hinge as well, but more so out of boredom than looking for a better alternative than her as I’m very monogamous and usually give most of my focus to only one person at a time. 

I’m a very patient and understanding person but I do still question things here and there like every other human being especially in the online dating scene. 

What should I do here? Should I fall back a little yet continue to be patient and supportive and let time tell where things go? or should I cut it off?

she replies: ""I am busy! jeez""... (and ill be honest, I know her schedule... its not that busy).

I was with a guy who, at the start, seemed too good to be true. But then he slowly started showing his true colors as we got more serious. 

He was possessive and jealous, he would ridicule and criticize me for everything to my clothes and body and hair and even right down to what tv shows/movies I liked to watch. It always had to fall in line with what *he* liked to do or watch because I guess he considered himself the ‘gatekeeper’ on what’s ‘cool’ and ‘fun’—which was basically anything that wasn’t ‘girly’. 

I felt self conscious around him all the time, I stopped talking about anything really in front of friends when he was around because he would look at me like I was making a fool of myself and would openly ridicule me, but then he would get mad at me for ‘not being sociable’ when we went out with friends. It was damned if I did and damned if I didn’t.

He also had horrible hygiene, he was one of those guys who didn’t believe in washing his ass. He would leave his nasty undies on the floor with big skid marks on them. I remember a few times he’d walk past me and I’d catch a whiff of his smelly ass and I’d immediately be turned off. Apparently this is common for guys, according to him?? And it was totally fine for him to fart 24/7, even literally right in my face but if I so much as burped in front of him he’d throw a fit (“Girls shouldn’t do that!!”). 

We finally broke up and I was happy to be free but it left me with a lot of insecurities and I also find it difficult to be attracted to men now, because every time I see a guy I’m attracted too, if he shows even the slightest sign of reminding me of my ex then I lose interest immediately. I can’t check out a guy with a cute ass anymore without suddenly thinking (Eww what if he’s one of those guys who doesn’t wash his ass and has skid marks in his undies?).

His younger 20 year old brother. His brother is dating this girl who has made him change in so many ways. He doesn’t say happy birthday to his family anymore. He doesn’t visit ever. He doesn’t talk to his parents. He gave up his dog to get a dog his girlfriend wanted Instead. He literally has no contact with his family at all.

I told him I’m not a “go with the flow type of person”. I told him we’ve been on quite a few dates and I just wanted to know more. It got awkward. He also said he has deleted the apps and said I didn’t have to. 

A big thing turning me off is he said since we aren’t official I can date other people. Why would he say that if he said he saw something with me in the future. 

The thing is I can’t really date other people if him and I are seeing each so often. I am thinking of pulling/falling back. Everything is going well, but something is telling me I think he wants to maybe have sex (see if we’re sexually compatible) before a relationship. I don’t really know how to ask him.

She always had a close body language, 1/10 did develop subject that we talk about. Most of the talk was small talk.

He didn't text me ever since and I guess that shows he doesn't care lol

I also notice she been a little distant like being dry and hardly hearing from her at some point. One day she told me she needed a break because she was busy with work and school. She removed me from snap and stop talking to me. From the time being I started dating other girls..

Fast forward into this year I've received a message from her on Facebook and I was in shock!! I never thought I'd hear from her again... she ask me can we do some catching up and get coffee. We did all that on the same day and we chatted and chilled.. our second date we went to the park and had a picnic and we sat next to the water. She sat on top of me and started kissing me and told me she missed me, we walk back to my car and she wanted to have s#% but I told her I didn't have any protection and she still wanted to anyway and told me she was on the pill...

So just like before her text our extremely dry and she never wanna talk on the phone or really wanna text. Shell post stuff on her ig and would tell me shes tired but would still post online.

I have been with my partner for a year and a half, met on Bumble. Our time together has been amazing, best time of my life.


But unfortunately two nights ago I was going to sleep and all of a sudden she jumps up panicking saying she has to tell me something, never thought I would honestly hear the words out of her mouth and where they came from, she said, ""I don't think I'm in love with you but I love you"". I was gobsmacked, now she has alot of anxiety issues, we both do, and she constantly worries about her feelings and what is happening around her. 


We went to sleep after crying and coming to an agreement that we would talk about it in the morning (this was at 2am after we finished watching Twilight...). Anyway morning comes and we end up talking, kissing, had sex... this was all confusing even though we came to the conclusion that we would stay together as close companions until she knows who she is and where she is, she is only 20. She also did say she had some feelings come up about someone at work (mainly because she had in common the fact that he is at uni, she gets very excited about university, he does have a girlfriend) and was concerned about that but she thought that was her mind telling her to take time to herself and establish who she is.


What makes our situation different to other situations is that she has been living with me here at home in my parents house since November 2020, we have basically not been separated from eachother since before we started dating (apart from work, however we do work at the same place...). Her mum kicked her out of her house because we were constantly together for the first couple months of dating and she didn't like that she wasn't home to help clean and look after her two younger siblings. So my parents took her in with us, the amazing people they are. On top of that she only just started university last month and has already had to defer because of the extra stress this has put her under.


Since we have started dating she has made amends with her mum and her dad who she hadn't spoken to for two years prior, and she wants to go back and live with her mum and siblings for a little while until she finds her feet. This was the primary reason according to her and she is just in a very confused state at the moment as this morning she woke up not wanting to have any romance at all like we did last night.


I don't know what to do, I have told her that I will wait and she has told me that she is hopeful that reconnecting with her family properly will be what she needed. But I don't know if it is worth it, she is definitely worth it, but the wait may not be depending on how long it is. 


We have established ground rules for our break and have ensured we won't be seeing other people and still keeping in contact as we both don't want anything romantic outside of eachother. I do trust her decision on that as well, she is so kind-hearted but I do believe sometimes she has some mental health issues she needs to sort out, just like myself.


I just don't know what is the right thing to do, our situation seems so different to everything else I have been reading, it doesn't seem like she is doing it to be with someone else, it really seems like she wants to be alone for the first time in nearly two years, which I do understand at times. I do want to wait for her but how long is too long?

I (19f) set up a “date” with this guy (26m) a few days ago, we decided to go for brunch bc he wanted to try out a new restaurant. We end up going to three different restaurants and the wait times are way too long, so we both agree we should just order food and end up deciding to go back to his place (which I know isn’t ideal for a first meet but it isn’t uncommon for me and I didn’t really think anything of it). I get there, he ends up cooking, and we’re having a good time just getting to know eachother when he suddenly brings up that he wants to kiss me. I’m flattered and I tell him I don’t kiss on first dates, I don’t know you!! But he continues bringing it up, weaving it into jokes and after a while it makes me uncomfortable but I try to shake it off. 

Anyways, at this point I notice he wants to get closer to me, and soon he makes the offer to go to his bedroom and relax; which he later explained was due to lack of room on the couch. We start cuddling, amicably, and after a while he very politely asked to put his hand under my shawl, I one upped him by stating I would just take it off for comfort. After a while of cuddling we somehow decided to play his switch, but he just switches cuddling positions to a much more intimate one imo, and I end up kissing him. Big mistake. He then decides that every two seconds is an opportunity to kiss me and he towards the end he even takes it as far as basically dry humping me whilst kissing me, he literally pulls one cup of my bra down to go for my nipple and after I said “no I really can’t” he goes “just let me kiss it”. cringe. I just stared at the ceiling for a couple seconds before it was over. That threw me off because we had a conversation about celibacy and the importance of informed sex before we even left hinge. 

I left and explained to him that the physical contact was just too much and too heavy for me right now,  he apologized but laughingly. I want to bring it up again in the future but don’t really see the benefit? I guess i’m just worried because he seems like a really sweet, genuine guy who I really enjoy.. but some of those actions seem a little sketch.. I feel like some of it is my fault though. I guess I just don’t understand the inconsistencies.

So, she’s not shy around anyone except me. Before I asked her out, she was perfectly normal around me. Now, although I don’t know for sure, I get the sense that she’s overthinking literally everything. 

She loves having conversations with me (she’s constantly smiling and laughing), but she seems like she might be thinking way too much about what to say next. There are also a lot of awkward pauses, most of which are filled by me (not many by her).

Also, she clearly feels uncomfortable starting conversations (irl or otherwise), again, with me but not others. She will often stand or sit near me at work, prompting me to spark a convo, but she never speaks first. And she never texts first, but always replies reasonably quickly, and is much better at carrying on a convo over text. And she never calls me, but always answers my calls. 

Conversely, the problem could be that she has trouble initiating. She might just be pivoting off of whatever I do. I just don’t know!!!

We got back together dated for 2 months, I definitely wasn’t the same girl when we got back because I just didn’t trust him. I was always anticipating a text from him, and always in fear that he would leave without saying anything again. It was hard especially because we were long distance, so I just really wanted to feel like I was truly safe &amp; secure and that if things were to end again it wouldn’t be through ghosting. Unfortunately it did end again through ghosting, but this time I don’t know why. When he ghosted me again, I tried reaching out to him for about a week. I called once, sent paragraphs. I guess it just sucks that you could put so much effort into someone, do you best to make them feel safe and loved and they can just easily dispose of you like you were nothing. 

It’s been almost two months now, and overall I feel glad he ghosted me. I deserve better. However once and a while I experience waves of emotion. Today is one of those days. I don’t really stalk him at all tbh. I get urges sometimes but I rarely even feed into the urges. I just feel so betrayed. This is one of the most hurtful things someone has ever done to me.

Yesterday, he came over and told me that he was considering getting a house with his babymama. It would just be coparenting and he would be helping her out as she wants to leave her boyfriend and doesn’t have anywhere else to go. I acted like I wasn’t bothered and we spent the day together and had fun. 

Tonight over text, I told him that we should end whatever we have going on because I’m not comfortable with him getting a house with his babymama.

Swim- almost my whole swim team are girls, but it’s not really somewhere you go to find dates because I’m more there to swim and be with friends.

Wrestling- mostly guys and girls are strange

Sculpting- by myself and I wish I could find people to make sculptures with, I’m truly alone when it comes to this hobby that I’m obsessed with. 

Painting- same with sculpting 


Working out- individual thing.

The thing is, social aspects of my life aren't that normal, that includes dating, obviously (duh) Dating is hard, right? Now imagine dating when every time people see you in public you're in a wheelchair, all it takes is one look and it's almost as if I'm labeled ""undateable"" immediately, it's like the disability is too much to overlook,  in short, no one has flirted with me, had a crush on me or anything like that, I never came close to even kissing someone... ever. I can't be that ugly, boring, uninteresting, can I? Maybe I am lol  Guess I can't blame anyone, maybe I'd act the same if I was seeing things from a different POV, but it's a crushing feeling that's been hitting me harder as of late, I wish people knew I have romantic wants and needs like everyone else ( again, if this is not the right sub for this post, I'll delete it, no big deal, and I don't see a ""vent"" flair anywhere , so I apologize in advance, appreciate it if you read the whole thing )",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1163657,public,self,I'm tired of feeling undateable,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/teitm0/im_tired_of_feeling_undateable/,no_ads,0,,,,,,

Although I approached her first because she was really pretty  I soon realised she is definitely not my type when it comes to her mindset and way of living and terminated the thought of ever dating her. She coincidentally lives very close by to my place so I used to drop her everyday. We grew close as time went on and used to be together at all times. Even if some of her things really infuriated me some of her other points were very close to me. We almost developed telepathic connection where we used to complete or simultaneously say out loud our statements. The thing is recently we went for a tour where she fell sick. Extremely sick. And I was more worried than I would have liked to be. Everytime she wasn't in front of me I felt like I am doing something wrong and I should be with her. I sat by her for two nights without sleeping much at all making sure she was okay. You could almost argue that I was like a parent to a child. When she was crying because she was sick I felt My heart shattered over and over again. And mind you I have made it very clear that I was interested in girls other than her since long back and she has also been dating for a while. Now that I look back at things I have done everything with her which would fullfill my ideal date expectations every single time except the physical aspects of it. So right now I have this boatload of emotions arguing with my logical part of brain that I may really be into her. I am really confused.
