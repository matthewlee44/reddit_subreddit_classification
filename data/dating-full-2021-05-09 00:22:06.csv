There‚Äôs often piles and piles of sex negativity, especially in more puritanical traditions, and women probably get the brunt of it. Though my experience being raised that way as a man really fucked me up too. So it‚Äôs not like it was like that for women and cake for men. Seeing the way the women were treated in my upbringing, I‚Äôll agree that they probably ended up even more emotionally abused by the process. And, as an extension of all of that shit, women that were discovered to be promiscuous were treated absolutely terribly. Whereas high status men that achieved promiscuity were able to hide it and suffer very little backlash. I don‚Äôt think that was all men though to be fair. That was just the ones at the top that were getting fucked non-stop.

Nowadays I feel like there‚Äôs an new extension to this where some women feel that promiscuous men are celebrated by society so promiscuous women should be celebrated too. First of all, sex doesn‚Äôt need to be all that. Maybe no one is a winner or should be celebrated by everyone for having lots and lots of sex. Maybe that‚Äôs just another way to be and it doesn‚Äôt mean anything. Anyone taking that attitude is basically wanting to become a new version of those shitty men from the old days that celebrated themselves while women were treated like shit. And what a small number of toxic fuckboys currently tell themselves they are. Celebrated for all the fucking they do. It‚Äôs offensive bullshit to both women and the majority of men.

Don‚Äôt be like those assholes. Because that basically will translate to the majority of men, the ones that have never been capable of being promiscuous like that in the first place, will be treated like absolute shit by everybody. And that‚Äôs some shit.

Everyone just needs to be honest and stop pumping themselves and let the truth out. How many people you fuck doesn‚Äôt mean jack shit. Particularly in a world with 7-8 billion people.

I was wondering about the experiences some of you have had with going on dates with multiple people. It‚Äôs been a few months since my ex and I broke up and I‚Äôve been getting back in the dating scene. I realized in the past that I always found ONE person to talk to at a time and then dated them until it either became official or we just didn‚Äôt work out, whatever. But now I‚Äôm interested in 3 people and while I was thinking about who to pursue, I realized maybe I don‚Äôt have to make that choice yet ? Haha I‚Äôve been on 1 date with 2 of them and haven‚Äôt been on one yet with the 3rd. I dont plan on sleeping with any of them of course until I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre the one I actually wanna get serious with. But how many dates would be fair before calling it quits with 2 of them?

Ugh!!! I fucking hate this shit. I was dating a man I REALLYYY liked. He made me feel something I haven't felt in a while and when he kissed me I would melt and I've never felt that before.

A few days after our first date I got upset with him when he wouldn't be honest about his past FWB even when i asked him straight up. He basically made me feel like I was dumb for assuming the woman who was trash tweeting about him was the one he was talking about when he told me he ended the FWB thing because he was ""tired of the drama"".

He came back a few days after me leaving him alone saying he missed me and had a long talk about it all. I asked him if they would ever be FWB again since it was a ""on again, off again"" thing and he said no. Ok, cool. Resumed dating.

Tonight I just feel like that mess isn't over. 2 days ago he expressed he was in a depressive mood and so I gave him space. We didn't speak for the entire day yesterday but I made sure to ask him how he's feeling last night at 9. He didn't reply for the entire day today and I'm cool with it because, hey, focus on your mental, take your time. But imagine my surprise and hurt when I log onto twitter tonight and see he's tweeting and interacting with that same FWB tweets but couldn't even bother to say ""yh"" or ""nope"" to my text.

I practice not taking things personally and letting things flow but wow is this bothering me. I know I'm not the problem here and everyone has their someone so maybe he isn't mine but wtf bro, I liked this man. Now I'm gonna have to deal with him running through my mind for the next 3 days because that ex FWB of his can be so messy and I hate drama so I'd rather remove myself.

I recently started talking to someone and we went on our second date tonight. It was fun and we made out a little at the end. The thing is, is that I‚Äôm not really that physically attracted to her. I mean, she‚Äôs not bad looking and she‚Äôs fun to talk to and we get along, it‚Äôs just that I‚Äôm not that attracted to her. 
It gets a little more complicated, I recently fell for one of my friends in my class. I told her that I had feelings for her and she said she wasn‚Äôt in a place to date and she wanted to remain friends. This was when the girl I‚Äôm not that physically attracted to started texting me. I told the friend I fell for that I needed space so I could really try with the new girl. 
I guess I‚Äôm just conflicted about what I should do. Part of me wants to keep trying with the new girl despite me not being super into her looks. I feel like it‚Äôs kinda shallow and there‚Äôs way more to a person than just their looks. Also, She may also help me get over the friend i fell for. The other part of me feels like attraction is important and that I may be starting something with the wrong intentions. Like I‚Äôm just using her to get over my friend. Also, I‚Äôm in grad school so it‚Äôs kinda hard to go out and meet people especially with covid. I feel like I‚Äôm also starting this cause I‚Äôm kinda bored and lonely and want someone to connect with. Who knows what if it grows into something good?

There are a finite number of men and women in each city or area. In most places there are more single men than more single women because there are more men in general and also many women end up sharing the same guys. This is not my opinion but simple fact.

It is also a fact that there is a dating hierarchy for men which goes:

1) White men at the top

2) Hispanic men second (no surprise, they are half white)

3) Black men third

4) Asian/Indian guys last

This is not a hierarchy created by magic, Hollywood, or out of thin air. It is a hierarchy created by women and their dating preferences/requirements.

I have noticed it is no longer taboo or controversial to talk about the fact that if you are an average straight Asian/Indian guy you will likely have a very poor time dating.

Yet if you bring up the fact that this happens because most women are so fixated on dating only white men, that is still taboo to discuss.

How does that make sense? If there are finite number of men and women and most women want to date one race of men (white), then by definition, that is what creates the disadvantage for another race of men.

It's also interesting to note that men don't have apply the same racial hierarchies for women. In dating studies, white, Asian, and Hispanic women do equally well. Only black women do worse, and they still do better than even the whitest men. So it's not an ""everyone does it"" thing. It's specifically women's behavior.

Will this ever be okay to talk about? Or are we supposed to pretend it's not the reality forever? Is the problem that we might offend a woman to point out the truth and that in itself is taboo? 

I don't see anyone having a problem pointing out men's issues in dating. If a man does or says something offensive and someone posts about it they are guaranteed thousands of upvotes. Yet if you talk about anything negative women are doing, you will likely just get banned.

Hence now I invest my time in myself, building new skills etc. I am not as available as I used to earlier. Now I find, my availability have also been complained about and thus leading to rejection. How should I balance this? Meaning how much time should I invest in someone over phone, given the possibility of seeing each other are zero for the near future?

I don't have her in any classes this year and don't really get a chance to talk to her in school, although she lives very close to me, and is as far as I know one of the only people our age in my neighborhood. I'm planning on trying to talk to her and hopefully build a relationship with her this summer, although I don't exactly know how I'm going to do that.

My plan as of right now is to dm her and claim someone told me she lives in my neighborhood, and use that as an excuse to ask her to hang out sometime and go from there. While I'm not completely confident this would work, I feel it is my best shot at getting to see her in person this summer, and would like to hear your thoughts and feedback on this plan. I'm open to other suggestions as to how I should get the ball rolling, and am really hoping things will work out this summer.

(Just another note, it'll likely be a few weeks before I actually put my plan into action.

I've been seeing a guy for a couple of times a month for the last year and a half. We've never dated officially, every time I expressed I wanted more, he said he wasn't ready for a relationship (we met a week after his break up after 6y relationship). I tried dating different ppl, sometimes for a couple of dates, sometimes for a month, but I always ended up spending time with the guy, we called each other from time to time, we can talk for hours and we like spending time together. For a year we also slept together, but since September, when I said I wanted more and he refused, we stopped. I decided to respect his space. I didn't want to lose what we have, but I forbid myself to write or call him and we only talked when he contacted me. Last week we hung out and he stayed at my place until 2am and when I didn't want him to go home, he told me he started dating someone and they are in a relationship. I would normally let him leave, but this is a fourth guy in my life, who told me I'm great and loves spending time with me, but couldn't be with me and then just got in a serious relationship with someone else and stayed with them for years. I understand that that's completely natural in a dating world. Im just slowly stopping believing, that the problem is not me. We talked for two hours with the last guy and he was telling me how much he wants to stay in contact and the only reason we're not together is the timing/concept of our meeting. I don't want to do something I will regret later, but he wrote to me 3times since that evening and I can't bear to even reply to him. I had to block my last ex because it was too painful for me and I guess I'll have to do the same thing here, sometimes time is the only thing that helps. I know it's important to keep trying and looking, I just feel like I can't do this again, because it's gonna be the same shit all over again, if I don't change something. And I don't know what to change and I sometimes I feel like there's something really off with me and noone's telling me. Was I supposed to push him more? Was I supposed to cut him off sooner? I know I can't do anything about how people see and feel about me, what exactly do I have power over tho? I exercise and run, I'm in therapy, I'm in school and I work, I love my friends and I think I could make all the guys I loved laugh.

The dates went well, but because of our situation at work (there is a policy against people in the same team dating), she decided that she wasn‚Äôt prepared to take the risk of our co-workers finding out about us and that she only wants a relationship that she can be fully open about. Although I would have been prepared to keep it on the downlow, since I am looking to change jobs over the next few months (she doesn‚Äôt know this), I respected her decision.

After this, we agreed that a lot of the things we were doing (such as the flirting, messages of a particular nature, going for our lunch breaks together) would stop, but otherwise we would stay friendly.

For the first few weeks, this all worked well. We would have the odd message exchange outside of work, but it never went beyond the sort of messages you would send as friends. 

This has all changed over the past couple of weeks, though. She has started messaging me several times a day, before and after work (almost always initiated by her). She is sending me selfies. Her messages contain things like ‚Äúmiss you‚Äù and ‚Äúyou‚Äôre amazing‚Äù. She is constantly asking me what I‚Äôm doing, and she left me a drunk voice message last weekend in which she said I was the type of person she could see herself marrying. She also says I‚Äôm often the last person she speaks to at night. Beyond that, there is nothing particularly flirty about her messages, but the sheer volume of them is at a level I would only really expect of a woman I was actually seeing or in a relationship with.

The situation has left me struggling with how best to move forward. I still have the feelings for her that I did while we were dating, and I‚Äôm fairly certain from the way she‚Äôs messaging me that she still likes me too. However, I am also wary of the fact that it was her who made the decision not to take things further, and I feel like if she has had a change of heart, then she has to tell me that. I just have that nagging doubt that if I try to pursue things again, we will end up in the same situation a few weeks down the line where she says that she doesn‚Äôt want to risk it because of work, and all I‚Äôll be doing is setting myself up for more hurt. Another part of me wants to move on completely, but if I freeze her out and stop talking to her, it‚Äôs likely to cause problems at the office.

Every time I post a picture on there, my partner tells me to take it down because my partner is ""uncomfortable"". One day, after a fit of frustration following me posting a picture, my partner said, ""Just do whatever you want."" Keep in mind, just a few days ago my partner told me to post a picture to my Snapchat story (which, albeit, is private) to show everyone how much more attractive I've gotten.

Yesterday, I posted a picture of myself on my Twitter for my birthday. My partner saw yesterday's picture and got enraged, saying that I don't respect the fact that posting these pictures hurts them and makes them extremely uncomfortable. I then responded by saying posting pictures of MYSELF is my choice and a reflection of my autonomy. My partner replied by asking how could I not give up this one thing because it's hurting them. I brought up the fact that this comes off as controlling. My partner agreed, but attempted to justify it by saying it's the one thing in our relationship that is controlling. 

I've tried to compromise by telling my partner that I'll keep my Twitter private for as long as the pictures are up (they're never up for longer than 24h anyway). My partner simply replied that I can't ""force"" them to make a compromise because they've made too many compromises in the past (my partner used to attempt to control where I went and what I wore, until I told them it made me uncomfortable and then they stopped and are now referring to this as a compromise). 

Finally, my partner brought up the fact that I'm controlling in the way that I don't want them to speak to their ex (who they cheated on me with and are still in love with) so we can focus on healing our relationship and so that they don't fall in love deeper with their ex. My partner said if they could give up talking to their ex, then I could give up this one thing for the sake of our relationship.

What do I do?

Before COVID-19 i had a crush on a guy. We would briefly talk before and after class. Just for a minute or two. One day he said we should do something together and I was really excited. We got each others phone numbers and texted a little. One day he just stopped replying however he wold bring up things in person that I would text. We went our separate ways and I didn‚Äôt see or hear from him in about 6 months however I was not able to get him off my mind so I asked him out. That didn‚Äôt go well at all as he told me I barely knew him and all I knew was his name. So a big no. I felt hurt for a do and moved on with my life. About another 6 months pass and he texted me and apologized for how rude he was rejecting me. He also asked me out for coffee, I was thinking what was the worst that can happen, we had coffee and it was fun. He was cool. After we schedule another date. The day of that came and he left me standing in the park, he thought it was the next day so we rescheduled. The second one went amazing and we kissed and left it on we want to see each other again so we made plans for in two weeks. A few days before I checked in we were still good to go. The the day of the date came and about an hour before he told me that he had a family emergency and rescheduled for the next day. The next day about an hour before he told me he had a doctors appointment and rescheduled for two weeks and told me he couldn‚Äôt do it sooner because he was studying for finals. The day of the date came and I had moved my schedule and turned down a sift at work to go on it. But he wrote me about two hours before and told me it wasn‚Äôt going to work out because we were both to busy. I was shocked to say the least as the day before we said we were both looking forward to this. I told him if he wants me to wait that is fine. He said that we can keep checking in but for now he doesn‚Äôt think it can. I wish just then and there he would have said it can‚Äôt work instead of wrapping it up in business. Now I understand I am busy, I run a Business full time and work a part time job well having an internship. But at date two I am not going to change my entire schedule for someone. So a few weeks go by and I can‚Äôt get over this person. I still think that there are feelings left for him. So I wrote him and said I was sorry for how busy I was and that if he would like to do something again to let me know and that if this is over that is fine. At this point I just wanted a straight answer, nothing wrapped up in other reasons because my mind will spiral then. He wrote me and just said, I understand. I asked again if he wanted to do something, no reply. Another week passed and I wrote again saying that I would like to know if he wants me to wait or if this is over. Deep done I had know it was over since he cancel the second time but I just wanted a straight answer. And boy did I get one. He told me that he tried to be as nice as possible to protect both of our feelings but I didn‚Äôt get the hint. And that to please stop texting me and good by.

We made out a little, ordered late night Dominos pizza and he slept over. He asked me about my previous relationship, and he told me his. Found out he was cheated on in his last relationship back in high school. Felt like he was trying to be open with me. He then hung out at my place until noon the next day and I made pancakes for us. We had a chill morning.

When he left I figured maybe this was just a one time thing, until he messaged me asking to go to karaoke together. We ended up going to a cafe and then doing karaoke. We held hands out and about and we kissed in the karaoke booth. We even sang this really famous Japanese love song/duet together called Uchiage Hanabi Êâì‰∏äËä±ÁÅ´ (great song btw lol). Didn't feel like a fling. 

We set up another date to watch a drama at my place and when we met up at the station, he took my hand and even did the whole thing where he walked on my left side so he was walking on the side where cars drive by. We watched a bit of the drama, I made us tacos, and things seemed great. He stayed over again and we ended up having sex early in the morning. TMI: I was a virgin (by choice üôÉ) and it was good (surprisingly no pain) and he stayed again until around noon the next day. 

My birthday was coming up the next weekend and he was all ""we should do something special"" and I we were planning on going out to a cafe or something. He then found out he got requested for work (his job wasn't the typical Mon-Fri 9-5 job) so we could figure something out as like a belated birthday. 

My birthday came around and he texted me Happy Birthday and then the next day or so - radio silence. We use the LINE app here so I didn't know if he blocked me or just hadn't read the message so I checked Instagram and it no longer showed him following me nor me following him and his account was now privated. 

I messaged him and he gave me a really BS apology saying he found someone else but really enjoyed our time together, etc. Does this sound like ""bad timing"" (ie me being the second lead - if this were a K-Drama lol) or did I miss a warning sign? 

I had tagged him in one post from when we went out to eat at the cafe and I just wonder if he is a sleaze who had a girl and just wanted to get with a foreigner and she happened to find out about it or something...

Then it moved to just late night texts, and still seems to be that way, yet whenever it starts to get good and I think there could be something more, she stops communicating as if all the sudden she doesn‚Äôt want to hang out. I know she is leaving in the next couple months so I feel like it‚Äôs pointless to even try and start anything more, but I just feel lost and confused on what to do. 

I expressed my feelings for her a while back, but havn‚Äôt anymore because she never reciprocated them. She acts like she wants more than just sex, but its been 5 months and I‚Äôm in the same situation.

I‚Äôve though of a few ideas

1. Just stop communicating with her

2. Text and tell her I dont wanna see her anymore. 

3. Try to express my feelings one last time

4. Try to plan a date
