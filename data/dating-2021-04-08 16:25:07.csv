1,mn2106,1617917418,"I can’t tell if he is just busy, or busy and uninterested? Should I text him?","
I went on two dates with a guy recently (first being virtual, second in person). We’re both late 20s.

And I felt we really hit off. We kissed at the end of our second date, and he asked me to let him know when I was back from my upcoming long weekend trip. I was really excited about this guy! Which is rare for me.

For context, he is finishing up med school, which I know means he doesn’t have a ton of time, and has a crazy schedule.

I texted him I was back, he said excitedly welcome home and all that, we texted and then he dropped off for two days. I followed up saying let me know if you want to get together when you’re free next! He apologized for a busy few days with work, and said he had plans in his one day off for the coming weekend, but would let me know. And then said welcome back again, hope it’s good to be home, a generally nice message. I said great!

Anyways that was now a week ago. I have not heard from him since. I haven’t texted him either, not wanting to be a bother, or for everything to be one sided. I realize even though he was responsive, I also was the one who asked for the first two dates. He seems like such a great nice guy, and I know he is busy... but I can’t tell if he is just busy or busy and uninterested. Should I at this point send him a text, just a joke or saying hope you’re weeks not been too bad, or should I just leave the ball entirely in his court and accept that I probably won’t hear from him?

TLDR: should I text him after a week of radio silence?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mn2106/i_cant_tell_if_he_is_just_busy_or_busy_and/

6,mn2xij,1617920014,Dear Men: women have just as many crazy weird or even unwanted views and insecurities when it comes towards dating and men.,"Which again is something I think a lot of young men really need to internalize to help them not pedalize women or let them get away with bad behavior.

When I was younger I thought that women could get away with anything and this led to my own pedalization and that is because of how men and women are raised

I was raised very matriarchal in the black community surrounded by nothing but women on both sides and I had mostly women as authority figures. Questioning a woman or questioning her experience or anything like that was forbidden especially in my little precocious mind.

It wasn't until I gradually got older and started interacting with women more closely is that I kept realizing just how much women have weird or crazy views of men.


I have literally turned off potential love interest because I am not a thing and this is coming from their own words

I've had women think that I wanted to sleep with them or even something unrelated to sex like sell them something just from the simple act of talking to them


I've had some girl say that their vagina stank even when it didn't.

I had an ex swear that her right breast look bigger than the other one even though to me it didn't.

The point is is that women have an advantage as that they don't have to pursue so it's extra anxiety and pressure on the man until we can change this but something that has helped me with approaching is to remind myself that this woman is filled with insecurities and doubts and imperfections just like you are.

And some of these insecurities and doubts are so unwarranted or even come from a place at which you probably don't understand but to this individual girl it does.

I had a date with an older woman who was insecure that she was super thick even though I am totally into those body types

And the list goes on and it has been a really humbling and a little bit of a relief for me because I spent years wondering why I was inside of an abusive relationship after being the most respectful. I kept going over and over in my head what I was doing wrong until I realized that there is no such thing as doing right or wrong especially when it comes to dating.

Lucy will think that your belly fat is cute while Amy may think it's an attractive.

And this isn't a job at women as I think a lot of men and women really need to understand that the person they are dating is a human and really isn't any better or worse than them.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mn2xij/dear_men_women_have_just_as_many_crazy_weird_or/

I’m 25 and never had a Boyfriend and I’m scared. I’m independent, friendly, I’ve worked on myself for years and I’m happy about myself.

I’ve just always wanted to meet someone but I’ve never had mutual interest from a guy. Every time I get close to a guy, they have to move away or they meet someone else. I must have liked about 20 guys in this way and then rejected. Even men that chased me when I was 21, would ghost me. It’s really making me worry as I’m lonely, I live alone and want someone whose always around for holidays and fun times. I have a lot of love to give.

I’ve even tried the dating apps but the problem for me is I’m attracted to personality and I can’t gage that from texting. Texting is so boring and I’m so bad at it. I get ghosted a lot after dates

I was upset last year cause it was going well with a guy from bumble, we really had fun dates and amazing convo and chemistry and then he ghosted me. I can now see he’s dating a girl who has lip fillers, boob job, false eyelashes and really fashionable. But I’m more natural but i dress well so I’m maybe wondering I’m just not good enough for anyone

I thought guys were meant to be all over you at this age, but I don’t get anyone show me interest.

5 years ago I was upset to never experience love, and 5 years later it’s not happened. Everyone around me seems to find nice guys so easily whilst I’m invisible.

However, since 3 days ago, I have been practically blanked since. One of her friends checked in on me to see how things were going and even she was surprised by this. She was still in contact and could receive replies instantaneous with her. I asked her to ask if she still had interest in me; she replied that she did essentially (much more detail but for ease). 
Now I don’t get how I can be blanked while this person is apparently obsessed with me? I hope this isn’t, in her mind, one of them childish ways to test someone.

16,mn4sly,1617925830,"Blew it on first date, friend-zoned(?) and how to get out of it","Last fall, I (35m) had recently gone through a breakup and was pretty  upset, along with being in the middle of quarantine.  I downloaded  Tinder and  though I suppose I didn't actually plan on meeting anyone, I  happened to  talk with who I'd describe as my absolute dream woman  (also 35f).

Between  the  post-breakup blues and how everyone felt about quarantine back  then, I  was pretty wishy-washy about meeting up and pushed it back  multiple  times.  Eventually, after a month and a half, we met at a  coffee shop  and chatted for an hour.  She was great, even better than I  expected,  but I know I came across as timid, low-energy, nervous (first   first-date in a long time and I'm not the most confident or experienced   dater).  I didn't flirt, get close to her, etc... I was boring and   fumbled it bad.

Afterwards I got a   fairly typical ""you seem like a nice guy but I don't feel a  connection""  type txt.  I fumbled that too, asking questions about  getting feedback  and all.  Pretty embarrassing and needy.  Since then,  I've sent her a  couple txts ""hey how were your holidays"" type stuff,  didn't get much  response, and eventually got the hint and deleted her  number.

Then  randomly a few weeks  ago, I get a txt from her.  She asks me if I'd  like to join her to go  for a hike (a big hobby of hers and one I had  expressed interest in).   I'm in a much better mood these days, have  gotten in better shape and  some confidence back, things are looking much  more promising about  covid, etc.  I jump at the opportunity, say yes,  and we meet up the  following weekend and spend the entire morning  together.

I  was pretty confident,  fun, easy-going and didn't bring up anything  from before.  Didn't flirt  with her or anything... didn't want to make  her uncomfortable out in the  woods with a guy she barely knew.  Just  approached it as a good chance  to get to know her better and enjoy the  day (turns out we actually have a  lot in common and have very easy  conversation).

Afterwards,  I let  her be... to show I can be less needy and desperate as I had  been.  2  weeks later, I hear from her again.  She wants to do another  hike.  We  do it last weekend and it goes very similar to the first.

I   don't really know what to make of this situation.  I'd be thrilled to   go on a date with her or something but she had made it abundantly clear   she was rejecting me last fall and I don't want to come across as the   guy who just doesn't get it.... and blow it with someone who might just   want to be an occasional hiking buddy (which, if thats all this is  going  to be, I'd be happy with too).

I geek over every new suitor. I see potential vs face value. I'm willing to compromise a little of myself to make something work. 

Luckily, as I get older I'm doing better at pulling away, but that initial whirlwind still consumes me. I adore everything about the new person in my life and want it to work and to be my happily ever after. 

Seriously... wtf!! Please tell me how to make this stop. I'm desperate at this point. Dating hurts. It's exhausting me. I keep taking breaks, reassessing basic traits to look for, finding me, self-care all that bs, but here I am again happily in a situation where I'm afraid to even ask for exclusivity because I'm just fun and it won't go to the next level. 

Background info: I'm a single mom (31). Intermediate/senior level, homeowner, MBA, great at investing, run several businesses. City girl spunk with a southern heart. Extremely affectionate, great conversation, well-traveled.  I hear so much that I'm the package outside of the kid thing (I never introduce any dates to my kids btw... ever! and it's so hard keeping those worlds separate 😔). I make men feel good and confident emotionally,  my energy is great to be around, arm candy, etc.... blah,, blah,, blah... I've heard it over and over again. 

With my current guy, I'm not ready for it to end because I'm so happy with him and vice versa but like I said it won't pass the surface of dating. Excellent guy but I can't see him as a step dad and that epiphany has me in the blues.  I'm trying to look at him as just fun on my end too, but I can't. I want the full, real thing.  I'm not the type that can entertain multiple men either, but I need to move on and can't.

He said he wanted to go slow, which is perfect for me, and so we've just been talking, every single day.

It's going to be about a month of talking by the time we can actually go out because of finals and his thesis, and clearly we both like each other. He's said how much he can't wait to meet me, but I'm nervous.

Previous dates it has simply been the anxiety of the date itself, but I feel like we're so compatible and interested in each other that I'm petrified I'm going to fuck up a good thing.

How do I translate talking every day into an in person date? How do I allow myself to just enjoy the date and not feel the pressure weighing me down and dampening the chemistry?

I’m not going to lie; when you said you wished we had this conversation a year and a half ago, I secretly wished the same. Because even though the years have flown by, in that moment, it felt like we had never broken up. In hindsight; I would have married you. And because I have so love for you, I will respect the relationship you have with your current partner. While I no pleasure in saying this, I know she is better fit for you. Which is I established the boundaries between us and expressed my concerns to you. My intention was never to gossip about you behind your back. However, your girlfriend and I knew you weren’t being completely honest with us. Your girlfriend is extremely devoted to your relationship, she would do anything to  keep you around. I don’t want to hurt your feelings, or be the source of anymore regret. I love you, so I’m willing to let you go. Please forgive me, and accept that what I did was for the best.

I now know that she was extremely nervous, mainly at the idea of meeting a male stranger and so she was open in her answers, but looked frightened the whole time. I tried my best to make her comfortable, and felt like I came across as friendly and caring from the start. She texted after the date that she wanted to see me again. We eventually planned to go to a museum two weeks after our first date. In the meantime, we are texting every day, and ended up texting every day for over two months, which in my mind is a good sign. On the Friday night the week in between our first two dates, she said she wanted to hang out after saying she did not want to. I said I would also hang out, and then she proceeded to panic over text and ultimately said she did not want to hang out too often yet because she did not want to seem too interested, because ""I seemed interested."" At this point, I barely knew her, and was interested in seeing her again, but in no way had strong feelings or thoughts about her. So this was very confusing to me, but I figured she was just nervous, and I was nice about it.

The 2nd date was considerably better, and we ended up getting lunch and then walking around the museum for 4-5 hours. It went by in a flash. We talked the whole time, I still was asking more questions than she was, but I was starting to feel more interested in her. Then in the coming days, it became clear over text that I remembered more about what we'd talked about than she had, and she came out and said she is talking to and dating multiple guys. She expressed she had never done it before now, and that it was hard to connect with me because of that. I was honest back and said I was only seeing her, and that made her nervous. We agreed that it is fine that we are both doing what we wanted, but I lowered my expectations of what could happen because of this.

Date 3 we met up for lunch, another two weeks after the 2nd date. Sat for a couple of hours, conversation was great. We then walked around the city and we walked by a movie theatre. Obviously going to the movies during COVID is new for everyone, and she asked if I wanted to see a movie, and we went to it. Then she picked out the tickets and picked the back row. In my male mind, I figured she was a little interested in kissing because of this, and plus the movie we picked was like an hour away from when we bought the tickets. So she initiated the movie + waiting for it together in the lobby + back row. The movie went by, and we both did not take our masks off, so no kiss. I did not know if she wanted me to make a move, so at the end of the date when I walked her to her place, I asked if she wanted to kiss. She said no, but it's not because of me, she just was not ready. I felt a little awkward but was ok with it. 

We then agreed to go to dinner and a drive-in movie the next weekend. So since she was willing to hang out two straight weekends, I felt good. We are still texting every day, and a lot, not just a few messages. The drive-in got postponed due to weather, and then I asked if she wanted to do something else. She said no. Then I asked if she would go to the drive-in next weekend and she said she might have to work both days (she works weekends, not an excuse). So I openly said, I don't know if I want our dates to be so spread out. She said she was not willing to meet up more frequently, and that she did not want to seem too interested. This confused me, because she was willing to go on a date and the only reason we did not was because of the weather. Nevertheless, we put this conversation behind us.

We ended up going to the drive-in the next weekend. So 4 dates in 7 weeks. We got dinner first. I brought blankets and pillows and she willingly used them and we shared the blankets. We saw a kids movie because we both enjoy Disney, and at some point, I asked if she wanted to hold hands. She said yes, and seemed into it. We snuggled for a few minutes, and then the movie ended. After the movie, I asked if she wanted to do something else, like bowling or just getting dessert somewhere. She said no, and I drove her home. She used my phone to play the music, and the conversation was great on the way home, not awkward. I asked to kiss again when we said goodbye, and she said no because she was scared she would be a bad kisser. I was in shock of this, and I told her that is so sweet and it's totally ok to wait until she was ready. Over text the next day, she said she could kiss me, and asked if she thought less of me because she was scared. So she is REALLY inexperienced. I did not know that at the start, and wish I had. 

Her birthday was the next week, and I asked if she wanted to get take-out and eat outside that Friday. I wanted to get her favorite food (mac and cheese), cheese fries, which she ordered on our first date, and a slice of birthday cake. So I get the food, pick her up, and we go to this little crappy city beach. We ate outside, it got cold and dark, and she asked if I wanted to just sit in my car and talk, because she likes sitting in cars and wanted to talk and not go anywhere. So we found a place to park and sat for around 2 hours talking. Our conversation was a mix of personal topics and just light-hearted, goofy topics. She said she wanted to kiss, and she did not know what to do, so she closed her eyes and said I can do whatever and go from there. I did a peck, and then she initiated a make-out. I enjoyed it, and felt like there was some spark. Then I closed my eyes and let her do whatever, and she grabbed by face and aggressively kissed me. I felt good about this, especially since kissing is clearly a big deal for her. I brought up that I really enjoy going on dates, and I am happy our lives crossed paths. We then held hands and kept talking until we decided to go. So I dropped her off, asked for a  goodnight kiss, and she said no again. I felt a little awkward, because she seemed so into kissing, but I considered this a successful date.

At this point, I figured we are pretty close. I would not hold hands on two dates with someone I was not interested in. We text about personal problems a lot, and she often would say things about happiness and fulfillment/ social media addiction/ longing for more. I figured since she brought up these topics, she wanted me to be supportive and caring. So one morning I texted her that she makes me happy. Maybe that was inappropriate of me, but I meant it. I was invested in her happiness, and really enjoyed being together. She said she appreciated that message and our texting was normal. Then two weeks later, we plan to get dinner again and she wanted to go for a walk after to talk. So we get dinner, and at this point we seemed so comfortable with each other. No date nerves, just us talking. On the date, she talked a lot about problems at work and I could see it was upsetting for her. Then we go for a walk. I asked if she wanted my jacket, she said no. We still talked normally on the walk, and it was pleasant. Then I drive her home again, and figured she did not want to kiss, and I did not want to put pressure on her again. She clearly looked like something was off when we said bye, and I noticed. So that next morning, I sent a text saying I care about her, and I want to continue to talk about her issues if she wants to, and I don't want her to be unhappy. She said she appreciated that, but she was uncertain and scared. That could mean anything to me. Either she is still deciding if she likes me as a potential boyfriend, or if she is scared things are moving too fast for her. She said she was overwhelmed and needed time to think, so we didn't text for a week.

A week later, she says ""I am just not ready to date right now."" She added that she knows that is a classic excuse, but she actually means it, and is not talking to anyone else either. She said ""She chose herself."" I could not hide that I was upset. We talked on the phone for an hour, and she explained it's hard for her to date on apps because she doesn't think she could date someone she is not friends with. She added she doesn't think she is feeling anything for me at the level that I am towards her. She doesn't view me as a friend yet, and doesn't think she knows me that well. So it makes sense if her feelings are less because of that. In my mind, texting every day for 60+ days, and 6 pretty long dates is clearly enough time to get to know someone. We seemed so close to forming a strong emotional connection, so this hurt me badly. My interest in her had gone up after each date, and I fear my messages about caring about her put too much pressure on her.  

I have spent the past week very sad over this. We have texted a little about it, which we both know is bad. I have expressed that she is my favorite person I have ever dated, and feel like we have so much potential. Am I a dick for assuming we were more than we are? She said that she was texting other people throughout all of this, which surprised me. For some reason, I thought by our 5th date when we hung out after her birthday, that maybe she was only talking to me. Is 2+ months and 6 dates enough time to be genuinely upset over this? I am not infatuated with her, I know that. I truly like her as a person, and see how great of a person she is. Her happiness makes me happy. Is it too early to be feeling that? She added that she has been uncertain about us from the start and that I was good at convincing her to go on dates. I don't think that's fair, as the only times she expressed uncertainly were when she took back something she said about wanting to hang out. She essentially led me on without meaning to, but also is it my fault for thinking it was going so well. Is it normal to go on that many dates and text this much just to figure out if you like someone? If anyone read this, thank you for making it to the end, and I could use someone to talk to.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mn5sd0/i_am_extremely_upset_after_girl_does_not_want_to/
28,mn5sqs,1617929173,Confuse and idk if this title is good for what I'm posting,"I had been rejecting people to enter my life for the past 5 years. I never had meet someone that was ever closed to me since then. Now as I realize that I'm already at age (i'm turning 21 this september) I feel like maybe I need to let people specifically connect with the guys. Sometimes I thought what if for the next 5 years I'll be alone and possibly spend the rest of my life alone which is a sad thought right? I mean who would want to get old without anyone taking care of you...

And so, I had been into dating apps during the whole quarantine here in our country which is Philippines. I was trying to connect with guys but yet again didn't work. I also don't have time to socialize with people from my place because I am always busy with work stuffs and studies (yeah sucks) and idk I feel like there is something missing on me... I just can't figure it out.....

What do you think? Do you think using dating apps makes me desperate to find someone? I mean long distance relationship is very tough and it just applies to people who are strong enough especially in this pandemic its hard to travel everywhere..

When you ask someone out or ask to connect with someone and they don't give a straightforward answer, I would recommend moving on. Of course this is a case by case basis and sometimes the person doesn't know if they would be free on that day to hang out or go on a date. However, if they don't counter with other days and times that they would be available, I would move on.

For the most part, if someone is saying maybe or is dodging your question to hang out, they aren't interested in you.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mn6a2x/getting_a_maybe_is_the_same_as_getting_a_no/

33,mn6jal,1617931696,Dating and Politics,"Hi all,
So I M[32] have been dating a F[36]. Our chemistry is good, sex is even better. She loves to go out and has a lot of friends. We aren’t in a relationship but she goes out a ton even on weekdays, Mondays, you name it. Ive been wasting a lot of money on food and alcohol(guess thats the dating life now). Im new to this again bc i divorced 6 months ago after a 9 year relationship. She goes out a lot without me as well, especially to bars or restaurants. I don’t get mad because we aren’t in a relationship but i guess i was starting to catch feelings even though she is a FWB. Red flags are that she goes out A LOT. She is a freelancer but currently doesn’t have a job, so guess thats why. I have a corporate 8-5 job. So yesterday she was out drinking but didn’t post with who and i didn’t want to get in her business. I posted on Instagram who was free to do something. She replies “stop being weird, come to this Mexican restaurant I’m having drinks with friends”. Me like an idiot went...which i shouldn’t have. I felt like she just invited me because I was bothered. I went anyways and met her there with her friends. They proceeded to talk politics and talking down really bad on republicans. Please note i don’t like politics and can give a damn about it. My family are republicans but doesn’t mean I’m gonna go out bashing democrats. She turn the whole night into a political debate and i didn’t say a word because frankly i don’t care. She made a comment “oh he is probably a republican”. I replied “well my family is”. She got so offended and started bashing me saying I’m a trump supporter and putting me down. Her friends even had to say “hey calm down, he hasn’t said a word”. Every little thing I did the rest of the night she had to compare it to Trump or Republicans. I was like whats wrong with her? So we paid and left. We made out, hugged, etc. then walked her to her car. She proceeded to call me and said sue cant believe I’m a Republicans and that i lied to her. I was really confused bc i cannot recall that conversation . She felt offended and said if i was calling her a liar. Im now second guessing her because she really screwed up that night. I didn’t want to keep talking about it, so i hung up. She came over to my house to try and talk about me accusing her of lying. I came out for a but bur the conversation was going nowhere and i went back in the my house. She unfriends me from Instagram shortly after. Im so confused that I’m not sure what to do and what i did.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mn6jal/dating_and_politics/

35,mn6ta1,1617932660,Am I overthinking this or do I have a right to be annoyed?,"So I’ve been on 8 or so dates with this girl and things are going decently well it’s just that sometimes she does things and I don’t think she realizes how she comes off. In person i can read her really well and she’s like super responsive, we spend the whole day together and things are cool.

But like for example the other day I bought her something for her birthday and even though she didn’t invite me to her party, i still just wanted to buy her something small. She forgot the gifts in my car, but she also forgot to her hydroflask and to give me my jacket that she was wearing. So I told her that she left them and she said she was sorry and thanked me for the presents, but I was still a little bit hurt/annoyed by it.

Today we had planned to hangout bc we’ve had conflicting work schedules for a couple days, but then she had to reschedule. She said she was going out with her friend and her sister, and idk it made me feel like I’m just not that much a priority. She said we could hangout tomorrow  but I said we could hangout Sunday instead bc one of my friends is having a birthday party tomorrow (which is true). And I probably would have not gone out with my friends if I thought she would do the same for me. I’m actually thinking of introducing to my friends to her, since I’ve been introduced to all of her friends but now idk.

I know I can be a little intense/clingy so I feel it’s good to sit out my thoughts and idk if I’m just overreacting. I also don’t like when randomly she’s sort of short over messages and it’s somewhat rare she’ll ask questions and keep the conversation going, but in person she’s pretty normal. 

I also went out with this girl a year ago on one date and I originally stopped talking to her bc she’s very nonchalant, it seemed like she didn’t like me when that wasn’t the case. It’s crazy to think about how we went on one date together then sort of stopped talking and then we went out on a date literally a whole year later and now we’re a thing.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mn6ta1/am_i_overthinking_this_or_do_i_have_a_right_to_be/

After a traumatic experience in my 20s, where I was making more than anyone in my age, I learnt that money is what caused my depressive episodes, loneliness, insomnia, trust issues and other mental problems. I was sad every day and coping with it by having an abundance of material possesions, drugs, women, etc. I’ve been on both sides of the financial spectrum from being in debt, poor, frugal, well off and lastly, financially independent. Now I find myself in the dating world (without having social media) but have certain views of money because of my past. I wanted to get advice/opinions on having a partner who purposely chooses to not make over six figures or may even enjoy the stay at home husband/dad role. Also some advice on how to communicate this better while on the first couple dates, knowing that “occupation” is one of the first topics mentioned or talked about in the first couple dates. I’m a very ambitious person and I’m in the process of getting a house for myself but don’t plan to live in it until I have a family because living in a house by my myself is what also added to my mental problems in the past. I really just want to keep my finances and occupation private while dating someone (until its serious) because most people will only see the good I have and not my feelings towards it.

39,mn784t,1617934068,Late Bloomer. Is It Too Late Now?,"So I told myself I didn’t need to make a post, just let it go but here I am....

I am a 29 year old male. I have never dated, outside of like 1-2 dates in my life. So of course I have little to no experience in dating/relationship/sex. It’s not like I haven’t tried. Middle School &amp; High School I tried a few times here &amp; there. I was rejected every time.
Early 20’s to mid 20’s I didn’t. I was a homebody, never went out. I was just an online person.

I was a super shy, overweight person. I would tremble talking to women so of course that doesn’t help. I have an anxiety disorder so that plays a big part. I was never dirty but wasn’t really fashionable or whatever you want to say. I was bullied throughout school for many things so that didn’t help my confidence at all &amp; honestly still carry that with me to this day but have had big improvements cause been working on it.

About me more recently, a few years ago I stepped on a scale and I was not happy with my weight, so I embarked on the weight loss journey, lost over 100 pounds. That feels good to type, I however put some back on during CoVid but I am still skinny, body not completely where I want it but work in progress &amp; feel much more confident. Also working other things to help boost my confidence in myself. I know looks won’t bring full happiness but it’s a start. I started my current job almost 2 years ago, met some dope ppl, a few friends that have given me tips on how to talk to women, appearance &amp; what not. It’s been a tremendous help. I have found my voice more, I can talk to women easier now. I never smelt bad but cologne was a recommended thing &amp; I am such a fan. Got compliments since I started to wear it about 8 months ago. So much progress/growth in the past few years. 

So I know that my twenties is basically the start of my adulthood if I’m blessed to see 30’s/40’s which I believe can be my prime if I stay the path &amp; don’t worry too much about the past. Don’t let bad experiences &amp; what I haven’t done get me down. But it’s difficult sometimes to know I missed out on so much but even now I started trying dating apps last year with nothing coming from it. Makes me feel maybe I am just actually ugly or I am not meant to find a relationship.

I honestly feel like I’m fucked regardless if I ever get a chance from someone. With almost no experience in dating/relationships at my age, what girl would want that. Ppl my age usually have had multiple relationships or at least know a good amount about dating. Like I don’t know really anything so yeah...

Not to mention that I have like no experience in sex. Like it’s kinda sad tbh, not even a hookup, so I must not be wanted at all. And say I get that chance to be intimate with a woman, my lack of experience would most likely kill any thing afterwards. I will probably have a shyness to me with it. Like I know I am down to do whatever I can to please her, I know damn well I want foreplay &amp; try multiple things. I’m down to explore. I feel like that will help me make sure we both would get ours. I’m not one of those guys who only cares for himself. I put effort into things I want, I would get better &amp; need less direction sooner than later but it might not live up to her expectations so it might not matter much.

So basically in summary maybe I’m destined to be alone forever, I’m not ever gonna find love or anything like that. No woman probably will ever want me if I disclose this information. Maybe I should not mention it or tell a fib till I get more experience if I even can get a shot with anyone, cause the fact is still I feel like 99% of women probably find me ugly.

I seen in other posts that some women find no experience in these areas are red flags. Furthering my thought process. I am curious about the little sex history being a red flag but I can see the relationship thing cause thinking I can’t hold a relationship or maybe there’s something wrong with me.

Is my dating/relationship/sex life over after even though it never began now that I’m already 29. And is there something wrong with me? I don’t question my worth as a person, I am a very good person. But am I not worthy of romantic love?

45,mn7klv,1617935262,When to stop Pursuing,"So during the end of high school I started having feelings towards this guy who was in a couple of my classes. He was very easy to talk to and we often had very long interesting conversations, the type where you would lose track of time. Near the end of one of our classes, I overheard him ask another girl out, she politely rejected him. I had mixed feelings about it, I was glad that he was rejected but also sad that he was into some other girl. So a few more weeks pass and the semester is coming to an end. This was my last semester of high school so it was now or ever. I light heartedly told him that I liked him. But he pretty much friend zoned me. I guess it was possible that He was not over that other girl. A year later we are still on good terms and text a lot. I still have feelings for him  and  I am debating weather it is a good idea to attempt to pursue a relationship with him again.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mn7klv/when_to_stop_pursuing/

49,mn7qe0,1617935836,Is hookups the only way to date ?,"I'm a 24F , I recently started using dating apps because my friends convinced me to. I only had one boyfriend and never been ""out there"". 

Anyway, they met their current boyfriends from hookups first. That's ok but I tried a hookup once and I didn't feel right.... it just wasn't for me. I guess I need a emotional connection and really get to know a guy first. 


I use bumble and okcupid but the guys just want to hook up. No, my pictures don't show cleavage.  Yes I put my hobbies. I basically do what this subreddit suggest but it's just hookups for these guys. Even the ones who say they want a relationship.

I get judged by my friends because I turn down guys who want to sleep with me. The guys never ask me on dates but now I feel like I'm doing something wrong. Is this the only way to date now? Hookups? If that's the case then I may be single forever which is ok. I have my own place, dog, almost done with my degree , and saving lots of money. Being single forever won't affect my life. Maybe I'm a weird idk. Just want some input. 

I'm honestly scared of STD from random guys on the internet. My friend caught a few but tells me that antibiotics fix it and to just be safe and have fun. I just feel like a loser. I get it, people enjoy sex, I do myself but I just can't do hookups but it seems it's the only way to build a deep connection.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mn7qe0/is_hookups_the_only_way_to_date/

He is the first man who I have had a long term relationship with, he is very respectful and always shows me that he wants to be with me. But, I wonder... Why men that are like this (which is great and rare in nowadays dating) tend to be boring?!

His sense of humor is very small not to say none, I laugh about things and I show him videos or tell him jokes and he doesn't even react, sometimes he thinks is not funny or even stupid. Makes me feel embarrassed of wanting to have fun. I want a man who loves and respect me but, do I want to be also with someone I cannot laugh with?

I love watching movies and be amazed by new things, he overthinks them. I love to dance, but since I'm living with him I only dance when he's not home because I feel embarrassed. I don't know... I want to do goofy things and make him laugh, but I feel that's not his vibe. I cannot by 100% myself. No games or play night, not singing... The funniest thing, watching a movie.

However, he's responsable, he's loving, he can cook and do house chores, he never looks other women, he supports me when I need it.. but I don't know why this absence of humor compability hits me so hard.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mn830e/why_are_loyalserious_men_often_boring_and_dead/
51,mn856o,1617937322,Who’s in the wrong? Me (23F) or my boyfriend (22M)? Be totally honest,"So I recently started a new job but it’s on the other side of the city (30 mins) but my boyfriend is walking distance from my new job and I asked him if I could sleep over whenever I worked back to back days but he could totally say no if he wanted his space.

The first day was fine because I finished work earlier than him and bought some food to cook dinner so he’d have food whenever he came home.

That following morning was pretty typical but I can tell he was tired as he works 2 part time jobs (Bank teller and Post office). 

I started work at 11am and he didn’t start until 4pm. I had just gotten out of the shower at 9 ish and he was doing the dishes. I sat on the couch for a bit and just wanted to chill before I headed to work. I started to play League of legends on my phone so I can get some energy going and he heard my game and said “are you seriously playing your game right now? Like why don’t you do anything?” Mind you the day before I never played because I went to bed. 

I told him I wasn’t aware there was anything more to do right now and if he asked me I would have done something. He said “ why don’t you figure it out?” I was SO confused because I just woke up and I’ve slept over many time before so he’s never had a specific routine.

At this point I assume he’s talking about walking the dog so I begin to put a leash on the dog. I told him “ is this what you mean? I can take him but you could have just asked me instead of getting mad at me for playing my game”. He took the leach from me and said “forget it. Do whatever you want” . 

How do I avoid future fights first thing in the morning? I hate conflict before heading to work because it makes me lose focus and I have a hard time grasping tasks. I always try to avoid an argument right before work; especially because it was my 2nd training day and I take things to heart.

Who was in the wrong?

52,mn88jw,1617937651,Would you still continue to see someone who gave you COVID on the first date?,"Okay, so I matched with this guy on tinder and he's a bit slow to respond, and once I get his insta he's also a bit slow to respond in DM's. On Thursday, I decided to make the first move and invite him over for drinks. We had a great time; we have a lot in common, sex was great, and he stayed over.

The next day, my sister who I had seen the previous Sunday told me she had COVID. I went and got tested and came up positive. I texted they guy to let him know. I texted him again on Wednesday to check in and he's positive for it. Luckily, we both had mild symptoms, so it's more an annoyance to quarantine than it is serious.

I'm wondering if there's still a chance he'd want to see me after this? On the one hand, we were both on the same page about wanting casual sex, we got along really well, and the night of joked that it was the best tinder date he'd ever been on, and we both agreed that the sex was great! Both my sister and I have been careful, so I had no reason to believe I had COVID and it obviously wasn't intentional. But, I feel like he hates me for getting him sick. He can't work from home, so he's missing a lot of work days. I also can't really get a good gauge bc he isn't a big texter, and I don't want to be annoying.

54,mn8dwd,1617938197,I'm wondering if whether she is not interested in me anymore or just overwhelmed?,"So I am a girl and I was dating this girl (a co-worker) for the last few weeks. We admitted we liked each other for a while and hung out a few times after that, holding hands and kissing on the cheek/hand ect. I am older than her so I wanted to take things slow, which I said to her and she was very nervous around me from the beginning so I didn't want to push her as she is inexperienced as well. The first time I kissed her hand, she kissed mine back but said it took her a lot of courage to do so. We seemed to get along well, at work we were teasing and joking with one another; outside work, we were the same and laughing a lot, being close to one another. 

This recent weekend we kinda went out on a date. I am still very inexperienced with women, only just admitting that I'm interested in them and want to be with them. And she has only had a brief relationship with one herself. So I don't think we knew what we were doing and I had no idea how to lead. So we went bar hopping, the conversation wasn't the best but it wasn't super awkward either. We ended up at a place where we had a dance and a cocktail or two, and a guy approached me and started chatting and dancing near me, clearly drunk off his mind. He then realized we were 'together' and I looked at her and she looked at me laughing because we obviously haven't had that talk yet as we were only just going out. I shouldn't have chatted to him but just wanted to be friendly. But she suddenly got quiet and said she needed to go get some water. So I went with her, and later on we sat down and she was even quieter. She said that she may have been a bit jealous, but she wasn't sure about that. And then she said she felt out of place over there. I tried to reassure her that she wasn't and made sure I was close to her. 

We decided to leave that spot and then we went to a quieter place to get a drink where I asked her if she was okay. She said she was, but her eyes said differently. and when I got up to get another drink for us, she gave me a really big hug. I told her i was sad that she was sad, because I was, and I felt like a tool. I then tried to get her to talk about her favourite things, which she perked up a little bit with. The rest of the night, she was getting me things, kissing me on the cheek and shoulder, she was holding my hand in public and she said she didn't want to go home when we got back to the car. So i took her to go watch a storm near our cities foreshore, where you could see the city lights reflect on the water. We had been there once before and she liked it and she agreed she wanted to go back there. There we held hands again, were very close and hugging and putting our heads on each other shoulders, giving a few sweet kisses here and there and I finally asked her whether I could kiss her for real, and she said yes. Unfortunately I don't think I kissed her very well. i took her home after that, and she hugged me and kissed me briefly. 

The next day at work, she was a little quiet, but was still joking around with me. And she was chatting to me in the evening. Monday she was silent. Tuesday, she was silent as well. And then Wednesday, I sent her a message saying that if you need to tell me anything, I am here and I will try to understand you to the best that I can, sensing that either she was a little upset or was overthinking. So she sent me a message saying sorry that she had been quiet, she had a lot going on in her life right now (which she genuinely does as shes told me) and that she thinks she got scared and that she needs me as a friend instead of complicating things further romantically. So i took that on board, I was a little upset as I had feelings for her so naturally. But I'm prepared to be her friend because she is a great person and I feel we have a lot in common, a similar goofy humour and I enjoy talking to her. But I'm just wondering if you guys think she lost interest after the not so good date or if shes just feeling overwhelmed and not good enough for me? She has been mentioning to me that she feels like she isn't sexy, and she doesn't like her face or her body and that she thinks I'm hot and beautiful. She's mentioned to me a few times that she gets super shy with girls compared with guys, and that she feels girls wouldn't be into her. Not to mention on top of that she is balancing uni work, working a lot, trying to move out or look into that and dealing with her shitty parents who treat who really unfairly. What do you think? I am taking this as a rejection either way but I just want to know what really happened so I can learn.

59,mn8ucq,1617939884,Dating has given me a lot of empathy lately,"We all should stop trying to be so perfect and we all need to have a little bit more into people with each other.

When I was a kid I hated when people talked about people behind their backs and assume things because I was a victim of those types of behaviors.

Even if you somehow know a person and think that you have them figured out by the few times you've spoken with them or even with a dress like YOU STILL DO NOT KNOW THEM COMPLETELY. There's a timeless beauty in that. 

My last girlfriend was a victim of human trafficking and it wasn't super severe but it came from her own mother.

This girl loves to party and drink and so do I and even now I'm torn between wanting her to forget that stuff so she can get away from her darker past. Get at the same time she is still young like me and she deserves to live a life just to have fun and make mistakes.

She's back with her abusive ex unfortunately but I do not resent her and our time together was fun.

The last day I went on was super pleasant. She was my dream date as she was an older woman and that is a slight fetish of mine XD. But she talked about her experiences. And as beautiful as she is I thought she would have tons of men after her but she was actually married and got married again and has a bunch of kids.

She's so stereotypically Mom like and it's adorable and very endearing.

I do not like gender roles at all if you could tell by my post history and I myself have had some crazy pass with women in my life but I'm really starting to feel better.

I've learned so much about men and women just from these short years of dating.

I have a friend who is also a street kid like me but ever since we graduated high school he completely mellowed out and changed radically for the better.

He told me he slept with 20 girls not because he planned it but because he was hopping from girl the girl trying to find a relationship. It's such a stereotype that dudes want to sleep around a lot but knowing his story it's kind of relatable. He was a young boy looking for love,and there's nothing wrong with that simple fact but as men were expected to sleep with anything that moves.

68,mn9ckz,1617941770,Ghosting and unghosting?,"Back in December I decided to start looking for a partner seriously. 
I would let people know on dating apps that I wanted nothing temporary - we could even be friends but just no hooking up and never talking again. 

I met this guy who I thought was really cute and I noticed his bio said “something casual” and I told him I thought he was cute BUT I’m not really looking for casual right now. He said he only put that there because he had been tricked by girls cheating on their boyfriends or something along the lines of that. It was weird but I was like ok cool he knows my intentions.

Then we meet up, have really good chemistry and end up having sex. He says all the right things, tells me I’m so gorgeous, easy to talk to, seems super into me. 
We meet again and have sex again. Maybe that should’ve been my first warning, that we were only having sex. I just enjoyed it a lot, and his intimacies like forehead kissing and talking about our lives. 

Then it’s getting around the time for him to go back to school - I didn’t expect a relationship at all but I did want us to remain friends at the least. I’ll admit that I was really excited about him so I probably came off as clingy when I double texted after he took a day or so to answer. Then he asked to meet up again, said something sexual, and then ghosted me HARD. 

I was devastated for some reason. I had just been ghosted a lot before and I didn’t know why. I hate the feeling, like I did something wrong. 

I texted him how shitty I thought it was about a month after he ghosted, I took him off my social media and the app I found him on. Attempted to get over it, it was hard but I’m in a better place now

It’s now been a few months and he just followed me on Instagram suddenly with no context. Im not going to follow back or message him or anything. But why do you guys think he did this? Do you think he’s sorry or do you think he thinks I’m just going to message him again ???

This was when college parties and gatherings existed before covid. I was in a club and sitting with all my classmates around the table (first year students, we don’t really know the others in the club yet as they’re from different “classes”)

In my class there’s this one guy who’s attractive, sporty and we’ve already had a few eye contacts, chats here and there and being close to me, but I didn’t really read much into it, but I had a feeling he likes me a bit. He had a reputation of being a ladies’ man.

Sitting on the table sofas there was one person between me and him, and when that person went away, he slowly got closer to me. Then he weirdly put his leg slowly to touch with mine, then his arm slowly closer and closer to my arm (possibly testing would I react negatively?)

Then we started chatting, said cheers with out drinks and then he told me he saw my profile on Tinder, and told me “not to get angry” that he didn’t swipe right as he “never swipes people he knows”. I was like cool no worries. Then he started chatting about the dating process there and basically told me how hard it is to get hookups easily, and told me story times of how he once took a 31yo woman home from a club. (I assume he doesn’t like me as he talks about other girls, hooking up with them and why talk about such subject when we don’t know each other well). 

Then he surprisingly pushed me closer to him and put his hand around me. We were so close. I took it as him flirting and liking me. He was a bit tipsy but not much. Then we chatted and I started flirting too: like when we laughed, I put my hand quickly on his leg a few times. Not for a long time though but just to show I like him too. 

We chatted and all but then I saw something occupying his mind and we didn’t chat much then and he talked with his friends on the phone and the night continued just partying.

**Knowing that this guy takes girls so easily home, why did he suddenly stop flirting with me or didn’t take me to his goal?** (Maybe it has something to do with the “he doesn’t swipe people he knows right?)

Also, **why would he tell me about other girls and hooking up with them? Does he think he’d impress me? And lastly, does he like me or not?**",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mnahyj/why_did_he_show_interest_first_but_then_didnt/

76,mnb07w,1617948757,I hate how good and bad I am in dating at the same time.," 

Weird  title right? Well let me just say areound 7/8 out of 10 girls are  willing to go on a date with me, i'm a pretty outgoing and good looking  guy if I say so myself. But yeah I suck at dating at the same time.

Basically  everytime me and the girl have a nice time although it basically always  has the same ending which is ""I had a great time but I see it as  friends"". Well okay, no biggie. I don't expect a girl to like me or want  me and that is totally fine. I've been on that side aswell, just not  feeling it.

The thing is, out of a  100 dates maybe 1 or if i'm lucky 2 are down for a second date. Which  also always result in a ""let's be friends"".

I  absolutely hate it. I hate how people are like ""Wow, you're dating so  much how do you do that? That's really impressive"" and more of that  shit. Why do you think I date so much. Eventually i'd like a girlfriend  but it just isn't happening These people who are impressed by how much I  date meet a girl and boom, relationship. And here I am, going and going  and going and not even a single date turns out into more.

Can't  even remember when I last kissed a girl let alone have sex with them.  Last relationship is a good 10 years ago aswell. Last tuesday I had a  first date which turned out like said above. This afternoon I have a  date with another girl which'll probably turn out the same way. Ofcourse  I hope not but seeing my trackrecord the outcome is likely to be the  same again.

tldr:

In fact there was one lady whom I regret not being with when I had the chance but I really don't think this is the reddit for that story.

78,mnb8l4,1617949811,tired of dating and never finding love,"so I’ve only ever had one “official” relationship and it was honestly a joke. i’ve never been with someone/ talked to someone that I genuinely am impressed by let alone who’s smarter than me. Especially someone who also has a good job, can geek out about finance, has good music taste, yanno checks all my boxes, until I met this guy a few weeks ago.  he was different from all the rest, we were aligned. he was very intelligent and recognized my intelligence (which is almost never with smart guys) and we both just clicked on so many levels. He’s the only person I’ve ever even met who’s checked that many of my boxes. I was genuinely really excited to see where things went even if it turned into just a friendship. I’m someone who puts my all in all my relationships (friend &amp; romantic) and it’s also hard finding someone who does the same bc not everyone is like that (&amp; that’s okay they just aren’t for me). lately he’s been distant and not solid with plans so I was straight up asked if we were gonna hang soon (as in the next week we haven’t seen each other in 2 weeks) and if not I was kinda done trying. (I’m someone who knows what they want, is very picky, has high standards and is very quick to cut off people who aren’t aligned with that or reciprocate my time, effort, &amp; energy.) he politely said he just doesn’t have the time right now and he would reach out when/if he does. which to me means he isn’t really that interested anymore. I’m extremely busy too, it’s my final semester in my undergrad, &amp; we are in the same field so I understand how tight time can get. but to me you make time for the people you want in your life. if you’re really interested in someone you make the time. which makes me so disappointed and I’m trying really hard not to care or let it affect me but I’ve had a lot of long term relationships end recently (my dad specifically blocked me and won’t come to my graduation, my best friend of 5 years who was my first close best friend told me to fuck off basically, and my grandpa who was very important in my life died in Jan.) and it’s been really hard but I was finally excited about this one guy.  He’s the first guy I wanna say ever if not in the past 4 years I’ve really been crazy excited about and impressed by. So it really just fucking sucks and it hurts and I just hate becoming vulnerable to someone and them end up switching up. Even if you don’t think they will. I know it’s the universe telling me there’s better on the way but it’s just so exhausting. I’m so tired of starting over with guys. I’ve never been with someone i truly love and I just want to experience that so bad but I’m just so tired of searching for it. tired of constantly getting disappointed especially with someone I was so hopeful for /////:

idk I know this is probably common but I just feel like I’m such a good person with such an open and caring heart and I do so much for everyone and I try so hard to be the best and I would be such a good girlfriend, I can cook really good, I’m motivating, I have a high sex drive, I’m extremely understanding, and I’m communicative. and it just sucks never being able to have the chance to show someone that ///:",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mnb8l4/tired_of_dating_and_never_finding_love/
79,mnb91r,1617949869,"Went on first date after two weeks. Went well, now what? (21M)","Met a girl off of a dating app a couple weeks ago and we went on our first date two nights ago after talking for two weeks.

The date went really well, we non stop talked the entire time about a variety of different things and got along well. I ended up staying the night at her place and we ended up hooking up as well.

This is the first time I’ve actually succeeded with a girl who I’m really attracted too AND who I think is really cool. I’m pretty proud of myself in this sense because I am usually the type to look at myself as “forever alone” but I managed to go on an amazing date with a beautiful and really cool woman. There are a few issues though, mainly involving myself. 

For one I feel like I’m forcing myself already to not get emotionally attached after our first date (the feelings are there because we slept together and because I just think she’s really great). And two there is just something I know deep down that I am not really her type. She is very artistic by nature and trade while I am not, and she’s also into skating which I also am not (though I really appreciate both of those things, I just don’t have those skills). Basically I feel like I’m not good enough for her despite her letting me crash at her place and allowing me to sleep with her.

I have to mention that I never been in a relationship, I was actually really ok about that right before I met that girl, for real the only thing I cared about before meeting her, was studying.

87,mncuno,1617957348,Fell in love for the first time at 23 (M),"English is not my first language, so my deepest apologies if it's a bit hard to read.

(TLDR at the bottom)

A bit of background on me, I'm a 23M from South Asia, bought up in a fairly conservative family. You see, arranged marriages are sort of a thing in my country. So, my parents have sort of grilled this weird mind set that ""love marriages"" are not a good thing. But I've always given them the deaf ear when they start talking about relationships and what not.

I've been through University, High School, Middle school, Primary school without actually having the feeling of love. I've had infatuations or crushes, but never this unending desire to approach the person I've had crush and tell them i would like to go out with them. This might sound weird, I'm just not very good articulating stuff, sorry.

So, we have been having work from home for the past 1 year. Many new hires, and we resumed office on Jan1 (2021). I meet up with my colleagues the usual chit chat and everything. but out of the blue, this, girl (25F), she walks in. You know, the very first time you see someone, your heart skips a beat, the entire audio around you just becomes mute and your eyes are just fixed. I knew on that second she's the one I wanted to be with, because, I've never felt that way!

So, I muster up some courage, and decide to talk with her during coffee break or lunch. but i just couldn't do it, I tried for 3 months, some stupid issue or the other used to come in the middle couldn't do it.

In the sidelines, I've been thinking of changing career, so, I resigned from my current company and was in my notice period. The very thought of not being able to see her again, it's just killing me. during the last 15 days of my notice period (which was 2months) i decided, fuck it, I'll speak with her, ask her out, if she says no, it is what it is. But fate has a weird way of twisting arms. You see, someone from my office tested positive, and everyone is under quarantine for 15 days (till April 13). But my last day is 10th April. So, now, i just cannot ask her out. 

I've only ever talked with her like 4 times in the past 3 months and all on a professional capacity over work.

So, I don't have her phone number, but just her work and personal email.

Because of this, I've been having this idea of retracting my resignation (my boss wanted to retain me, but I declined) and maybe try talking to her. I've also been  thinking of asking her out via email, but I felt that is just too stupid so dropped that idea. 

I thought of asking a mutual friend for her number, but, I thought she might get furious that I got the number behind her back. (because I would get furious). And this mutual friend is a bit of chatter box, so dropped that idea.

At this point, I just don't know how to approach her or talk to her or even reach her. This is probably the first time I am even making a move to talk to a girl, so all this stuff is like totally new to me. What do you all think I should do?

(and, she's 2 years elder to me, I don't mind that at all, but I hope she doesn't mind that too)

TLDR : New girl in office, though of asking her out, I had to resign due to personal reasons. COVID caused another work from home before I could make a move. I am on notice period, and my work period at the company ends before the work from home period. The only contact info i have about her is her personal email and the internal",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mncuno/fell_in_love_for_the_first_time_at_23_m/

I don't know why negative experiences need to reflect dating and people in general!! 

Secondly it's fine to have a type, whether you're picky or not picky. The problem in society is everyone wants to follow a trend, even this website has people following the leader. 

'I ain't going to go for a girl who takes 100 selfies a day'

'I don't care what they look like they just gotta have substance '

'I can't be with a man that doesn't see me as his equal'

'I can't be with a woman who won't offer to pay on the first date'

This is so commonly seen her and it doesn't need to be this way
The problem with social media culture is following the fucking crowds. 

I have always been 'picky', who knows what picky mean??? No-one because picky is subjective !!!
All the types and characteristics you want in a partner is SUBJECTIVE!!!!!  

Good looking? Is subjective!!!! 

For instance. I always thought I was not picky because my 'type' consist of 'normal' men who aren't really reflected in social media and entertainment...  But to other people it's considered 'picky'... I think I am picky in the sense I know what I want... 

Hot. Sexy. Funny. Tall. Clever. Macho. Strong. Are all subjective to the person using it!!!! 
And if we are so social media obsessed then these words probably have 1 meaning!! 

Funny ~ could mean someone with a sense of humour, a clown, a comedian, a guy who knows how to giggle... Funny could mean anything!!! 

Tall- could be any height. I obviously want someone few inches taller than me... But so many short girl in for 'short guys' but sometimes it's their 'tall'... I know shorter girl go for giants.. But that's their preference... A lot of girls go for giants or say they want giants.. God knows why because eventual they'll end up with someone a bit taller than them because they are short anyway. 

Strong ~ subjective yet again maybe I like u STRONGER ..hence why I say 'strong'

Facial hair~ again this is subjective some people love werewolf and some people Joe butt fluff

Clever~ this is subjective too..sometimes we mean cleverer or sometimes someone means scientist smart. 

Personality, I can't stress on personality but this rant has become unexpectedly long

These types and preferences do not need to be generalised and we all need to be open minded. 

Just because someone has a type doesn't mean it can't be questioned and doesn't mean u don't fit their type.. The list can go on. Similarly sometimes you WILL NOT FIT THEIR TYPE and that is fine too!!!!
