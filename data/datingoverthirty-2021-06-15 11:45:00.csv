1,o0j4oy,1623776513,Long distance dating and a ferry,"**TLDR:  How would you go about dating a guy who lives on an island and your on Mainland? Considering ferry costs and getting to know eachother plus realistic expectations. I was already planning on moving to the Island in 6 to 12 months anyways.**


I'm curious how other ppl deal with long or longer distance dating. Especially dating that involves a ferry/boat. I live in British Columbia Canada 🇨🇦 and I'm getting interested in one guy (or maybe two!!) who live on the island. I'm on Mainland. 

So there's ferry costs travel etc.

It's easier when it's just an hour drive or so but have I lost my mine for seeing some interesting blokes over there. I'm not on the apps anymore so these are guys I've been chatting with and one guy I've got to see a few times on Mainland.

I'm basically totally confused about this or if it's even worth it.

I'm also planning to move to the Island in 6 to 12 months after I have gained some experience at my current job. This move was planned waaaay before I even knew these guys. I would NEVER move for a new guy. This move would be all for me and about me with no influence from men.

I ask because I have heard of relationships where they start as friends with benefits and they move to a serious relationship. Let's say though that you find the man attractive you get along well enough but he is a functional alcoholic, or spends a lot of time on his hobby, or well I guess anything really that wouldn't meet your requirements as a serious partner.

5,o0k16a,1623778849,What's a graceful way I can tell my date that I live at home with parents at age 32?,"So me living at home seems to be a fundamental deal beaker.  I'm going to be at home for another year while I finish grad school.  I can graduate completely debt free with some savings this way.  The very last semester of grad school is a full time internship which is nonpaid.

It's very unsexy for a man my age to live at home.  Here are some things I've encountered these past 4 months:

1) Phone date last February.  I was extremely innocent and new to online dating.  She asked about my living situation and I innocently told her without thinking twice about it.  Boom ghosted.  At first I was confused since she seemed so interested, until my buddy told me what's up and I was like ""ohhhhh.""

2) I had an in person date with one woman where I danced around the question when asked.  I said something like ""yeah my parents live around here.  We talk sometimes.""  2nd date she asks more firmly about them, and I tell her.  She looked authentically hurt that I originally omisively lied to her.  Made me feel like a huge jerk, and her interested dropped like a rock.  Me being shady painted me with a gallon of ""ick.""  I will never take this approach again.

3) Went out on an in person date with another girl, and when she asked I had a conversation about it.  About how I'm living at home to save money while I finish grad school which has 2 semesters left, and how it logistically makes sense for me since I'm currently right next to where I work / go to school.  I let her know I'm planning on moving out when it's over, and this is the first time in my adult life I've been at home.  I was very straight up with her because I wanted to let her know what page I'm on in life.  Boom ghosted.

4) Went out on a date with a woman last Thursday.  She asked, and I told her ""I currently live at home with my parents.""  She responds with ohh that's kool.  She literally left 2 minutes after that.  She looked sorta mad.  She gtfo out of there after hearing that.  I later texted her, and she was nice saying ""yeah living at home is one of my deal breakers.""

I want to be clear.  Each of these dates seem to be going very well UNTIL that question comes up.

I know the logical answer is to not date, but I mean...I want to date.  And I'm willing to take the punches in the mean time.  Plus if I meet a woman who likes me over my circumstances, that's going to be a huge green light for me.

So if you were me, how would you bring this topic up?  Oddly enough, other aspects in my life are just fine...but they're very overshadowed about my living situation.",datingoverthirty,t5_34cyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/o0k16a/whats_a_graceful_way_i_can_tell_my_date_that_i/

8,o0l5xe,1623781818,"Six Months In, some Disagreements and Serious topics coming up.....Help!","Hey everyone, 

So I'm 39, and I've been in a relationship with my gf who is 36 for 6-7 months now.  Things are going great, we just took our first vacation together, we have been  having fun, getting to know each other these past 6 months, etc......I can see myself with her and i know she feels the same. I was actually thinking of proposing at around the 1 year mark as we are getting older and why waste time at this age? 

But (there's always a but right? haha) , we have very different opinions on family, and relocating.  She stated to me she wants to have kids (at least 1, if not 2) and to be honest I am on the fence about it, leaning towards no.  I will be 40 soon, and honestly i used to see myself having kids when I was in my late 20's and early 30's but it hasn't happened for yet  in life and at this point I decided I'm not trying to have kids at 40 or later.  I would rather travel, have fun, go out,  and live a worry free life and not have the responsibility of raising babies at 40+.   However, she is an only child, and she wants to have kids, and when I told her I don't really want any or I'm on the fence she was surprised.  She was like ""kids are a blessing, a family is a blessing, you're creating life, its your DNA, etc etc......"" 

There is also the issue of relocating.   I was actively looking to move out of my state and relocate for a better job last year but then I met her, so i put the moving on hold,......life happens i guess, right?  I'm very open minded and open to moving and experiencing a new state, a new environment, new people, etc.  She knew this as i told her in the beginning when we met that i was looking at jobs out of state right before we met.   She on the other hand, is very traditional i guess.  She is hesitant to relocate when I proposed that idea to her.  She said her friends are here, her family is here, her parents, and she doesn't see herself relocating anytime soon bc she doesn't want to leave that.   I kind of said to her well if we relocate when we get married for a better life, that's a good thing right? I would have a better job, make more money, etc.....but for her i guess that doesn't outweigh leaving her friends and family.   I said to her we can visit anytime, or they can visit, it's literally a 2 hour plane ride....it's not that serious.  People do it all the time. 

So i ask you guys.......will this work?  Am I being too selfish not wanting kids or being on the fence?  Or wanting her to be more open minded about things like relocating?  I do love her and I do see myself with her as we get along great but these are 2 major differences we have that recently came up.",datingoverthirty,t5_34cyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/o0l5xe/six_months_in_some_disagreements_and_serious/

I'm 2 dates in and I feel like I'm putting in 60% of the effort and they're putting in 40%. I'm not sure if they're just not that interested in me or whether they're just shy. In-person, we seem to be quite comfortable chatting. We get to deep topics fairly quickly. But I worry that we'll run out of things to talk about.  Over text, we don't really chat much. I try to crack a joke now and then and they're receptive but no real follow up. Trouble is that I used to be painfully shy too and am a strong introvert so I'm worried about running out of conversation on our next date.

15,o0mvob,1623786399,"How to date casually in your 30s, without being an ass?","After reading a lot of posts and comments here, it seems most people are looking for a long term relationship. People who doesn’t want to commit are not super popular. Many of you have been hurt, or felt deceived, by someone who was stringing you along. I also know from personal experience that it’s extra easy to be deceived when there are emotions at play. I’ve been there too. Now I’m on the other side, and I want to be careful.

I (F32) just came out of a long term relationship, and I don’t want to jump into another. However, I do want to date and have fun. I’ve been in this situation once before in my twenties  - coming out of a long term, live-in relationship. It was a fun time, I had some flings, went on some dates, enjoyed life and flirted a lot. I’d love to have that again!

So much has changed since then though. Now most of my friends have houses and kids. And I feel like everyone is very focus on building things. Be it a family or just a relationship that can last. I am not ready to build anything right now… except maybe my independence and feeling of self worth. 

Any thoughts on how to go about casually dating in your 30s? I don’t want to be too explicit in my dating profile. At the same time, I don’t want to hurt anyone by giving them the impression I’m ready to commit either.

40,o0vu7d,1623814799,Can attraction grow if you're turned off during Date 1?,"Once upon a time, I had a short-lived relationship where I wasn't attracted to the guy on the first date, but psyched myself up to go on a second date anyway, and ended up being super attracted to him from Date 2 and on.

Having a guy's attractiveness grow on me had never happened before that experience, and hasn't happened since.

But it's impacting my view on how many ""chances"" I should give a guy to see if I'll change my mind about being attracted to him.

Usually if I say ""yes"" to a second or third date, that means I definitely want to have sex with him eventually. However, with this other category of men, at the point when I would need to say ""yes,"" I might still feel like I would recoil at their touch and definitely don't want them to even kiss me. But I'm wondering if that's some weird barrier on my end and I just need to push through and go on more dates to see if attraction grows (like it did with this one person from my past).

For the record, of the last 4 guys I've been on in-person first dates with, it's been 50/50 if I'm attracted to them vs. kinda want them to never touch me, so it's not like I'm never attracted to anyone. Also, in all of my longer term relationships, I was attracted to them immediately when I met them.

I have a person right now that wants to go out again, and I just can't decide if I really want to spend an evening with him or if I'd rather be alone / with friends. Should I go just to see how I feel? I'm not a fan of wasting people's time, so I don't want to lead him on. But what if there's a chance, no matter how small, that I'll feel totally differently several dates in?

Other thing that keeps coming up is condom use. I swear by it. Birth control came up naturally on our second date and I said if we were to get to that point I would expect him to wear a condom. I use and IUD which he knows, but I am a believer in safe sex up until a point. Ive had every good friend / boyfriend in my life tell me it's bs when men say it's that much less good and I trust them and not random men trying to fuck me... anywho, we've had sex 10ish times. At least once a week we've had fights about him not wanting to wear a condom. Safe sex is the only sex I'm having with someone I'm not in a committed relationship with / hasn't had multiple STI tests months apart, I've told him this every time we've had this conversation.

Today, we're having a heated argument about him making multiple rape jokes while we were watching a movie. Which turned into a whole thing.

He said he ""looked better on paper then me so it shouldn't matter"" and ""and that I was flipping out"" 

So obviously that turned into bigger a fight , then it snowballed into one about condoms, where he said (and this is what the post/break up is about) **""  I just think your still seeing other guys, and that's why you want me to wear one ** "" that's a whole red flag on its own, I've repeatedly said I'm not seeing anyone else but he keeps pushing it, like I'm hidding something? But then it gets worse (remember I have an illness and take multiple pills a day). His exact next sentence is "" **are you sure you don't have something that your hiding with all those pills you take and that's why your so insistent on condoms? ** ""

I'm mad. Like I'm next level, spitting mad.

From day 1 I've set expectations that I want and expect to be safe, respected and healthy!

Am I over reacting? I couldn't even see straight when he said that to me I was so furious, and I want to be very clear, this is not to shame anyone who has an STI. Simply that I want to be in control of my own health and my body and I am not okay with someone treating me with such disrespect. But to have someone try and deflect, shame, and accuse me? How dare he?

My 2 best girlfriends say ghost him.

I want to have a legit break up conversation with him but and tell him what's up, but based on this and other conversations we've had I know he won't hear what I'm actually saying.

I'm writing this about an hour after he left, so if anything didn't make sense please feel free to ask! Lol

Edit: I'm getting alot of feedback to end it, which I had already decided to do when I wrote this post. ""How to handle the breakup"" was literally in the title, it was already decided lol My asking for advice for that part was because, I really don't think this guy is bad news bears, I think it's his inexperience with relationships that has gotten him here. He's had 3 major relationships, all lasting under 2 years, 2 of them about 10 years ago in his early 20s. He's said he doesn't have female friends, almost like it's a point of pride for him, because he believes men and women can't just be friends. I've met a bunch of his friends they're all in relationships / married with kids and really solid people. Never have I gotten *bad* vibes from him and my gut is usually spot on. I'm experienced in dating and the world and am good with setting boundaries. I do not want to shit on this guy. Nor do I want to be with him, but I legit think a conversation could be good for him.",datingoverthirty,t5_34cyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/o0yp80/how_upset_should_i_be_right_now_how_to_handle_the/

88,o1de84,1623872216,I’m trying to change my dating patterns and need an unbiased opinion on this situation involving my birthday (32f),"Hey! So I’m that type of person who runs on the anxious side and loves avoidant people, we all know me. 

A few weeks ago I met 30m on Hinge and he seemed super excited the first week, I even found it a bit overbearing. He wanted to have phone chats right away and they went surprisingly well. 

We met shortly after a few phone chats, but our hangout got cut short as he was called into work. Next hangout we had was only an hour and it was weird. Because my area’s still in Covid restrictions, we sat on his back patio. I had a glass of wine, he never even sat down and then asked if I wanted to walk, but then ended up driving me home. He said he was feeling tired and he seemed really anxious so I sent him a reassuring text saying it’s ok if he’s feeling a bit of anxiety and we should hang out for longer next time. He seemed to appreciate I recognized he was anxious. 

Next hangout, we watched a movie. Some cuddling and kissing but again super short hangout. 

Lastly, my birthday is tomorrow. I asked him earlier this week if he wanted to join a few friends at a patio with me, even if he just came for a drink. I thought perhaps a social setting would be interesting to observe how he was. He said it sounds like fun, but didn’t really say he was for sure down. Today, I told him I don’t know the plan but I’m to be free by 7pm if he wanted to join. He informed me he’s working overtime. He didn’t even try to reschedule a time to see me this week.

Is it social anxiety? I feel bad, I think I expected a bit more regarding the birthday thing even though we’ve only been on a few dates.

Edit: I should note I’m well aware the meeting friends thing is early and I appreciate people who brought this up already - but I should add he even suggested me meeting his buddies at a bbq, so I felt extending the invite matched.

93,o1ekq9,1623875184,Advice for dating with health issues and living with parents,"I am 34 years old and have had meaningful happy healthy relationships in the past. Now, I am looking for advice to help me as I put myself back out there in the dating world. Specifically, how to share and when to share the reality of living with an invisible illness. Additionally, advice on navigating a world where the first question in social situations and dating is often, “what do you do for a living?”

A little about myself. I was always extremely active in sports growing up and through college.I graduated with my Master’s in Accounting. Married my College sweetheart at 24. He left school to become a State Trooper and most of our relationship was long distance. Unfortunately, after getting married and living together we realized that we were not on the same page in a lot of ways and there was no compromise on his end. I was never a priority. We tried to make it work but ended up getting a divorce. We both moved on. I have no regrets, learned a lot about myself and of the part I played, mistakes I made in it ending. I was a CPA working at a Public Accounting firm. Loved my job and was good at it. Then, life smacked me in the face. I was having health issues including chronic pain, fatigue and ended up not being able to do my job. Took FMLA and tried to find answers.

I was in a relationship at the time but things ended amicably when I had to move back in with my parents. Long story short, 7 years later and with the correct diagnosis, my life is completely different. I have had relationships during this time. I have met men, both online and IRL through hobbies (shout out to fellow D&amp;D nerds), who have gotten to know me and accepted the fact that my life isn’t typical. It’s been a couple of years since I tried online dating but am ready to try again. 

My life has changed but with that has come so many of my better qualities. I am grateful for the things I do have and don’t take things for granted like before. I have so much more compassion and empathy. Through therapy, grief of losing my old life and acceptance of who I am now I am a very positive person. I have learned to talk about my feelings and not to be a mind reader. Life is too short. Each day may bring different challenges but small bits of gratitude add up to help get me through harder times. 

Any advice on dating with an illness that requires me to live at home? When is the right time to bring it up and how soon do I share the reality of my life. Some days I may be laid up in bed because I over did it the day before. My parents help me in a lot of ways.
