0,ordnd3,1627227083,Not sure if I'm starting to catch feelings for a friend,"Quick backstory about my ex (even though she isn't the main topic here)

Back in March my ex broke up with me.  It was a very toxic relationship full of gaslighting and emotional abuse which devastated me. My every attempt at communicating with her to fix our relationship was always met with an argument and me apologizing for something insignificant (white lies about not reading text messages, not being ""attentive"" enough, etc.). She tried to persuade me into being her ""friend"" after the breakup which I wouldn't accept because she only wanted my support without her having any obligation towards me, basically bringing the toxicity up another level. It all ended with me going no contact


After a month of breaking up I started to spend time with one of my colleagues. I've known her for about 2 years now, hung out only once or twice before and we initially got together to study. She also had a toxic relationship which ended around the time mine did, we both shared our stories and supported each other through our difficult time. She always compliments me, tells me I'm ""a perfect husband/boyfriend/future father"". After our exams were over we started hanging out more frequently, we text each other every day, she quickly became one of my best friends and I'm starting to question myself if I'm catching feelings for her. I wasn't attracted to her in the past so that's why I'm a bit confused about my feelings right now. I usually know if I'm physically attracted to a girl the minute I look at her but this seems different somehow, it's like we're building a connection over time slowly. Even if I am attracted to her, I'm not sure if it's a genuine feeling or I'm just starved of attention and still hung up on my ex. 

I've never had a deep platonic friendship like this and I'm not sure what to do here, not sure if I should do anything. She is special to me and I'm ""the best guy she's ever known"" (her words) and I wouldn't want to ruin our friendship just because I'm hung up on my ex and she is the one giving me support and attention. On the other hand, maybe deep friendships and gradually increasing connections are foundations of a long lasting relationship.

1,ordvha,1627227851,Dating women makes me feel so expendable and just worthless,"Guys are just so replaceable when it comes to dating now. Any girl I talk to has the ability to find a different guy in 6 minutes on her phone. 

It takes me literal months to find a girl who’s willing to go on a date with me. If I’m seeing one girl, I’m without a doubt putting all of my effort into her be I just don’t have a choice otherwise. Even if I wanted to date around I can’t. 

But most of the girls I’ve dated are usually dating more than one guy. I’m in constant competition for a chance at love and usually I loose out. 

You have to be perfect to get a girl now. I just can’t do that. Because of this I’m just replaceable.

3,oreruf,1627230735,Will Skipping Steps Lead to Damage in the Long Run?,"So I (25/F) haven't really dated anyone and definitely haven't had a real relationship. When I was a kid I was desperate for a boyfriend while everyone else still thought kissing was gross so I felt like I was gonna be ahead of the game but ended up falling behind. I liked a couple people as a teenager but it never matched up and I ended up feeling good that I didn't get involved in the mess that is high school dating.

But flash-forward a decade or so and I'm in basically the same position, bar a few people I've gotten to know on dating apps. My stance now is that I don't want to date someone unless I'm comfortable with them and I don't want to mess around - if we're in a relationship, it's serious and I need dedication to feel secure. A lot of people my age just want to mess around and I don't; I know this will change as my cohort gets older but I worry that not having these other experiences will damage my prospects in the long run.

4,orewk9,1627231157,I lost my perfect match and soulmate,"This is going to be long. I just want to paint a full picture of the situation.    

I'm a 22 year old guy who's recently realized that I'm not as completely straight as I thought I was my entire life. I've been talking to this guy on tinder for a few weeks. I'll call him JV. He's basically the perfect guy. He's very attractive and talented. He's a former model, he can sing and play a lot of instruments. We started messaging each other on snapchat and he started talking about how he wants to do dirty things to me.    

I told him that I don't like to talk sexually with someone when I don't know them that well, we've only been talking for a few days at most at that point. He told me that I made it seem like I didn't want to have sex with him, and that I should because I know that he likes me. I told him that I did, but I like to take things slow, and he understood.    

He's told me that he's obsessed with me and falling for me, how he can see himself spending his life with me, that he might be my perfect match and how the reason other dates I went on didn't lead to another one was because no one else is as smart as me, and that he's probably my perfect match. I'm basically social inept, never been in any relationships and only been on a few dates, but this seemed like everything I was longing for. A really attractive guy really liked me. I couldn't believe it.    

I told him about bad experiences I've had with people on dating apps before and he said that I must attract crazy people, but now I have him, and he'll sing me to sleep at night. I'm socially awkward so I've never been in a relationship before, and have only been on 3 dates so far, but this seems like something that I've been longing for for a while. The only potential issue is that we live an hour away from each other and I can't drive yet (I've taken driving lessons on and off over the years but I just have difficulty with it.)    

We videochatted a few days before we planned to go on a date. During the call, he told me that he was ""complicated"". He told me that he cheated on his previous boyfriend with older men because he has ""daddy issues"" and his ex boyfriend didn't satisfy his sexual needs, that one of his flaws is that he likes sex too much and that he blew JV off and didn't spend time with him a lot. This made me a little nervous, especially because me and him live an hour away from each other and JV and his ex boyfriend did too.    

But when I brought up my concerns to him the next day, he assured me that he regretted cheating in his previous relationship, and sex wasn't the main reason why things didn't work out. We set up a date on a weekend, to go to a diner near me for lunch. We were texting the night before and I mentioned a first date I went on last year where the guy tried to have sex with me, and how it made me feel because I don't like to have sex on the first date. JV replied saying that maybe we should cancel the date and go our separate ways because we're too different of people.  I told him that was probably for the best, as I didn't know where we could have sex because my family lives with my stepdad and he doesn't like me, my sister or any of his kids having significant others spend the night at the house. JV said that his ex stayed over at his house when they were dating, and that his family was fine with it, so I could too.    

He asked if I'd be able to fulfill his sexual needs and I told him that I could change my sexual boundaries for him, and he said that he thinks that this relationship could work. We went on the date and it went well. He told me that he usually doesn't drive an hour to meet someone for the first time, and that he didn't think he'd be trying to get into a relationship so soon after his last one ended, but that there was something about me that changed his mind on those things. We had lunch and then we went to a nearby park and made out for a bit on a nature trail. It was my first kiss. He asked if I wanted to go further, and I said that I didn't.   

After the date, we kept texting and we planned a second date. He said that he wanted to have sex with me on the second date and that if it was good, I'd be his boyfriend. We started talking about what kind of stuff we'd do to each other and sending each other nudes. He asked if I'd take him to my room to have sex on the second date, and I reminded him that I couldn't do that. He said that it had to be in his car then, which I thought was kind of strange, since the reason we were even still talking to each other was because he assured me that we could have sex at his house. His family was moving soon, but he knew about that before the night before the first date, so it wasn't like it unexpectedly came up after.    I asked him if we would wear condoms, and he said that if we were dating, that we'd only be having sex with each other, so we wouldn't have to, and also that he wanted to cum inside me. He assured me that he was clean and taking medication to prevent getting HIV.

I realized that even though I found him very attractive and he kind of drove me crazy, I didn't want to have sex on the second date. It's just too soon for me. I feel like I don't really know someone that well after talking for a few weeks and going on one date. I told him that I didn't feel like we were sexually compatible and that we should probably stop talking. He got upset, saying that I was acting like he was a sex addict and that he was hurt that I would assume that about him. I told him that I changed my mind but he said that I already made my choice, and that he couldn't be with someone who didn't know if they wanted to be with him. He then told me that his ex had been calling him recently and he's been ignoring it but now he might go back to his ex. 

We've stopped talking now, and I'm extremely frustrated with myself. This guy was so sweet to me. He was my perfect match and I completely ruined what would have been a great relationship. I've cried and gotten drunk a few times since all this happened. I'm just really upset with myself for blowing it.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/orewk9/i_lost_my_perfect_match_and_soulmate/
5,oreym1,1627231351,I don't know how to handle the aftermath after breaking things off,"So a briefing about I (21M) and a girl (19F) I am/was interested in. We met late 2019 and we just got each other really well. I've never been in a relationship and she just became someone I wanted to have a real one with. She told me that I was special and that the way things have progressed between us was something that had never happened to her. After about 2 months of being friends and I was ready to tell her how I felt, she told me one day that we needed to talk and that she has a boyfriend already and she didn't know if I was interested in her was why she never thought to tell me. As expected, I was shocked because the way she related with me wasn't like someone in a relationship. A lot of people even thought we were dating. She still wanted to remain friends and she was like the only person that got me so I continued the friendship. I eventually told her about my feelings and she rejected me as nice as possible and that she already had a boyfriend.

We continued talking all through the pandemic and got closer than before, I could not handle that kind of closeness and still term it friendship. I broke things off like 3 times during the pandemic and her coming back every time. She said I was always nice to her and that she loves talking to me, and that she likes me but not in that way at the moment, plus she was still together with her bf. Finally broke things off this February and told her to just let each other be. She said 'I know what you want but I just don't see it happening anytime soon."" That was not the answer I wanted and I remained firm about us cutting contact. 

Now, it's been 5 months and nothing has really changed for me. I still like her a lot and even though we don't talk, we attend the same church and I see her every Sunday. Just seeing her and not being able to tell her how nice her dress is, how beautiful she looked and ask how she's been as just been so hard. At times, I look away and don't talk to her at all, at times I just say hi. She's reached out four times during this period. The first was to ask for an advice about her career, the second was to check up on me, the third was when the football club she supported won UCL and the last time was last week, a robbery happened in the street I live and she was checking in to ask if I was safe. I know she cares about me but it doesn't make it hurt any much less. I'm really trying my best to move on, unfollowed her on all socials, deleted her pics and number but it's just not been working. She's the closest thing I've had to a girlfriend. And I don't want her to think I'm doing any of this out of revenge or anger or anything like that. I get that she is loyal to her bf but it just sucks. 

There's also the issue of a beanie and cardigan she made for me during the pandemic and planned to give me once we resumed. Well, she hasn't and I don't even know what to make of that. I'm confused about how to handle everything in general. Should I keep looking away when I see her, should I say hi and ask about her, her birthday is coming in a few weeks, should I wish her? Or should I just regard her as someone who is no longer in my life and not give a damn about her??",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oreym1/i_dont_know_how_to_handle_the_aftermath_after/

Not a big deal to me in the slightest. But I’ve heard it’s usually a bigger deal to women if they are the older one in the relationship. I don’t think she knows I’m younger then her cause I’m rather tall and have a full beard so I look older then I am.

still a virgin.

I am low energy/laid back so I like to invest and spend quality time with one person. Unfortunately, this does mean I have a tendency to get attached eventually/put all my eggs in one basket.

* Always assume the person you're seeing is seeing others as well 
* Keep it fun and light hearted at first 
* ""Go with the flow,"" and don't rush to define what's going on 

However, I really hate these rules. I know you can't force a long term relationship but it feels like no one is actively looking for a serious relationship off the bat which makes sense.

After a month, I ask her out again, and she said yes and then we finally gone out and she is interested during the date. After the first date, I ask her out again and she said yes, but later only to break that date because she forgot of an important arrangement made on that day.  We later reschedule the date and gone out the second time and it was a blast.

**Me: Hey so I know we made a few comments last night about you going back to [his school] &amp; I feel like I left some things open-ended. I don’t want to give you mixed signals so I want to clear them up before we see each other again

I would’ve liked to have this convo in person but it’s sort of bugging me haha

I think we mesh really well together and I’d love to see this continue past the summer, but I’m open to seeing where it goes. I know the timing is less than ideal so I’d love to know where your head is at about everything and what your expectations are**

**Him: 
Yeah I completely understand, was wondering the same. I’m really enjoying where we’re at now, getting to hang and experience things with you. I know how difficult a relationship can be at a distance, especially at a distance that far. my fear is that we’d both be too busy to be as attentive as we’d expect for a committed relationship, so i just don’t know that it would be smart to go in with that mindset that might lead to someone getting hurt. what’re your thoughts?**

Yesterday he was over and I was joking about when he was going to ask me to be his girlfriend. 

He told me he’s too busy and can’t focus on his day to day tasks. So he wouldn’t have time for me. 

I’m happy with what we’re doing. But, if he really liked me, wouldn’t he ask me to be his girlfriend? Am I settling?

I’m confused on what to do. I don’t want to wait too long for him to ask me to be his girlfriend. Will I then wait too long for him to ask me to marry me? Wait too long to have kids? 

I don’t want to rush marriage or kids but if I’m waiting until he’s 100% ready, what if I end up waiting too long?

Should I reach out to her and if so how long should I wait to reach out to her?,"Doing a little backstory so you guys can see where I'm at with this girl. Last weekend I went to a backyard party at a friend's house from high school. At some point a friend of mine came up to me and told me this girl thought I was cute. So we started talking and playing drinking games together and we got along really well. She took the initiative to bring up going on some sort of date together and I got her number. 

We spent all week texting back and forth, not too crazy but we were having good conversations with actual substance to them. And there were other good cues I was getting from her that told me she is definitely into me. We set a date for Thursday and we went out to get dinner and then we were supposed to go mini golfing but we ended up talking for so long in the restaurant that the mini golf place was closed by the time we were done. 

We ended up meeting a friend of hers and going back to her house to hang out. I invited a friend at their suggestion and we were having a good time. During the night we ended up making plans to go out to a local tiki bar the next night. I texted her early in the afternoon to see what her plans were because we didn't iron out all the details yet. She got back to me a few hours later while I was at the gym. She texted me twice. Once saying what her general plan was and then a second text an hour later. Her uncle died so she was now being dropped off to be with her family. I texted her saying that I was so sorry and hope she's ok and to let me know if there was anything I could do. 

I haven't heard from her since then which was Friday and I was just wondering given our rapport so far, if I should just reach out to her at some point and say something like, ""Hey, just wanted to check in and see how you were doing in light of what happened. I hope you and your family are doing well."" Is this is a good idea? If so how long should I wait? I know she almost certainly needs space to process what happend but I also want to let her know that I care. Would it be too much to send a message at all?

So on Friday I finally found an opportunity where we were both alone for a moment and I asked her if she wanted grab a drink sometime. She seemed really caught off guard and said “yeah we should *all* grab a drink together sometime”. She seemed a little uncomfortable while she saying and I got the hint immediately and said “yeah ok that’s cool, have a good weekend” and I went home. 

I’m just wondering what I should do now. My gut is telling me to avoid initiating any interactions with her from now on and to try not to look at her or make eye contact from afar anymore.

25F college graduate who is struggling in the dating world. Never dated anyone or been on a date. My social life is kind of tragic and I'm the only one in my friend group without a partner. I've been thinking about this for the last couple of years and to me its kind of obvious I'm not up to the standard of how women should look like today. I'm slim and go to the gym regularly but I'm definitely not attracted. I used to be ranked last on the lists guys used to create in school and that has kind of stayed with me through out my life.

Spoke to a friend yesterday who suggested cosmetic procedures (fillers) to try and accentuate features in my face like lips, cheekbones and nose. I think it would drastically change my life, going from the ""ugly girl"" persona to a more better looking woman.

I've been reading around subs like this one on reddit and have gathered the fact that women are placed into ""values""  by guys - every woman has a market value, you're either hot and dateable or unattractive and not so dateable, mostly used for sex. The second category doesn't sound nice to be in so trying to avoid.

I am a very shy person so its hard for me to make the move and when i do my other problem is i fall for people quite easily and it's kind of hard to move on   (this one girl situation was a year ago and i still think about her ,i mean i moved on but she's still on my mind because i keep seeing her still viewing my stories)
All of them does that everything is over but they keep liking my posts and viewing my stories they just won't get out of my mind.

I never ever dated anyone for more than a first date  never kissed anyone never got intimate with anyone never got to express my true feelings with anyone, i have friends but no one i feel comfortable with to talk about these things.

At the first few tries i can move on and i understand that i am not gonna be everyone's type and it's quite common in my age but now it's really getting to me i can't stop thinking about it day and night it's making me sad and feeling bad about myself i tried to make peace with it but i just can't help thinking :

Am i that boring? Am i that ugly ? Am i that bad of person ? Why can't anyone like me?  Why can't anyone give me a chance ? It can't be that hard there's something wrong with me most of my friend group are in relationships or seeing someone, it's just me i can't help but feel lonely and unlikable and constantly in doubt of my self i tried but i just can't.

It's affecting the way i think about myself i am starting to doubt every choice i make like my clothes and my hair.

I know this may not seem like a big deal to many people but to me it really does ,i don't want to be in a relationship just for the sake of it and to match with my friends it's really not, i just want to be in one so i can know that i am normal and that i am worthy for someone. 

I want to feel loved and wanted by someone other than my family.

i just need geniun advice and the perspective of people other than mine.
also please, just don't try to tell me that it's normal and i will eventually will find someone because BELIEVE me i know , and am sick of hearing it.

I've been dating this guy for 2 months. We met through Tinder and went on 4 dates the first 2 weeks, which all went really good, I even met his friends. We have been texting every day the past 2 months.

Then we didn't see each other for a month (he got Covid, I got ill etc.), but I started to feel he was making less of an effort to ask me to hang out, even though we still texted every day.

But last week he invited me week to a party at his house. I stayed the night at his and he told me he likes me and I said the same to him. He asked me what I'm looking for. I said I want something serious and he said he doesn't know what he wants but that he can see it going somewhere with me.

A few days after I texted him that I really like him and he said the same (again).

At the party I was talking to his best friend and she told me that she hasn't seen him being interested in someone as much as he is in me in a long time, but that his heart has been broken before.

A few days ago I finally asked him why he isn't really making an effort to see me (as in, go on dates), to which he replied that he is very busy and doesn't really know what he wants. ""He needs to take some time to figure things out and he knows it sounds shit but he doesn't want to waste my time either""

I am obviously going to respect what he said and give him the space he needs. And I'm ready to move on, but I don't wanna shut him off completely in case he does change his mind.

Here, my friend, who is the co-owner/developer of this application, just launched this in the U.S. so let me tell you why I’d love to recommend this to all of you.

I believe most of us who use dating application may sometimes feel sick of swiping and swiping and then waiting for someone to match with. Sometimes, that someone may have different view of life from you and the conversation just dies down. This goes on and on but why you have to waste time on this?

If you value your potential partner’s attitude more than anything else, « Ansxer » is the answer. Here how it works:

1. You can download the application from ansxer.com
2. Create your profile and set up/select up to 10 questions that you would like to ask others (can be both MCQ and Q&amp;A)
3. Once you like someone, you swipe right and then you will be asked to answer his/her questions
4. That someone will not see your profile picture. Only answers will be displayed unless they like you back and tadaaa it’s a match!
5. Now, time to start your convo.

Who knows, love at first conversation can start here 😉 (at least, it happens to me)

Feel free to share this post and give comment/feedback so that we can enhance that. We’re really excited and would love to hear from you!

I also got absolutely 0 confidence in how i look, despite i’m tall ( I can send you some pics of me in dms if you want me to )

I’ve seen this dude’s videos on Youtube ( ThatWasEpic is the channel’s name )… he’s an handsome blonde ( and tall ) guy that has so much confidence that he approaches girls on the streets. And usually gets numbers too. I know that maybe my country is way more strict and diffident ( nobody wants to be approached especially on the streets ) but i felt very bad while i was watching his videos. It gave me so much anxiety that I started to doubt about my future… does a guy REALLY have to approach random girls like that? Just to be in a relationship?

Or when I send him snaps like he does he doesnt always respond, even if i'm saying something that garners a response.

88,ormvr6,1627256568,I miss him but I hate him at the same time,"I’m not going to lie, it has been hard to find someone who is right for me. I struggled with picking the right guy my whole life. About 3 months ago, I met a guy who I thought was a wonderful fit for me. Same morals, same religious beliefs, same interests. We spent so much time together and I quickly fell in love. He said he was in love too, and often told me that. 

He left me a couple days ago and I’m in shambles. He told me he didn’t feel anything for me anymore and that during sex (I gave my virginity to him) he felt nothing for me. He said he could’ve orgasmed just the same on his own and that I did nothing for him. I was distraught. I could’ve sworn I saw love in his eyes when he looked at me, and I really believed all the compliments and encouragements he gave me. He says it all wasn’t true. How can you have sex with someone who you’ve put so much emotional investment into (especially when YOU ask for it) and not feel anything? 

The reasons all shift; he doesn’t love me anymore, the spark died, sex wasn’t what he thought it was, our relationship doesn’t make him happy, he doesn’t emotionally connect with me. The last one hits hard because I did everything I could to be a better person with him. I listened to everything he ever asked of me and respected his feelings. When he said to change something because it wasn’t working for him, I did. I did everything I could to support him and I spent hundreds of dollars on him trying to make him understand how special he was to me.

And maybe I should’ve known. I felt a bit defensive and nervous after our first time, and I think it’s because on a subconscious level I knew he was a liar. I did too much too fast because I thought he could be “the one,” but apparently this was just a fling. That might be crazy to some of you, that I felt so certain about him, but I can’t explain it. It just felt so right with him.

I just want to know why, if it wasn’t serious for him, he said all that shit about taking me home to his family and confessing his love to me. He knew he didn’t feel the same way but he still called every night and fed into my belief that he truly loved me. It really just breaks my heart that I gave my virginity to a guy who didn’t even appreciate it.

To top it all off, I found out he was giving my abusive ex tips on how to get in bed with me after we broke up. He even said he sympathized with him. He always told me how bad my ex was to me and how I deserved better. Guess those were lies, too.

90,orn5sd,1627257602,Advice needed:,"Do I write in my online dating profile that I am agoraphobic???

&amp;#x200B;

I (m38) am newly divorced after being married for 20 years. I thought I had a happy marriage but I was being cheated on repeatedly. My ex wife blamed my agoraphobia and the impact it had on her life for her cheating on me. She cheated on me with her boss....her best friends husband.....dads from our kids school and various others.  Eventually I had to end the marriage because of this. To be cheated on because of an illness you can not help is soul destroying and it completely took my confidence away. 

Thats my problem. Around 15 years ago I developed Agoraphobia. I would really like to meet a woman to have a real relationship.....but being agoraphobic is not exactly a turn-on I am finding.

So if I do an online dating profile, do I put in it that I suffer with this illness and it does impact my life? I figure what is the point lying? If I hide it and then decide to meet with someone I meet online....I think they are going to clock on pretty quickly. So is it best to be upfront?

Or....

As it seems to be such a turn-off, am I better off trying to build up a rapport with someone and getting to like each other and then drop it in down the line somewhere? hopefully by that point they will like me enough not to care.

I don’t care if she says anything about me cuz she ain’t like that it’s just if something goes wrong I could piss off this friend (she’s rly defensive around her friend group) and I could possibly end up not being mates anymore.

- some of my friends don’t particularly like her, not like either her or them did anything she just has a strange sense of humour and comes off a little weird. Again they aren’t dicks or anything but my best friend is hopeless when he’s drunk, always says stupid shit so I’d always be on edge if those two were in the same room

- Idek if this chick knows that we live so close and went to the same school n shit off my Tinder profile alone - she doesn’t rly know me that well.

I’m not rly worried about any of this for my sake it’s just Ik she suffers from pretty bad Anxiety and I rly don’t want to hurt her feelings in any way cuz I rly do like her.

I also know that I’m looking way too far in the future it’s just I basically gotta choose if I’m going for it or not cuz i don’t wanna lead ppl on - thanks for reading and any advice is welcome!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/orn8gv/complex_situation_any_ideas_on_wtf_i_should_do/
92,orn8il,1627257854,She (F23) thought I was joking when I (M23) asked her out?,"I slid into the dms of a girl I knew from a while ago. In the past, she would give me heavy IOIs (smiling, heavy/deep eye contact) and even flirt with me in front of her bf. I deemed that to mean that she was interested, but didn't think much of it at the time. Now, when I asked her out, she responded ""this is a prank."" I took that to be a soft rejection and stopped responding. Since then, I've seen her out and about. The first time her body language was cold, and I ignored her as well. Then the next times, she was blushing and wanting my attention. Then I noticed she removed me from her socials. I don't know what to make of this?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/orn8il/she_f23_thought_i_was_joking_when_i_m23_asked_her/
93,ornant,1627258079,What do i do,"Long story short, was dating a guy for 4 months and he turned around and said he’s not sure what he wants bc of his depression. Me being naive I hung around for a bit. Now that I’ve stopped messaging him first I rarely hear from him. My question is, do I call him and end what ever this is or do I just go about my life and not message",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ornant/what_do_i_do/

95,ornc1q,1627258222,Venting,"My boyfriend (19M) is a gamer and he’s always online and talked to many people. I (19F) like to play games for fun but they are not as serious for me. I’m a person who like to go outside and chill. He never goes outside because of his anxiety. He gets mad at me when I go outside and when I’m with my friends. We constantly have arguments about having friends of the opposite sex. I do most of the work in this relationship I pay for everything to see him. I buy food and everything he wants. My males friends have been my friends for over 2 to 3 years I’ve never had any attraction to any of them. Since being in this relationship I put distance between myself and my male friends. I hangout with my boyfriend almost 24/7 and only go out sometimes. So I can be there for him. 

The recent incident has made me really upset. It has been really hard to trust him with other females because he has a tendency to validate other females feelings over mine and it makes me feel worthless. We had an argument and he went and texted another girl before he talked about it with me. He’s always talking to new girls and he’s always online. I want him to get out into the world. I’m not opposed to him having female friends at all but it hurts when he talks to them everyday and that girls he just met he gets upset over them so much show that if I said I don’t want them talking he stops showing affection to me and completely ignores me",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ornc1q/venting/

99,ornim9,1627258892,How do I want to be treated?,"There's a point of contention between my partner (21f) and I (23f). We've been on the rocks for a bit because I feel like my efforts aren't being reciprocated. I plan and pay for dates; she just has to get dressed and get in the car. I keep both of our apartments clean. When I spend time with her, I ensure there is nothing to distract me from her. When she's upset, I either listen or actively provide solutions (every venting session is different). Recently she's been looking to get a second job, so I helped her revamp her resume, prep for interviews, and even spent some of my free time applying for jobs on her behalf. I shower her with compliments, tell her often that I love her, and give her as many hugs/kisses as humanly possible. On one hand, I don't feel like I'm doing a lot for her because these are all things that make her happy or feed into her in some other way, so I really don't mind doing it. I often find myself caring for her naturally because I just want to see her smile. It's like second nature to do things that I know will make her day a little better. On the other hand, I feel like I'm doing a lot. I don't want to be one of those people that does something nice and asks what they get in return, but....ya know? While she is a priority to me, I think I'm more of an afterthought to her.

I took my frustrations to her recently and told her how I felt like she wasn't trying, and she asked me how I'd like to be treated. My first point was that I'd like her to be more intimate and physical (through hugs and cuddling or whatever, not sex), and she said she wasn't that kind of person. I also asked for more words of affirmation, and she said *again* that she wasn't that kind of person. She said she'd work on it and that I'd have to be more patient until she was more comfortable. (Side note: she has no problem eating me out or being sexual, but hugs are simply *far* too much for her???). I asked for her to start planning/paying for dates and helping around the house, and she said she wasn't the best at planning, she's not in the best financial situation to start paying, and she works so much that it can be difficult to muster the energy to help clean. She's asked me to come up with other ways that I'd like to be treated, but I'm clean out of ideas. It seems like she's uncomfortable with everything I'm asking for, but I don't have any other things that I'd like that would be a decent compromise.

I guess my actual question is: how would I like to be treated? Does anyone have ideas on what I can ask her to do to make me feel like I'm more of a priority? Any feedback is appreciated, and please don't hesitate to ask questions!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ornim9/how_do_i_want_to_be_treated/
