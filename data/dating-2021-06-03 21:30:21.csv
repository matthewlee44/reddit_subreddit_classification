So I have this gurl who I was seeing a couple years back. We had a lot of great sex but wasn’t in any form or relationship. She really wanted for us to date but she is a wanton and I just didn’t know how to deal with that or the fact that she has several sexual partners. Well we had this 3some with this girl and sometime later she comes to look for me and finds the girl around tried to stay over but I asked her out she got upset about it and tried to sleep with my friend who is also my neighbor. She gave him good head and tried to convince him with sleeping with her to which he agreed to but told me a lie that he couldn’t ever be into such a wanton woman and that she wasn’t his type whereas the truth remains he went to get his condom then she declined and next morning told him to tell me they had sex. I guess his feelings were hurt and he must have felt stupid but he didn’t have to lie to me cause I already established to him we just had a sexual thing and nothing more and if he was into her and wanted her he could go ahead to lie with her. Well he failed. Well I let everyone in on the gist cause I got tired of them asking after her. 2months in she came back and all she’s saying is shes been obsessed with me and how I fuck her and how she misses my dick. She’s basically shameless and doesnt care what the neighbors think. I do like her cause she’s handy and fucks well but I don’t think I should continue with a person I did so much for and helped financially to just come back in that easily. We have had some wild times recently but there’s still that void there. Now I’m a hunk  of a man and very good looking.

9,nrvawk,1622776595,Best way to let someone down after a month of dating.,"I've been dating this guy for about a month now. He is much more attached and invested than I am and I have come to the conclusion that this is not a relationship I would like to pursue. The reason for this is I just don't feel a connection that is 100% there and would rather be single.

I tried to break it off about three nights ago however, he came back and said the following points:

\- But haven't you enjoyed yourself every time we have seen each other?  
\- Am I not good enough?  
\- Do you not find me attractive?

All of the above I honestly couldn't say I disagreed with because I did find him attractive, I did have a good time and I honestly believe theres never an instance where some is 'not good enough'. As there was nothing really tangible as to why I want to stop seeing him he suggested we keep casually dating to see if anything improves.

Immediately after we parted I regretted not breaking it off and agreeing to continue to see each other. Three days later and I've been very anxious about even if he texts me. I know that I need to break it off once and for all but I would love some pointers on how to do this firmly yet still kindly. He has made it clear in our last chat about this that he does not want to be friends in anyway.

I also don't want it to seem like I'm trying to waste his time as I also said to him that it is something I am conscious of.

Last chat was also face to face as I wanted to show him some respect as I still like him as a person. Any advice moving forward would be so great!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nrvawk/best_way_to_let_someone_down_after_a_month_of/

13,nrvwaq,1622778663,I need a crash course of how to talk to girls,"For some context, I'm an 29y old (M). Due to some circumstances, I'm never in a relationship. Trying yo get into one a few times, one lead to nowhere and we stay friend, one indirectly reject me through social media, one indirectly mention she have a boyfriend. Being tired of getting to know someone, I focus on my education and career. 

Fast forward to now, I'm having a good job, and more confident about myself. But when you're at the age when all of your friends have a significant other, the loneliness just creep up to you. And so I start by online dating, and that's where the problem show up. A few girl that I match with don't talk much, basically I can't keep their attention. A girl that I talk a bit more because I mention her cat ask me do I never talk to girl and she hit the nail on the head, she knew it just by a few day talking and eventually ghost me too. My friend said it will come with experience but I personally think it won't (for me) and I feel like a jerk talking to a few girls at once. 

So that lead to my question, how should I keep the conservation rolling, how to keep their attention and entice them to talk. I know the rule of less messaging and quickly get to a date in person, but due to Covid, our place is in lockdown, so we can't expect the cafe or other places to open in a few weeks.

19,nrwj2f,1622780916,I just don’t know what to do (M26),"So here’s the story, I haven’t been with a woman intimately in over 4 years and it’s a tough time even talking to women anymore. I live in a suburban area around a relatively small city and it’s a drug and crime center. Everyone tries to leave and i simply don’t have the means or desire to leave because where i live is a very nice neighborhood in a decent house with my brother and our roommate. 

The problem is everybody wants to leave this area the second they turn 18, first to college then to anywhere else to continue their lives and it is what it is. I can’t find anybody even close to my age that isn’t unbearable or truly a lost cause. I’m a chef and although I’m not very good I’ve some how got a ton of promotions and raises recently so I’m actually getting decent money now. But me being a chef with more responsibility leads to an unwinnable situation. 

I come home exhausted every day 5-7 days a week 10-12 hour days depending on the day, never a holiday off because those are our busy nights. Why even make someone deal with that kind of life? The reason i learned to cook was to share that food with the people i love and it’s oddly hard to find someone to love. I pretty much sacrificed my life for decent pay to learn a trade that limits how much i can truly express what I’ve learned or for time for myself at all. 

Then we have The last woman i was with was my 4th “body” i guess you could say, so i was never really hooking up. My first girlfriend was a 4 year relationship, followed by 3 shorter 2-5 month relationships over the next 2 years until i turned 22. After that last woman i left college because i lost all interest and drive to do anything. Not specifically because of her, this actually happened while i was with her. But after our break up i made the decision to move back home with my brother closer to my family. 

Now i look around and can’t even imagine trying to tolerate any of these women i see. All the good ones left or have been taken, and the good ones i do find, what do i even look for anymore? I don’t even want to meet people online because it’s absolutely hell on earth. With my schedule it’s almost impossible to try and even start seeing someone, it’s a terrible time folks

25,nrwv48,1622782196,Why do I feel guilty? (NSFW?),"I just want to vent about this situation. I (24M) hooked up with a girl (20F) recently. Started off with clear intentions, very casual. We had sex right away. It was fun, not the best. Huge problem though- she wanted me to remove my condom. I asked if she was on birth control and she said don’t worry, everything was fine. When I came, I tried to pull out but she hooked me with her legs so I really couldn’t. Afterwards she tells me that she isn’t on birth control, she’s just confident that she won’t get pregnant. That’s the first problem. She spends the night, I had work in the morning so we had to wake up really early. I wake up to her rubbing my penis though. She tells me how bad she wants to have sex. I tell her that I’m too tired, I need to go to work soon and I need sleep. I was still half asleep, but I remember saying “no”. She doesn’t listen, gives me oral sex before getting on top and riding me until I came again. And again, no condom. So that’s the second problem.

Days go by, I’m freaking out because I do not want a kid right now. Especially with a random hookup. I tell her this, she gets upset. Finally her period starts and I have the biggest sense of relief. I keep thinking about everything though.

She’s constantly messaging me throughout this, constantly asking for sex, and refuses to use any form of protection.

So today I cut her off. I told her I’m not comfortable with the type of sex she wants and how careless she is. Now all of a sudden she has feelings. She’s acting heartbroken. She claims she wanted more from me. She’s crying. I’m the bad guy and I used her apparently.

I’m not going to cave. I know she’s playing games. And I know I made the right decision by cutting her off. I don’t feel bad about that. I still feel guilty for some reason though. I’m not sure if it’s because I believe that I hurt her somehow? Or if because I know this is now just a one night stand and that’s not how I usually do things? I’m not sure.

26,nrx6co,1622783386,Dating difficulty varies for each individual and the general idea of “attractiveness” is not useful in explaining that,"People usually have answers for what is generally attractive in guys and what isn’t. I.e. confidence, status, good looks, height, muscularity, money etc. The usual advice given to people struggling to get dates is to improve these things and put yourself out there.

However, these things don’t universally help everyone equally. Particularly, as a minority, when I compare myself to my non minority friends, I’m supposed to be more attractive on paper on all these factors. Certainly they agree as well. In fact, when I do get dates, they are more attractive than the dates my friends get on average.

However, they seem to be getting a lot more dates and meeting a lot more people, which allows them to find someone they are compatible with more easily.

It is pretty clear that race is something a lot of people, maybe even the majority, factor into dating preferences. And I’m not talking only about same race dating. 

I think the conventional viewpoint of be attractive and don’t be unattractive only applies for those in the majority. There has to be more awareness about how dating can be orders of magnitude harder if you are attractive but don’t suit the majority’s preference (and even people in the same racial group) when it comes to dating. I think a lot of people who voice things like this are instantly accused of being an uncle when a lot of them are just well put together people who are confused about why dating is so hard for them because the common narrative doesn’t account for them.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nrx6co/dating_difficulty_varies_for_each_individual_and/
27,nrx7ey,1622783503,I have a crush on my friend,"So little a year ago me [16M] and my friend Ben [15M] sat down at a random lunch table with 3 other kids there. These kids names are Carter [17M], Chloe[16F], and Lilly[16NB].

The 5 of us started talking and we all realized that we were all mega nerds. We mainly talked about Pokemon.

Anyway so during lunchtime oftentimes Ben, Carter and Lilly would be leaving Chloe and I out a bit. Not intentionally but just talking about stuff we were interested in. Me and Chloe pretty much just showed memes to the other. We really started to bond. I started to develop feelings for her.

Then COVID hit. Just my luck that before hand Chloe was the only person I was not able to get the phone Number of. So a year went by. A few months ago I was talking to Lilly. I mentioned Chloe to her. She said she could give me Chloe's discord. I took her up on that offer in a heartbeat.

So me and Chloe started talking again through discord. It seemed as if she and her family were doing pretty good.

About a month ago Ben invited us all to go see Godzilla vs Kong. Me, Chloe, Ben and Carter all showed up. Lilly couldn't make it. When I walked in Chloe was the only one there. I greeted her with a high five. During the movie we were both going crazy. After the movie was over Chloe hugged me before we left the theater room. I was caught of gaurd but hugged back. When we got outside Chloe's mom agreed to take a photo of the 4 of us. I felt Chloe put her arm around me. I put my arm around her but didn't want anyone to know that I liked her so I put my other arm around Ben.

Before Chloe left she hugged me one more time. I hugged back. She gives the best hugs I have ever felt. No she did not hug anyone else.

The 2 of us have now been talking on the phone practically everyday since the movie. 

I want to ask her out but I am far too afraid to loose my best friend if she rejects me and things then become awkward. I know its only awkward if we make it awkward but we are literally 2 of the most awkward people in school. 

I plan on asking her out eventually but i feel like if I do I will loose our friendship which is the most important thing to me.

35,nry348,1622786887,Dating Feels So Hopeless...,"Dating feels so hopeless. 

I'm not a miserable guy by any means. I've got things in my life that bring me joy, purpose, and tranquility. I don't feel like I need a relationship, but I still just really want one. I miss the feeling of having someone to give your love to, spend time with, sex/intimacy, all those wonderful things. 

And so, what do I do? 

Dating apps? Those will crush your soul. Be one of the twenty guys chasing any given girl, and in an environment where people have no accountability. Seems like even a simple ""I'm not feeling it"" text after a date is above-standard; ghosting has become the norm. And to even get a date is already an achievement. You make small talk over and over again in hopes of a date, carefully crafting each text as to not turn them away. God help you if you don't have some great pictures of yourself on hand. It's incredibly draining. 

In-person? Cold approaches? Are you kidding me? I'm supposed to go and approach hundreds of women out in the wild? I don't even know if I like them -- I don't know them, yet I'm supposed to approach them? The dynamic just isn't there.  It's too cold. People aren't finding love by randomly approaching strangers. Especially not in a climate where there are so many women are closed-off due to trauma caused by creeps. 

Yeah I know, social groups are the way to go. Go make friends over a common hobby, and expand your social network until eventually you organically meet a women who is:

a) Also single, emotionally available, and looking for a relationship.
b) Romantically compatible: matching sexuality, wants the same things in the long-term, etc.
c) Physically and emotionally attracted to you, and vice-versa.

And then maybe, just maybe, you can have a relationship. Though it's never that simple. Relationships feel like something that just magically happens; love won't fall into your lap because you're outside of the house doing some hobby you enjoy. 

So I'm sitting here, venting in a bout of loneliness, and I feel utterly hopeless. I'm taking care of everything in my control: working on a good career, financially stable, in shape, fashionable, social hobbies, hygiene/fragrance on point, all of that. And I'm mostly at peace, despite this rant. I can take a rejection in stride. 

It just feels completely out of my control, and therefore hopeless. 
I feel like I'm locked outside in the cold, looking in at this thing I want, and just hoping that someone unlocks the door for me eventually.

So, I've just kinda ignored wanting to date because of that. Even on dating apps I just don't find anyone I'm interested in...

It may be due to my deal-breakers or it may be due to a inability to be vulnerable. Or I just could still subconsciously be wary of finding a partner again because my last long term partner cheated on me.

He said he wanted to see her to only get “closure” and say goodbye (ps. They broke up 4 months ago) so I told him there’s nothing to say anymore because you guys have been broken up and prob wanted to start talking to her and getting back with her. He tried to explain everything and asked me to give him a second chance to fix everything. He said that he knows that I don’t trust him but he just wants to prove himself to me and treat me very good this time. I told him I need time to think about it so I didn’t cut him off yet. He told he will never see or talk to his ex again and he sent her a text saying that he will block her and doesn’t wanna talk to her again and he sent me a screenshot and proof of it. just a reminder we have been talking for 2 months and are not serious at all, we haven’t hooked up or anything yet either.

If a person has Bad Personality they're having that Bad Personality indeed, irrespective of their looks.

I was talking to some obese/ fat girl who told me how ""Dating is hard for me"" and how guys are shallow to NOT approach her for a date. So I flipped the question and asked her: ""If you were slim and attractive and your boyfriend was fat what'd you do?"".

And she replied: ""I'll kick his ass and send him to the gym"". And currently she's obese.

I felt so sad as if that these Average Looking Girls are just being kind and well behaved because they're NOT getting any guy because they're Average Looking. 

NOT generalising, but it's sad when Men date an Average Looking Girls thinking they're better than Pretty Looking Women, instead they too have their real intentions but have suppressed them.

The lesson I learnt was to improve myself and date a 8/10 or a 7/10 Decent Looking Girl, with Good Personality and Character and who's educated and has a job instead of some 4/10 fake girl.

And I personally believe that, Men should Improve (in terms of looks) themselves and date a better chick (not definetly saying to date a supermodel) but a decent girl.

There’s this guy that I work with and it’s probably been a decent like 3 weeks of interaction with this guy. So.. I noticed him looking at me, or giving me the stare as i walk past him and sometimes direct eye contact. you get it.. lol the guy would stare. and for a couple days that’s how it was &amp; so.. then eventually I just nodded my head and he’s like “Hey!” all like... flirty i’d say. and so we just kept it at that for a little longer until one work day we were actually assigned to the same area — so we were now working with each other. And then we formally introduced ourselves “Hi, my name is..” — &amp; surprisingly we hit it off with conversation. like, meaning like i was able to get laughs out of him and he got some out of me. I also flirted a little by complimenting him on his muscles and asking if he worked out. We both shared some common interest in a few things and I guess we just had really nice conversation is what i’m trying to say. 


So the day after we met he asked for my number at the end of our shift. Then later that day maybe like 2hrs after shift or so I saw that I had a missed call from him and so I called him back and we were chatting for a while maybe an hour over the phone just going back and forth talking about a various amount of topics and that was well it was good. I mentioned to him that I hadn’t been to a river before and that I’d want to go one day. So funny thing, later that night I guess I had fallen asleep because the text was sent to me at about 9pm, but anyway. The text was a photo of a river &amp; he’s like “This is a good spot we could go? Where do you live?” and I just replied “oh wow, yeah that’s pretty. i’m 25 from that park.” and that was it right. 


So uh the next day — I noticed 2 missed called from him and a text that said, “Today seems like a good day to go to the river to me” and so i call him back right? and we chat, conversation good, flowing and there’s laughs. He’s like let me take you to the river, then he goes on to paint me a picture of what it could be so he says.. “the weather is good it’s nice and sunny, i could bring a big sandwich to share and sodas and beer corona to be exact and with lime since you said you never had it with lime, and we could bring chairs, and my dog will run free while we are at the river come on” and i admitted to him that i felt i’d be nervous about the river so i said no, then it turned into yes lol.

Fast forward — 
So, we’re at the river and it’s all great. we’re vibing, hanging out with his dog (glad she liked me, lol) and we’re drinking beers. so after a while of swimming together and stuff he starts to get closer to me while we are conversating, like doing such things like: 
•••
holding me by my hips in the water while facing him.
grabbing my hand and holding it.
brushing his hands along my sides.
side hugging in the water with with soft thigh grips.
and, there was many times i lost my balance due to the rocks lol i didn’t have river shoes so when he’d brace me it was very close body to body action goin’ on.
•••
so all these things are going on as we have great conversation about actual things. sorry to be so vague when i say conversation but yes. we ended up making out in the water &amp; thats when it got spicy. We stayed in after the kiss but then got out and ended up getting out to eat. 

Fast forward again, so as we are leaving the river he kisses me goodbye and part and get into our cars at first. As i reversed out my parking spot i see him come over and he’s like leaning over my window and he asks me what i was gonna do when i got home and i basically was just saying nothing — and so he invited me over to his place... and then that’s where the deed happened. We didn’t have penetration sex but oral sex. He gave and I returned. But afterwards we still hung out for about 2hrs or so.

So, my whole thing is i’m unsure if his intention was only to successfully get oral and that’s it. or if he’s interested but that made him less interested.. this happened and i didn’t hear anything from him the next day. No phone call, no text. And i’ll be seeing him at work in a couple days so i’m wondering how i should even act as well considering what all happened lol.

Anything helps.

59,ns36g6,1622807230,Dating &amp; Flirting: Pro tips and basics,"TL;DR Skip to the third paragraph

So after being on here for just a tiny bit (popped in every couple months) I've been seeing a substantial amount of misguided men.  Not all, but a portion of men here seem clueless and I think we could benefit from a quick little guide...

&amp;#x200B;

My background is having two sisters, only son, and have dated and flirted with many solid 9's.  I wouldn't say models, or could be models, but just below.   

Overall dating tips:

1. Go freaking watch Youtube videos for help.  Videos on flirting tips, confidence guides, how to tell if a woman is interested, psychology tips, dating tips, first date tips.  Heck maybe even style.  Truly and really does help, plus knowing more will truly increase your confidence/
2. Practice!  If you have confidence issues in approaching women than practice on girls you find slightly less attractive that you might not go for all the time and try flirting.
3. Hygiene.  Hygiene.  Hygiene.  Have a nice haircut, go get good cologne, don't be dirty, brush your teeth, maybe get whitening mouth wash.                                                                                                                
\*\*I actually use Bod ""Blue Surf,"" it's maybe $7-10 sold at Walmart, I'd stay away from the   
super fancy cologne because in my life time I rarely was complemented and women I was actually dating usually say they don't like it.  Axe products are actually great.... just not the freaking cologne or spray.  But a major thing girls love is smell, it works insanely
4. Facewash, I actually just started this year using face wash and moisturizers, outside of just washing my face in the shower.
5. Look good, clothing wise.  Doesn't matter if you dress up with nice dress shirts or more skater style.  But just know how you dress will determine what type of girl is going to be more interested.  Don't dress up with long sleeve nice dress shirts tucked in, no tattoos, and then go looking for a fully tattooed girl.  Always have a watch, necklace can help sometimes too.  Don't like wearing a watch?  Get used to it.  Also make it match.
6. Have good shoes/boots that also match.  Don't approach a girl in the shoes you'd wear to do yardwork.
7. Nice guys do finish last.  Be respectful but don't apologize for stupid shit.  Don't be a full blown jerk, but putting a girl on a pedestal never works.  That is for your wife, not a girl you just met.  It's psychology, if you are acting full blown head over heels towards a girl most the time, subconsciously you are putting them in a higher bracket than yourself.  Do flirt, do call them beautiful, but don't go crazy.  There really is a chase too it.
8. GET A HOBBY!  GET A LIFE!  No TV and video games do not count (I love video games btw).  I do guitar and photography.  Love guitar more, but in comparison to my photography skills I suck at playing guitar.  Firstly, if you have no hobby you're going to come off as boring.  Literally anything.  Does not matter, even if you just started last week. 
9. Work out.  It's just simple, everyone needs to.  No reason not to, you look better, feel better, everything is better.  Yes some people ""don't care about looks,"" but overall you will have much more success.
10. When a girl asks ""how you're doing"" or ""what's up"" never say ""okay"" or ""nothing much.""  Well that is unless you're not interested in them whatsoever.  Gauge the girl and find a happy medium.  Some might wanna talk a lot before a date, but don't go crazy talking, and don't barely talk at all.
11. Never in anyway make a possible date, or girl feel guilty about anything.  They're not interested?  Leave it.  There's 300+ million people in the US, or however many in your country.  I've said/joked my entire life there is a solid 10 out there for everyone.

 

First date tips:

1. Treat everyone around with respect and be confident about it (waiter, workers, etc).
2. Make some moves!  Flirting, touching (not inappropriate)
3. Be very social (not flirty) with EVERYONE.  Women like confidence and typically like alpha's.  Practice, practice, practice.  
4. If it's all going smooth kiss her at some point, DO NOT ASK.  Again women like confidence, if you have to ask you probably just ruined most of it
5. Ask her questions and be interested, but don't ramble off constant questions
6. Work on being clever and funny
7. Don't mention a single thing about your ex
8. Don't do the movies for a first or second date
9. Don't be late (and expect her to be)
10. Don't talk about a second date, unless she does
11. If things are going really well suggest continuing the date (Went hiking, then ended up going out for dinner)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**I PROMISE!  If you do these, your dating life will become exponentially better.   If you constantly get rejected 9 times out of 10 you're doing something wrong.

The past week ive been dating a coworker and I thought its been going pretty well, I made it clear to her that I dont know what im doing but she still seems to like me and we’ve seen each other like every day this week. Yesterday she came over to my apartment for an hour or two and I definitely should’ve made a move then, its been well over a year since ive even kissed anybody so Ive annoyingly been hesitant about it. But after she left I went to work and a ways into my shift she told me to come over after I got off at 11 pm, at like 11:25 I confirmed. I get there at like 11:40 and shes drunk from hanging out with friends earlier and already half asleep but insisted i sleep over. Ive never really been in that situation and obviously I didnt want to do anything wrong so I awkwardly layed on the edge of the bed the entire night. The next morning she had to immediately go to work, while she was getting ready I picked what looked like a random motivational book off her shelf to keep myself occupied only to find out it was more of a journal thing, i was like two pages in and she got pissed that i was reading it. She drove me home and the entire car ride was very awkward and she was clearly not interested in talking.

So we text back and forth for about 3weeks and I see her about 5/6 times during that span. During which we went out, I went over to hers she came over to mine, didn't get physical beyond some kissing here and there and I made sure she knew I wasn't there to just bang and bounce and even bought her flowers (she said no one had ever given her flowers).
 All is great and we make plans for another lunch date so I'm like hey I'll cook again and surprise her with another bit if flowers.

Canceled to do some work, no biggie people are busy but it did hurt to get cast aside so easily. I didn't whine or complain but instead tried to reschedule for the next day or day after.

NO RESPONSE

Hey how is your day going at work? Response like normal no amount of one word short answering to be seen. Ask again for the reschedule or if she wants to have lunch at all still and I won't be upset if she is busy.

Again, NO RESPONSE

Friday morning last week comes and she texts me she doesn't want to have obligations (to be short, this was explained over a few texts).

So my question: did I do something? Did I NOT do something?

&amp;#x200B;

I (29, M) went out on a date with this girl (31) last Wednesday (8 days ago). This was through a professional matchmaker team, so we already had checked each others' boxes on paper. The date went as well as it could have: The conversations were great, we're of very similar values, etc, tons of flirtation and chemistry. We left the restaurants, went to a couple bars and ended the night with a great kiss! For a few days later and into the weekend, the texting was as I had expected. Tons of chemistry, flirtatious texts, etc, and she called every night.   


Starting on Monday this week, the tone/frequency/length of the texts changed. She does work 2 jobs, but I can always differentiate between ""busy"" and ""uninterested"". We had planned a date for Saturday, but last night she texted and asked to move it to Sunday late during the day. 

  
Here's where I struggle: 50% of me want to call it out and just ask her to be honest and not waste each other's time, the other 50% of me is saying ""take it slow, it's been 1 date, chill"". I spend a ridiculous amount of time (over)thinking the situation and trying to figure out the interest level, and what may have changed, if anything.   


Ladies, any advice is welcome on what she ""might"" be thinking at this point, and which route I should take. She seems very mature, has 2 jobs, and has good social intelligence. Is she ""slowing it down"", or ""withdrawing""? I am hoping this weekend will clear it all up, but I'm not hopeful. This stuff causes me anxiety, and I seem to attract it.

79,ns6ajm,1622816500,Why would a lot of men would rather sleep around than date?,"This post is going to be a little controversial. A lot of people are going to get upset but I think it might be very helpful for some women if they want a better understanding of men.

I know a lot of women complain about how when using OLD a lot of men will open with something vulgar or something sexual will come up in the first few messages. They also complain about how men just want sex, and a lot of us (not most) just want sex. Here’s why:

A lot of them are sending out those messages just to get a girl that is also into those things. They know that it won’t work on a woman that wants a relationship because they don’t want to date. Because dating and trying to date is becoming increasingly not worth it for men. Let’s just think about this with an open mind for a second.

As said by one of the dating gurus I follow (she is a woman before anyone tried to call me a misogynist), “To date as a woman, all you need is a smartphone and some patience. Dating as a man is like trying to win the lottery with a ticket you found on the ground.” This honestly is a very accurate statement. 

It’s significantly harder to get a date as a man than it is as a woman. There’s also significantly more that men have to do. Most men already have lower chances of getting a date, we also have to invest more money into a date, we don’t have many options whereas it’s easy for any woman to see multiple guys at once, we’re competing against pretty much every other guy in a 100 mile radius when a woman we’re seeing has no competition, and to top it off, a lot of this doesn’t change when you get into a relationship except you then have less time for your friends and self because you are trying to keep another person happy so she doesn’t leave you.

A lot of men just see it as being not worth the trouble. It’s too much financial, physical, and emotion strain and it’s easier to shoot a risky text to a girl we match with in the hopes that she might wanna hookup and never talk again.

Now I didn’t make this post to say that women have no struggles when dating, they do, but I don’t think they compare to men’s struggles.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ns6ajm/why_would_a_lot_of_men_would_rather_sleep_around/

I received a *plethora* of good advice. The loose consensus was to let her know I was uncomfortable with it. We ended up having a surprisingly lengthy discussion. Her intention was to continue the conversation, but also to be upfront and honest about having a fwb. She admitted it probably came across as tactless. I would've preferred not to know as I assume people are dating others until exclusivity, plus I only want to discuss this subject when sexual exclusivity becomes relevant. The problem's that her fwb was brought up straight away, which forced me to find out if she'd be looking to be exclusive with the right person in the future. She said she would, but wasn't going to give up a recently formed arrangement, particularly for someone she's just met. I agreed it's way too early for me to ask much of anything at this point and I wasn't going to. 

She's being intimate with someone in ways - physically and (to a degree) emotionally - that I'd be looking to ultimately share with someone exclusively. It's a sexual relationship. I'm sexually monogamous; proceeding knowing she's sleeping with someone compromises on my personal boundaries too much. It's too conflicting and difficult to get emotionally invested knowing she's having sex with someone as I'm getting to know her. it's also not fair for either of us for me to have a barrier up until she potentially ends that.

I voiced these thoughts. Her messages back were long, thoughtful, honest, and notably trying to reassure me. She also tried to reassure me further by saying she might not see him for 1-2 months. Honestly, that helped a little, but the principle remained the same - she still wants that arrangement. Ultimately we reached a stalemate - there'd be no way to proceed we'd both be happy with. We've called it off for now, but agreed to stay in touch.

I never really understood dating for many years of my life or relationships for that matter. I've always wanted a girlfriend and just didn't know how to form healthy relationships with them being the anti social and shy introvert almost all my life, so I looked up ""how to get women"" on the internet and got sucked into the whole PUA bullshit. At first I saw the results that these guys were getting, reading all of the books like the mystery method, and the rules of the game which was recommended by my roommate in college. when college came around I wanted to change so I've went out to parties and the street to try this stuff that I learned from several videos and articles I've read on women, using tricks, and tactics to make myself seem like a high value, alpha male (typing that out just makes me feel pathetic). It's all quite psychopathic and doesn't lead to happiness, it might get you results for a hookup but looking back, in hindsight I wish I never knew about the PUA tactics. I wish I never even said things that I saw other PUAs said, it was toxic and I admit it, i'm so sorry. Who ever is reading this and struggling with dating, don't do what I did and fall into the world of pickup. It doesn't work in the long term, and it's not meant to form healthy relationships with other human beings. I'm done with it and I'm never going back, just be you, be genuine in your words, don't try and impress people, it's a terrible thing to do.

89,ns7hm3,1622819650,Sexual unsatisfied with my dating life after a really great sexual relationship,"I've been struggling with sex. Basically 5 years ago I was in a LTR for 2 years with a woman who was sexually liberated. We did a lot of stuff and I learned that I love kinky sex. BDSM, butt stuff, role reversal, public sex, threesomes, etc. She was constantly eager and ready, it was incredibly hot and fun. We broke up because we did not love one another and she had all sorts of personal problems. 

Most of the rest of my dating life after and prior has been with women who are the opposite. Very conservative, lucky if they even like oral sex. Most just want PIV in a couple different positions, are don't even want to be on top. Occasionally I am able to get them to try stuff, but even if they like it during the act, they have issues with thinking a finger in the butt is dirty/shameful and anyway, who wants to deal with that? 

Some of these women are good people, a couple of them I even loved, but man I feel forever unsatisfied. They never have that  kind of uninhibited joy and passion for sex that she did, and they never push me to try anything new. I miss that level of excitement and intimacy. I am getting so bored in the bedroom these day, lately I have even had some ED problems because the last couple of women I was with were so low-energy and awkward starfish types that I was completely turned off even though they were attractive. 

I'm not sure what I'm suppose to do. Just slog it out an hope for the best? As a guy I can't really be explicitly about my sexual desires early on in a relationship, because that is 'creepy' or whatever. I have tried GGG/sex positive on my profile, but it doesn't change who matches me at all. I still get a lot of conservative/uptight types of women who are not sexually open minded at all. 

I guess I don't need that crazy porno level of stuff, but man I want someone who is enthusiastic about something other than PIV or who is willing to try new things or even use toys. The last woman I got kinda freaky with wouldn't even go into the sex toy store with me because it was 'too embarrassing', and waited in the car while I bought some butt plugs for us. She looked at their online store from the car and told me what she was interested in... and I purchased it. Least to say we didn't last much longer.

Does anyone else have any advice or has dealt with someone like this? I'm sick of dating people for whom anything other than vanilla sex is taboo/negative.

“Where the hell did this come from? Lmao you need to chill out dude we are just friends, this is so weird wtf man” 


I know damn well if I was attractive, expressing my sexuality and desire would be seen as normal and a natural healthy thing. 

This honestly just destroys my will for everything in life.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ns8ib0/ive_26m_noticed_when_i_ask_women_out_or_express/

97,ns8rqu,1622823024,I literally tried dating guys because I was so desperate (22m),"Disclaimer: I just want to vent. Don't label me an in.cel or entitled misogynyst or anything. I don't hate women or think that I'm entitled to their love and affection.

Virtually every date I've had with a woman has resulted in them either ghosting me completely afterwards or saying they just wanted to be friends... and then proceeding to ghost me anyway in most cases. Presumably this is because I'm just not charismatic or funny and I suffer from social anxiety. And being a skinny ginger probably also doesn't help, though those women did swipe right on me so my looks probably aren't the main problem.

But seeing gay male family and friends of mine consistently get dates and relationships with ease despite being relatively unremarkable men made me jealous of gay people. So one day I decided to pretend to be bi and see if things would work out if I tried dating guys. Almost every guy I swiped right on was a match (of course), and I got flooded with messages when I set up my grindr account, though the vast majority of those guys immediately started sending me pics and asking about my penis size and clearly weren't interested in actually dating. I eventually did find guys who wanted to date me, but most of them wanted to also do sexual stuff right away. I tried making out with them and giving oral multiple times and wasn't a fan, and some guys tried doing it to me but it didn't satisfy me at all. The longest period of sexless dating I had was three dates with a guy who I genuinely connected with personally, but after the third date he said he'd found someone else, which I'm guessing was triggered by me not showing interest in sex over those three dates.

I am massively embarrassed and ashamed that I had to stoop this low in an attempt to find someone who would genuinely like me. I performed acts that disgust me. All because I couldn't face the fact that I'm unloveable. Sometimes I still get jealous of gay guys and get mad at the world for making me straight yet undesirable to women. But I know these are not healthy thoughts, and I need to move on. And with all the toxic relationships in the world and ugly divorces, maybe embracing single life is the way to go and this is just the universe's way of telling me that.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ns8rqu/i_literally_tried_dating_guys_because_i_was_so/
98,ns8snl,1622823090,Do you believe in soulmates?," I used to be in a relationship with someone and never put too much thought into the word ""Soulmate"" until a certain point it just started when the relationship got stronger. Now, months after we broke up were still in contact and even if I have interest in other people, I feel how this guy was my ""soulmate"" but at the same time I don't think the term ""soulmate"" even exists. And probably shouldn't exist.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ns8snl/do_you_believe_in_soulmates/
99,ns8tcz,1622823146,In need of some advice 31(m) with a 25(f),"Hey r/dating. I have a bit of a predicament on my hands.

So I have been in a relationship with my current GF for several months. And I have been seeing patterns that indicate red flags, I’m kind of at a loss as to what to do right now because I want to trust and believe in her, but I just can’t bring myself to without compromising my own emotional health. So, here I am.


So over the past couple of months we have had some hiccups. And there is this pattern of my GF telling me things- 2-3 weeks after the fact

So, for example this morning she said “you know why I was irritated last week? Because someone was hitting on me while we were eating sushi” 

Like I don’t know what to make sense of it, if that was really the case? Why didn’t you tell me then? After I had been asking. This was a huge flag for me this morning and it was not the first time this has happened. 

(Where something happens and she doesn’t tell me unless I bring it up and pry it out or she won’t until she feels like enough time has passed) 


Or- for example, suddenly out of nowhere there was a sport game she was invited to from her church group that she “forgot” about. Some guy gave her his extra ticket. She said “I hope your not mad at me” whilst “suddenly remembering” two days ago. I don’t care if she does things with friends and stuff

It’s just that at work as well she has orbiters with and she is talking to them about me and they are giving her bullshit advice.. “oh the sex may be good now, but you’ll want something else”

(How in the fuck did she get into a convo about that?) 

No I am not mad- but this is just too wierd. I just think this is suspicious granted she has a pattern of not being forthright. I’ve communicated this to her yet she continues to do this. I don’t want to get hurt. And I’ve talked to her about “orbiters” and she doesn’t seem to “get it” or she is just ignoring what I am saying it feels like. 


I plan on addressing this concern when i see her in a bit. But really I am super discouraged because I don’t think that she is listening or respecting me... does anyone have any advice?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ns8tcz/in_need_of_some_advice_31m_with_a_25f/
