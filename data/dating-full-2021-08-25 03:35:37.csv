Her and I instantly clicked and if we ever had the chance, we'd talk for a while.

I always wanted to make a move, but it felt weird because I only saw her at her workplace. 

Eventually I stopped seeing her there a couple months ago, and then today, I decided to hit up the pizza spot in my city. It's this real authentic Italian pizzareia I wanted to try.
I went in, and it turned out she works there and she was the host.
She instantly remembered me and we had a pretty good conversation for around 5 minutes.
All those feelings came back.

It feels like we were supposed to run into each other again, because the chemistry is very natural and easy.

But I'm still stuck in this conundrum where I don't know how to make a move because she's at her workplace.

I hardly ever talked to this man (let's call him John), we have exchanged pleasantries but nothing more beyond that. Last week, John approached me and asked if I were willing to help him work on a project that he's working on over the weekend, he needed some extra hands to get his project moving and I happily said yes. He asked other friends in our community if they were willing to pitch in, so I was expecting a small group of people coming together over the weekend to help out, but when I arrived, I ended up being the only person there. 

I felt a little awkward being there, but I already drove a long way to help and he said others would arrive later in the day, so I decided to stay until other people came by. Throughout the day, the conversation felt pretty one-sided, I could tell he had the jitters, he was all over the place and didn't really stick to a plan on what we could finish, so I did what I went there to do and just talked for a while. It wasn't until two other people arrived hours later with raised eyebrows, wondering why it was just the two of us there, I just figured everybody else stood us up. I left shortly after the other two arrived, he thanked me for the help and said he would help me with the project I'm doing this weekend. I'm honestly thinking this is just a business exchange, nothing else beyond that.

The next day, John called me and said he had two tickets to this broadway show this weekend and wondered if I was interested in going (our mutual friend is in the play) so without a second thought I said sure because it sounds like fun. I figured after he helped me out with my project, we would meet up later that day to see the show and support our friend in the play. I talked about this scenario with a friend and she said I was lured into this ""plan"" to eventually go on a date with this guy. She even asked me why I said yes, and to be honest, I've never been to a Broadway show and I thought it would be cool to support our friend in the play. Thinking that this was a date was literally the LAST thing on my mind, I honestly feel so dumb after saying it out loud. 

I'm really not attracted to this guy at all, he's usually not the person I would go on a date with. I just got out of a bad break-up the week before and I'm not really interested in getting to know John as a romantic interest. I already said yes to the show this weekend and I would hate to be *that guy* and cancel plans shortly after (or worse, *the day of*). I don't want to send mixed signals about the situation and neither do I want to hurt him in the long run if I were to simply run with it, but now I'm not sure what to do or how to explain my point of view. 

What can I do or say to John about this ""date"" this weekend and explain I'm not interested? Should I cancel these plans? 

tldr; I was asked to go to a Broadway show with a guy at my local community group without thinking that this was actually a date.

So for context, I met up with my uncle and his new girlfriend recently at a restaurant. He is recently divorced and I haven't seen him much lately because COVID. I've only met his new girlfriend a few times but she's very nice and friendly and the whole family likes her. When I got there they were already a few drinks in, so they both were a little loose-lipped and more open than usual. Somehow she steers the conversation towards my dating life and asked if I was currently dating, and when I said no, she asked why not, but I couldn't answer because we got interrupted by something, either the waitress or my uncle saying something. Later on she says she was going to be my matchmaker and find me somebody, which she has previously joked about in a past quip while I was on the phone with my uncle. 

This got me thinking, am I more ""dateable"" than I previously thought? The reason I haven't even been trying is because I feel like it's kinda useless/hopeless for me to do so at this point in my life. 

I'm 24M, and live in a somewhat rural area with my parents in a smaller house while I save up some money so I can have a strong start in life. I have a car and a decent job permanently working from home right now, I'm in a very good field and have a degree from a well-known university, but I've got a shit ton of student debt and I'm trying to build some experience so I can get a kick-ass job that will ensure I can live comfortably once I move out. So I'm planning on staying here for a couple more years. I have pretty much zero dating experience, not a virgin but I'm still way less ""experienced"" compared to everyone else my age. I don't have much of a social life either, if I go out to do something, it's with family, but I still have a friend who lives in the area who I'm trying to stay in contact with, but I'm pretty bad at that kind of thing so I'm not sure how long that will last. 

I'm really not building a good case for myself, am I? I guess that's the point of this post really, these are things I know I need to fix, but at this point in my life they really can't be fixed without a mountain of effort and a lot of time. I know nobody's perfect and there are probably tons of people who don't have their shit together as well as I do that go on dates all the time, but for the longest time I've felt like I just have too many dealbreakers for girls my age and I'm better off saving myself the wasted energy/constant rejection of trying to date and instead filling my time with work and solo hobbies. Yeah, honestly I'm pretty lonely and depressed, but what else can I really do for the time being?

I don't think my uncle's girlfriend knows any of this about me except for the career stuff and living situation, but still, her broaching the subject just messes with my head and makes me wonder whether I'm needlessly self-sacrificing, and that I'm more ""dateable"" than I realize? Then again, she's a lot older than me and she probably doesn't understand the current landscape for people my age, so maybe her optimism is misplaced? Can anybody else here weigh in on this? Feel free to ask questions to gain more context, I have a tendency to make lengthy posts and I'm trying to cut down and be brief.


TL;DR Uncle's girlfriend trying to be matchmaker, I don't know whether my self-esteem is shit and I have a chance of being successful in dating or if I'm being wise and saving energy/preserving mental health by waiting to move out of parent's house/gaining dating experience",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,972159,public,self,Am I doing myself a disservice by not even *trying* to date?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pb4c0t/am_i_doing_myself_a_disservice_by_not_even_trying/,all_ads,6,,,

I’ve also been trying to move on from someone who emotionally manipulated me (most likely out of immaturity), but I was also coming up with stupid reasons as to why I don’t deserve love. For example, a married man who is around my age (he is married to a girl I went to high school with but never had feelings for, and she is a day younger than me) has an assault rifle on one of his profile pictures and I have never shot a gun in real life which makes me feel inferior to him and makes me feel like I’m not good enough.

And don't get me wrong, there's a lot about his current situation that I think would deter someone else. But we click so naturally, I find it easy to look past.

For the past couple of months, I've had an interest in a girl (18F) who is in my scholarship group at my university, and finally built up the courage to introduce myself during our college's freshman camp.

Once the camp ended, I decided to text her, saying that it was nice to meet her and asking her if she'd like to hang out once we moved onto campus. I'd had her number ever since all of the scholars made a Google sheets with our contact into, but I didn't want to just randomly text her because that'd be weird.

She replied that she was glad to meet me too and that she'd ""love to hang out on campus :)""

We texted pretty constantly ever since, exchanging emojis, gifs, and various applicable pictures to what we were discussing. Lots of compliments back and forth, like ""they don't give this scholarship to just anyone"" for example and joking about things like how pale she is and how easily she gets sunburned and when I crashed my bike before I even moved in.

Anyways, both of us moved in to our respective dorms last Saturday (me engineering honors housing, her university honors housing), and pretty much as soon as she knew I'd moved in she asked if I wanted to hang out that evening, so of course I said yes!

At our university, there's a whole rivalry between these two chicken restaurants, so after some mild banter we decided on the more local one. It was only awkward for like a minute or so, and we just sat down and started talking and talking and talking, for about an hour and a half, with her laughing at all of my jokes, even the crappy ones, and smiling a lot, and barely even eating half of our food, we realized that basically everyone had left and we should get going (side note, I love the spirit of that restaurant).

We walked back to campus and looked at the moon and we parted paths about halfway between our two dorms and she told me to let her know if I wanted to hang out again.

We've kept texting, though limitedly, because we've been so so busy during this week, though I did see her today during an escape room (more like escape building) and she looked really happy to see me and waved enthusiastically.

She's also invited me to some parties by her dorm, and we're planning on hanging out again the two of us (like that song lol) this Friday (she wanted to do Wednesday, but I was busy like a bongo).

I'm planning on asking her out on a true date in a few weeks, but I thought I'd get y'all's thoughts on: a) if you think she likes me romantically or like at all b) if so, how should I proceed.

Okay so Tinder actually worked this time, because I (20y/o) matched with a really nice girl (19y/o) and we've talking on Instagram for almost a month by now. She's the type of girl who smiles all the time and is really fun to talk to :)

We're now planning on meeting eachother for some drinks on a terrace soon. 
I've been tought to never come empty handed when meeting someone for the first time. I'm thinking about getting her some nice fresh flowers, but I'm worrying that it's a bit extra for a ""getting drinks"" first date.
I think it's nice to get a little gift or something as a girl on a first date.

Hope you have been well and that you are enjoying the time with the fam.

Writing this because you still cross my brain from time to time, but your memory has quickly faded from my brain.

Honestly - thank you for the time we shared together. I had an absolute blast with you. I think the friendship we shared is the only thing I miss now. You’re one of the smartest people I’ve I had the pleasure of meeting and I enjoyed that about you. I know you were in a broken place (emotionally) when we met…so….in a very weird way…thank you for sharing that time with me. I hope I was uplifting, to some degree, during our time together. 

We are polar opposite human beings in almost every way…and that still puts a huge smile on my face lol. I now know that I loved the idea of being with you; not actually being with you. I don’t hate you nor will I ever hate you but I understand that neither of us can give the other what we want out of life. 

While we did not work out, you deserve nothing but love, happiness, and respect from whomever you are dating/will date in the future. I hope you find the happiness and fulfillment you’ve been looking so hard for. 

Thank you again for the many wonderful months of knowing you. I appreciate you very much. I will always be one of your biggest fans.

But I wanted to share my story that sometimes it just might work.  


I had my fair share of men ghosting me, acting weird, and being overall kinda terrible (oh, so many entertaining stories to tell!) so I decided to give up on the relationship. I started browsing just to find a hookup, no strings attached. I found a guy on my Tinder Gold (yep, I paid for one month, what to do) that looked fun. Nice tattoos, piercings, had a dog in the picture. On his profile, he mentioned that he's looking for FWB or Netflix and chill type ""thing"" so I knew what I was going into.  
We had a thrilling conversation, like really connected on multiple subjects, made jokes, and overall the vibes were impeccable. He is 3 years younger than me (24) but I couldn't really feel any age difference and then again, it was supposed to be sex right?

Well, two days into talking I decided that it's time. I drank some liquid courage, invited him to my place and it kinda went off the rails. As it turns out I got a bit drunk and I don't remember exactly what I said. He filled me in recently that I assured him a couple of times that we are not gonna sleep together this night, and when he said it's cool and we don't have to, I said ""ah, who am I kidding, of course, we're gonna sleep together"". And we did.

I was ready to let him go when he invited me for a walk with his dog and that's where I lost. I completely crushed on him the whole time. Turns out we couldn't stay away from each other. He was a perfect gentleman, we laughed, spent a lot of time together, and went back to his place. 

Even though I was ready to jump ship to avoid potential heartbreak, he did not give up. We talked every day, met every other day, spend weekends at each other houses. I got invited to all the parties and hangouts with his friends, within a week and a half we said ""I love you's"". We met each other families, recently went on vacation together (just the two of us), and are going away for a weekend again. We discussed moving in, children, marriage, all this stuff. Never would've expected a random Tinder match that was sitting in my ""waiting likes"" for a week to be my soulmate.

&amp;#x200B;

I had a couple of long-term relationships before and was never treated with such respect, never felt so wanted and appreciated. This dude makes me laugh every day and the communication is perfect. I've never been happier in my life.

I did not want to stress her further, since I had to focus on that too. I asked her how the studying went, but no answer.

I (M23) soon to be 24 have never had a proper relationship. I've been on loads of dates off apps but never got anywhere. 

Hookups have never interested me, I've always desired a deep connection with someone. But to no avail. In recent months I spent too much time feeling sorry for myself. 

My most recent saga ended a few months ago after seven dates with a woman I met off Hinge. I didn't shed a single tear over it but it still got to me. I'm actually proud I didn't cry over it, considering I'm a very sensitive man. 

But most recently, I had a revelation: I can't continue using dating apps. Getting numbers and then instantly getting ghosted will never do your confidence any good. 

I have officially deleted all apps and will work on myself to gain confidence, to be able to approach women irl. It's something I've not done much, but I know if I don't try then I won't ever get anywhere. 

It's okay to long for affection, I have for a very long time now. But it's important you remember to enjoy life when you're single. Think of all the things you can do without worrying about anyone else!

Going to those places and not drinking has people assuming you're weird or trying to force you into drinking with them.

Swiping through dating apps is mind-numbing, it's almost like seeing the same profile over and over. Wine glass in hand, LED angel wings, birthday balloons and a dress.

Because I am really interested in her, I decided to push on after a while and we spoke and decided to see each other again. When I wanted to plan she wanted to pull out again, so I called her on this and she started saying stuff about guys dropping her after a few dates and she didn't want the drama and all. She kind of described herself as undatable or something, really weird. 

Mind you, this woman has had past relationships, is beautiful, successful, sociable etc. Also, I told her I'd stop trying to date her if she told me she's not interested and she said she was not saying that to me because she didn't want to lie to take the easy way out.

So after a really good talk we decided on seeing each other this week and see where it takes us, but tongue in cheek made the deal to stop after a certain number of dates, because that's the mark where guys pull out with her apparently.

When I told my friend he ran to his bedroom to get a red shirt and waved it in front of me and told me to GTFO.

I met her through work in february through work and what started off as just a bit of fun with talking on the phone slowly evolved into a really strong connection, we meet for the first time 30 march and after the second date we spoke out to eachother that we like eachother. I always have a hard time opening up but she did not mind and was willing to wait, two weeks later i slept at her place and we slept together. Until that point everything was great between us until a week later she said she does not know if it just friendly between us or romantic. I told her it would be hard for me as i do have those romantic feelings, She just had some doubts about it, some moments she did had attraction towards me and sometimes she did not.

As time progressed we remained friends, still talking on the phone everyday, telling eachother everything going on in our lives and she frequently said things like she is really happy that she has me in her life and that she needs me. But as time progressed it also was harder for me at times. Especially if she was hanging out alone with her guy "" friends"".

I was feeling jealous and really questioning my own self worth/ respect at times. I know i just should have go NC the moment she friendzoned me, but yeah stupid me.

But i was becoming more distant from her to just protect myself and 3 weeks ago she send me a messages that she really misses me and did not thought our bond would ""break"" this quickly. I told her i miss her aswell but from the moment she told me she just wants to be friends a lot had changed because i really thought we were building something more then just friends. she did not respons on my reaction.

For the last 3 weeks our conversations are really dry and it feels forced. I got a snapchat from her last week from her that she was taking a drive with her ex, which she always complained about to me and talked alot about when we were ""dating"" in hindsight it maybe meant she was not over him still. But since she send that snap i did not contacted her and it has been 3 days now.

I need some advice on what to do next, should i stay no contact or should i contact her? i have to be honest and tell you all i am having a hard time, also because she is undergoing surgery coming thursday and i want to be for her, but on the other hand it is hard to be in her life as just a friend",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,972541,public,self,I (M24) need advice on my situation with a women (F21),0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pb9jfz/i_m24_need_advice_on_my_situation_with_a_women_f21/,all_ads,6,,,

Everyone always talks on these subs about just how many people you have to filter through before you find the right person. I live an incredibly busy work life, and my social life with friends is massively, massively important to me. So I only tend to date someone when I meet them and feel a really strong connection. 

I've tried to push the boat out a little by going on a few very random dates where I didn't necessarily feel a very strong connection in the past couple of years (maybe one every few months). But honestly, it's quite hard for me to get a date on apps and I only really go for it in real life if I meet someone with whom I really, honestly feel a strong connection to (which maybe happens once a year). So, really, I'm dating maybe 3 or 4 people a year, if that.

I guess the reason I'm concerned about this is that a relationship is something I would really, really like if it was with the right person. I've never really been in a 'proper' one before, and I'm still a virgin - I have a history of sexual abuse that I am getting over, but I think for now I would only feel comfortable having sex if it was with someone I truly cared very deeply about and had built up a very strong trust with. So that's something I really want, and I'm worried that I'm not going through enough people in order to find the person with whom I build that connection.

Btw, it's not a case of me not meeting enough people - I live a very active social life and meet loads of new people every week.

I did not hear from her for 2 weeks and reached back out to find she had already moved. 

I think maybe she was busy or whatever and forgot to remind let me know so I propose a coffee date for the past Sunday (she suggested coffee). She tells me she has a crazy schedule but will let me know. 

So Saturday I didn’t hear from her. Didn’t her from her Sunday morning so I figured it was off. Sunday afternoon she texts me that something came up and she was out of the area... whatever

I tell her to just let me know when she’s free and reply to some small talk she made. I send this Sunday and she leaves me on read. 

Yesterday I run into her on a little campus tour (were both grad students). We are introducing ourselves and are on opposite sides of the circle. I hear her name first and then I’m waiting. It comes to me, I say my name, and she pops out from behind a person gives an awkward wave, and looks like she saw a ghost. She gives me a little hug but makes no effort to talk to me 1-on-1...

She pulls away from the tour to take a phone call for 5 min... comes back and still won’t talk to me 1 on 1 even though I make a point to walk away from the group a bit so it’s private and to give her a chance. Instead she walks behind me talking to some other girl, then tries to introduce me to her and gets her name wrong lol

Then she tells me and the girl she just met she has to meet a friend and leaves mid tour. Gives the other random girl a hug but not me..... and runs off

Afterwards I text her and say it was great to see her but I wish we could talk more trying to be cordial. She tries to justify running off but doesn’t respond to the great to meet you part

I tell her to get in contact with me when she’s free as a act of good-will to keep things cordial since we are in the same-ish circle so we will 100% run into eachother again not expecting her to do it

And then she text’s me back saying, “yeah I think I may be on campus again tomorrow. What about you?”.

Mind you we’ve known each other for a year, she has said she wanted to go out for a year (according to her) she said she wanted to spend her birthday with me in 2 months, and she was “super excited” to go out. I even asked 2 weeks directly if she wanted to go out and she said yes. That’s when she suggested coffee.

Recently, I was on a bus and a very pretty woman in a yellow dress sat Infront of me. It might sound Weird but this bus had seats that face each other. 

Anyways, my heart was racing and I just COULD NOT look at her directly but I could tell she was looking at my direction out of the window. Then, I proceeded to close my eyes a little and when I opened them she was literally staring right at me. This went on for 5 maybe 10 minutes and I was just paralysed. Then, she got off and looked at from outside the bus.

If she just said something I would've literally threw myself at her feet. The tension was insane and dresses are the key to my heart.

So I have realised this. I go out on dates with guys and one of three cases happen:
1. I am not into them
2. I am not crazy about them, I see some red flags but they check other boxes in my checklist (great job, often same as me. Tall. Works out. One/more of these.)
3. I'm crazy about them!

Now I'm talking about when case 2 happens because for case 1, I don't care for a second date and honestly 3 almost never happens, not through OLD atleast.

So I'm not necessarily into these guys, but I try to give it a chance. I feel like I'm fun on dates and we are having fun, there is chemistry and everything. BUT a few dates later they decide somehow to move on and even though that works perfectly for me I am devastated!!

Now that they're not into me anymore, they become these amazing men I can't have.

What sort of trickery is this?  Does anyone else feel this way? Should I simply not go for anyone I'm not into in the first place?

We had our miscommunications on how we dealt with our feelings of expressing them and not showing them. We both had to date more before taking a long trip, I think we just rushed into liking one another that we didn’t really got to know one another.

I met someone who I developed strong feelings for already after 4 dates. During the 4th date, I came on pretty strong admittedly so. I didn't pronounce my love or ask to be exclusive but I did mention that I have strong feelings/butterflies, and how I haven't felt something like this in awhile. I'm not even sure why it was worth mentioning in retrospect but I believe I was coming from a place where I wanted to show how I feel and be the person who gives a lot of love early on rather than play it cool and possibly miss out on an opportunity. We've held hands and kissed many times.

We went on date number 5 recently and I was told that I was liked but the feelings are not mutual. She proceeded to state that she had times in her past where feelings developed over time but she doesn't know if that will be the case here which is something that absolutely makes sense. I get the vibe those feelings won't come but who am I to say that exactly...

Is this one of those time where I'm being let down easy? (which I appreciate how this was handled) or is this something where we should continue to hang out to see what comes of it? It's hard for me to detach, step back, and lose feelings while we try to date but I really don't know how to gauge this situation.
