I have a date tomorrow and I'm incredibly nervous. We met on tinder around a month ago and have been slowly building up a text relationship over the past weeks. It is safe to say we are both incredibly into each other and share a lot in common. This chemistry is actually just making me nervous. 

The issue is that we are both in entirely different weight classes and it is giving me anxiety. I am literally double her weight and afraid she doesn't realise this. 

I have made every effort to make this clear without coming across as a huge insecure weirdo. I've sent many full body pictures and at least half my tinder pictures are full body. Maybe she is just into my body type? But I find it difficult when she is probably underweight and I'm fairly far in the obese category.

I'm seeking advice on the whole situation. How should I have it if I turn up and it is awkward because I've been an accidental catfish? I'm feeling awful about this and should be happy.

And, so few hours later i commented on one of her meme posts (on a good day she posts a lot of memes - like what 20?) so it was easy to interact with her, as I would respond to the memes with a caption and from there it’d start a silly lil convo. 
Now, I’m experienced enough to know that she was enjoying talking to me too. 
So i slid in her DM’s to say hey and hopefully take it further, for her to respond &amp; us to continue making jokes. So, i dropped lil hints about going for a drink which she keenly responded to, as she was up for it.
So i made the made move by initiating  that i had the week off next week &amp; asked how her schedule was looking, for her to respond by asking what i did for work then telling me she worked as a freelance so she could pick her schedule , which to me didn’t seem like a rejection so i asked which night worked best for her (after exchanging couple messages talking about our jobs, maybe this is where i went wrong) for her not to respond for over 24 hours then.. maybe regretfully i messaged her asking if she was ok.

She eventually responded by saying she had been ill and completely dodged about meeting, now we’re still talking on her fb posts &amp; texting minimally.. but its def not the same as what we once had

I was having long distance relationship with on and off situation. 
I met him in college and after 6 months of dating we started fighting. Although the fight was only initiated by me, but the sole reason was his ex or his passive behavior. 
Initially he triggered me saying ""His ex was a genius"" Then brainwashed me saying his ex did all unfair things to him, which made me protective yet insecure. He started dating me right after his ex made a final call that she doesn't love him. 
He kept all her convo screen shot and bra pics and it was discovered by me later within 3 months of dating. 
I developed hardcore retroactive jealousy too which made me toxic. I did try discussing with him  but he said ""I chose you, you are overthinking"". Every time we were together, he would get drunk and vulnerable and said "" How others and his ex made him feel alone"". This was everytime when we were making out too. 
He stopped sobbing about once he knew I was getting insecure. But it got worse for me and I needed a break. When I asked for a break he used cry all the time and make me feel guilty saying ""what about me? Why do want to leave me alone? I have invested so much time in this, I did a lot of things for you, you have friends to talk to, I have no one""
This felt he just needed company and sex to bond with. 
I tried forcefully taking a break, then I made out with someone else which made even worse. And it happened twice. After coming back to him I told him this the situation, but he willingly accepted saying I wasn't in a right state. 
I've told about him to my parents happily, but he was very hesitant tell about me to his parents. 
All I used to get is ""You are now doing well so you want to leave me. You have people to talk to, I have no one"".
He even went accusing my parents of being evil when clearly my mom saw me depressed and told me to take a break from him. 
I feel am I actually breaking someones heart? Everyone says he's a nice guy. 
But I can't take it anymore. If he was suffering because of my past I would let him go, because I loved him. 
All he would do is hear me cry and say don't cry.

31m met 30f online. Long story short,

We've only been on one date, went to dinner and got drinks. Asked her out for a 2nd date a couple days after and she agreed. She had plans to fly home the following weekend, so we set something up for the weekend after. I suggested we do something fun this time like the aquarium or an arcade. She said she likes the aquarium and she was free on that Sunday. I explained that the aquarium sells timed tickets that needed to be purchased up front, she agreed to Sunday 1-2pm.

Sunday morning comes and she texts me saying she is sick. At first I thought she was lying, but eventually her pattern of behavior during the days she was sick make me believe she was being honest.

So after she's feeling better I check in and ask her if she wants to reschedule. She responds immediately, ""definitely!"". But I had to work that weekend. So she told me she would be in touch with her availability for the following weekend (this upcoming weekend) Still haven't heard back from her with her availability.

Kind of feel like this is trending towards not setting anything up this weekend. I'll give her until the end of the week, if I don't hear anything by then I want to text her, ""Hey. Never did hear about your availability for this week, and it's now been a month since we've gone out. Kinda feels like this isn't happening, so would you send me half of the money for the tickets I got? That seems fair to me.""

A year before we started dating, we became best friends. Throughout lockdown we would talk on the phone day and night, and we talked about everything and anything. Christmas came up and I told him all about the past with my ex of 4 years and how his family was weird and wouldn’t let me over for Christmas because it was ‘family only’ and he didn’t want to be away from his family. I usually sat alone crying each year because nobody cares about it in my house, my parents are divorced, and I wished and wished I could experience a nice Christmas. It was my dream, but i couldn’t have it. This time of year became pretty painful for me. Last year my house was empty and my Christmas dinner was  pack of noodles. The year before, me and my ex had a problem because he wanted to see me on Christmas but his family didn’t want that and he had anger issues at the time and physically took it out on me. Pretty traumatic. So anyway, when me and my current bf first started dating, one of the first things I asked was would he spend Christmas with me. He said of course, and he promised he would come and he was determined to make it the best ever. I was careful with how I asked and made sure he confirmed he would stay over, and that we could open gifts together and have dinner in mine. So with Christmas coming up, I checked in to confirm our plans. He says ok and says he will speak to his family, and next thing you know he comes to me and says he is staying in his instead but will come later, and will go have dinner at home. He said I was welcome to come along.....
I would’ve spent Christmas in his house, but considering we planned it to be in mine, his family has had issues with me in the past, I’m not allowed sleep in the same bed as him (at 20 years of age), I have trauma from the day, and the fact that I have panic attacks all have a part to play. We then had a huge argument and are not on speaking terms at the moment. I asked does he have any idea how difficult it will be for me to be alone yet again and he said yeah but my family its Christmas. I thought I was family.. Thoughts?? Advice?? I begged but he doesn’t want to. It really hurts. We have been on the rocks for weeks now and I’m scared we are going to end soon. 
I just wish him and his family weren’t weirdly clingy. It’s almost incestual. At the end of the day, we planned it. He promised, then changed the plan just like my ex did. I don’t know if I can handle another Christmas alone.

I’ve wanted a boyfriend ever since I was a teenager. Alas, it never happened for me. I’m not the best looking gal out there, and was bullied intensely over it in school. My 20s definitely allowed me to “grow into my beauty” (this is something less attractive women probably say a lot, lol), but I’m still not exactly a great catch. However, I’m quite fucking smart, on my way to completing a PhD, fairly successful in my career. And “I have a great personality (lol). But I’m fairly independent, aggressive and assertive in my professional life and friendships, which likely comes off as somewhat menacing to dudes. Oh well.

I’ve had hookups and short flings ever since I was 19. Nothing has ever lasted very long and though occasionally things have inched towards the relationship level with some dudes, eventually they just blow me off for someone better. It’s alright, it is what is. I’ve definitely suffered through it a few times and as a result I’ve just kind of come to expect it from all the men who somehow make their way into my life.

I started seriously seeing this guy (30M) almost four months ago. He’s absolutely sweet and wonderful and he treats me marvelously. Legit I’ve never been treated this way before. I still kind of can’t believe that he’s real and exists and actually wants to be with me? I think he thinks I’m too good for him, but I kind of can’t help thinking the opposite.

We see each other on weekends, as we are far too busy to meet during the week. I’m very aware of not wanting to be a needy girlfriend and so I don’t really hound him with texts or calls or “so do you still love me?”. But when he leaves on Sunday night, I get a dreary feeling inside me. It usually fades until Wednesday night, when it’s been a few nights without him and I start to get antsy. Thinking the worst, assuming he doesn’t want anything to do with me anymore. I try not to let this show to him, but I can get pissy and occasionally go into “retribution” mode where I won’t text for a few hours after he responds “to give him a taste of his own medicine”.

I checked his social media and he had this beautiful blonde girl in all his photos, going back 2 years.  I suspected they were dating and silently crushed on him. I didn't make any moves. 

But out of the blue one day this guy (my hot roommate) asked me to get drinks. While we were getting drinks, the blonde girl Facetimed him and he hung up on her to go out with me. It felt awesome. I thought this was finally my CHANCE.

The guy cuddled with me ALL night and it was the most romantic experience of my life. He even tried to have sex but I wasn't ready, though I regret not doing so. 

Unfortunately a week later the blonde girl was back with him, and I heard her next door in the room with him. I gave up for a little while.

Then a few weeks later after she had been coming over regularly, he told me his GF was in the hospital. Meaning he was home alone. He invited me into his room to watch a movie. When I laid in his bed, he asked to cuddle and although I wanted to, I declined with a firm NO this time telling him he had a girlfriend!

Ever since I declined to cuddle, he's now completely stopped talking to me and has been totally focusing on his girlfriend. She was over our house 3 times this week and I have just been hiding in my room.

Although this guy only took me out for drinks/spent a couple nights cuddling with me, I really miss him/our few cuddling sessions. I feel like an abandoned toy!

It is BEYOND painful to hear him next door having sex with this girl. She also posted a photo of them together looking happy and beautiful on social media today :(

I really miss the nights cuddling with my roommate. I am realizing that sooner or later one of us will move out and I will never see him again. Should I tell him how I feel? I know he has a girlfriend but the fact that he cuddled with me a couple nights must mean something...right?

So then I or others get told to do clubs and meetups but then told we shouldn't do those things to meet women? The mental gymnastics people have when it comes to advice is astounding, you can't go out and do anything for the sole purpose of meeting women to ask out and date, but if you go out and do things strictly to do the things and have fun, you're going to miss out on any sort of opportunity that might very rarely appear. If you don't pick up on the slightest, most subtle of social ques then any women that might have been interested just move on.  


For the life of me it feels like dating and relationships are just forever going to be something that's forever out of my reach, I'll never understand it, I don't even find the idea fun to begin with because dating is just a long string of feeling hurt and rejected, from my experience anyway. I don't even have any bad/failed relationships to lean back on as valuable life experience, I just have nothing because nobody wants me in the first place  


I don't have any relationship experience and everything that might entail with that, I know that I'm not perfect but with the right person I feel like I could have so much love to share but no one wants to even try to see it.   


I bought a lot of new clothes this year, more than I ever have before, I put in effort to try to look and feel good, recently I tried growing facial hair to look a little more rugged/mature and none of that really even mattered or did anything. I still feel like shit and my self-esteem is still very poor.  


It feels like there's zero compassion, empathy or patience anymore, especially in the world of dating. You either get it/have it or you don't and at this point I think it's the latter for me. No one wants to date someone with no experience, no one wants to date anyone that isn't perfect, stable and put together. If you make one wrong/awkward move you're ghosted or, worse yet, made fun of or judged by others on here or on social media in general.  


Dating, relationships and sex in general are all exclusive clubs for me and I'm certainly not invited. I resent being told to learn to be happy without any of those things but the people who tell you that are dating, married or single but still have casual sex every so often, so it just feels extremely patronizing to me. Everyone else gets their own happy ending but me, instead I end up feeling for my friend and it's unrequited, instead I fire up Bumble and get a sense of dread because women there just think I'm ugly trash.

She was different. I’m 20 years old, fairly attractive and but have never really gotten close enough with a girl or found anyone who I’d consider getting serious with. But I immediately hit it off with her. Went on countless amounts of dates and picnics, met her family, was told she would be there for the long run and just genuinely made me believe this was the real thing finally. I was head over heels for her and for the first time I felt like she was for me too.

Fast forward to October, we’re both working and in school, but her situation was a little tougher as she had double the course load and was working constant overtime shifts helping out with her fathers business. Around this time I could feel her responses changing, I could sense the stress and just change of vibe so I decided before I stress her out even further, I asked her if she needed space from me and she agreed as she had a lot going on. We didn’t specify how long this space would be but I ended up going no contact for 3 or 4 days and when I reached out to her again everything was off. We texted normally again for a day but then I was given no response. I texted her asking her what page we were on a few days later and was met with a cold response saying “I didn’t understand her idea of space”, which to me her idea of it was completely cutting me out of her life with no indication of whether or not she’d come back.

Here I am a month later of no contact, considering myself ghosted. This is my first real heartbreak so I am extremely hurt and confused. I don’t know whether to wait for this girl and am just genuinely confused on how over the course of a day or two someone you spend so much time with can become so cold and just pick up and go.

I understand that life can get in the way, people have told me “busy-ness is no excuse, if she wanted to make time she would”, but I genuinely felt bad for her and her schedule. But at the same time, I don’t know what to do. I want to work on myself and try again with her, but also think the way she dealt with the situation whether or not she was under a lot of stress showed me a lot about her true colours and general respect for me.

I’m what I like to call a serial monogamist. I can’t date casually or have one night stands, I’m really an all or nothing kind of girl and I have to really know someone to be attracted to them. I’ve tried to do it but it’s just not for me! My ex and I broke up almost a year ago, making this the longest that I’ve been single in my adult life. My concern is that my two long term relationships have both developed ddlg dynamics and it’s strongly what I’m looking for in a partner.

I’m not going to spend the time here to explain what ddlg is or try to defend the reputation it gets; there’s lots of information on the internet if you’re curious! If you’re against it or it’s not your jam I’d really appreciate avoiding those kinds of comments bc that’s not the focus of this post.

In my first relationship my boyfriend at the time and I slowly developed we had what was essentially a ddlg dynamic and leaned into it, learning about it together. My second boyfriend was willing to learn about it and eventually became comfortable and happy with it, although at a much milder level than my first relationship. Dating and dating apps already suck and people who reach out to me because of ddlg tend to be pretty creepy. This is really holding me back from dating because while most couples can go through the dates, meet-cutes, awkward conversation, decisions to be together and call it a day, I will have to go through a second layer of discomfort and vulnerability when I bring up this need.

As someone who grew up on the Internet I often forget that not everyone went through a period where they were flooded with information on sex, and most people aren’t familiar or comfortable with the concept of ddlg. Considering that it’s also a section of bdsm with a particularly bad reputation I’m immensely afraid of finally finding someone I really mesh with and them leaving because of this, or worse, attempting it, disliking it, and then leaving. I understand that life is just like that sometimes and you have to do the work to find someone that’s good for you and you for them but I notice myself refusing to even seriously look at anyone due to this fear of rejection.

26M here, who started dating a 27F just over a month ago. We met on a dating app, and have been getting on like fire. We agreed to be exclusive / not see other people, and even deleted our apps.

Now there's something that's kind of bothering me, and because I've never encountered this myself, I'm curious / unsure how to feel about it.

So majority of the times, the issue is that a guy is following models on Instagram / TikTok etc and the girl is concerned or insecure. Now the girl I'm dating, found my Instagram and followed me. I followed her back, and as you do, look at her 'following' list. I found that she is following a lot of male models, with tattoos, 6-packs, completely ripped physiques etc. I sort of let it go, until a few days later, when she did the same on TikTok. I again saw, that she was following similar kind of guys who post thirst traps, videos of them dancing practically naked etc.

Now I'm someone that was previously overweight/obese, and in the last year, have changed my body shape and packed on muscle. I'm also happy with who I am, and not worried about what she / others think of my physique. I should also mention, the girl I'm dating has put on some COVID kilos, and is working on losing them also.

I personally stopped following models/thirst trap account back when I was 19-20 when I got into dating, as I never saw the appeal in opening my Instagram and public and scrolling through days on end posts of models.

So I guess what I'm wondering is, whether this sort of a thing is a red flag or something I should be concerned about? Bringing it up just is not something I intend on doing, because its too weird.

What do people think, and have any guys experienced something similar?

We dated for almost 2 years then brokeup and have been broken up for about a year and 3 months and had quite a rocky relatio ship due to it being both of our first long term ones. We both made mistakes and she was very insecure and I didn't reassure her enough and treated her not the best always. She definitely didn't deserve that but I have matured quite a bit and am looking to get back into a LTR and want to know how I can reconnect respectfully and maybe even date her again if she decides to.

We had a couple 3 hour phone calls and a 2 hour FaceTime before our first date. 

The date itself was just lunch and a park but we kept hanging out, ended up getting supper and went back to her place. We spent a great deal of the day/night talking and getting to know each other and I spent the night. 

We both came very close to saying “I love you” that night and said pretty much everything but. For context I haven’t been on a first date in about 15 years. I married my “high school sweetheart” and we divorced last year. So all my dating/relationship knowledge comes from high school and an abusive marriage. 

It seems weird to connect with someone so well and deeply, so quickly. She’s great and it’s been a couple weeks since our date; because of distance I haven’t seen her again yet but we still talk and FaceTime and are smitten with one another. 

I know this may sound dumb, but is a first date to quick to have someone fall in love with you? And to reciprocate those feelings? I’m not gunna wake up without half my stuff again am I? Or with 1-2 fewer kidneys? 

We really are on the same page with our goals, lifestyle, religion, everything really. We both know what we’re looking for in a partner and have found it in the other. 

Like I said, I’ve been out of the dating world for so long and given my last relationship, I just wanna make sure this isn’t a big red flag I should be aware of. I think we both are just at a stage of life we’re we know what we want and we see it in each other and we’re not afraid to make that commitment.
