I always putted 100% effort of showing my interest in her and investing time with her. I started to believe it wasn’t the women it was something I was doing that was making women not be attracted to me. I dress nice, 5’11, good oral hygiene and I’m not fat but definitely on the chubby side. About 1 year ago I went through a lot with women and just honestly looking at myself in the mirror. Now, this is where I really can’t believe this tactic works. I’ve been purposely ignoring and to be frank, treating them poorly in terms of verbal communication and they love it. This is so messed up but it’s been getting me laid on first dates. I lost my virginity this year. Most of my dates consist of women driving close to where I live bc I make up some excuse that I can’t leave my area and they agree. When we’re on a date I don’t give her any mind and talk sexual or tell her all the things I like in a women which I know she doesn’t possess — if she’s tall I’d mention how tall women and not my taste, if she’s on the thick side I mention how I love women who are vegan etc. They immediately get attached and search for something that I can validate them with. This all leads to them wanting sex by the end of the night. Even AFTER the sex , they still want to keep in touch to which I only text them a few days in advance asking how’re they’re doing if I’m looking to have sex again. Why is this method working ? It’s nothing like movies or stories our parents tell us. I’m not complaining as I’m quite happy that I’m getting laid just curious tho.

TLDR - changed my approach of not love bombing women and results have been showing through cold approach.

Warning: Long read ahead..

Basically, I matched with this guy on Hinge back in mid Jan. We talked for about a week before going out for coffee. At the end of our first meeting he asked me when I'm free next and I was a bit caught off guard so I just said I'll let him know. He texted me soon after and we met up for next weekend and drove around different parks and talked for like 7 hours. Afterwards he texts me again and he was kind of asking me to go to his place to watch a movie, and since I didn't know him that well I just wanted to tell him that I'm looking for a serious relationship and not something casual. He didn't really explicitly say that he is looking for a serious relationship but he gave a roundabout answer which implied he was on the same page as me and saying he's not a hook-up kind of guy and that he's on hinge, not tinder...

This guy was genuinely busy balancing school and full time work, on top of a drama-filled roommate and he was still making time for me so I really appreciated it. There were a few times where it seemed like he was going to flake on me because something came up, but he didn't or he would just delay the date by a bit. I understood his situation and after we met up for the 3rd time (just a quick dinner he had to go back to class after), he started to call me frequently, almost daily and suggest meeting up.

He was taking up a lot of my time and I stopped seeing other people. I also noticed he deleted his Hinge profile not long after we met but I didn't ask him about it, just assumed he was too busy or maybe because he wants to focus on me. For the following 2 months, I got emotionally attached and I'm pretty sure he would know that I'd get attached with spending so much time together, daily calls and texts, good night texts, etc..

Our last date was April 2 and after we spent a whole day together, i asked him if he liked spending time with me, and he said yes... then I asked him if he's dating anyone else and he answered with ""not right now"". I thought that was kind of a weird answer and I guess he felt unprepared for that kind of question, I asked him why he does not ask if I'm seeing anyone else and he said he assumed I'm not and ""why does it matter"".  It was kind of an awkward convo in which he proceeded to tell me that he deleted his hinge profile because he was too busy, and that he told his mom about me too.

The next day, I slept in and missed his call. Apparently he wanted to see me before i meet my friends just to go to costco, he told me that he likes spending time with me and it doesnt matter what actiivty we do and that he leaves his schedule open for me.. but I couldnt meet him as it was too rushed. I did notice there were many times he would just call me after work and ask me to hang out, but I always turned it down because it's too rushed. Though we would still have preplanned days to hang out (usually he reserved Friday nights or Sundays for me). So i took it as a sign that he really likes me.

Literally the next day, he texts me in the morning, I reply, and i do not hear from again for the next 24 hours. I was completely confused and even worried something happened to him since I know he was hanging out with his friends. He texted me the next day saying something came up and asked if he could give me a call later in the evening. For the next few days, his communication was really inconsistent... he acknowledged this and then asked me if we could meet up and go for a walk or video call. We went for a walk and that's where he told me that ""he's not ready for a relationship right now"" due to not wanting to lose his freedom (he got out of a long term relationship about a year ago and the girl cheated on him), he feels that his next relationship would be one where he settles down and there are still things he wants to do. I said you can still do those activities with an S/O... and then he also talked about how he wants to meet new people but he wouldnt be able to do that in a relationship.. well no kidding! And that he thought he wanted a relationship in the beginning but changed his mind after his very long and deep talk with his friends. And that he had these thoughts already during the beginning... needless to say i'm not the first girl hes dated since his breakup but i guess im the first girl that went this far. During our talk I wasn't reactive and I was calm, though i showed my disappointment, I told him to give me some time to think about my decision.

When we departed, he texted me again giving some vague message about hoping to see me once before I decide to leave if thats what I decide on, and I told him to give me some time to process everything. About a day later, i told him lets meet up to have a conversation and we met up a week later. I told him I want him to be happy but I can't do a casual relationship because I want more than him, he said hes not looking for FWB and that he wants to stay friends. I said I can't be friends right now, and he insisted he's going to follow up with me in 2 months. He said that he feels bad because he likes me a lot but can't give me what I want right now. . It was so saddening but the whole time I was honestly so composed, he even said that he was planning to just ghost but because I was ""different"", he wanted to have this conversation even though it's difficult...After we departed he texted saying he's sorry and that he'll check in with me again, i just said ok take care and he didn't reply to that.

That was about 2 weeks ago and honestly it's been very hard to get over him. I redownloaded the dating apps but Im not really feeling it, but at the same time I feel that void where he used to call me every evening. I talked with friends, dating coaches, and everyone almost said the same thing saying he used me to get his emotional and physical needs met without having to commit. I feel very used and devalued, and it's been a rollercoaster of emotions. Some days I'm content, some days like yesterday I was pissed. I had the urge to call him and just ask him questions like ""Why did you lead me on?"" ""When you say you dont want a relationship right now , is it a way of letting me down gently??"" ""If you like me a lot why cant you commit""?? ""Why can't we talk right now... even though I did suggest i cant be friends with him right now..

I am not sure if he would reach out on the day he said he would. On one hand I am scared if stop talking then he'll just be out of my life.

We talked for a month and then started going on dates: so far we’ve gone for about 7 dates. Things are starting to get serious but there are some stuff that I noticed that makes me wonder if these are red flags:
- He never offers to pay: I’m completely fine splitting the bill, but I like when a guy offers to pay. In my past relationships we have also usually taken turns to pay, or he’d pay for dinner and I’d get drinks etc. However this person has never offered to pay once in our 7 dates? 
- He has hooked up with a lot of people in his past and still talks to them relatively regularly - FWBs, one night stands etc
- He’s inconsistent in how fast he replies to texts - we used to text once a day, and for the last couple of weeks much more frequently than that. A couple of days ago I asked him for our next date for the first time (typically he asks) and he didn’t reply for the whole day, which made me rather anxious lol
- I told him that I wasn’t ready to have sex and he respected that, however we were making out and he was having blue balls and he wanted to jerk off, but he was doing it in the same room as I was in (didn’t even go into the bathroom) and I’m 99% sure he was watching porn to do so - I know I’m the one who said we weren’t going to sleep tgt but I still felt disrespected.
- He’s still seeing multiple other people: which is fine since we didn’t talk about exclusivity, but guys I have dated in the past who were really interested actively stopped seeing other people because they wanted to dedicate enough time to our dating rship. I didn’t ask if he’s sleeping with them tho.

All these are also inconsistent with how he has been telling me he has really strong feelings for me, he wants to move things forward, he really likes me, etc. I’m starting to catch feelings so I want to know if this is worth pursuing, otherwise I’d want to stop now before I get more emotionally attached.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,740805,public,self,Are these red flags for the guy I’m dating?

I am alone in romantic way all my life ; I am 27 years old man, average looking, with high education (university degree). And I tried Tinder. Well, first experience with Tinder seems good but at end that was disaster. My heart was broken, and i needed time to start feel normal again and move one. I saw her like 7-8 time, she was caling me first etc, asking favour and at end she just put picture with other man on Facebook and people commeting like ""you are cute couple"", ""i am happy for you"". Just few days after out last call. I was broken, not becouse she didn't want to be with me, I was sad about the way she did that. I try to kiss her on third date, she refused. Jesus, what a pain. But i didn't show emotion and i was act normal. That was like 3 years ago? And i needed like few months(like 9-10) to feel good again. And i went on 3 date in like 2 years. First girl was realy nice, but i didn't like something (don't judge me please, it was not easy for me to say i don't want second date, i felt realy bad lik I'am bad person). Third girl was nice, but she didn't want second date and i said ok and i moved on. But that is fair, she said she is not interested and i'm fine with that. 

And where is problem now, why i need advice. I meet girl. I felt realy good! I felt like somebody is listening me, not judging me, like she is realy good person. I meet offcourse girls in my life, i find someo of them like realy good, but thay don't have ""that something"". I feel like she has ""that something"". We spent like 4 hourse on first date, and that time passed quickly. I asked if she wanted to see me again, ans she said - she realy had good time, i'm good company and that we will hear each other. I don't want lie, my biggest fear is that she will say in next few day like - i chanded my mind, or i meet somebody else,or even to put me in friendzone... She is girl ond Tinder, and offcourse she have lot of offer. Offcourse i want to say to her I'm afraid of that. And where is problem? Becouse of my fear, I'm afraid i will ruin something. I don't expect that she will felt in love in 5 days, i don't expect that she think about me right now. I'm not that stupid. But, she has all that what i looking for loooooooong time. And i have fear. When i sended messegess, my fear was thet she will say  - you are good BUT... I don't know what to do. I realy don't. It is much easier when you don't care about, you don't think about lot of things. It is hard to intrepert messegess and emotion. That is drains my energy. I know that i'm not only person with that ""issues"", but i cant talk with friend about that. They can't understand that, not becouse they are bad, but they allways say - why you care, there are other people. Yes, but it is realy hard to find person ""right person"". I cant fall in love easly, but when i love, i love with all my heart...  And i don't know what to do. If i try something on third or I dont know which date, I can lost her. If i don't try or i wait too long somebody can be with her. I hide my Tinder not, I'm not visible becouse i don't want to talk to other girl and I think it is not fair to go to multiple date. Maybe I'm wrong, but i can't do that. I have feel that i don't rescpect to her if I talk to other girs in moment after date. Offcourse, we saw each other for only 1 time, and that mean only that - 1 date, nothing more. We offcourse have right to talk to other people, but i can't do that. I'm realy afraid that  she now don't talk with other about date :(

&amp;#x200B;

I have big big big fear. After long time, i cant say i meet girl that which won my heart fast. Offcourse, that is just begining and ond second, third date i can find that she is not right for me.  but intuition, which has guided me well so far, tells me that I should wait a littl. But I'm not sure is that just hope in my hearth.

He’s not much of a social person and neither am I so our texting is very sporadic and I don’t know enough about him yet to feel comfortable meeting him.  But he says he would rather talk about deeper stuff like that in person and not text.  

So, thinking of how I’ve spent all 29 years of my life single, I figured I’m just going to go for it and suggested a weekend to meet.  Weekends only work for him even though they don’t for me so I had to request a Saturday off for this.  I instantly regretted it though and I want to cancel it.  I did leave it open and said if I can get it off, would he want to meet and he said yes.  So I suppose I could just tell him something came up.  I’ve got two weeks to tell him but I feel like the sooner the better.  

I don’t want to sound so flaky but I suggested this date last Saturday and aside from him stating that it works for him, we’ve only sent one text to each other.  I can’t really ask him anything I want to know because he doesn’t want to do that over text so I don’t really know what to say to him and apparently he doesn’t want to text because he’s not texting me.

I can’t get weekends off to see him and he lives like three hours away and I don’t want to drive that far.

He took care of me to the same intensity that I took care of him. We were goofy together and made each other laugh. We shared common values and were delighted with each other on a number of levels that we frequently vocalized.

My past is riddled with religious dogma and guilt due to growing up in a fundamentalist sect and subsequently leaving it behind me when i was in my early twenties. I was excommunicated by my own family and they even admitted that they'd rather I died than left the church.

I had warned him from day 1 that it would be unlikely i'd ever introduce him to my parents... and as time developed, I introduced him to others who were important to me, but never my parents. Initially he accepted this wholeheartedly. We can't pick our parents, and it was just the shitty hand I was dealt in life.

Apparently this caught up with him.

He never mistreated me, he never spoke harshly, or behaved in a controlling manipulative fashion, he never lied or did anything to compromise my self worth. But that ONE thing made him realize that he liked me, perhaps even loved me in some small ways... but not enough for it to last. He wanted everything I was, but with the good family relationships attached to it. He wanted someone who had family who would accept him... and I think most people want that, so I didn't blame him.

It's somewhat easier to get over a relationship where there is betrayal, or bad behaviour. Because at least in those situations you can point out the villain in the situation... or you can say ""they were emotionally unavailable and I deserved better"" or ""they lied, and therefore I feel better about how I conducted myself"". But in a situation where the person was a good and caring partner, perhaps even loved you... but cut it short simply didn't see a future with you.... it sucks. All you can do is sit in the grief of knowing that the type of partner they were is hard to come by... and that you'll have to repeat the laborious process of finding someone who carries all those good traits, but who has a fortitude and attraction toward you that is more long lasting.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,740945,public,self,"The worst way to be broken up with is when the person is into you and good to you, but can't see the long term potential with you.",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mzx2jq/the_worst_way_to_be_broken_up_with_is_when_the/,all_ads,6,,,,

I told him I wasn’t looking for anything serious, just casual sex and I already have few dudes. Been upfront from the very beginning.

I liked him most out of all dudes I had, and seemingly he liked me too as all meetings were initiated by him, he’d ask me about other dudes I have in my life and act jealous. We’d meet once a week.

I have been seeing this guy since January, and in March I found out he had a long-distance girlfriend. I immediately cut him off, but after 2 weeks, he reached out to me saying he missed me and wants to see me again. The feeling was mutual because I was really into this dude.

I met up with him again. He told
me he was in LDR with this girl for a year and he said he will move to another country in April for 6 months for work and his girlfriend will travel to that country too. After that meeting, he again asked to meet because he misses me and I ended up seeing him again. While I was giving him blowjob, he said he loved me. And he said it like 7 times that day during sex. Said he will miss me.

Anyways, he moved to another country few days after we had sex, and deleted my number on Whatsapp. Haven’t heard from him ever since. He is now with his girlfriend posting happy couple IG stories that I stalk. 

I cannot help but feel used. I know this was the arrangement I signed up for, but I feel sad that I was so easily disposable. He was never mine in the first place, but I have this ‘what if’ thoughts.

Fast forward to the following summer, I reached out to him on instagram and this time he was interested in seeing each other. We met up about three times in three months (I was home for the summer so I went to visit him, about a 4 hour drive) and I knew I was infatuated from the first meeting. I could talk to him every day and never get bored, wanted to know everything about him and asked many questions, felt content doing anything with him, and just had this feeling as though he was the one. Of course I did my best not to come on too strong.

I dated a guy for about a month. We realised he was too busy at the moment to give me whatever I needed emotionally and we decided to break up, with the thought that after he finished college we might get back together and try again.

A few months passed, I see him at a friend gathering. We hit it off. Decide to go back to his place. All fun and games until we go to his bed and he... Physically forced me to give him oral. Several times. I refused a lot and said a very firm no but he didn't stop and kept pushing my head with his hands. I eventually caved in just for it to stop and then told him I'm tired and went to sleep. He dropped me off silently back at home very early the next morning and that's it.

That's how one encounter just traumatised me so much that I decided to take a break. From men, from relationships, from dating. I can't see myself getting into another relationship and ending up being harassed again. Looking back at the relationship we had at first, there were signs I didn't notice because I was head over heels for him. Just the thought of being so in love with someone I don't see the abusive signs frightens me.

I keep replaying it in my head and nothing adds up. It's so difficult to process.

Walking to the car she said ""Sooo how do you think this went? Not going to ghost me are you?"" To which I replied "" I think it went good. I don't ghost people. Even if I thought it wouldn't work out, I'd tell you"". 

We get to the car and she says ""Hopefully I can see you again!"" And I say ""you will"". We hug and leave. When I get home I thank her for spending time and tell her I forgive her for blowing me off previously and hope we can see each other again.

I’m 25 and always been pursued by creepy men. Ones that are extremely inappropriately sexual bordering harassment. 

Drunk messages, from guys who only message me drunk, super creepy and desperate messages.

What’s upset me most today, is that I received a message from an unknown number today from someone asking how I was doing. I didn’t know who it was so told them I had a new phone. They then proceeded to tell me it would spoil the fun if they revealed who they were. The most creepy thing was they told me they missed me and that they know I’ve recently moved to a new town. I’ve hardly told anyone there I was moving. He even said he would reveal who he is if I told him my deepest secrets.

I’m really creeped out by this. What’s more, the messages are all in lower case but iPhones and androids automatically capitalise messages. 

I was ghosted by a guy last year but I moved on. He’s the only guy I can think of who would miss me as I don’t give my number out.

So I've recently started dating this genuinely interesting guy. We met on an app, but I recognized him from high school. We casually met at a park, both jammed the guitar, had a lot of fun and there was def a connection. We met a couple more times the weeks after, things got intimate and everything seemed equally reciprocated, but every moment was almost dream-like, away from reality. And I'm not sure if that's a good sign. 

I have never met a guy quite like him, his lifestyle is so unique from most people I know and he seems to have a lot of friends. So I'm finding it really hard to judge his character and how he thinks about things related to dating.
I wasn't necessarily looking for a relationship and I must admit I've never really communicated my intentions, simply because I wasn't sure about mine and his. But it didn't feel necessary either. I just went with what I felt like.

Now 3 weeks ago he asked me to go camping with him and a friend of his. Two days before we went, we'd still spent a great day together, quite romantic even.

On the trip I noticed his attitude towards me slightly changed over the trip. They hadn't seen each other for a long time and were very well befriended. But it was almost too noticeable, like the bromance was so extreme that it was hard for me to get involved in the conversation and numerous inside jokes. 
We only kissed one time the first night in our tent, that was it. Very weird. What we had done before suddenly seemed like just some friendship and afterwards I felt like he shouldn't have invited me on the trip. Now a week after we haven't really spoken much, but I definitely want to talk to him about it. But I'm hesitant about everything rn.

I just have no idea what happened or what shifted in that short period of time. Did he hold some facade on our dates and did he show himself on the trip when his friend was with us? Is this a sign of immaturity, am I not giving clear signs? I cannot figure out my importance to him, which itself can be a red flag. I want to keep my self-respect at all times and don't want to be toyed with, but he's like the most interesting person I've ever met.

Of course, there's the 'just ask him', because communication is everything, but the situation is just so complicated right now and I know it's going to change a lot. So what are your thoughts on this?

I'm 18F, he's 19 and we're both studying in the same city.

My friends would be approached by women or had their crushes reciprocated, but to my knowledge there was no one who ever had any romantic interest in me. I had no trouble making friends, male or female---it was just romantic interest that was the issue. This can almost entirely be attributed to me recovering from a medical condition that caused me to become quite underweight, often fatigued or in pain, and with a speech impediment that would vary in intensity. I went for coffee once with a girl who actually made fun of my speech during the course of the conversation.

I dated fine in high school before my medical condition came up. Over those five years, unable to do much else, I devoted myself completely to my career/entrepreneurial activities, and now I'm making much more money than most people my age. I've been on an experimental pill that has largely cured me of my condition over the past two years. To help with my esteem, I spent some of this money on an expensive personal trainer to help me bulk, and given that I was already starting from a ridiculously low body fat I'm now in excellent physical condition.

I didn't really talk to new people over the past year due to COVID, but over the past couple months I've been easing up and tried dating again. And it's like there's such a big difference---now I'm in shape, have money, and have no speech impediment, almost everyone seems interested.

The issue is, I have a really hard time taking any of these women seriously. I'm a 24 year non-asexual guy: I'm interested in sex. But I really can't see them as anything more. I don't care at all about their feelings, and I have no interest doing anything for them. I'm trying to play the game and act kind and genuine, but if something ever came up where they needed my help, I would intentionally not be there.

(Yes, all the legal action I could take has been taken.) I am basically over the trauma, but something happened today that’s made me feel upset and nervous.

He grabbed my nose and twisted it for several minutes as I sobbed and begged for him to stop. The violence was likely prompted by me telling him I didn’t want to be in a serious relationship with him. As a bit of background, he is super rich and used to getting his way with everyone. He would try to give me gifts and take me places, but I always refused. (I posted about him earlier this year and you can read my post history if you want.)

I spent time with him because I thought he was interesting and fun, and because he was dark and sexy, and I never imagined he’d physically assault me. Blame early exposure to Twilight. I don’t know, I’m going to be more careful from now on.

Anyway, as soon as he let go of my nose, I ran away and told him never to contact me again. (By the way, I had to go the ER to make sure my nose wasn’t broken.)

I left his house at maybe 2 am. The next morning, I woke up to a VERY expensive flower delivery (like $178 flowers) from someone anonymous. I called the flower shop, told them about the above, and they confirmed it was him.

When I confronted him via text about the flowers, because I was disturbed and upset, he said that he had ordered them days ago, and that he had tried to cancel them, was told they were canceled, and that they went through anyway.

To me, this didn’t feel so bad. At the very least, it wasn’t creepy.

I have been trying to get a protective order against him, and I found out today from the detective on my case (cool, right?) that the flowers were ordered after the assault. That means that he ordered them sometime from 2 am to 6:30 am after I ran away from him crying.

My question is: Why would he do this? I was sobbing SO hard when I ran away from him. He kept trying to engage with me, and I kept telling him to leave me alone and let me go. My last words to him were “do not ever contact me again.”

When I got in my car after the incident, I went online to block him, but found that he had blocked me on all social medias (probably right after I left his house.)

This is really bothering me. I’m pretty spooked he went on his computer and sent me such expensive flowers to my own apartment (thankfully with a lot of security where he is banned from entering) literally RIGHT after I ran away sobbing from being in so much physical pain.

I (24F) have recently met someone (38M) on a dating app. It’s been about a week or so since me and this guy have been texting. We’ve exchanged pictures (nothing nsfw), we’ve sent audio recordings so I know I’m at least speaking to a male and i’ve done my googling on what information he’s given me so far. I’m a single mom of 1 kid and he’s a single dad of 2 kids. So we both have the same kind of life situation, in that aspect at least. 

He’s very sweet, thoughtful, and is always making good conversations. He’s asking questions about me, making it known that he’s actually interested in me and he’ll text me throughout his day at work to let me know he’s thinking of me! Super sweet right? ..right? 

He’s overall, as far as I can tell, a genuinely good guy. But something seems off. I feel like he might be moving too fast already or I don’t know? He’s constantly saying “I want to know everything about you” or “I feel like you’re my person” things like that. I’m sure his intentions are well but something feels off about it? Like he’s trying to push so hard for comfortability, like the second day we were texting he asked me my middle and last name? Doesn’t that seem odd? Or am I overthinking? 

I haven’t been in a real relationship in awhile, I haven’t dated since before becoming a mom. This guy seems really sweet and genuine, but something just seems off with how he wants to know everything about me. I haven’t noticed anything else odd, granted like I said earlier in the post that it’s only been about a week or so.

So my question is- is this normal? Is it normal for a guy to be wanting to know everything about you this early? Is my anxiety and problem with overthinking going to ruin my chance with someone who actually wants to be with me? Do people always move this fast? 

I know there’s some relationships where the people meet and then get married right away and are still together 20 years later.

We decided to stay friends. We talked for a bit and stopped. Like friends normal do.

But it’s been a week, and he hasn’t texted me. And I told some one in the comment is going to tell me to text him.

But I just wanna see for once if someone cares enough about me to text me. 

Even when we were getting to know each other, I texted him first all the time. 

I found out he got a friend vibe off me, and I was okay with that. Because I was gonna suggest we be friends and I found out he got a friend vibe off me when I told him it’s better if we stay friends.

So we both decided to stay friends, I couldn’t make him like me, or see me as someone he likes, so what’s the point.

And I actually see my self being his friend and I understand why he got a friend vibe, I kinda of understand why now, I get that from him too.

But I feel like he wants me to text even if we’re texts.

And I think he doesn’t want to meet up, or talk on the phone.

I think he just wants to have me on Snapchat to make himself feel like a good guy. 

What the point in being friends if it’s always texting forever? And what’s the point if one person is doing the texting? 

I always felt like I didn’t matter to people, if I didn’t text, they wouldn’t. And times like this I get this feelings so strong.

There is this girl at work who began to sit across from me on my breaks at work. I started talking to her and before i knew it we would/could talk about just about anything. She would ask me what my weekend plans were/ i would ask her

She would also ask me what i was doing after work. She took a genuine interest in my life/school/ family. Would get excited when we had something in common

Very awkward and shy when she would first sit across from me. Only started the convo 40% of the time. Other times she would just sit there and look at me until i said something. Would always blush/smile. 

If my break was 15 minutes or so she wouldn’t leave until i got up and left. Seemed to genially enjoy talking to me. Applied the rule that if i were talking to another dude i would be uncomfterbal here with this type of silent behavior but seemingly just enjoying my presence. 

There is no way she is interested in me as she is a 9/10 in my eyes and im maybe a 3 at best. She is athletic i am not. 

I am genially friendly and a lot of people like to great me when they see me. Talk for 3-5 minutes. But usually don’t take breaks with them. When ever someone would great me i would try to include her in the convo as i know she is shy but she would only smile at look at them then get on her phone until i was done. Really cant figure this out. 

Seemed to get slightly annoyed if someone took my attention away from her. Or if she saw me talking to another cute girl on the sales floor she would turn around and flip her hair and i think intentionally made me see her walk away.  

Another thing i truly cant figure out is when i would be sitting down talking with her. On quite a few occasions she would speak so softly i couldn’t hear her and i would ask her to repeat herself 3-4 times until i would just go with it and act like i heard her. Really confused as to why she wouldn’t speak up. 

After about 6 months of talking at work i asked for her number and texted her the next day. We texted for about 2 days then i asked her on a date. She said she couldnt because of covid and a household family member had health issues. I took this as a rejection and told her i wouldnt talk to her anymore. She then said she really liked our relationship and i didnt have to do that. Why would she say relationship not friendship if she rejected me? I told her i would think about it and she insisted. 

When i saw her at work she looked all dolled up with make up and hair done more than usual. She approached me like usial We talked the next day at work like normal. 

That night i texted her saying i needed space to get over my feelings for her. She said she understood. The next time i saw her she looked really sad and almost like she was about to cry. I felt really bad by cutting her off, i realized i should make amends and the next time i saw her i approached and she told me she no longer wanted to speak to me. Now when i see her she still looks sad and takes her breaks byherslef. I dont know what to do as i really enjoy taking to her. Any ideas on what went wrong? Also is there any way i can fix this as i really liked her and enjoyed talking to her. 

Now when i see her it appears that she doesn’t put any thought into her appearance. Probably not related. 
I did ivite her to a real public place and the more i think about it she seems to take weird and extra precautions at work

She also seems very very shy from what I can tell and doesnt like talking to many people. 

We texted alot on the first two days. I sent her a message on the third to which she didnt respond. Then i texted her the next day and we resumed texting where i asked her out via text 

To add on to this if she wasnt interested romantically but she liked me as a friend. Why wouldnt she tell me that instead of making up an excuse?

We’ve been taking for about a year before we started dating. 

A little background on us: Prior to dating we have only gone on a few dates and mostly built our relationship off of hanging out on mostly weekends after a party. The attraction is definitely there but just this past week or two we have started getting intimate, taking her virginity. She’s gotten better in putting an effort to hang out compared to before. But it’s nowhere near where I think personally it should be. She’ll ask to grab Starbucks here and there for an hour during the week. But the relationship is still build off of hanging out Thurs-Sat night, with her never sleeping over, me driving her back at like 4 am. To be fair this is her first ever relationship she has been in and it’s obvious she doesn’t know how to fully be a relationship. 

I’ve been in past relationships and have seen buddies of mine get into recent relationships where them and their significant other hang out 5/7 days of the week, sleeping over and going on constant date. For me that is inexistsnt it feels like. I’m always asking her to hang out almost everyday and trying to plan cute stuff with her not really showing the effort back.

Am I just being to needy for a relationship so new with a girl who has little experience? I was thinking about backing way off, still talking to her obviously, but seeming less needy and appear I have more going on in my life then I acually do lol. And kinda let her take the initiative. At the end of the day we do have a fun time together but she has said I come off as needy.

She ended up breaking things off bc she said she wasnt ready for a relationship and even though we had been seeing each other for 3-4 months, she said she saw things as casual the whole time. I still think about her tbh and i did want a relationship with her and i was very attracted tp her and sad that things didnt work out. I dont understand what happened there (maybe i became too clingy or needy once i caught real feelings) but we skydived together, we would skate together, she cooked for me one time, i bought her a birthday present, somehow we would wear the same colors when we would go out, yet she just ended it in an instant. 

And cut to last week where i meet a girl at a club and we were sort of eyeing each other throughout the night, she was a friend of a friend, and somehow she ends up grinding on my dick and dancing with me. I thought it was fun and all but after my friend mentioned to me how she just wanted to dance and have fun and wasnt really interested in me like that. I don't necessarily want anything with that girl but  i felt like i was just used like a dancing pole lol, we held hands and she grinded on my dick, it's cool to touch a hot girls ass, but i felt bad that she didn't really  mean anything serious by that.

And yesterday i went out with this girl, this was basically the first time meeting her and i wasn't even trying to make a move or anything but she invited me back to her apartment and we had sex. The sex was meh but im not even sure if she wants to hangout again and she was going out of town to see her family which she had told me about before, and she said she would ""let me know"" when we could hangout again which to me means like a soft no. In this situation im sort of indifferent about the girl but i felt sort of used lol, and like she didn't even want to cuddle after and i felt like a sort of boy toy.

With the girl from yesterday we had pretty good conversations as well and talked for like 3-4 hours and she opened up to me about her mom having cancer, her disorders, not having friends, and we talked about what we want to do in the future and stuff like that. I made her laugh and we had some banter but like i think maybe the sex was off but it was my first time meeting her so i wanst even entirely comfortable tbh and i really only had sex with her bc she offered me drinks and i got drunk.

Personally from my perspective i think im decent looking enough and i give off a very carefree vibe, so i imagine these girls feel safe or comfortable just expressing there desires onto me.

What are your thoughts on this...

Back in January I matched with a guy on Hinge but due to Covid I had to return to my home country for a couple months. We never even got the chance to text that time because I wasn’t up for anything long distance. 

In mid March this guy started texting me insistently through Hinge and then gave me his phone number so we could FaceTime. I was a little cautious at the beginning because I had just gotten over a “break-up”.

The guy was super cute and made me feel a little confident about what was going on. We FaceTimed almost daily and he would always say he wanted to see me ASAP and just hang out. 

Just last week I got plane tickets to go to Miami, not to visit him but for other VISA matters, and I just thought it would be the perfect opportunity to meet him. He was super excited and was even sad that I was staying for too little. 

1 day before the flight he called me and said he couldn’t wait to see me and he suggested we got together on Saturday (My flight was on Friday) because his sister needed some help over the house and her kids. I said it was ok, since I was going back to Miami in May to work. On Friday (the day of the flight) we spoke over the phone and he seemed super excited.

Then everything changed :( 

I never got a text or call from him on Friday and his phone went on voicemail so I thought he was out of battery. Saturday same thing, I couldn’t reach him. So I texted him asking if out meeting was still up for later that night. 1 hour after my text he just responded me with I cant, had to stay with my sister. I was kind of mad but just got over it since I knew he was going to be helping his sister over the weekend. So I asked him when we would meet them and his answer was “May” (When I am supposed to be back) 

Its Tuesday and I haven’t heard from him. No text, no call, nothing. I am confused af because not sure what could’ve changed in less that 24 hours. Should I wait for him to text me or reach out?

I've never been in a relationship before and I started to get the ""I really want to go on a date"" bug, but since COVID hit that was put on hold.

Anyway, my town has started to settle enough to go out with someone and recently I've seen a hairdresser that caught my eye. I wanna ask her on a date but I don't know how, I'm too awkward to ask.

So, how do I approach the situation? Any tips would be helpful, thanks in advance!

For some background, last summer I got out of a 3.5 year-long relationship and have finally decided to start online dating “seriously”. I’ve used apps for a couple of hookups but haven’t tried doing the relationship thing with them yet. 

I work hard on my body and am proud of it, but was wondering if using a gym selfie would be more suggestive for hooking up and attract people just looking for that. They’re not super suggestive, I can prove a link if need be, but I do wear a sports bra in most of them to “show off” my stomach. Not really looking for just hookups anymore so trying to figure out the best pics to use!!

I date both men and women so opinions from both/either is great. Thanks!",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,741669,public,self,Gym selfies in online dating profile? (24F),0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n06ivi/gym_selfies_in_online_dating_profile_24f/,all_ads,6,,,,

I really like this girl who is a year older than me and she actually said yes to a date with me about 3 to 4ish weeks ago. Maybe a week or two after that she said she loved me. I of course reciprocated the same feeling and said it back. Everything was fine until about a week ago when she got mad at me because I could not hang out with her because did some complication. I mean she ghosted me for a good solid 4 hours until she called me after crying. I felt like utter crap because I made this girl I loved cry but just earlier today my phone wasn’t sending texts or snaps and I guess it didn’t send anything to her. Which she then thought I was ghosting her and she posted on her private story saying that communication is the best thing in a relationship and she had those same post crying eyes and it hurt me so bad. So if anyone can please help me it would mean so much.
