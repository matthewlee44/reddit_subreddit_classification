I was talking to and went out a few times with a girl for several months. We’ve been communicating less and I think she may have been upset.

I didn’t tell my friends who this is but I was able to figure it out based on what they told me. The account has been deleted now. I told my friends it might be a toxic ex I had because I don’t want to tell them who she is. The last conversation I had with her, we discussed taking a break from talking.

It was amazing and more, staying up all night just talking, telling each other how cute they are etc etc. 


I’ve never felt this for so long, and 1 week may not seem like much for most people but she was so sweet and a straight 12/10 (and that never happens to me ever) that I could envision a life with her (lol). I couldn’t believe this girl liked me and was wondering how I got so lucky. (Looking back how quick she left I’m beginning to doubt this was true) 

Anyway I had introduced her to a few of my friends and invited her to a discord channel. It was going well. Except now for some mysterious reason the talking got less, the passion definitely dissapeared somewhere. Before she would reply right away and be wanting to voice call anytime I asked but now the reply times are longer, the voice call questions get met with an excuse. She used to just follow me around everywhere wanting to do whatever I do (even though I wanted her to choose what we should do). 

The last time it was going great was 2 weeks ago, the last time it was going okay ish was maybe a week ago and lately? She doesn’t reply to my messages, when I see her online she’s always playing with this one dude from the discord server (like 5+ valorant games a day 7 days a week ). Whenever we’re both on she prefers to play with him. For a while I was getting really jealous and wanted to confront her about it but I don’t know if she’s doing the same stuff with him she did with me. It might just be a game only thing and I chalked it up to he’s better at valorant than me so that’s probably why she sticks with him now. These days I invite her to play and she doesn’t reply, I even message her to play still no reply. Even when we play in a full 5 stack team she doesn’t really acknowledge me in the game anymore. She used to send me kisses in chat (cheesy I know!) She also doesn’t really reply to me on discord but I’ve never tested the waters double or triple texting as I feel that would just ultimately result in a block. 

I know I know I should take the hint she wants nothing to do with me but why? I’m trying to find the reason or the flaw in myself that made her peel away without any real explanation. Sure we had a couple minor issues (she wanted to play an unrated game and it wasn’t clear that’s what she meant, I ended up queuing competitive, we ended up losing badly and she got pissed cuz it was her rank up game. 1 of 2 issues like that). 

I have been looking at older conversations reminiscing about our time but also trying to figure out where exactly did this boat turn around. We did voice call a few days ago and it was really good, almost like nothing had happened.

I have been meaning to voice call her one time, and just confront her about how I feel and finding out what’s wrong and why the change.  However I just feel this would push her away more. 

It’s hard to let go when a person like this only comes in your life once every few years and  to just forget about them without getting some sort of explanation. 

Lastly to be clear, she hasn’t blocked me on anything or unfriended me on any of the games/platforms we talk on. However she has left me on delivered on Snapchat for 2 days now so I gusss it’s almost the same thing tbh. There hasn’t been any ultimatum or argument that had resulted in a separation. Just slowly yet rapidly without a real explanation just what it feels like she wants nothing to do with me. 


Is it because I’m bad at the game, that she doesn’t want to play with me and then ultimately doesn’t want to talk to me, something I said, or did she simply lose interest. I wish I was a mind reader so I could get answers because all I have are questions. 

I guess what I’m looking for is advice or possible next steps. Sometimes I think I really need to man up and stop letting this girl control my emotions and cause me to be sad for days just because she won’t talk to me, but it’s hard.

We had similar goals and interests. Sadly we do not live in the same city. She came to my city with her friends and it was during a busy day for me (classes, work, among other things) but I still squeezed in a small hang out with her. I only had about an hour and a half with her give or take. However it was not a date sadly it was just me tagging along with her and her friends (Probably mistake #1). We all grabbed dinner together. I paid for the bill because I wanted to be a gentleman and to keep my principles that a guy should pay for the first date, even though this was not a date I wanted to still impress her in some fashion. Honestly talking and hearing what this girl said made me just like her so much more. She was just the type you want to bring back home, she had strong goals, she was on a grind that I found so attractive. Fast forward she leaves to go back home and talking is regular, she says things like come to where I live and we can make it an actual date. Hearing this eased my stress because even though the day was not how I would of liked it, at least it seemed like she saw something more and was willing to keep it going. Fast forward a few days after, she hits me up saying ""I am sorry but I want to focus on myself, this semester has been a lot of work."" Basically she cuts it off with me. I do believe that is the case because she has a major and two minors and has an internship among other priorities. She says ""Maybe when life is a little less hectic we can start talking again."" To be honest, I am still kind of just latching on to this little message in hopes it is the case. As someone who struggles in the dating world this one kind of hurt.

Why would a guy chase after you for 2 years while you are in another relationship? Make a point to flirt even though I wouldn't flirt back. It's not my style to be nefarious in that way. When I'm in a relationship with someone I give them my full attention and drop everyone else.

We went to a concert together with a group of friends and i had a crush on him instantly but I was seeing another person at the time. 

Over the 2 years this guy sent me riddles, invites to concerts, horror clips, cute furniture pictures. We share quite a few likes and interests. Outdoor activities are very similar. On paper, this is pretty much a great start.. We are both into horror and the goth scene. Have the same style in decor, we are both extremely hard working individuals. I gave him a chance and he doesn't show interest after a week of hanging out. Wtf is that even? I am constantly told I am an intimidating female. I understand that about myself and I'm not afraid of it.

This guy is either egotistical and to into himself meaning his own wants and needs for strange, he enjoys the single life and is not looking for a commitment, or has no idea what to do with me out of fear. It's hard to find the line between someone playing games and actually just purely busy.

Unfortunately, I'm into romance and effort. I am divorced, my ex-husband was a sheriff and like most sheriffs he was aggressive and abusive. I am just done with bullshit games.. When I am attracted to someone I give them my my full benefit of the doubt, my time and effort. If I'm not receiving that back I lose interest quickly and build my walls back up.

Me personally if I think I’m getting ghosted I’ll send a follow up question text like “is everything ok?”, and then sometimes I’ll send one last text after that if the first one goes unanswered kind of as a last shot for closure.

So to start off I am currently a 20 y/o guy who's never had a relationship. Before you ask I'm not fat and I do take showers. Also I've had my fair share of female friends throughout my years so I don't think I'm coming off as a creep cause who would wanna be friends with someone who's creepy. So I don't have a problem talking or making friends with girls it's just when trying to take it further something gets lost in translation. Now that's out of the way I can get on with the situation I'm in. I got accepted to a new university that I will be attending next fall in a different city I'm in now. I will be living in the dorms and attending class in person. Compared to my current situation where I'm taking online classes in my community college and living with my parents I will have a lot more opportunities to not only meet potential partners but people in general. I also plan to join some clubs. I love drama so I will be doing that. I also play basketball a lot so that's another opportunity. Point is I plan to put myself out there as much as possible and try to get myself out of my comfort zone. A question I have is what/how can I increase my chances of finding someone?

I will now go over my personality traits. To start off I am a very introverted and shy person by nature. I am very similar to Hinata if anyone reading this has seen Naruto. The reason is because I had very bad speech issues growing up. While I can talk fine now, I didn't start speaking full words until I was 4 and had a very bad stutter until I reached middle school. I slowly learned how to communicate with people but it was a very hard process. Also I don't have any siblings and other than my parents I don't have any family in my city. So I never had family around my age to help me break out of my shell. As a result this molded me into the introvert I am today. However since I am introverted I am a very good listener according to my friends. I can recall minor details from conversations that happened weeks ago. So no matter what is going on I will always lend an ear and empathize. Also I am an active person and I do some kind of work out most days. So I will always keep up my appearance psychically wise. Also I like to think I'm a positive person and I always try to see the best in people. I'm not claiming to be a saint and I certainly am capable of losing my temper here and there. I try to go throughout my life treating everyone with the kindness that they deserve.

My main weakness however is my lack of confidence and low self esteem. I've always been a timid person and sometimes have a hard time standing up for myself. Because of all the relationship failure I've had in the past I can beat myself up over it. It just makes me feel like I'm not good enough since no girl has deemed me worthy. I feel very left out it's human nature to feel shitty about being left out. How I describe it to people is if a kid forgets his homework and has to sit in the classroom while looking out the window and seeing all his friends playing on the playground having fun. Also because I have failed over and over I don't have a lot of confidence. Think about it this way if you were playing basketball and you airballed a bunch of 3 pointers would you feel confident in your jumpshot? Hell no. I've heard from a lot of people girls like confidence more than anything but I don't really understand why low confidence is such a huge issue. Nobody is perfect and everyone has their own demons and flaws they are living with. I have plenty of good things I can bring to the table so why does this one little character flaw cancel out all of my good traits?

And I’m over fifty. I tried the dating apps and it didn’t turn out well for me. I’m not a doctor or a medical expert. 
But I believe he was a Narcissist that rocked my world. 
Not in a good way. 
It took a year to recover. And then I started to look on the apps again but with hesitation because of the fear of it happening again. 
The thing is I know what love feels like. The excitement, compassion, sex everything about it.
And I miss it. And I also realize that I need human touch. It makes you feel alive. It make you feel human.
A partners love its different from your families love.
Anyway let me get to my point. After dating a few times with no success.
There was guy who really liked me and we have stayed friends and talk every once in a while. He never stopped trying.
He’s a nice guy just not my type. And I can’t see us together as a couple. 
But I thought since I can’t get a date why not be friends with benefits. So many people do it I think!
So I called him and ask if he was interested!
And he said hell yes. And I went to his house and it began. Sex was great! 
And I thought I had it made.
Having sex ,human contact no commitment. I thought I hit the jackpot and so does he I’m sure.
And now I’m a few months in we’ve seen each a handful of times.
But I don’t think I made for this. It’s not that I’m having feelings for him. I’m starting to question me. 
Is this all you can get. Why are you settling.
This is not who you are. And it hurts.
I know I’m a phenomenal woman who has her shit together why am I doing this.

I developed chronic health issues in my early 20s after a bad reaction to a vaccine (there’s now a class action suit because so many women either died or have lifelong health problems from it... my cousin almost died from it too) and despite doing literally *everything* in my power (diets, fasting, naturopaths, Accupuncture, supplements, meditation, energetic healing, conventional western medicine... etc) I STILL have debilitating health issues. 

I have chronic pain, migraines, POTS (I get dizzy and almost faint a lot), arthritis, nerve pain, intermittent paralysis in my hands, and chronic fatigue. I guess I’m lucky to be alive since my limbs were paralyzed for 2-3 weeks when I was 22 and I couldn’t walk. I had to relearn how to walk again. But no matter how much effort and money I pour into being ridiculously conscious and putting tons of effort my health, it is *still* far from normal, and I *still* cannot work more than part-time because of this.

This has caused me immense grief and devastation, since I used to be super athletic, healthy, smart, and was the hardest working person I know. Always scoring the top 1% of everything. I feel like a shadow of my former self, with all these health issues.

When I was healthy dating was no problem. I had several normal and fulfilling relationships that ended peacefully because we just had different goals in life. Since being chronically ill, though, dating is an absolute nightmare. I went on numerous first dates from OkCupid, all of them starting well and ending awkwardly in rejection when I went into more extensive details about my health issues (I never hid it from anyone, but when I went into more detail it scared them off). Attracting men isn’t my problem, but finding a man who is ok with commuting to a chronically ill woman is. 

My last relationship ended after I discovered I was being cheated on the entire time. 
I’m not satisfied with my current relationship, because my partner doesn’t make me feel good romantically, sexually, or emotionally. Because of this, I am considering leaving it but I feel so broken and unworthy, so considering my health issues. 

I am wondering, with brutally honesty, how many of you men would *ACTUALLY* date a woman who can’t work full time or live a “normal” life due to lifelong chronic health issues that she can’t fix or control?

Before going to sleep, we kissed, and it was easily one of the best first kisses I've ever had. Still, we went to bed, and I had a very, very hard time going to sleep.

He said he is open to a relationship but not with anyone (same). I ended up thinking that he was a bit too forward in the kindest way and I had gotten out of a relationship a month or so beforehand. We had some really great chats. I think he took it a bit negatively and blocked me on social media. I had noticed that he unblocked me on social media so I reached out saying it was probably a miscommunication. He responded positively and we had our first date. Said to me to come to his which we did, we ordered food to his (very gentlemanly sort of guy), attracted to each other, great chats again and we went on a little evening picnic. We both have similar interests in academic stuff. We only kissed that night. I got to his around 6pm and left almost 12 hours later. He offered that I could stay the night but we could sleep in separate rooms or he was happy to drive me home but it was late, so he ordered an uber for me. We both are quite busy and we had our second date a few weeks later. He said it would be nice to hang again. A few days before our second date, he asked what I was up to one evening and offered movie night in pjs.

Anyway, the second date comes, I got to know him a bit better and he mentioned that we're quite similiar. Joked that we both mumble a lot. Ended up sleeping together, not a selfish person, cuddled afterwards and had our good chats. Date went really long like last time and I got an uber home. He messaged me asking if I was okay and to send me the details of the driver. We have been in contact via social media a bit since.

I'm just unsure whether he should be the one that expresses what he wants in person or do I mention that this is what I'm after. He works till the evenings throughout the week and weekend so it seems that I can only see him after work hours.

Hi, I’ve been with my current bf for about 6 months now. Ever since we got together I’ve had trouble trusting him because of an incident that happened at a party. For some backstory, he threw a thanksgiving party and all of his “friends” came along. We had just got together on November 11, 2020 that’s when we made it official and the party was November 23. So, during the party everyone was really fucked up including myself and him. We were both on coke, molly, and alcohol. 

I’ve never done those drugs before until I met him. It was a pretty fun night but I blacked out for the rest of the night. I went into one of the rooms, it was a party bnb we were at and I started throwing up like crazy and I passed out. Fast forward this girl I met that’s a friend of his comes into the room pacing back and fourth, grabs my face and tells me “I deserve better than him” I was still fucked up so I wasn’t making any sense of it. So the next morning after the girl texts me saying that my bf was hitting on her the entire night and that he tried kissing her but she refused and yelled at him to stop. 

I asked him what went on and he denied that happening saying that she wanted him and she got mad at him for leading her on and not telling her that he has a gf. I also found out that she took him to the bathroom with her and closed the door for a few seconds, then came running out. While that was happening I was in the room, Right next to him and her friends closed my door, trying to hear what was going on between them two. he didn’t even try to tell anyone there that I’m his girlfriend and show me off. So I let it slide and believed his word. Fast forward to now I checked his old phone and found his messages with her and he told her “how hot she is” after checking her Instagram while being with me, this was on November 12, the day after me and him got together. 

He also lied to me about hooking up with his girl friends and said he would never do such a thing but actually did when I saw one of his texts in the past talking about a threesome he had with his two girl friends at the time. I also saw another text he sent to one of this girl friends in the past, that said “come to the party, my friend is making medicated treats for everyone” I’m the friend he’s talking about even though I was his girlfriend. I confronted him &amp; He said he never wanted to tell me any of this cause he knew I would be hurt and he told me“I didn’t take you or our relationship that seriously in the beginning” am I wrong for being stuck on the past. Whenever I bring it up cause I’m not over it he gets very angry with me and starts yelling at me and telling me he wants to punch a wall.

I know I’m wrong for checking his phone but I wanted to know what really went on cause either side could of been lying. I will never know cause he denies that incident happening. I don’t know if I should break up with him or not or maybe I’m

He calls dogs and cats beautiful, certain models or actresses in movies beautiful, and some very attractive people beautiful.

I’ve had my pictures rated before and my guess is that my appearance is about 7 or 8/10. I’m definitely not the “most” beautiful woman in the world but I also believe that I look more attractive than “average”. I also know beauty is in the eye of the beholder, too of course 😇😉

My point is that I’m not “ugly”. I was bullied a lot as a kid for having dark-colored skin (I’m part south-Asian), but most people who aren’t racist think I look at least decent.

What bothers me is the fact that my boyfriend can’t tell me that I’m beautiful. He has made a few disparaging comments about my genitals not being “pink” or about me not having blue or green colored eyes. I’m the first brown girl he’s dated, he’s used to being with white women. 

Am I correct in my interpretation that he doesn’t find me beautiful? He has a low libido, hormone and sexual problems, and rarely ever initiates sex or anything romantic with me.

Then told her in Portuguese she’s beautiful in her ear. Ask her if she knew what the means she said no, and I told her it meant you’re beautiful. 

She laughed I said goodbye. 

Texted her when I made it back to my friends place in Philly so she won’t forget who it is

He said he is open to a relationship but not with anyone (same). I ended up thinking that he was a bit too forward in the kindest way and I had gotten out of a relationship a month or so beforehand. We had some really great chats. I think he took it a bit negatively and blocked me on social media. I had noticed that he unblocked me on social media so I reached out saying it was probably a miscommunication. He responded positively and we had our first date. Said to me to come to his which we did, we ordered food to his (very gentlemanly sort of guy), attracted to each other, great chats again and we went on a little evening picnic. We both have similar interests in academic stuff. We only kissed that night. I got to his around 6pm and left almost 12 hours later. He offered that I could stay the night but we could sleep in separate rooms or he was happy to drive me home but it was late, so he ordered an uber for me. We both are quite busy and we had our second date a few weeks later. He said it would be nice to hang again. A few days before our second date, he asked what I was up to one evening and offered movie night in pjs.

Anyway, the second date comes, I got to know him a bit better and he mentioned that we're quite similiar. Joked that we both mumble a lot. Ended up sleeping together, not a selfish person, cuddled afterwards and had our good chats. Date went really long like last time and I got an uber home. He messaged me asking if I was okay and to send me the details of the driver. We have been in contact via social media a bit since.

I'm just unsure whether he should be the one that expresses what he wants in person or do I mention that this is what I'm after. He works till the evenings throughout the week and weekend so it seems that I can only see him after work hours.

It's fundamentally among the most important parts of ""being a man"". No one is going to take a small endowed man serious, no matter how tall he is or how attractive or how rich. 

It hasn't always been this way though, the Greeks when they were in charge thought the bigger men were ""barbaric"" and small-endowed were more ""pure at heart"". So this is a recent thing with the Anglos deciding bigger=better.

So the reality is, it's BS. Under no other time in human history have women selected mates based on dick size until now. But here we are and we act like it's always meant to be this way. It's not. It's just not natural.

On a personal anecdote: I am an Asian dude so we all know about the stereotypes. I've managed to date several western K-pop fans ( [https://imgur.com/rhWAh3o](https://imgur.com/rhWAh3o) ) and none of them care about dick size. I'm not big but I'm not small either. But the point here is I'm just asking, why don't they care? There's nothing in the blood of K-Pop fans that should influence their dick size preferences. Yet, they just don't care.

The answer: K-Pop fans are not as easily influenced by Western media (the fact that they like an Eastern music genre should tell you this) that perpetuates the idea that dick size matters more than anything else and women should use it to select men.

He’s an intellectual, works out, takes care of himself. And he’s really into me. He texts me at least twice every day and asks to see me almost every day. And he constantly tells me how much he likes me. 

The thing is he doesn’t respect my boundaries. One time he called and said he wanted to see me, and that he almost came to my apartment to surprise me. I told him “please don’t do that. Always make a plan with me before you come over.” He said, “challenge accepted.” And he only conceded when I told him I would not take his call if he showed unannounced. 

Then there’s sex. He doesn’t like to use condoms but it’s nonnegotiable for me. The first two times we had sex I had to tell him multiple times before he would put in a condom. 

Yesterday he asked to see me. I went for a walk with him. I talked to him about these two things. I told him that his actions made me feel like he didn’t respect me. He said that it was not his intention, and that he wouldn’t cross a line on purpose. It felt too easy so I told him “I don’t think you really get it”. But I decided to trust him. 

Later last night we started to have sex. And he again tried to penetrate without a condom. I stopped him, asked him why he didn’t respect me. Then I got up, sit on the couch and started watching TV by myself. He tried to apologize, but as I refused to further engage with him he left after a while. 

Today he texted me, asking me how I was and apologized again. I replied “I think we should cool it for a while.” He said ok. 

I know I’m in the right. I can’t let other people push my boundaries like that, especially when it concerns my health. But I still can’t shake the feeling that I’m overreacting. I haven’t dated in 10 years so I’m not super confident in my judgment. Also my therapist always tell me things are too black and white for me so I’m trying to see things in shades of gray.

&amp;#x200B;

just a little vent on my side about how things went wrong with a girl, TL;DR at the bottom.

So after I (M23) met a girl (F24) at an outdoor activity and having a great date, I noticed how she kinda avoided meeting up again by always having other plans. But whenever I got kinda sad or angry about that she would be really sorry and call me. While texting or calling (most times the phone call lasted a few hours) we got along pretty well and everything was fine.

So I kinda went for it and asked what the problem was, and she said that she has a problem with the distance between us (one has to drive about a good hour to meet the other one) and that failed for her in the past. And that she doesn't want that if things go the way she thinks its gonna head (so seemed like she expected it to become an relationship).

I was kinda devestated to be honest, since we got along so well and that something like that would even be a problem if everything else was fine. So I met up with her to discuss things and this time she said that she doesn't want something with that distance and that she also has the feeling things wouldn't go too well for us in the long term. Thing is she also couldn't explain why she feels that way, said she liked me and that it has nothing to do with me but she just has the feeling that with the distance and everything things will not turn out the way we want. 

What is also strange is that she said last time when I stated that I'm not a guy for fwb (since I think I will develop feelings) she kinda understood what I wanted and that she doesn't think things will work out that way. But when I was on the date with her she herself stated that she tried that in the past and developed feelings and that she wouldn't want to do it again.

So what the hell does she even want? She doesn't want a fwb again, but saying that you are looking for something serious in the long term (although I even said you dont have to start out that strong, just meeting up and seeing how things go for a while is fine) is appearantly too much? I'm at a loss here...

&amp;#x200B;

So thanks to anyone for reading, feel free to drop your opinion on the matter. It felt good to let it out.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Girl kinda avoided meetup after first date but kept contact, stated the distance to drive is too much between us for long term and said she doesnt want fwb again.
