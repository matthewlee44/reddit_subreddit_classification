Just for some background, our culture heavily involves parents in dating/marriages. There are matrimonial websites (think the equivalent of catholicmatch.com ) for Indians, where parents often make the account-sometimes jointly with their kids-and look for prospective brides/grooms for their kids. Just tossing this out there because of the relevance it has to my post.

I met a guy in real life, through some friends, and we've been dating now for a few months and had the exclusivity talk. We both seem to be looking for similar things in life-marriage in a few years, settling down. He's made it clear that before that step he would want to make sure of a few things including being sexually compatible and being together for a few years...I personally, would not want to have sex with someone who wasn't at least a boyfriend/in a committed relationship.

Here's the spin. I found out recently through a female friend who is on these matrimonial apps that this guy's mom recently created an app for him and she has been logging onto it every single day. This was after our exclusivity talk. I confronted the guy, who told me that he doesn't want to involve his mom or dad or any relative in his dating life or tell them about his dating life because they may get overly involved. I do happen to know many parents who are guilty of doing this, so he's not entirely wrong, it does place lots of stress on the kid. The guy doesn't want to tell his parents much about me, or even how serious we are, up until we decide to get married, which will likely be in 1-2 years' time (he said he needs that much time). He has assured me he won't talk to anyone else, even if his parents find him a prospect. 

But this leaves me in a bad boat. I like that we are exclusive but that's not the same as being boyfriend/girlfriend. I can't go on for years and years in this state of ""exclusive, but not bf/gf"". On the other hand, if his parents are actively seeking out prospects for him, are we really bf/gf? What if they find someone they like better and refuse to even accept me?

And, if we are indeed in this state of ""limbo""-I'm not comfortable sleeping with him-let's just say that.

I'd love to hear from anyone who's been in a similar situation. Or words of advice from anyone more experienced than I. I'm sitting here, not seeing anyone else, all dating apps deleted, but I can't help but wonder if I'm wasting my time as his parents may find him someone better.

So I met this old family friend of mine after 12 years. We were never really close as kids, played football together sometimes and maybe spoke a few times. 
Anyway, our families (and some others) had a get together 3 months ago and holy shit. He got so hot lol. He’s super tall, lean, has the most stunning smiling ever etc you get the picture. 
Throughout the get together I caught him glances at me a couple of times, but I honestly thought they were coincidences because why would HE look at ME? 
I had some other friends with me and asked them what he’d been up to. They told me he’d just dumped him girlfriend of 8 months over some drama. I didn’t think much of it. 
Anyway, two-ish hours after the get together ended, I got a follow request from him on Instagram. I accepted and 3 days later he replied to my story and boom. We began talking everyday.
Now here’s the thing: I am a university while he has a job. He’s the same age as me, but he started working early. 
I’m not the best texter so our replies would be spaced out 7-8 hrs. 
Also, we live in different cities. 
I know it’s awfully stupid, because a) we dont even talk to each other THAT often and b) I know we could never be in a relationship because we’re in very different stages in our lives and c) WE LIVE IN DIFFERENT FUCKING CITIES. 
But fuck me, all I think about is this guy. I dont know if it’s the fact that I’m really attracted to him (physically) or if our spaced out texts have conditioned me to always be excited to talk to him, but I feel so….helpless? I have absolutely no control over my feelings. I post stories SPECIFICALLY catered to him so he replies and we can have yet another conversation. And he ALWAYS fucking falls for my stories lol. 
I’m usually a very mature person. I don’t even like all that much Instagram lol. But this crush is making me act like a 12 year old. 
All I think about is meeting him in real life, going on a drive with him, kissing him, HELL SUCKING HIM DRY LMFAO THIS SHIT IS DRIVING ME CRAZY!!
Please tell me what the fuck I should do with all these feelings.

How the hell you spark interest into a girl.

Not talking about the ""I see a girl I like and she does not know I even exist"" type of scenario, no, I'm talking about the ""I've started chatting with a girl I see 3 times a week in the morning because of my job"" type of scenario.

So I deliver stuff for my family shop and one of the places i go to is this complex with a bar in it. There is this girl I see almost every time I go there and one morning she said something to me like ""Oh sorry i left this thing in the way"" (It wasn't really in the way) so when I was leaving I stopped and said ""Soo what's your name? I know the names of basically every other worker here but not yours"" and she warmly replied her name with a nice smile on her face. Next day I stopped and tried to chat with her for a minute and paid for a bottle of water and in the end I asked her instagram name and she wrote in on a paper for me. 

See, the issue here is that I cannot make a distinction between the ""I am being polite"" type of smile and general kindness and the ""I'm letting you know I want to know you"" type of smile and general kindness. 

So I guess this could be a first question. How to tell?

And second thing, some people told me that before asking a girl out you should at least try to connect with her in some small way, some would call this ""flirting"", a thing I am ten-thousand percent not familiar with. So kinda hitting on them in very mild way? I have never had much expirience so I don't know any tricks or good things to say. 

Any suggestions on what to say to try and mildly flirt with someone before actually asking them out? 

BONUS EXPLANATION: I made it really sound like I have never interacted with a girl in my whole life and that is not true, I had a wonderful three years relationship with a great person and I have learned a lot from that experience, problem is she was into me before I even started talking to her so I have never really experienced the flirting part, only the actual relationship part which I feel I am very good at.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1005430,public,self,Question mainly fore the ladies but skilled fellow males can answer too.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pnn3e3/question_mainly_fore_the_ladies_but_skilled/,all_ads,6,,,

2. After being rejected, I still harbor insecurities by wondering if I am lovable or worthy of love.

But as i go to talk to her about this in our conversation things got a little heated and she said "" you better start acting right because i got somebody who will treat me right "". When she said this i was trying my hardest not to lose it  ( not anger but sadness ). The person she was referring to is a fellow coworker of hers. After she said that i proceeded to ask the obvious questions like what all did you guys do if anything etc. She told me that they did not do anything and i believed  her.

Or rather, he slept with me after I got blackout drunk and he took me to his room. All is well, I found him cute enough and had sobered up enough to properly consent once things got to that point-- I just want to be clear that he was the one who went out of his way to get us in bed together in the first place. My issue is it's September now and the guy is still treating me worse than a stranger.

As far as I remember, the sex was pretty typical for drunk sex (i.e. more about the vibe than prowess for either of us). I made sure not to overstay my welcome in his bed, and moved to suffer my hangover on the couch once I was able to walk that far in the morning. And we didn't know each other well, but we were on friendly terms before we slept together. I figured his cold/distant thing was due to him not wanting to deal with attachments or the like, which, fair enough.

But this far into the new year with him being avoidant/ignoring me and I'm kind of getting annoyed. We have an overlap in social circles and so have hung out in multiple times since then. And the switch in his attitude towards me is still there-- he's fine and nice with everyone else, so it's noticeable. I thought it would get easier, and hell I honestly thought \*I\* would remain the awkward one about it.

Anyway, at this point, I feel like talking it out will make it worse since he's pretty adamant about not wanting to be near me at all.

So I'm diabetic and have something called peyronie's disease. I am 39, and things downstairs aren't working so much anymore.  


I am scheduled to get a penile implant soon. This is devastating and humiliating to me. It's permanent, I'll never get a natural one again (I currently get, well, useless ones.) This has been a major blow to my confidence, especially since it used to be a part of myself that I was kind of proud of. I am still single and this is making me pretty terrified that it's yet one more hurdle towards finding a partner.   


I've done a lot of research and apparently the partner satisfaction rate is very high, but that's mostly with older married couples who are having sex again for the first time in a while. It apparently feels and looks exactly the same, and I can still have an orgasm. There's no refractory period so that's a plus, and apparently it increases girth.  


On the other hand I have to manually pump it through a device hidden in my scrotal sac. I am afraid women will be hugely turned off by this. I am good at oral and even enjoy doing it. Would this be a deal breaker? Would it be too weird? It feels like a deformity and one might miss seeing me get actually aroused. I will never have a natural erection ever again.  


I am hugely depressed, anxious, devastated, humiliated, furious, and more about this. I know it might sound shallow and dumb to some people but it feels like I'm just losing such an intimate part of my body forever.

POF seems like the only valid free option but you can't even message half the people due to this stupid mechanic, ""xxxx has disabled messaging for now"". Basically it means you didn't 100% match their criteria and so you are automatically disabled from messaging. Excuse me, website bot, let THEM or I decide if we should message or not.

So im a 5ft2 guy in the US, 25 yrs old. Im also a minority. 

In the past I only had one relationship but there was a lack of mutual attraction in the relationship. I had to completely get rid of all or most my standards physically. We both settled to a degree and the relationship ended up breaking apart. Now I must admit I havent really tried very hard to get in another relationship since then cause Ive been busy otherwise but based off my minimal past experiences and my observations, things look really bad. I am looking at my options now. I realize that my height is a significant hinderance to getting in a quality relationship. According to stats only 2% of women would date a guy my height in the US barring any other preferences on my end.

That being said, the way I see it, I only have three solutions to get a relationship with mutual attraction:

-Find that 2% and somehow get extremely lucky, put in immense effort for a tiny maybe. Sacrifice all other aspects of my life: Work, goals, career

-Save up for a couple years and get limb lengthening to become 5'6 (still short) and have a slightly better chance of getting what I want with a large chance of me not. Leaving job for a while.

-Look overseas to shorter countries and find someone conpatible overseas. (Mail order). Maybe ill find mutual attraction in a shorter country? Bring them back to the US. Risk getting extorted. And im still short so id have to face requirements in other countries as well. Time off work . etc

I have been in and am still in therapy and plan to ask my therapist about this eventually but we're working on other things right now and I'd just like some input.

My GF acts like a 5 year old, and it really turns me off. Like I can go from wanting to do a marathon in the bedroom to not wanting her to touch me at all. It grosses me out when she whines like a baby because she had a bad dream, whines like a baby because there was something gory on TV, whines like a baby if she gets a cramp. But in front of others she's never like this. She is mature and bubbly and passionate and powerful like a grown woman usually is (and that's who I am attracted to.) But home alone she talks like a baby sometimes like ""oh hehe I know I'm being weird sorry!"" But like, how you would imagine a 5 year old saying it.

I have tried over and over to talk to her about it and every time she completely agrees that I  am not her mother, I am not responsible for her emotions or her behavior and while I am here to support her, I am not here to baby her. I even asked her ""are you a little? Because I'm not into that "" and she very much insisted that she is not.

I get the impression that she thinks girls are supposed to be like this with their partners but it's not practical at all and it's killing our relationship. 

It also makes its way into the bedroom.  She has on more than one occasion completely killed the mood by acting sort of child like,  it's hard to explain.  When I talked to her about it, specifically about how she is totally into me pleasing her but acts like pleasing me is extremely uncomfortable for her or she has no idea what she's doing even though she's been with several other people, she said she had some mental blocks, and that she was willing to work through them. But when she finally did make love to me for the first time, she acted traumatized after and now I never want to do it again. 

She also is in therapy but I don't think she even knows just HOW much she acts like a child because she ONLY does it when she's with me, and never with anyone else so she probably doesn't consider it to be a personality thing. 

I think this is a trauma response known as regression but she insists that's not the case and I'm at a loss because I don't think this can work until she sees it is a problem.

So I had a fwb with a girl, we got along and everything like that. We agreed to only sleep with each other at the start met up a couple of times and I’ve slept over. I invited her to a party and we went shopping to get me an outfit. 

So recently, tinder was downloaded on her phone to see how women do on the app. Since then it felt like she was rubbing it in my face saying “aww are you jealous I have tinder” are you jealous are you jealous. But I didn’t say anything and just went silent. “I was a little jealous with how much attention she gets” her having tinder isn’t s problem it’s how she gone about everything. She said she isn’t going to use it she’s just curious, the next day she’s kept asking me if I wanted her to delete it. I told her it’s her choice. 

She told me she wasn’t interested in meeting anyone or lads. And said she wasn’t messaging anyone on the app. Then she was but nothing serious. And now today she’s apparently meeting someone next week. 

I had a meh reaction as I thought why didn’t you just say that’s why you wanted to use it in the first place? Instead of making a big deal and asking if I’m jealous. So we got into an argument after I explained that I’m pissed at how she’s gone about this situation and she’s instantly thrown the jealous card and she can do what she likes she’s single. Said she thought her saying to me are you jealous was a joke but yet she asked me what was up and I explained. So In this argument she’s been petty and said  things to piss me off and hurt me. While I’m just trying to explain how it made me feel? Apparently it’s controlling behaviour and she can do what she likes it’s her choice.

I stopped talking to my best friend of 8 years a few months ago. There was a competitive energy to our friendship and when I tried bringing it up I think it sounded accusatory. It was at the point where we hung out everyday but we didn’t tel each other anything. We just met up to have something to do I guess? There were phases in the friendship where she was rude to me or made me wait for her to show up to our plans or would cancel when I was there. Other times I was too pushy and need to to hang out I think. But eventually things went back to being good for the most part. I just don’t get why she was so side eyeing at me towards the end.
So I stopped asking her to hang out and she never talked to me again. Now it’s been a few months and I want to be friends again. I stopped asking to hangout because it felt a bit one sided so I waited for her to say something and she never did. Do I reach out or do I just drop it?

The breakup wasn't clean. After I told him we were over, we continued texting as friends and because I knew he'd take it bad if I cut him off completely. I thought over time it'd become easier, but he used it as a way to get me back. It backfired and I became fed up with the whole situation. We had another argument and after that I haven't opened his chat. 

But now, after the storm has passed and I'm finally calmed down, I find myself missing him from time to time. I find myself missing our casual convos and playful discussions. Despite our problems, we still had some good times and sometimes when I remember them my eyes well up.
Yesterday, I came across a post I knew he'd like and for a moment I forgot everything and almost sent it to him. Few days before that, something good happened to me and I wanted to tell him so bad but I couldn't. 

It's weird, you know. You spend a year with someone, learn what they like, how they experience things, what brings a smile on their face, you learn their flaws and imperfections, you even love them, and after the breakup you're left with a hole that will heal but in the meantime you have to deal with the empty, disgusting feeling of having to relearn how to be without them. They were a part of the daily routine for months and all of a sudden they're not and it hurts. It doesn't mean breaking up was wrong or that just because you miss them you should forgive all their mistakes, but it's just...frustrating to go through all that to feel at peace again.

I know I will never get back with him—the problems we had in the relationship weren't small things—but I'm just sad because I lost someone who was loyal and, even though didn't know how to properly express his emotions or talk things through like an adult, someone who seemed to really love me in his own weird way.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1005727,public,self,Just a rant about my post breakup feelings :),0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pnrxzm/just_a_rant_about_my_post_breakup_feelings/,all_ads,6,,,

I met this girl on Bumble a couple of weeks ago who I really clicked with. We ended up going on a date to the mall labor day weekend. We kissed a couple times in the mall and ended up making out in the car for a couple hours after we got out. She came over to hang out after making a pitstop for PJs at her place, and we just fell asleep together. It's also worth noting that she was ending her period when we hung out the first time.

Backstory:
For the past week, she has been very consistent at texting me when she wakes up around 5:30am and telling me goodnight when she goes to bed around 8pm. In between, we'll usually text pretty consistently throughout the day.

We were supposed to hang out last Thursday, but she ended up needing to stay late at her work since her coworker had to go attend to their kid. She expressed how much she hates bailing on plans, but that she was really tired and it would be better to hang out on Friday. I agreed, because a Friday movie night sounded pretty killer.

Friday comes, and I get sent home from work with Covid symptoms -- so I tell her this and end up cancelling the date. (I've had the virus and the vaccine, so low likelihood that I would get it yet again)

On Saturday, I was pretty confident that I didn't have covid because only my sore throat was sticking around -- but I went to get tested anyways. She has been wanting me to go on a walk with her, so I asked if she wanted me to go with her. She agreed. We left our houses about the same time, but I live 40 minutes away from the destination so I wasn't even close. She calls me after like 10 minutes and says she's not going walking today because a screwdriver was in her tire. She sent me a red snap of a screwdriver in her tire, so that's definitely true.

On Sunday, she didn't talk much for most of the afternoon, but gave me a call in the evening to talk about her day. Everything seemed good, and she sent me a sweet goodnight text that also thanked me for video chatting with her for a while. I also got my negative covid test on Sunday.

The Situation:
While on the phone Sunday, we said we were going to hang out this (Monday) evening. She doesn't text me in the morning like she usually does, so I send her one when I get up at 7am. She still hadn't answered by 11, which is really uncommon, so I ask ""Is u alive?"". She said ""Sorta"". I asked ""What happened?"" And she just said ""Just been super busy"" -- also pretty uncommon. She didn't send anything after that. The time comes when we were supposed to hang out, and she still hasn't answered my next message. I give her a call, and she says that shes at home laying in bed and feels awful -- with stomach pains, a migraine, and something else. The call lasts about 90 seconds because she sounds awful.

The Question:
What's y'alls take on the situation? It seems pretty fishy to me that she would take a sharp turn like this. I'm kind of thinking that there could be something working in the background that I don't know about yet.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1005751,public,self,Opinions on a fishy situation?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pns7y9/opinions_on_a_fishy_situation/,all_ads,6,,49223cde-abc9-11e9-b518-0ee41f1cd37e,dark

Everyone seemed so focused on his/her career, including the uni I'm attending. Moreover, Covid prevented me go to pubs or cafes to interact with others.
Whenever walking around the streets, i could see many attractive girls. I dress well, I fit well. As I identify myself as a shy introvert, I always have a courage to ask them out, but I'm always afraid of being rejected. This was originated from one the past memories that I had. Getting detailed, I liked one of my friends a lot but turned out she had a boyfriend and my mind shattered. She realized I liked her, then she left from my friendzone. After that, I couldn't eat about a week and couln't sleep properly. I had this memory from my home country(S.korea) and I don't care about it anymore anyways.



 Of course i cannot ask them straightly like ""Are you single"" etc on the streets. I mean I should do some efforts to interact with other torontonians, and I still am doing. But I still haven't had a chance to get to know other women, and craving some intimacy which could build the future together.
I've been trying tinder, meanwhile, the match results were unsatisfying

This is my long description posted on several reddit websites. Hopefully I can get some dating advices.



After the longevity of covid, I'm looking to get out of my tedious life and try new things. Got out from helicopter parents and living in DT toronto, I regard this moment as an appropriate timing for this. 

I'm 24, 5'11"", Asian(Korean) int'l student, Double vaxxed, currently sparing my time from school. I've been spending my time preparing school, and currently taking summer courses. Been shy, but I really like meeting other people. 
I love grabbing cold fizzy drinks and wandering around the city with trams, watching theatres. I don't really go to parties or pubs but I go to parks or campus to relieve myself from the heatwave. I'm listening to instrumental pop musics with earphones nowadays cuz it's hard to allow myself to go to heavily crowded places.

I also enjoy skiing, walking along the beach and trailing around the city. If allowed to, I'd pack my luggages and planned my details for the trip. 

As always, I've been thinking it would be great to share the adventures such as delicious fun🔥😏 and try something new. I'm also down to have a romantical style partner to go on fun dates with and enjoy a deep convo at cafes and get to know each other.

This is a thing I don’t think she’d stop talking to me for. Idk if I actually like her or if it’s a nonsexual fantasy that I have. I mean sometimes I just want to kiss the fire out of her if that’s not too bold to say (not that I would just randomly do so). Today I kind’ve wanted to get her flustered so I told her “has anyone ever told you how INCREDIBLY (I emphasized that) beautiful, I am. Because I’m just awesome”. It wasn’t awkward or anything but she just didn’t say anything. Kind’ve worried that my mind glossed over how bad that was but usually I know when somethings that awkward. Anyways is there anything I should try to look for or test the waters because for some reason I have a desire to make her like me. Also do you think I like her or just have thoughts of her?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1005785,public,self,I (M17) think I might have something for my best friend (F16),0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pnss60/i_m17_think_i_might_have_something_for_my_best/,all_ads,6,,,

In my first relationship (M) for the past 5 months or so. Hung out with another work colleague recently; we have a lot in common, value-wise and interest-wise. I'm not very good at picking up flirting cues, so I went into the day thinking that it was just as a regular hang out. In the back of my mind, I told myself that if things were to turn in a romantic sense, I would have to let her know and set the boundaries. I would like to get to know her better as friends given our similar values. Anyways, we end up hanging out for the whole day. She invites me back to her place and we are chatting on her couch. I'm starting to realize that she is probably thinking this day was more of a date rather than ""get to know each other as friends"" situation. Anyways, we drive back to my apartment and in the car I end up directly asking her whether she liked me in that romantic sense. She ended up saying yes, and I let her know I was in a relationship but that I would love to still get to know her as friends. She ended up asking if I liked her at all in a romantic way. Throughout the day, I had developed some attraction to her, so I let her know that yes, I had some romantic interest but that wasn't going to go anywhere at the present moment. We left it off as - sure, we can still hang out, but with the friend boundaries.

Anyways, two questions for a newbie at dating/relationships:

1) Can I simply be friend with someone of an opposite sex while I'm in a relationship, even when both of us have at least some romantic interest in one another? I know I can set boundaries and that it would never be crossed.

2) Should I tell my current partner about what happened (not that anything actually happened, we just hung out). My gut says I should, but at the same time I realize my current partner is very anxious about everything and has low confidence; she has also been cheated on before. So I'm thinking that if I tell her, she would make it more than it actually was. If I were her, I'd actually appreciate it and trust my partner more for telling me, but I'm not sure in this case.

He had all the green flags—I won’t list them because I’m not trying to start a debate. But I will say he made me genuinely laugh when it feels like so many guys are so busy trying to get sex they hardly have a personality. We had so much in common and he kept fawning over it. We even have the same tattoo in the same spot. He asked me to hang out again the very next day. Told me he liked me and was very genuine. Even admitted he paid money to rematch because I missed the time window. Like it is very rare for me but I was so genuinely attracted to him even tho he didn’t check all my physically boxes. (He was super cute by short for instance) 

Then today when we’re lowkey discussing sex I inform him that I don’t have casual sex. It wasn’t like “IM NOT FUCKING YOU” it was a very covert convo about our intentions and such. So, he drops the bomb that he got divorced after a TEN YEAR relationship that started when he was 16. Not sure when exactly. 

Basically he says while he had a fantastic time and absolutely is interested in me, he wants to have a ho phase instead. 

And I’m just honestly shocked how someone could shut down such a great connection for the streets. Especially with how savage they are these days. Every day I wish I could take back my home days because they honestly traumatized me. 

But I guess it’s different for men?

I feel sympathy but I can’t get over the nagging feeling that he was just trying to get sex from me and doesnt have the game to finesse it like most app veterans. 

Needless to say, I deleted all my dating apps immediately. I honestly cannot suffer through another second of the disappointment online dating brings. 

At this point im reevaluating if I could ever even see myself having a long term partner because at this point it feels like everyone esp on apps is rebounding or just being a ho (even in their mid thirties) and no one wants anything substantial.

We'd talk every day and go out for hours and we really enjoyed each others company. I wanted to know if anything had progressed. So I kept lurking here searching for old posts until I realized I just had to be honest and open.

So I decided to be clear about how I felt and my expectations (being okay with going slow, but still interested romantically). And after a bit of back and forth, it was clear that she was still not ready, but also just wanted to be friends.

I have to be honest it hurt a lot to hear it. It was also hard to say that I wanted to move on and not cling on to any false hope. I know I will be glad eventually that I brought it up rather than just continuing not really knowing how she felt.

Anyway, I know this post wasn't looking for advice specifically, but if anyone ever finds this and is in my situation not really knowing how the other person feels, hopefully you will find the heart to just talk to the them.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1005865,public,self,"I told her how I felt and she didn't feel the same.

I was born with autism, so I’m naturally less adept at relationships. From what I’ve seen, there seems to be this “free pass” awarded to guys who are arrogant and/or conventionally attractive. I’ve seen these guys belittle their girlfriends, take advantage of their trust, etc. And yet, women often choose to remain with them. I’ve seen so many women complain about this continual mistreatment but wanting advice on Reddit and other social media apps on changing them so they can stay together. I have never been on a date, or even held hands with a girl. Why am I never even given a chance to date? Why am I automatically seen as lesser than?

I know what this sounds like; it sounds like I feel that I’m entitled. And that girls should just throw themselves at me because I’m such a rare gift, right? The thing is, I am prepared to put in the work. I am prepared to love and support whoever I’m lucky enough to be with. However, I (along with many other “lower class” men) am not allowed a seat at the table. Whereas, it seems, that even if these arrogant and rude men are throwing tantrums and throwing their food on the floor, they are still allowed to eat at the table. They aren’t put in time-out; they are simply told off for being rude. How does that change their behaviour?

Two weeks ago, me and my male friend both went to the same gym where he had a training session with my personal trainer, I was just training on my own, maybe 20 feet away from them, the personal trainer didn’t know he’s my friend.

About 5 minutes later, the personal trainer looked at me for 3 seconds and told my friend “Hey low key, but I have an Asian fetish”, my friend didn’t say anything back, but told me after we got out of the gym. At that time, I was the only Asian girl in that area.

I’m very confused because this trainer has been treating me super duper normal, never make any extra conversation with me, leave the area after we’re done for a session. Lately, he changed time on my training session 3 times in a row, so I asked him whether he can coordinate better with me on time wise…
