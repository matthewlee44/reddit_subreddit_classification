0,rdcd4m,1639153608,Fell in love with a girl that i will probably never see again. Really need help thanks.,"Hi everyone, i (M 25), fell in love for a girl (22) that i will probably not see again.

I'm currently working in Norway for a sort of cultural exchange in a small farm, hosted by a Norwegian family.
This girl is Austrian and we arrived here pretty much during the same period and, even tho i've met maaany other people during this experience, i just can't get her off my mind. We have so much fun together, i make her laugh a lot and she does too, i feel very comfortable with her and we really understand each other a lot. I've started to feel this very strong connection after getting to know her better and i know it may sound stupid but i really, really didn't want this. After some bad things that happened to me, i just wanted to focus on my life and that's why i'm doing this experience. But it happened, and now i'm struggling a lot with this.

One month ago, she left this place to go work somewhere else  for a couple of weeks and we were talking a lot on the phone via messages, and after awhile for me it was ok just like that.

But now, a couple of days ago she came back here and she's going to stay here up until next Monday, then she's going to go back to Austria for good.
I wasn't 100% sure of what i was feeling, but now, after a couple of days together after she came back, i feel like i REALLY, REALLY like her, and i just like so much being with her, making her laugh, working with her and everything else.

The only problem is that she's a very ""direct"" person and not very open about her feelings or emotions in general (i hope i explained well what i mean) and it's SO DAMN hard to tell what she's thinking or how she feels, i've never struggled so much with anyone before.

I really don't know what to do and also i only have a couple of days left since her departure, i just really need some advice.

Thanks in advance for reading my story and sorry for the length of the post.

4,rdd2fg,1639155525,Advice to any guy dating a nurse,"DON’T DO IT.  Coming from someone who has dated one and who has also worked in an ER, Everyday I watch these nurses come to work and blatantly disrespect their SO.  The majority of them are married with kids.  They get home from work and say “sorry I didn’t text you all day, it was SO BUSY and stressful.” When in reality their 12 hr shift consisted of 3 hrs of actual pt care, 3 hrs of internet searches, and 6 hrs of flirting with/arranging side dick with their male coworkers and the ambulance crews. I feel so horrible for these poor clueless husbands at home who are so proud to be married to a “hero,” when in reality they’re getting cheated on and played.  Everybody they work with knows their married, nobody cares.  The culture they work in supports this kind of behavior and they are absolutely a part of this when you are not around. There truly is a “what happens at work, stays at work” mentality.  So my advice is to stay clear of this. And if you absolutely cannot live without her, then stay on high alert.  Snapchat-bathroom break Snapchat’s of her ass are not just for you, they’re also for her male coworkers.  when they show up home from work 2-4 hrs late and say “I got stuck in a code,” that is most likely not the case. And always remember, having a stressful job is never an excuse for cheating or treating your loved one with disrespect.

7,rddbg1,1639156147,screwed up potential relationship with anxiety,"I've been seeing this guy for about month Things were moving slow but seemed good. His work schedule had been pretty busy so we hadn't been able to see each other that often and I had suggested hanging out at one of our houses so it could be more relaxed. We had only had dinner dates and I felt like I wasn't getting a chance to get to know him.

But then I started overthinking, we've only gone as far as a kiss and I got myself really nervous. Due to a new medicine, I've gained weight and am not comfortable with
my body right now in anyway. The thought of him coming over and things potentially leading somewhere more intimate freaked me out because I didn't want him to see my body. (I understand this is necessary for things to move forward but it's hard to rationalize with anxiety sometimes). So I cancelled on him blaming it on my anxiety and now I feel like I ruined a potentially good thing. He was understanding and said he wanted me to feel comfortable but when I brought up potentially rescheduling he hasn't replied since. 

Has anyone ever dealt with this? How did you overcome it? I'm mad at myself for just not going through with the date but I just couldn't do it.

14,rddt0h,1639157439,I’m scared this second time around might be the same. . .,"So all my previous post are about this same guy. In them I explained what happened when I met him  and our current situation.

Which I will be seeing him this Sunday for the first time after two months of being ghosted.
Long story shot he called me on Monday and explained and apologized for the way that it happened. He said he was a jerk for leaving without a word and that there was a lot going on with his life at that time (school and work) he’s (22M) and I am (20F) 

The thing is, leading up to the ghosting previously- he had always sucked at texting. I am not the type to really care as I am also a bad texter and have a busy life. So I more than anyone can understand when life gets in the way. Hell I don’t even need that constant mindless back in forth all day every day. I understand that he has a life and he’s busy just as I am. And I couldn’t be happier that he has his own goals and aspirations that he’s working towards.

But then it would kind of stay getting ridiculous at least personally when he wouldn’t reach out for 2-3 days then hit me up and ask to go on a date. 
How could I be his everything in person. And also be absolutely no one as soon as I’m out of sight??? 

Then the night before I got ghosted when I brought up my concerns and communicated with him, he himself acknowledged that it washes lack of texting and communicating. I had told him that I understood he had a life and was busy so if he needed spaces to figure out what he wanted I would give it. I said that if he wanted to date other people to figure it out I would understand. He said there was nothing that would scare him away and blah blah blah. Ghosting happened and now he’s back 2 months later. 

My current concern after having come down from cloud 9 of him reaching out, is that he’s more or less the same with communication. Since Monday he has texted me twice and proceeds to take full days to reply. In my head I’m thinking “you’d think you’d try a little more this time around, especially with how apologetic he was and how much he said he missed me and couldn’t stop thinking about me”

I really really do like this guy, if I’m honest he’s my ideal partner. It just he confuses me when he does that. I’m I expecting to much? And if I’m not how do I have a healthy discussion about my expectations from him this time around? Because I don’t want to feel like his all maybe twist a week and then feel forgotten for the rest of it. Also how do we discuss him leaving those two months? He was very vague on the phone call and I didn’t quite understand his reasons. 
I do, I want to work on this with him but I don’t want to scared him alway. He had told me that his last relationship of six months moved too fast that his ex was already talking about marriage and that he is being more careful this time around when it comes to getting into a relationship. Which I completely understand. I’m in absolutely no hurry either so it works out.

In my real life i saw some women cheating on thier husband.

 Because of all this negative information my brain is becoming hardwired to not trust girls  and restricting me to not fall in love. i am afraid to date attractive girls because i think that the more attractive they are, the more likely they are to cheat on me because they can pull 100 better guys than me.

I had been talking with this girl I met on tinder the last couple days and was about ready to ask her on a date when she stopped responding. Normally I brush it off. but she ticked so many boxes for me, so this one hurt a little extra. I feel like I am a great communicator, and the conversation seems to be going well. I am asking a lot of questions but they are matching my energy. Then they just stop responding. I don’t get it.

I have a SUPER solid friend group that is always hyping me up (which is great) but Its super frustrating not having that equate to girls as well. I have standards but they aren’t anything outlandish at all.

3 of my best friends are getting married next year and I feel like i am going to be missing out on a big part of life if I dont enter the dating pool soon.. i have tried dating apps and trying new things in social settings; but nothing works. I get it, im only 21 but man is it frustrating..

23,rdfmi5,1639162334,im a walking paradox (story time) 23M,"i just got the idead to share my thoughts and story this with this subreddit so that i could vent about this a little bit and hopefully just learn from you guys aswell. I don’t see much cases like mine here and on reddit in general. Im what most people would consider “hot”. Not super model hot , but hot. Im tall , athletic, good at flirting and talking in general. I party a lot, and usually hook up with girls casually very easily. It took some time to get here , i was naturally shy and not a confident guy, so it took some time. Now here’s the catch. I’ve had a crush / girl i like for the past 6 months wich made my life a little weird. Im not amazing at sex. Never was in a relationship with sex involved since my last relationship ended when i was 19 and i only lost my virginity at the day i celebrated my 20 years of age. We had sexual interactions like oral and stuff but no actual sex. Part of it was our inexperience and her having some troubles opening up sexually to me. That led to some sexual frustration and low sexual confidence despite having a good attitude towards sex and a high libido. Fast forward to today, i have a semi high body count, especially since i only lost my virginity 2 and 1/2 years ago. And while i had high sexual confidence at times, i was never able to actually do it with frequency, and with someone that helped me and gave me the confidence and experience to be casually good at sex. Most of the girls ive been with was a one night stand, and the ones i had sex more then once i eventually lost interest or vice versa. So lets get to the actual problem. There’s this girl ive been talking to for the past year or so. Since the first month of talking we always had a rly high sexual chemistry, she had a boyfriend, we couldn’t meet but it was obvious that we wanted to fuck the shit out of each other. She broke up with him , and since she was from a bit far away we couldnt get Together that easily. The sexual tension was immense, exchanging nudes almost every day, “virtual sex” , and all kinds of things, i had days in wich i spent like 3h masturbating and trading nudes because i just couldn’t get enough of it. And it never got old, this went on for 2/3 months. Until we eventually went on a “date” for the first time, the sexual tension, the antecipation, the hopes for the best sex of our lives was off the roof. She had told me sometimes before that she had the fear of not being up to my standards and i always stated that that wasnt a problem, i wasnt going to leave her even if it wasn’t good because i actually liked her, and expected the same off of her. She had never came with sex, even masturbation, she was only ever to cum with vibrators or on the shower, and there were high hopes that i could make her cum. The sex wasn’t that good, i was completly stoned , was able to actually last a lot of time but she didnt cum and the sex itself wasnt amazing. With most of the girls i was with before her, that would be more than enough, and i know that for a fact, but not with her. She had a long relationship and lost her virginity way younger than me, she Didnt have as many bodies but had much more experience in actually having sex. But since she knew i had a lot of bodies, she thought i would be a sex machine, wich i am not (yet)(despite me telling her that i wasn’t). Since then we never had sex again, hooked up 2 more times but never actually had sex again, and both of those times she regretted us hooking up again because “it doesnt feel right”. The thing is, and i know this may sound really bad, im way over her league, i have plenty of girls inviting me to come over but i just cant do it. Its like that Kobe Bryant quote “Jobs not finished”. I still think that the job is not finished with her. Last tuesday on a night out some girl i hooked up randomly with asked for my number and was texting me all night to come over, and she was hot, really hot, all my friends were calling me dumb for not caring but i just didnt feel like it. My sexual confidence has come down to absolute crap, i do everything well, and if she just wants to give me a bj in the back of some shady spot and some finger play im totally chill about it , but when it comes to coming over and having sex, im worried to disappoint. Im actually more prone to have random sex in the middle of nowhere than coming over to a girls house because somehow the standards are a lot lower and i can actually not stress as much. Last time i actually came over to a girls house was 1 month ago, i was drunk and high , and i had to think about that one girl to get hard, and eventually (while hard) just lost interest and left. I just lost that sexually confident self i was before. The girl i like (the jobs not finished one) , is 19 (so 4 years younger) , wich even makes it harder to think that i couldnt make her stick around. We get together , meet sometimes and talk all day over text , she really likes me , and she tells me that im hot and that she would really fuck me but that it just “doesn’t” work. She even admits that im out of her league and that she doesnt understand why i stick around when i have no problem just moving to another girl. The thing is, shes sexually active , and the guys she fucks, even her friends Tell her they are way worse that me, but she still fucks them over me. Its like i had this girl i liked, and Part of it was our sexual connection and the way we just got along and wanted to fuck 24/7 and couldn’t, and now i don’t have that Part anymore, the physical side of our relationship has basically vanished. And that trips me out because i miss that , never been hornier in my life than when we had that.

While this mentality has brought me a lot of casual hook ups since i literally dont give a fuck about any other girl other than her, and that obsviously is attractive to a lot of girls, im stuck being a “bad boy” to most girls and then turning into an absolute puppy around her. 

For me, the job is just not finished.

And yeah, i do like her aswell, like romantically, but i know that is even more complex than actually having sex with her.

Tldr: girls want to fuck me but i dont, i just want that one girl. that girl has made my sexual confidence go to an all time low because she stopped wanting me sexually after the first time we had sex.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rdfmi5/im_a_walking_paradox_story_time_23m/

She’s a foreign exchange student from Japan at my school and we’ve been dating for about two months. I asked her what she wanted to Christmas and she heavily hinted at earrings. She said she likes a surprise so I don’t want to ask exactly what she wants.

My sister doesn’t wear jewelry and my mom is almost 50 so not really in the teenage style. I have no clue about jewelry, or what types, or where to buy from. I was wondering if any ladies (or guys I guess) could help me in the right direction. I don’t have a lot of money to spend on this so I’m hoping I can get something good.

This girl is amazing and I know she would appreciate anything I gave her but I just want to get something she likes. She loves ice cream and cinnamon so I’ll incorporate that too if I can.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rdfqr7/how_to_buy_earrings_for_girlfriend/

But lately things have felt distant, she's been texting me less often and I recently saw that she edited her bio on Tinder yesterday when I decided to peep her account. I really like this girl, and I thought she really liked me as well; we have some great chemistry together and I'd hate for it to all slip away because I was focused on playing it cool and afraid of sending a third text in a row. 

Bottom line how do I make her mine without being so clingy that I drive her away?

It's the closest thing I've had to a long term relationship, and she knows as such. When we met, I told her that I was in a place after dating of looking to focus on myself and figure out my anxieties and insecurities before pursuing a meaningful relationship. She said she was in a similar place and we can just take things slow without talking about our future. 

She's posted a few pictures of us together on her social media and I haven't said anything about it, but it triggers this really intense anxiety that I think is definitely a me problem. I'd like to do the healthy thing here and talk to her about it but she isn't doing anything weird, wrong or harmful - it's strictly my own insecurities and anxiety that are wrapped around it. 

I think I need time when seeing someone before posting 'us' on instagram and social media. In fact, I've re-evaluated my experience with social media and my best use of instagram is when I just use it to curate things for myself that I like about myself (travels/explorations/etc) outside of other people. I think the anxiety stems from if/when things go wrong, and having it all public. There is also this weird fear I have of people knowing about/talking about my romantic life? 

Just wondering if anyone has experienced something similar - if they prefer privacy while dating someone and still figuring out how you are together. It's not like she's posting ""glad I found you &lt;3"" type pictures - they're honestly harmless pictures that I'd post with platonic girl friends I wasn't sleeping with :S 

There's a deeper seated thing here to address at some point about me being scared that she likes me more than I like her, and I'm with her just because I'm really lonely and she's cute and cool and one of the first women I've met where it's never been a question if they like me and want to be with me.

I'll go first

I will go first, went on a date with a girl from my English class, we went to the cinema the first time and it went well. So we went on a 2nd date. I let her choose the movie. She choose cats. It was just us and one other couple who were way at the front. I thought this was just gonna be a date at the movies, but no, she decided to jerk me off during the movie. I may add this was out of fucking nowhere. Awkward part was I was in such a state of shock that the movie calmed me down cause she was stressing me the fuck out. May add was the worst jerk hand job I have ever got.

2nd worst date was with a girl I met off tinder, I am from the UK, her from Venezuela. She had just moved recently but claimed to speak good English, she was very attractive and was into me so we met up, awkward thing was she couldn't speak a fucking word of English, so I had to try to talk to a girl who I couldn't really talk to. I had to get a friend to text me ""Yo Jacks girl just went into labour get your ass to the hospital"" also may add she could read good English. I felt bad but same time it was uncomfortable as fuck.

3rd worst date experience was far better and not so bad just abit bad. So it was me and my current girlfriend of over a years date. Went shopping and then went to get food. So we are just there sat waiting on our food having a good time chatting away. until a couple sit in the booth behind us. our waiter came with our food, but she threw my fries at the guy. turned out he was her boyfriend on a date with the waiters cousin.

Ever since my first and last ""high school"" date. I didn't come concerned about love or romance or dating. But it only resulted me to be alone and not actually going out there and finding new poeple.

This has been going on for years on and ever since last year, I've been online dating with apps and paying from time to time for girls to see me. It doesn't work, only a miracle would be possible even then it's highly likely it would be a mistake to swipe for me.

I'm known for being kind, big and have a weirdo type of  personality. And I just don't think women online or properly in person won't accept. They probably want a ""real man"" to be with them forever and have children. I on the other hand don't want to be married or have children. And I think that alone has cut majority of potential dates away only because I made a choice in my own right. I'm not saying this to target anyone. But I just feel like love is only getting in the way of life. It's like James Bond, you can get close but not top close. I can't even make a proper introduction. I'm known to be shy. And girls around me all seem to be 3 things. Taken. Uninterested or just plain cruel in teasing you and wanting you to burn.

I will be honest and say I missed being with someone you love, but at the same time it doesn't go right. But right now it's mostly because I'm online and not in person
but I'm afraid I won't be lucky, the world is cruel and I have accepted that.

The first time she mentioned him I completely ignored that part of the message hoping she’d get the hint and stop.

The second time she mentioned him she told me how he would become really aggressive and yell at her. I just told her I was sorry she went through that and assured her I’m a very passive guy and don’t like conflict and generally wouldn’t raise my voice.

The third time she mentioned him was on the first date. She just said something like “he took me to a G-League basketball game and it was the best date I ever been on. What was yours?” So I just answered it honesty and suggested maybe she needs to experience an NBA game (we live in a city with a team).

The fourth time she mentioned him I straight up asked her “When did you guys break up, are you not over this guy or something?” And she said she’s completely over him and she still talks to him “out of respect”.

So overall, I'm relatively naive to a lot of the world of dating, but I think I've handled myself pretty well--I'm generally good at spotting problematic behaviors, and don't accept poor treatment from men I've been on dates with. I've got my life together pretty well (good job, own house, a variety of hobbies, volunteer), and am pretty self-assured and confident. Generally, I've had pretty good luck dating in general, and have had above average luck with online dating. Essentially, I feel like my ""picker"" is pretty decent, and I've had flings with some genuinely great guys and a defined relationship with another great guy. 

A pattern has emerged that has me really confused, and I'm wondering if I could get some insight into it. So far, I've been very into two guys. 

The first was a situationship, where we hung out weekly for about 4 months. He initiated things, and came on very strong at first. I was getting close to saying I love you, he told me he thought I was the one... and then when I asked about exclusivity, he said he just ""wasn't ready for a relationship."" I ended things after that, not willing to be anybody's second choice and essentially feeling like I'd been love bombed and actions weren't aligning with words. Of course, at the time, I held onto hope that he'd change his mind about things when I was no longer around. As is standard, after I ended it, there was no contact. Until about 1.5 months later, when he started texting me again and checking in. I was annoyed, but was pretty much over him, so agreed to be on friendly terms. And that's essentially what is was--friendly texting. He'd encounter my new online profiles, and say things like ""those pictures don't do you justice"" or would tell me how the guys online aren't deserving of me. Lots of ""you're too good everyone"" and ""it's like casting pearls before swine"". I didn't find this particularly hurtful, as I had an easier time getting over him--I'd found a lot of his behavior manipulative and pretty quickly moved to a place where I'd say no if he asked for a relationship. He never did. We haven't seen each other in person for nearly a year, but still he texts every couple of weeks or so. I don't mind it, but it feels weird. 

I thought Guy #1's behavior was a one-off until Guy #2 came around. Like guy #1, we met online. He initiated things for a long time. He said ""I love you"" first, agreed to being exclusive. He did lots of things that made me feel like he was serious about us--we went on lots of weekend trips, he insisted on paying for things, we spent a *lot* of time together. We were together for about 6 months. He moved a couple states away this summer, which ended it. Leading up to the move, I'd initiated a few conversations about how things would go, and he kind of brushed them off, planning to do long distance and telling me that things would ""work themselves out"". Then, of course, he moves, starts getting really distant, and isn't reciprocating my efforts. He then dumps me over text one night. Not unexpected given his behavior immediately before that, but it still hurt. He was my first real boyfriend, and the first person I fell in love with. He'd had a few LTR's before this. In his breakup text, he even told me he loved me, but that distance just wasn't going to work. It hurt, but I understood--he'd just finished grad school, and was starting his real ""adult"" life. I probably would've done the same when I moved after college--sometimes you just need a blank slate. IMMEDIATELY after the breakup, he continued to text me like normal--sending memes and tiktoks like we did before. I told him I needed space, and that it made me feel like he didn't care about what happened between us that he seemed to be moving on so casually. He said he understood, but that he was continuing communication to make sure I was ok because he felt horrible about hurting me and ending things and that he also wasn't over it. He gave me space when I asked for it, until I reached out with a note a month or so later letting him know that I was feeling better and that I hope his life in his new state was going well, knowing that he was probably lonely as he didn't know anybody there and doesn't have many friends. He responded kindly, and I kind of thought that would be it. However, much like guy #1, he continues to text me every couple weeks/month or so. Also like the first guy, he's very complimentary of me and even as he was dumping me, told me how great he thought I was and all that nonsense. Unlike guy #1, I never found him to be manipulative or love-bomb-y or anything. I genuinely believe he's just a good dude. 

It's not so much that I want either of these men back at this point, but I just find this pattern of exes telling me how great I am and then wanting to keep me around in a friendly capacity so strange and painful. My friends all seem to think it's bizarre too. And it almost hurts me *more* than just a regular breakup or rejection would. These guys both know me pretty well, have a continued interest in getting to know me and stay in touch, but despite knowing me, they *still* don't want to date me. Like they say I'm a great person and they're attracted to me and all these things, but apparently I'm just not great enough to date long-term or commit to. It just feels like a really deep-seated, personal rejection, you know? It makes me scared to fall for someone again because I'm worried the pattern will continue--a few months of happiness, followed by rejection and then bread-crumbing. Sorry for the long rant, I just could use any insight into this pattern/their behavior that any of you have.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rdja2c/insight_into_this_pattern_of_men_ive_dated_ending/

70,rdkjoh,1639175514,Am I just someone to practice with?,"19F here, 20M is my crush. We met in class about 1.5 months ago. 

The very first time we hung out, we played lacrosse together. This is because he found out I was on the club team, and he apparently really enjoys playing, so he asked to join me sometime. After that, he asked me to come pick up food with him once. Then, I reciprocated by inviting him to my place for dinner after class. He also started offering to drive me home (I was just walking to campus before). I invited to my place for dinner a second time, and I also asked him then if he wanted to come to my club's formal. He said yes. The night of the dance, we drank and had a great time. We made out during the night, and eventually got back to my room. In my room, we ended up snuggling and talking until 5am or so. The next morning we woke up, and he pulled me in really close. We started making out, and after a few minutes he said ""I'm exhausted. We'll do this later."" We then went back to snuggling, sleeping, and talking for a few more hours. That was this past weekend.

This week, after class he asked me to come play lacrosse with him. Okay cool! We played and...that was that. Nothing romantic or affectionate really. Just playing and hanging out. Then after our last class today, I asked him if he wanted to keep hanging out now that our class together is over (we'd only ever hang out after class besides the dance), and he said yes...let's play lacrosse together weekend.

WTF? After this weekend, I really thought he liked me, even though we didn't have sex. We snuggled and talked for so long. He also made a joke on the night of our dance about being ""my first man"" if I become president (long story, inside joke). He also told me he opened up to me faster than he usually does with people. I guess he said those things while drinking so maybe they aren't true...but really? Am I just a lacrosse buddy now or something? Or is this just his way of spending time together?

71,rdkjyv,1639175536,"Dating someone new after a significant other passed away in 2018... and feeling ""old""","In 2018, my girlfriend passed away. I was 28 and she was 25 at the time. Eventually, friends, family and even her mom encouraged me to move forward and date someone new. I decided to seek therapy before making any moves.

Fast forward to this past summer...

I used to sell phones inside a Walmart store as an associate of OSL Retail Services and there was a cute young lady there. I developed a crush, but was crushed myself when I learned she had a boyfriend. Then, I learned that she is eight years younger than me, which made it feel even more inappropriate.

This past summer, she sent me a Facebook message that said she knew I often say hi to her when I visit that Walmart but I wouldn't find her there anymore because she got a new job after working there 4.5 years.

 I visited her before she quit and she revealed she was single (I remember thinking her 300-lb. ex was a lucky bastard because she was really nice and to add, beautiful). I also remember saying to myself, ""Damn. How did he get a girl like that? I must learn his techniques.""

I was then encouraged by many people to ask her out, so I did, eventually. The woman, however, is 23 and I'm now 31.

As for the lady that I will forever mourn, my new lady friend understands that there are certain anniversaries that are difficult for me (such as tomorrow, when my former SO would have turned 30).

We were getting to know each other as well but his overly aggressive manner when it came to sex threw me off. He wasn’t that aggressive but just made it known he was ready for sex pretty early on. He called me babe earlier too when we only had been talking for a couple days. We aren’t talking anymore because he apologized after asking if he could send me dick pics. All I said in response was that it’s okay.

Am I weird? I feel like I’m not really into sexual things so early on especially if we haven’t went on a date or saw each other in public. I’m just so conflicted as well because my ex broke up with me after I continued to question his loyalty when I shouldn’t have done so. Trying to move on is difficult because my ex was totally different. He never asked for nudes or tried to send me unsolicited pics. 

I would try to once we had been together for awhile but he said he didn’t want any. Are there still guys out there who won’t send dick pics?? Idk I might just be a prude and not into sending nudes of myself or seeing someone else’s. This guy claimed he wanted a relationship but  I don’t think I’m ready fully and he’s throwing up red flags with how horny he’s being. 

I just wish I knew what was normal or not. My relationship with my ex was kinda my first one and we were intimate but not everything lead to sex.

79,rdlmyl,1639178622,How insensible are my dating preferences,"Howdy all, 

People always get surprised when I state my dating preferences to them. They are: female, 6 foot and above and left-handed. I myself am 6""4'-6""-5' and also left handed. How unusual are such criteria? 

I would like to clarify that it is not a sexual attraction to those attributes but purely practical. As left handed people will attest it is quite frustrating living in a right handed persons world. Currently I live with three roommates – all left handed – and have found it much more comfortable and enjoyable than previous arrangements.  Height follows a similar logic. I am simply more comfortable around taller people – all my siblings are above 6"" – and enjoy not having to look down at people constantly. – I have serious neck issues (not visibly noticeable). 

That being said, as a friend pointed out after I turned down a dating opportunity to an attractive, pleasant, individual, that demographic represents roughly .8% of the population. So it is unlikely I will find a compatible person matching those criteria. Should I open myself up to other opportunities? Or should I just keep going with my current route. I am not desperate for a relationship, and, am still in University, but I do feel unusual explaining my logic to people.

Because my friends are all doing couple-y holiday things, and I can’t fault them for that, so I don’t, but damn does this get old. 

I’m 25F. I’ve gotten used to doing things alone due to being single for a decent amount of time and getting bored of only seeing my face everyday, lol. 

Every time I go out, someone (usually married women, for whatever reason) always asks why I’m alone. The most recent example was: “I could never handle the anxiety of going out alone. Do you not have any friends?”

I try to just laugh it off, because I’m sure they mean no harm, but then I sit there thinking “Wow, I must look so lame/weird” when honestly, me taking myself out is currently the only way to get social interaction because my friends are just busy this time of year. (I am actively trying to make new friends on Bumble BFF, so I promise I’m not wallowing without trying to make things better by expanding my group.)

I recently deleted my dating apps because I was just getting tired of it and want to meet someone organically, in person, so maybe it’s my own fault for deleting them but still complaining about this.

87,rdmbzq,1639180665,Guy doesn't flirt in the slightest over messaging; no written evidence?,"It's  a bit embarrassing asking this question so early. But although I had a good first date with a guy, where he held my hands over the table, hugged me and kissed my neck, he has not been the slightest bit flirtatious over messaging. We have a second date arranged for next week. 

I accidentally sent him a kiss emoji instead of a normal smiley face one and he did send a kiss back, but that was it. 

Part of me is worried he is secretly married and not wanting to leave much written evidence. He's obviously not shy about being forwards after all. 

I am just confused. What other reason might someone be demonstrative irl but not over text? He says on his online profile that he fancies a bit of sex (not in those exact words). But he also says he wants his next relationship to last several years. I know the two can be true at the same time. I'm happy to have perhaps ill advised sex til I find the next guy to have a relationship with.

It is driving me mad he isn't flirting, anyway. Could this be his end game? Could he be doing it on purpose? Or is he doing it because he likes me and doesn't want me to think that he's easy, despite him stating that on his profile?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rdmbzq/guy_doesnt_flirt_in_the_slightest_over_messaging/

90,rdmmr2,1639181508,This guy I met on an app recently wants me to send him pictures of myself everyday,I find this such a weird request. He hasn’t asked me out. We have FaceTimed at my request and he seemed cool. We definitely have potential but he’s insisting I send him regular photos of me. Why? He has the photos on my profile to look at. And he can call me or physically see me if he arranges it. Can any guys explain this? I haven’t sent any pictures.

91,rdmp0y,1639181700,I don't know what I can do anymore.,"I don't want this to sound like a cry for help, but I'll be honest I don't know what to do anymore. 

For the past few years I have had a huge lack of self confidence which I've no doubt has had an impact on my dating life, I'm not sure when this or how this started but I can't remember not feeling the way I do. 

My dating life has not been at all successful, I have been stood up a number of times which really took its toll. I have gotten myself into good shape and athletic hoping for better outcomes but again nothing, I have tried  asking the questions /asking for advice from friends which should garner some sort of response. But again I get nothing. So, over the course of time I just became less and less confident in my own self worth. 

However in the past few months I have tried to put that behind me and like myself more, get out there more and put myself out on the likes of tinder, bumble, hinge etc. I have been going to the gym to get myself into decent shape and recognising the things I am good at and I can be proud of. However, in my efforts I have found very little success. And to be blunt I've found this incredible demolarilsing. 

I have a brother who is an incredibly good looking guy (6ft+, good personality, good physique) and he has tried to be a real help to me these past few months saying ""just get out there"" and stuff like that, and to try and make me feel good about myself. However I am realistic to know that I can't compare to him physically. And 90% of these apps just go off looks and nothing else. 

And since I have not had any likes on the apps mentioned above I have to wonder what is the point of all the effort I am putting in to get nothing in return. If I do get a like/match on a dating app I always feel like I'm putting in 100% effort compared to them, and at that point I just stop because why should I expend effort for someone who clearly doesn't care. 

I'm getting to the point of whether I just stop the whole use of these apps and hope for something for the future as at the moment I feel this path is doing more bad for my mental health than it is good. 

I just want to know what's next because as of late I just don't know what to do....",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rdmp0y/i_dont_know_what_i_can_do_anymore/

93,rdmpii,1639181739,"Adult dating, what does the text mean.","Went on one date. We are both in our early 30s. The date was nice in the beginning but it ended awkward. There was mixed signals happening with the flirting. I flirted with him first by touching his back and shoulder, but he didn't respond right away. I backed away. Then later he flirted by putting his hand on my waist while we were on our walk, but I didn't respond right away either. When I did respond it felt awkward. The flirting was going on and off. The night ended with an awkward hug. I texted him the next day saying that I enjoyed the time getting to know him and to go out again sometime. He replied back by saying ""I enjoyed getting time to know you, although for full transparency I feel like I have more of a friend connection with you than a relationship. I don't want to be grey about anything but yeah if you'd like to hang out as friends let me know"". What does this really mean? Some men write this expecting to just move on while other really mean it. I felt like he liked me but he was just bad at flirting and so was I. I want to see him again and get to know him more as friends.  I had never felt like this with anyone! My instinct is telling me he's the one lol and can't let him go. He hasn't text back since that last text. Its been 5 days.   Any advice would be great.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rdmpii/adult_dating_what_does_the_text_mean/

95,rdmrhu,1639181904,Need help/advice,"Hey Guys - have a story I thought I’d share. I went on a date with this girl multiple times and we hooked up after both dates. For the last three months we were talking on and off then for the last month when we finally met we were sending paragraphs back and forth constantly and everything was going great, dates went well etc.

The morning after the 2nd time we hooked up I noticed something small was off but it wasn’t too weird so I didn’t say anything. We texted for a few days after that then she started ignoring me. We didn’t plan a third date right away since we were both traveling these next few weeks between holidays and random trips so is that why she stopped responding because she thought we wouldn’t see each other for a while? It’s been 3-4 days and still haven’t heard from her. 

I also live about a hour away from her which I thought could have something to do with it but I also drove to her since she was in the city. And before we started talking she texted me out of the blue to make a date happen. Just trying to give all the details but why would she randomly ghost me? Is it a test? Ugh she was more into me in the beginning and now I can’t stop thinking about it",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rdmrhu/need_helpadvice/

98,rdn3n3,1639182887,"they didn't want to have sex anymore, did i do something wrong?","i went on a date, a netflix and chill kinda date. we texted back and forth for about a week and i thought about it, got really excited for it. when i got there my anxiety was through the roof, and i don't know if that turned him off. he must've noticed. maybe i said something stupid. maybe this new setting let him see my face a bit clearer and i wasn't for him anymore. we initially started cuddling and caressing each other in a cute way. i was expecting him to make the first move, but something fizzled out. we weren't really responding to each other physically somehow. i kept talking during the movie which he seemed annoyed at, moved around a lot because i was anxious and didn't know how to comfortably lay against him. i also do this thing where i act intentionally clueless but in a way where they're in on the joke and he got annoyed with that too. maybe our energies didn't clash well and that's it. and i get that people can draw their own boundaries and stuff, but i really felt like i ruined everything with my stupid anxiety.

he said he wasn't in the mood because he was tired all day and even wanted to call off the night earlier but didn't know how. i really want to believe that. i really also wish he is able to communicate to me if he's not feeling down for a date ever again in the future, or if a certain day isn't working out for him. because then i go into it with my best foot forward and i realize that the person didn't want to be there to begin with. he said something that kind of stuck with me. we were discussing some of our own bad experiences and patterns within dating and he said that he didn't owe anything to anyone, especially people he didn't know that well. and i felt like this was an indirect comment for me, because at the end of the day i guess it's hard to reject someone with all this pretense built up, to their face. i'm willing to take his word for now. but god i just really feel like i fucked it up somehow! and i feel so stupid for it!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rdn3n3/they_didnt_want_to_have_sex_anymore_did_i_do/
