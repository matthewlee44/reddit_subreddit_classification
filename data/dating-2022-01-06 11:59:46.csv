With that in mind, I don't think she's over her ex and i don't think she's truly investing in our relationship. With those feelings, I'm also on the edge in terms of investment and am starting to realize that she won't be coming around any time soon.

I know honesty and transparency is important, but with this relationship really not even feeling legit, I'm sort of starting to feel like i won't go to hell if i actively start seeking others, and in the process, just fade off of this.

If you downvote me, please explain why, but don't come at me just because I sound like some coldhearted guy.

Not sure if this should go here or like relationship advice, but just wanted to hear your guys thoughts on the matter.

I’ve been dating this guy for a month and everything with him is going great.

The problem is that my friends like to make jokes about his height. He is 5’7 and I’m 5’4 for reference so neither of us are like super short.

Maybe I’m being too sensitive since the jokes aren’t being directed at me, but I’m not sure if I should address the jokes with my friends or just leave it alone. I know my bf is pretty indifferent to it.

I’m just unsure what to do in this situation. I feel its pretty rude to make fun of anyones appearance, but don’t want to overstep boundaries to speak up on behalf of my bf if he doesn’t feel the need to.

So would appreciate hearing your guys thoughts on this matter.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rxlbqp/should_i_address_this/
6,rxlf1f,1641493897,Do you think double standards apply equally to both genders?,"I always see things like ""I want a guy who is X amount tall, makes X amount of money, yadda yadda"", and it seems to be perfectly acceptable. But when a guy talks about ""I want a girl to weight X amount of weight, have X amount in cup size"", it's OMG MISOGINY

It just makes no logical sense to my brain that expectations can only be 1-sided. If you TRULY (and I put that in caps because it's the important word here), if you TRULY cared about dating and getting to know someone for who they are, your expectations would be tossed completely out the window. Because the perfect ideal image of our fantasy man/woman doesn't exist. Everyone is flawed. But the fact is, we aren't like that. We have expectations and things that we want and like, and it affects and guides our judgement on a consistent basis.

If you're attracted to a guy who is 6'4"", great. And you don't want to date anyone shorter than that, great.

7,rxligr,1641494143,Dating as a moderately conservative atheist...,"I'm in the south for context. I know I'm in a tiny niche of people since the majority of atheists seem to be left leaning, some very aggressively so, while I'm... not. I'm very libertarian, but can't call myself liberal and if you took an average of my views on things I'd probably be considered conservative. Like most I'm liberal on some topics and conservative on others though. Point being, I feel like I'm automatically excluded from some people who lean my way politically because I'm not religious, while those who I'd largely agree with on religion would exclude me based on politics. 

For example, one girl I went on a date with brought up politics (date 1) and kept saying she voted straight ticket Democrat and made it obvious that politics mattered a lot, while I said that I wasn't really into it these days, which I'm sure she took as me being conservative and hiding it, which was partly true but also because it was a first date and I didn't want to get into politics/religion yet... There wasn't a date 2. Also dated a girl for a couple months that was religious, but didn't go to church or anything until after we were dating and she started to act like she wanted to get more serious about religion, said her partner being a godly man was important, etc. That relationship ended because she cheated, but was also doomed based on religious differences...

How would y'all suggest going about meeting people? I'm tired of getting 3 dates in and finding out deal breakers... Or dating a religious person who I figure is fine dating a non-believer only for that to change...

The last straw for our relationship was when I accepted free lunch from a friend who I “should’ve known that he was just trying to fuck me.” I’ve just been running with that mentality more or less since several other men confirmed that my ex was right

Then I befriended a guy from work. Seemed to compliment me often, would randomly buy me coffee, etc. We had a conversation about working out and I mentioned that I wanted to be more active. He offered to coach me. I figured he had feelings or something and asked about it. He got really angry and called me “self-absorbed.” We haven’t talked since, doesn’t help that we no longer work the same shifts. I tried apologizing once but he ignored me.

23,rxmwfv,1641497727,MY CRUSH WENT MIA. Would you check up on them?,"Long story::: incominnnng

-------------------

My gym (trainer) crush and I have been back and forth for months now. 

We interacted a bit during lessons, and there was definitely a vibe. But I'd say we both seem nervous and it's hard to have a private conversation at the gym (it's a busy).

We matched on Bumble about three times now lol. I deleted it, he deleted it, then I ended up reaching out via insta after the third match.

He actually added me on insta about a week prior. Just after the announcement of a full lockdown (aka no gym classes). So I thought I'd shoot my shot and send a DM.

Basically said, hey saw you on tinder again.. if you want to hangout sometime hmu.

He said he wanted to, but would be out of town for December to babysit a cat and be home for the holidays (confirms, he was out of town). When he was back though, he wanted to hangout. Heard via my friend, who attended his gym classes long before I did and heard it from him, that he was struggling with his health and the lockdown came in clutch.

We chatted back and forth every few days and stayed in touch via ig throughout December. He repeated he wanted to hangout when he was back. The day after Christmas, his ig profile was deactivated. Huuuuh. And no, I wasn't blocked for sure.

He doesn't resurface until this past weekend.
First, he shows up in my bumble and swiped right on me (I have premium). I didn't swipe left or right and just left it hahah. Didn't know what to do. He still wasn't back on ig. A couple days later he was off bumble, but popped back up on insta. A couple more days later, he's back on bumble and swipes on me again lmao! I didn't match (and accidentally swiped left actually hahah).

It feels like odd behaviour. I've also observed his ig and bumble profile change up quite a few times since we've been in touch (clearing of photos, bio, profile pics). His health shit, that I ofc googled with my friend, is mostly physically related can also mildly influence mental health. I observed similar behaviours in my first boyfriend, he got anxious and insecure sometimes. 

Kinda just want to know if the dudes ok, but I feel like I've already been quite forward... Honestly don't even know if he's a good dude or not. Seems like it, but I have no idea.

He could of just told me before going MIA, but also, would you tell the person youve been chatting with/interested in but barely know?

-------- THE QUESTION ---------

Do I reach out via Instagram??? (a more subtle match on bumbles off the table because of my accidental left swipe haha). 

What the ef would you say? 

What id say:

""Duude you're alive. All good?""

Hahaha.

Or would you just leave it at this point. It's so weird.

28,rxneyg,1641499056,Here's how to find the right person for you: 5 golden rules.,"Some posts on this subreddit are about people not being able to find the right person, getting disappointed in dating, losing faith in dating, and so on. So I'm writing this post to share how can you turn this around and find the right person for you. 

**Why should you listen to me?**

Well, you don't have to. But for what it's worth, I was in the same position for years, I was convinced that I was ""undatable"" and I will die alone. That changed. To be completely transparent, I'm single. But I'm single by choice. I had a breakup last year and since then I have decided to stay single, not actively pursue love until someone comes knocks me off my feet. One more thing, I'm not a dating guru or so, I'm just a person like you. 

So here goes...

Finding the right person is simple and hard at the same time. So to navigate this complexity of life, I came up with a few rules that can help. 

**Rule#1: If you want to find true love, you have to first love yourself.** 

For years, I dismissed myself, secretly despised myself and my features. I was insecure about my build, my height, my skin color, smile, and much more. On top of that, I wasn't treating myself with love. I would say things like I'm boring, or what I do isn't cool, etc. If you relate to this, the first rule is for you. You have to love yourself first. If you can't love yourself, how do you expect other people to love you? Start with treating yourself right and falling in love with who you are. Others will see this and will be attracted to you. 

**Rule#2 Don't chase after love. Let it come to you.** 

The more I ran after love, the more it ran away from me. I didn't realize that I was coming off as needy and desperate while I was chasing love. When I stopped chasing love and made a decision to be me, focus on myself, my goals, and my hobbies, suddenly there were women interested in me. Women I would previously consider out of my league. So when you stop chasing love and focus on yourself, others see you as the confident independent who doesn't need anyone else to be happy and that attracts people towards you. 

**Rule#3 It's not about who you are. It's about what's it like to be around you.**

I used to think of my build, height, skin color, and other features for my so to say lack of attraction. But boy I was wrong. It's about who you are or what you look like, it's about what is it like to be around you. If you exhibit positive energy and fun vibes, people would love to hang out with you and be around you. In order to be a fun and positive person to be around, you have to be interesting, and to be interesting, you have to be interested in yourself, your life, and your hobbies. 

**Rule#4 Don't emotionally over-invest.**

If I could choose one rule out of any of these to stick with, it'll be this one. I used to meet women, and then immediately fall in love with them. This mindset leads to being too available, too needy, and too unattractive. When you meet someone, fight against your inner desire to emotionally over-invest in them. Treat them as just another person. Don't text because you're bored, text because you have something to banter about. Don't be too free to meet. Propose a date, if they can't then let them counter with a different date. If it doesn't work out after a few days of talking or the first date, move on. 

**Rule#5 Don't go with the flow. Be the flow.**

I was so afraid of where the road will take me when everything inside me was telling me to stop chasing others and focus on myself. I was afraid of dying alone and looking around at other people being in happy relationships while being single. Don't be afraid of where the road will take you. Instead, concentrate on the first step towards your own journey. Taking the first step is the hardest part but that's what you are responsible for. You'll be surprised how your life will turn out after that. 

**Bonus Rule: Don't worry about things not in your control.**

You can't change the weather and just like that, you can't change what others think of you. Be you and don't worry too much about what others think of you or say about you. 

&amp;#x200B;

I hope this helps you find what you are looking for. Feel free to ask any questions. I'll be happy to answer.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rxneyg/heres_how_to_find_the_right_person_for_you_5/

31,rxnnlw,1641499659,I’m too ashamed to date because I feel so ugly- mainly due to bad teeth,"I’m 31 and non-binary, assigned male at birth. I know that, logically speaking, I am not ugly. I’m not conventionally attractive, but I dress well (very into clothes generally) and my sort of queer vibe means that I don’t feel self conscious about having to aspire to be masculine etc.

However my teeth are really bad. This is a combination of an eating disorder when I was a teen, and (according to my dentist) genetically soft enamel. I’m not missing teeth, and my visible teeth when I smile aren’t black or super noticeably awful. But the lower parts of my teeth are turning transparent and the parts near the gum are eroding fast. All the main damage has been done to my teeth when I was younger- there’s nothing I can really do now.

So when it comes to dating, I feel embarrassed and ugly because of my current teeth, but I feel even worse when I think about what my teeth are going to look like in a few years time. I feel like I’m tricking people, potentially into a relationship where they’re going to feel disgusted by the way I look in a few years time.

I’m not really sure what to do about this. Teeth whitening hasn’t really helped, and veneers/crowns etc are totally out of the question because of cost- especially the reoccurring costs of having them replaced every few years. The work I need done would cost about £10k, and would most likely last for less than ten years.

I know a lot of people who are ‘body positive’ but none who are ‘teeth positive’- as bad teeth are associated with bad oral hygiene/bad breath etc, even though my oral hygiene is very good.

Any advice/insight/support would be appreciated. This whole thing makes me never want to date anyone else again. I feel like no-one could ever possibly be sexually/physically attracted to me. 

I’m in the UK btw- which I’m sure will come as no surprise to Americans on here…",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rxnnlw/im_too_ashamed_to_date_because_i_feel_so_ugly/

34,rxo2z8,1641500814,"I stopped talking to this girl I liked because she used to leave me on read for 10+ hours and texting her was a pain. She's contacted me again, do I bring up her texting habits?","Long story short, we went out a couple of times and things seemed to be going great. Distance was a pain as we lived 2 hours away from each other and we could only really see each other once a week, but apart from that, the dates themselves were amazing and the energy was there on both ends. The third date never came, however, as excuses kept piling up and just keeping in contact with her became such a chore. We used to have great conversation through text but somewhere along the way, she started taking incredibly long to reply to my messages. I'm talking 10 hours plus. I never confronted her about it because I felt like it was out of line for me to do so especially seeing as we had only gone out twice, so I kept putting up with it until I eventually had enough; we all get busy, sometimes extremely so, but when someone's consistently leaving me hanging for 7, 8, 9 and 10 hours, I get the sense that they don't want to talk to me.

So overnight I muted her on Instagram and deleted her number. I was almost always the one who initiated text with her so for a good week I heard nothing from her. This also cemented for me that I'd done the right thing by removing her from my life. She'd send me a post on Instagram and hit me up with a ""how have you been?"" text every other week, but I ignored some and replied to some a day later, wanting to really just let things die out.

Things did die out eventually and months went by without contact on either end, until last week when she's started texting me again. I've practically convinced myself that I no longer have feelings for her but I kind of still do. Is there any decent way in which I can bring up her texting habits without seeming confrontational or controlling? Or do I just count this as a lost cause and keep the door closed on her?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rxo2z8/i_stopped_talking_to_this_girl_i_liked_because/

He’s a gentleman, funny, caring and a good person in general . 

Lately I’ve been catching him staring at me and smiling and his friends tease him about it and he gets shy , I made a few conversations with him and I realized that I liked him so we’ve been staring at each other a lot until one day he wrote his Snapchat on my cup and I was shocked, I added him and he told me that he like me in a different way and that he’s happy that he sees me everyday. 

2 days later I had problems at work and I left my job and I told him , he supported me and he said that he will miss teasing me and seeing me smile everyday and I honestly was cautious about falling for him so I was trying to see if he was serious about me. 

9 days later he texts me when he wakes up and throughout the day until he falls asleep, he would flirts with me every second and says how beautiful I am but never asks me any questions about myself or even get to know me better like what is my hobbies what I like or what I hate and I was disappointed when he got cold day by day but when I surprised him at his work place he suddenly got excited and said how much he missed seeing my face and he confessed that he’s ready to give his heart to me and I told him too , when I got home , he expressed how much he wants to kiss me, hug me and I suddenly freaked out and got uncomfortable and I told him that I’m uncomfortable and he apologized but got cold after that and responded to me 7 hours later and never texted me again.

I went to the same mall again yesterday and I saw him glaring at me and never looked in my eyes after that like I never existed. 

I was shocked that he was upset because I told him that I was uncomfortable hearing him say that he wanted to kiss me or sleep with me , I don’t know him that much and he never tried to get to know me better and all he says is how pretty I am and how much he wants to sleep on the phone with me.

I don’t know if he just likes me because I’m pretty because I never felt like I matter to him as a person.

I don’t know if the right subreddit ( bald subreddit is full or balding men, and i think balding should be something that should fall in the “body positivity” category ). 


It’s literally destroying my self esteem, and it’s progressing super rapidly. I already do have some problems ( not physical ones ) that are currently ruining my life.

Last summer, I shaved my head. I felt horrible, and kind of invisible to people ( especially girls of my age ). The whole class started treating me differently. I’ve been going to the gym for a year, I’ve always been a sporty person, but I still feel doomed cause i know i won’t look like a young guy anymore.

I know that some women don’t care about it, but talking about girls, I don’t think it’d be the same ( rightly, they’re not used to see bald teens )

So the issue at hand would be that, She said we can be together but it wouldn't be official to her family as because she promised to Graduate first to her email (That was before i met her so it was a bit of a shock to me).

So then, i need to wait around 4 years or so? For us to become together officially to her family.... but to my family has nothing like that.

And then, We are also in an LDR which would make it pretty risky to wait around that long.

I don't it seems like a pretty big risk to me, I don't know what to do honestly. I said to her to give me time to think about it, and she did agree. But i honestly do not have any idea what to say nor do.

Bit of background. There’s this girl I’ve got my eye on. We get on really well in person, she works in a shop I regularly go to for work. Whenever I’m there we normally chat a bit. Boys that have been with me have even said stuff like ‘she fancies you’ etc…

She’s been in a relationship for the most part but now single.

I added her on social media about a month ago and she followed me back so I started to converse with her now and again. Nothing took off really, it was strange she wasn’t as chatty as she was in person so I thought ‘not interested’ 

Then seen her again and same thing, full of chat, having a laugh etc…

So I thought fuck it. Go for it. She made me a coffee so I struck up a conversation about that and it went well and ended with me asking her out for a coffee. She said yes and she would let me know. It was Xmas week so it was a tricky time to ask but to late.

Didn’t hear anything from her but something I bought arrived and used that to show her. We were chatting again and I asked her what she was up to tonight to which she said ‘fuck all’ so I used that to ask her to do something and she then said she can’t because her parents wanted a night with her. Could be bollocks could be true. We spoke more until past the countdown and we haven’t spoke since.

I haven’t reacted to her stories or anything and she hasn’t to mine.

I’m saying this because i know there’ll may be people who will suggest things like: “love yourself first”. that’s good advice but i already love my self a lot, and still think that having a meaningful relationship is something that can add more value to your life, and that’s why i’d like to know people, make experience, and if possible, why not, getting into a relationship.

My question is... What happened? Could a person change their mind after meeting someone by basically thinking good enough to fuck but not date? Any insight is welcome...",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rxqxmr/what_changed_her_mind/

I have a friend that is always approached by women when our group of friends goes out. They just walk right up to him unsolicited, sometimes several times a night. It helps for sure that he is tall and handsome, but something about his body language and the way he carries himself seem to set him apart. It’s like he just hangs out and knows they will come eventually.

65,rxr0rr,1641508633,How to navigate in the friend zone?,"I, (22F) have been seeing this guy (23M) for a little over a month now. Instant chemistry and comfortability. We truly have such a good time together and it’s very special to me to be able to feel so comfortable with someone. We can do anything together and enjoy it. A little background about myself: I’ve only had 1 “real” relationship, which was in high school. I have been single since I was 16. I have had casual flings here and there but I prefer to date with intentionality so I’ve refused to settle. It’s never been very fun to me to date around and it is my deepest desire to one day feel true love as I feel like I’ve yet to have that experience. The tricky part is that as most will say these are my prime years to explore, date, and have fun. I feel as though, I’ve done that and I’ve had enough. I’ve been traveling and living abroad since I was 18 and I’ve relocated overseas so I’ve have my fair share of experiences with different types of men. But now, I would like to build something real with someone. I would consider myself to be very mature for my age and it’s very exhausting to be in the dating world at my age and to want something beyond hook ups and flings. 

Now, since we’ve met we’ve spent 2-3 days out of every week together. From the beginning I’ve expressed what I’d like and he’s expressed what he would like. He has stated that enjoys what we have, he likes me, feels comfortable and can trust me, but does not want to commit to a relationship just yet and he wants to focus on himself. Which I respected and wouldn’t try to change his mind. Things got confusing when we added intimacy to the equation and from there I asked for clarification on what we were doing. His answer remained the same. Eventually I expressed that this may not be healthy for me being that I do have feelings for you and wouldn’t mind if things progressed to another level. He agreed that the intimacy should cease and we should be strictly friends. He still wants to hang out as do I because I do enjoy his company and he makes jokes about being intimate again although I’m very headstrong about this not happening again because I want intimacy with a commitment. 

My question is how do I navigate the friend zone when I have feelings? When I meet someone I really like and connect with, I tend to get excited and I fantasize because it’s truly so rare for me. I will never try to change his mind or convince him that I’m worth more or a relationship. My friends tell me to give it time and maybe he will come around but I’m afraid to hold onto that idea and I want to avoid disappointment. He talks about us doing things together in the future and I truly believe he wants to include me. I haven’t closed myself off to dating other people but he is my top choice. He is much more logical and I, emotional and I worry that I’m not viewing things realistically (especially given the time frame) but I know it’s also okay to feel how I feel and want what I want, which is something real. However, I know that nurturing the friendship is in my best interest.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rxr0rr/how_to_navigate_in_the_friend_zone/

67,rxr4lc,1641508909,Sudden ghost after having great dates,"I (25m) dated a girl (25f) for the last two months. Due to my business travels and her COVID infection, we were only able to have 4 or 5 dates. The dates went really well, with a lot of cuddling but nothing sexual. At the end of the last date, we had our first kiss. She wanted to kiss again afterwards and wrote me she had a great time directly afterwards (which I was extremely excited about since she's not very communicative over text).

Since this was my first dating experience, I read a lot of posts on this sub and wanted to initiate sex (the common opinion seems to be you should have sex within the first 5 dates). Based on this, I invited her to my place and wrote that I really like her and I'd like to get more intimate. I also asked her that if she felt the same about me, what her opinion about STI testing is.

She saw the message but has ghosted me. After a couple a days, I tried writing her again, telling her that if that's too early, I absolutely understand and that I want to make sure she has a good experience as well. No response sign of life from her for over a week.

I am absolutely devastated, I can't even focus at work anymore. Did I do something wrong? Do you think it's over for good?

For context, she is much more experience than me (had two or three boyfriends before and she told me she once had a hookup with someone she loved but did not love her back).

71,rxrht4,1641509896,Dating somebody I'm not attracted to - should I keep seeing him?,"I haven't been on a date with anybody since my ex-boyfriend in a very long time, but I recently bumped into somebody I grew up with and we're starting to see each other. The problem is, I'm not that attracted to him and worry that I might waste his time/hurt his feelings in the long run - I would never want to do that.

We met at the bar, his voice was so familiar that I approached him and we realised we had played out together on the road we both lived on as kids. I definitely used to have a major crush on him and he still looks similar in his face, except physically he is a lot rounder than he used to be. I decided to add him on social media after he bought me a drink. I wasn't expecting anything to come out of it as I was more looking for a friendly chat. We spoke for a while and he eventually offered to pick me up and hang out at his house, which I admittedly did out of boredom, and that's when things changed for me.

He was really sweet and we managed to talk for hours. Time went so quickly that we didn't realise it was 2:30am! It just felt so easy and safe with him and it made a huge change from other people I have met before. I had such a nice time that it seemed ridiculous not to give it a try with him over superficial stuff, so we have continued speaking, and he has asked me to dinner this weekend.

I like how he makes me feel and there is definitely something there for me, so I really want to give things a try. There's not a physical attraction yet for me though and I do feel this will be important later down the line when things get more intimate. I'm hoping that will grow but my worries are if they don't, I'd feel like I'd strung him along, and he absolutely doesn't deserve that.

72,rxrino,1641509963,"I've been thinking of the statistics of dating and have conclusion that if you go out a date a stranger, that on average their quality of person will be below average, is this a correct conclusion?(Reasoning below)","tldr:

The dating pool is mostly filled with undesirable people(compared to the average population) since people who are undesirable are more likely to stay in the pool than people who are desirable.

&amp;#x200B;

To also clarify I mean for this to be true for both sexes.

lets say that you could rank a persons quality from 0-100.

a 0 would be paranoid, ugly, annoying, selfish, needy, racist, a cheater, etc.

a 100 would be pretty, kind, generous, funny, good of heart, loyal, etc.

while people are likely to potentially value certain qualities while hating others that the majority likes, there are still many qualities that most people would agree are desirable. It can also be said that many of these qualities can only be assessed after spending some amount of time with a person.

The dating pool is effectively a market where if 2 people of higher quality meet then they are not likely to return for an extended period of time if ever. On the flip side people of low quality are likely to stay in the dating pool for an extended period and are likely to return back to it several times. A serial cheater(person of low quality) is likely to reenter the dating pool much more often then someone who is seeking genuine long term commitment. 

It would stand to reason then that the dating pool is mostly filled with undesirable people(compared to the average population) since people who are undesirable are more likely to stay in the pool than people who are desirable.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rxrino/ive_been_thinking_of_the_statistics_of_dating_and/

78,rxrsmb,1641510680,Is she showing interest or just being nice to me?,"So recently on Snapchat I've been texting this girl who I ended up getting her snap from her at my college a couple years ago. She didn't use to show interest in talking or getting to know me more better due to her own issues with trusting guys and having bad luck dating them in the past I guess, since she told me she was going to take a break from dating and relationships in general for a while because of this one guy who was a complete asshole to her and treated her harshly she told me. 

And so after that I ended up telling her that if she changed her mind about dating and relationships again, then I'd be willing to treat her right and more better than that asshole ever did. She ended up replying with a ""Lol thanks."" And I joking asked her when we could get to know each other better. She then replied to me with ""idk I've been pretty busy lately lol."" And so I said we could text on and off from time to time getting to know each other better if you're busy. So I offered her with saying ""How about we start the new year off with getting to know each other better tomorrow or this week after New Year's Eve, because this was during New Year's Eve btw. 

So the day after New Years Eve I asked her how she was doing and she told me she was tired because she stayed up late last night and was coming back home from out of town and was sorry for the late replies to me as well. I ended up asking her where she went out of town and she was open and honest with me about it and how she had a fun time there too.

After a couple of days of talking after the new year had started, I began to have doubts and thought she wasn't interested in talking to me much since I had gotten late replies to her until the very next night at the same or around the same time I had previously texted her. I asked her, ""Are you still interested in getting to know each other better ""her name""? It's just I can't really tell at times tbh."" She then replied with ""Honestly I kinda am. Only reason I haven't messaged as much is cuz I have the closing shift at work so I get home late and get tired af and I been working since Monday."" So at least she was honest and open with me about what was going on in her life, because I understand more clearly now why she replies late right now. 

I will also say that when we message each other about stuff she likes to use the lol at times to me when I haven't said anything funny or just in general which gives me hits that she is showing interest, but don't know at times. I've also noticed she texts me back right away within a 10 minutes - 1 hour timespan to me too which can be another sign of a girl showing interest in you.

90,rxszur,1641513864,"How do I ask out a woman I met once at her place of work, but have so far not bumped into since? Let me explain...","Around six months ago, I attended a follow-up physio appointment at a local hospital after breaking my leg, and upon arrival, was assigned a random physiotherapist, who just so happened to be a beautiful young woman. Lucky me. Unfortunately, that was the one and only time I ever had an appointment with her. Unlucky me.

Due to the nature of my injury, my appointment was roughly an hour long. Now, I'm not going to say anything like ""we had an immediate connection"" or any other romantic nonsense like that, but we seemed to get on like a house on fire. 

From the get go, she was very hands on (due to my injury) which immediately broke down any barriers, as it would if you were immediately instructed to take off your trousers so a stranger could massage your inner thigh. And pretty quickly, we were asking all about each other; what school we went to, where we lived, what countries we'd visited, whether we had any friends in common (it's a small town), not that we did. We established that we were both single. I made her laugh, she made me laugh. It was fun. And by the time I was leaving, it wasn't; ""have a lovely day, Mr 'Surname'"" from her, it was; ""Well, hopefully I'm booked on for your next appointment, 'forename', and don't forget your shorts, or I won't be so gentle"" - Her actual words by the way.

It wasn't until later that night that I realised I had daydreamed about her for the remainder of the day. And that has continued, somewhat annoyingly, up until today, six months later. And at this point, I'm sure you've guessed, I'd love an opportunity to ask her out. But how?

The only thing I know about her is her first name and where she works. Literally nothing else. Now, I can't just rock up at the hospital, that's a bit weird and inappropriate. And it's not like I have a legitimate reason to make another physio appointment anyway. I've tried to find her on social media, but knowing only her first name made that a non-starter. We have no friends in common to set us up, so that route is out. And to date, I've only ever seen her one other fleeting time, walking by in a bar, but before I could even swallow my swig of beer, she'd disappeared into the crowds.

The one and only connection I have so far established, is that one of my friends wives works in the same hospital. She knows of said beautiful physio, but works in a totally different department, and has never so much as spoken to her, so is in no position to set us up. But has confirmed that she still works there, and, more importantly, that she is not a figment of my imagination.

So what is a man with a formerly broken leg to do? I'm obviously eager for an opportunity to ask her out, but with all the traditional routes, such as; being set up by a mutual friend being apparently unavailable, I've no idea what to do? Or even if there is anything I can do? And being a man of moral standing, I absolutely won't do anything which would be considered creepy just to bump into her. So I'm stuck.

If I didn’t answer, he would double text. And they were real conversations where we were talking about interests and what not. I started to get more interested and was looking forward to another date. He took total initiative with date 3. I said we could do something chill, just drinks at his place after a work night. Four days in advance, he was asking me what kind of drinks I would like, etc. 

Anyway, I go over and we have one drink. We talk for like 20 minutes and then have sex. The whole time I was there, he was only interested in sex. Like sex for hours. While we’re doing it, his phone buzzed a few times. He went to the bathroom and I looked at his phone. I saw that this guy who seemed so interested in me and was texting me everyday doesn’t even have my number saved! The other two numbers texting him were also unsaved numbers 👀 I felt like an idiot. He clearly is playing with me and not that into dating me. I was shocked but I didn’t say anything and just acted normal. 

Now I’m convinced he was never interested in getting to me. He didn’t save my number just like the slew of girls he’s sleeping with. And I’d be fine with a casual fwb but I think it’s fucked up he’s love bombing by constantly asking when he can see me again, talking to me everyday, aka getting me emotionally invested.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rxt7nv/why_would_he_not_have_my_number_saved_after_3/
93,rxta3o,1641514602,I googled his number and found a post,"So yesterday my(35f) crush(33m) gave me his number, I wasn’t sure of the spelling of his name so I tried to google it. I found a link to a sexual posting “looking for fun.” Looks like it was a one time post, nearly a year ago. No additional posts, no reviews or comments.

I like to give people room to be human, I’ve made mistakes in my past that might make be seem like a less than ideal partner. and truly misrepresent who I am. I think my big fear is ending up with someone that is oversexed and I’m just going to end up being cheated on or objectified- of which he has never been anything but a complete gentleman, polite, and total sweetheart to me. 

So… do I tell him I found it? I feel like I might want to know in case another parent or colleague tried to google my number. Do I ask him about it? Do I run for the hills? Allow him to have a human moment?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rxta3o/i_googled_his_number_and_found_a_post/

I feel like pulling out a chair but not pushing her in is where we are now?
Opening car doors is still a thing?
Walking on the road side of a sidewalk?

Guys don't stand up from a table when a woman leaves anymore, right?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rxte32/whats_considered_modern_day_chivalry/
95,rxtki1,1641515397,A question for people aged 20 to 30 that are in a relationship!,"I am a ( 25M) who recently got out of a 2 year relationship 2 weeks ago with a (F23). For the longest time I have felt like I will be alone forever and the partners I have met I have settled for. I am not ugly in any way. Over the years I have used tinder and every dating app under the sun. Things never turn out and my recent gf was extremely attractive. I want to date an attractive women however I am unsure where to get the success. For context I am in Australia.

Here is my question. When, where and how did you meet your partner? What do you consider the best way to meet a women these days?.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rxtki1/a_question_for_people_aged_20_to_30_that_are_in_a/
96,rxtm2f,1641515512,What does this mean? And what should I do?,"I (40f) just started dating a (42m). We met organically not through OLD. For the first 2 weeks he was messaging me constantly the sweetest messages thick with pet names and emojis. We went on our first date a week ago and hit it off so well. He kept texting me after at the same pace. As a side note he is not the most attractive man in the world and a mutual friend of mine even made the comment “aren’t you a little out of his league?” But his behavior towards me made him attractive to me. After all I am just looking for someone who will be good to me. So all last week he was super attentive and sweet and we were intimate several times. He sent me texts like “I like you so much and I am so excited to see where this can go!” and “I love spending time with you!!” Fast forward to this week, his texting has totally slowed down minus the sweet pet names like “darlin” and “beautiful”. He has stopped texting me straight away in the morning and he even cancelled the plans that we had for tonight, knowing that I will get my kids back tomorrow night and won’t have a free evening for a while. I cannot wrap my head around his total 180 in behavior….. and I don’t want to come across as all needy and push him away any more….. I just don’t think this man is going to pull a woman any better than me… so I don’t think that that could be what he is thinking. I am attractive, have a great career and good character. Any advice on what this means and what I can do about it??

97,rxtpxc,1641515811,Single 5 years taking a huge toll on me,"Hey y’all I’m wanting to write this to possibly get some insight on wtf is going on w my dating life. I’m a 23 y/o female who’s been single for 5 years. I have a child, I work full time in the dental field, I’m super self sufficient (own apartment, car, handle my own bills etc) and not to sound douchey but I’m definitely an attractive female who’s able to get men’s attention right away (not that I’m looking for it). I’ve been single since I left my child’s dad at age 18 and every year passes by and I’m somehow still single. I’ve made tinder and bumble profiles but never really used them let alone met someone off there. I don’t really do much besides be a mom and work, I sometimes hang out with friends but haven’t been able to meet a guy this way. In the 5 years, I’ve only had 1 man come in my life that I actually really enjoyed being around but he ended up royally fucking me over. So it’s not like I’m out here going to pottery class every week or the gym, bar whatever to really even meet people. I have guys approach me from time to time but not super often and I’m usually not attracted to them physically or personalIty wise. I feel like it’s kind of insane to be single for 5 years, regardless of how much I get out of the house, and I very much don’t want to be single anymore. Like at all. I get super lonely from time to time thinking about it, to where there is a pit in my stomach. I just want to share a love with someone in this world to support each other in whatever way needed and I for some reason cannot find that. Many of my single mom friends have found partners so I no longer think that’s a huge reason why. Wtf is going on? Please help me with advice or insight. 
*also worth noting my daughters dad is 100% not in her life so it’s not like I have a crazy baby daddy scaring men away or anything*

98,rxtxo2,1641516389,The struggle with dating as a teenager,"I[15M] have struggle dating as a teen tbh. It’s not that girls don’t like me, but it’s that it’s difficult to find a date because I know teens don’t really understand the going on a date AND THEN dating thing just yet, and if they do they take it to the extreme and stay in the talking stage six months.

Like I wanna meet this girl in person because we had a great convo once, but she barely uses Instagram (she hasn’t really been active since school started back which is understandable) so it feels like it would be weird if I asked her now since teens don’t really do dates like that.

A lot tend to be nervous since they don’t really know me even though that’s the point. I fucking HATE texting so I wanna meet you some other way LMAO but yeah that’s the struggle. Needed to vent",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rxtxo2/the_struggle_with_dating_as_a_teenager/
