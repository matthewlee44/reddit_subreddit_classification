I was sitting at my desk today thinking about all the men I have had romantic or sexual interactions with and what I realized is that every situation felt transactional or unstable. I don’t ever feel like a man has prioritized my comfort even after I was able to ‘find my voice’ as an adult. Obviously I’m the common denominator in all of these situations so I understand that I bear some responsibility but I also realize the impact of living in patriarchal societies where men are being conditioned to not be accountable for the safety of the women they are connected to or their mistreatment of women. I don’t want to feel this way but here I am— can anyone relate?

26,pw8qak,1632713100,Ghosted After 3 Months,"I don't want this to be too long, because I don't have the energy.  Essentially, I started seeing this girl long distance.  I live in the Atlanta, Ga, and she lives in Charleston, SC (about a five hour drive).  We would meet every two weeks or so and text daily.  We had some great times.  We would meet up on the weekends, go do fun stuff (hiking, rafting, museums, zoos, you name it), come back to the hotel and have great sex.  Initially, it seemed like she wanted to make things more serious, and I didn't want to rush into it, due to the distance.  She agreed that made sense. But we started to get a bit romantically attached.  

One of the last times we met, she said she had started talking to someone else.  It obviously bothered me, and I got a little upset, but conceded that since we weren't official, I had no reason to be upset.  Afterward, she said she felt bad and she would stop talking to him.  Then in a recent conversation, she indicated she felt ""disconnected,"" and that she wanted to spend more time with me, but couldn't, and it sucked.  In the convo, I construed one of her comments to mean she was talking to someone else again.  I said, essentially, don't tell me you're not going to do something, and then do it.  The next morning, she had blocked me on social media and SMSs don't seem to go through.  I left my last voicemail that morning.

My first guess as to what happened - things got more serious with this other person, or she otherwise decided to pursue someone else because of the distance, or because she liked them better.  I just hate that she ended it that way.  She could have just been honest, I would have understood.  Now it's as though she would have rather it never happened, like I wasn't even real.  I can't even honestly discuss it with my friends, because it just makes me sound like such a loser.  Like, that's all I was to this person.   I'll get over it, I just feel so empty and alone right now.  I've started back on dating sites, and have ""gotten back out there"" (meetups, going to bars), but nothing has materialized yet.  *Sigh*

While on the dates we always have a lot of fun, and it does feel like the chemistry and attraction is there. But there are some red flags that have been bothering me lately.

**Red flags:** 

\- I tend to ask most of the questions that drive the conversations

\- We tend to talk more about her and her life because of that, but it's not like she never asks me things

\- She admitted early on that it's hard for her to develop feelings for people when dating

\- She hasn't been exclusive with someone in the past 5 years, but does say she is looking for a meaningful relationship at this point in time and does want to be exclusive with someone

\- I'm usually the one initiating texts, phone calls, and dates

\--

With all that being said, I do really like this person, and things do generally feel great when we are together. Am I right to think those bullet points above are all red flags? Am I an idiot that is just going to get hurt when I try to take things to the next level?

30,pw93b6,1632714549,Was I wrong - Early Stages Dating,"Not really a place I thought I would be but I have no one to talk to. Please don’t rip me apart Reddit. 



Was I wrong.

I’ve been exclusively talking to this girl for the last month plus. Things were great and we were really vibing. Being a single mother leaving a shitty relationship, I was trying to be supportive and understanding. We were clicking super well. 

Last week she text me saying she wasn’t fully over her Ex (not sexually interested but just not over him) and maybe we need to step back and almost stop
talking. Not an emotional guy but at this point, i had completely fell for them. I cried on my way home, that fucking hurt me like I never been hurt before. Later on we had both expressed how much we enjoyed each other and how we never clicked with others like so. I was hesitant with her text so I wanted her to clarify and we agreed on slowing things down but still growing together. Things didn’t really slow down  though some days would be lovey and the next was little off but she made plans for us this weekend so I didn’t really think anything was truly wrong. Plans fell through and my anxiety was super bad. I was so emotional sick so I texted her how I was feeling and acknowledged how we always talk and she shouldn’t take away from her Sunday but I felt like a wreck and missed her. (We’ve been super communicative and supportive with any problems/thoughts so this wasn’t too crazy to text) 

Things went south QUICK. Angry text from her saying I was wrong and she doesn’t understands how I could feel that way. Saying don’t text her. 

I responded calmly trying to explain and answer but it snow balled. Every step I try to defuse just made it worse and more angry. 

She ended tonight saying she isn’t in a relationship with me and I shouldn’t expect responses. She’s a single mother that was in an abusive relationship. Good luck. 

I did my best to understand and be supportive. Gave my full attention and listened to her. I just feel so lost. I never expected texts from her, she numerous times said she can’t wait for me to be her boyfriend. This felt like a family I could be apart of. I have a soft spot for her and her child but now I feel defeated.

Like I even told her I'll even find a job where she's moving at too cause I'm trying to look for a stable job anyways.

They don't learn the best way to comfort you after a bad day or capture how much it might mean that someone learns your like and dislikes and can surprise you with a great evening because of it.  They don't show you affection, keep you warm at night with just the right amount of physical touch.  They don't encourage you to be the best possible you that you can be.  You want to further your career, photos and abs won't encourage you and help find ways to position you for that success.  Want to change a career and they won't find ways to be the emotional rock you are going to need while you get started and possibly provide good feedback and ideas.  

So in a world where you are first and foremost presented with someones picture which has now been made to look perfect leaving you to be surprised who everyday is like and especially what morning hair and breath might be like.  Then you read the typical profile which is designed to get you interested on a date by checking off a few boxes about what someone claims to do with their time and then you meet and find out that either it was all shit and you think he is shit or that all that alpha stuff was an understatement and you think he is shit and then you go back to the profiles and do it all again.  

So what are the rest of us to do to demonstrate that we are not impending failure but legit men who understand that being a man isn't about his muscles or rugged good looks but about being honest, available, sometimes sensitive, caring and can take care of stressful things you may not enjoy and heaven forbid if the time comes and some wannabe alpha keeps chirping about his alphaness and starts causing trouble your silent alpha shows what it really means and gets you out of the situation unharmed.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pw9t0a/in_response_to_the_post_about_a_fake_female/

He is not a bad person, but…

We had a coffee date. I arrived 10 mins earlier and waited at the door. A few mins later, he texted me saying he grabbed a drink and waited me inside. (Normally I would meet the other person outside and walk in together ) it’s kind of weird, but I got my drink, and met him inside anyway. During the date, he started asking my job, we are in the same field, so he went to very detail level with specific question, its more like a knowledge share session than a date.

At the end, I suddenly realized that he “sneaked” into the cafe, because he didn’t want to pay for my coffee. The conversation about my job was more for him to prepare a job change/ interview.

After the date, he sent message on dating app, gave his number and asked me to text him if I wanted to meet up again. I didn’t reply or contacted him, because I don’t want to see him again. He messaged me again to check if I got his number.

We went on 3 dates and have been talking since early june. Had a great connection. 

I felt like I kept getting mixed signals after the 3rd date so Finally last week I told him I liked him as more than a friend. His exact words were “you are a super dope person and I like you a lot but it’s hard for me to see us in a relationship because of our schedules (I work nights and he works days rn) and you live so far away (45 minutes).”

I told him that was fair and but that I had also planned on moving to days soon anyways and will likely be closer to his area next year when my lease ends. And that is all true and has nothing to do with him. Just wanna work days and I’m trying to be closer to my family.

I added at the end something like “I say that to also say that it’s not worth pursuing if only one person sees value in it so I think we can just remain friends and I’m going to continue to date other people.”

And that was the jist of it. Now he’s been messaging me more than ever. Every single day. Same time every day almost. When before I told him this he had become very spotty with communication and leaving me on read a lot. 

He responds to my snap stories frequently. Sometimes complementing my looks and the other day after I mentioned a restaurant I liked he said that we should go there. 

Do you think he’s genuinely just trying to be friends or what??? I mean I know he has plenty of female friends and he’s a super friendly guy so it very well could just be that. But I got a vibe when I mentioned I was gonna be dating other guys that he was a little jealous although I could be misreading that. 

I feel like my feelings for him (while still there) are pretty at bay right now and I like having him as a friend cause he’s really a great person. I felt extreme relief when I finally let it out and wasn’t upset at his answer.

48,pwam8p,1632720712,Should men chase women?,"So, I was on a date last night with a beautiful lawyer who’s 4 years older than me. We discussed dating, and she brought how she doesn’t particularly feel that men chase women anymore.

That got me thinking: I personally don’t chase. I find it kind of immature honestly. I feel that if a person says they want to get to know someone along the romantic side, and the other says they want to feel the chase, that they aren’t interested. To me, the woman isn’t the prize, the mutual respect and adoration in a valued relationship is.

Which led me to looking up divorce rates. People divorce for a plethora of reasons, and this is just speculation, but if 51% of women file for divorce, and 49% of men file for divorce, it’s safe to say that 100% of these relationships failed because the other person wasn’t happy with their partner.

But what percentage of those relationships started with chasing the partner to validate that they were worth the other’s time? 

What’s the correlation between chasing and value? I don’t think it’s really consistent. To me, all it shows is someone’s inability to see their worth, and stop chasing someone who also is unable to value them.

TLDR: should men chase women?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pwam8p/should_men_chase_women/
49,pwaqg8,1632721237,Slept with two friends of girl I’m dating. Help,"Allow me to give some back story to do the title justice. I’ll make it worth your read :)

Im a 33 year old male and I’ve been casually dating mostly via dating apps for the past 6 months after getting out of a LTR. Three months ago, I went on two dates within a week’s span and come find out the two girls I went out with know each other and are friends. I only saw both of these girls once and we agreed it was casual and wouldn’t go any further. I didn’t click with either of them on deep level but I did sleep with both of them. The notion of them being friends certainly made it less than ideal but no harm, no foul. The next paragraph is where things get really strange and the sort unfolds…

A month later, I meet a new girl (also via a dating app). We got to know each other via texting a week before our scheduled date. From the few few messages, we discovered how many common interests we shared and had a great first date. We clicked so well on both a physical and emotional level and both knew we wanted to continue seeing each other. A random conversation the following day turns up her talking about two of her friends by name. The names of the girls she’s talking about happen to be the same names of the two girls I went out with a month earlier and are in fact the SAME girls. My mind is blown at this point and know I can’t not tell her as she would eventually find out.

After telling her the news, she was in shock but not completely devastated as she acknowledges I had no way of knowing and it’s purely one large coincidence. We continue going on dates and getting to know each other better but under the condition that she wouldn’t share her finding with her friends and keep it only between us.

Fast forward to today, we’ve been seeing each other for two months but in secrecy from her friends knowing. We both want to be in a relationship but she feels very uncomfortable coming clean to her two friends I met prior and telling them she knew I knew them but still proceeded to continue seeing me. She knows she needs to tell them but doesn’t know when is the best time.

Guess I’m just looking for some feedback given this unique scenario and seeing what the odds are this will work out.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pwaqg8/slept_with_two_friends_of_girl_im_dating_help/

2. Do NOT post pictures with a face mask on. Like what is even the point?

3. If you have pics with lots of people, circle your face out

4. Do NOT post super old photos or lie about your height or weight, same applies to all genders. It's blatantly obvious. 

5. Do not post multiple close up selfies, ask a friend to take a couple pics, or try posing with a friend or a dog instead 

6. A little couple sentences explaining what you are looking for is nice whatever platform it is. Sometimes that's how I decide if it makes sense to give it a chance. 

7. Teeth whitening products work, try it out if you are a coffee drinker like myself 

8. Haircuts and well fitting shirts make guys stand out

53,pwb192,1632722585,I like this guy but there’s problems!,"My roommate introduced me to her best friend. The moment we started talking we connected. It was great. We video called almost every night. This started as a flirting thing only, we both had the clarity that we didn’t want anything emotional from each other. But recently I started liking him, and seeing his behaviour I thought he did too. Maybe he does, I really don’t know. Side note: it’s only been a month.

Now the issues are: 

He lives about 10 hours away from me by car. I’d been in 2 long distance relationships over the period of 6 years. And I cannot see myself in one more. So even if this guy liked me back and we had something serious going on, it would be long distance. But I don’t know if this guy is worth giving a shot because I haven’t met someone like him in a very long time. We also don’t have a certain future plan yet; meaning that he or I might not stay in the same place, our careers are not settled yet. I am a kind of girl who looks for permanency. 

Another issue is that the common friend, my roommate and his best friend, she is kind of possessive about him. They both claim to be friends only and that they have no romantic feelings for each other what so ever, which I believe. But I feel like she feels a constant need to prove that she knows him better than anyone else will. So if the guy and I were to be in a relationship, she would get worse and make herself more annoying with all the things she’ll say. For example, every time I say that he did something, or that he has this certain quality in him, she starts making it her own story and narrates it saying, “oh yeah, I know; we did that together; he’s like that only; he’d do this; he’s not like that”.

Is it worth my time? I am confused. He also recently got out of a painful breakup. I don’t wanna add to his pain. Should I just back off? Or should I hang in there, be in this state of flirting and hope that something would brew?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pwb192/i_like_this_guy_but_theres_problems/
54,pwb20q,1632722675,I (24M) have no idea how to handle this. I feel sort of deceived by 24F,"TLDR: I 24m met 24f on dating app and feel like she knowingly misrepresented what her body truly looks like. We connected deeply before I met her but I’ve come to find out after meeting I’m  not physically attracted and feel like if I back out now I’m an asshole. 


9/22 started texting with this girl on Hinge. Her pics were pretty zoomed in and she had gallons of makeup on. She posted one pic where I could tell she had a few extra pounds on her but who cares. (You’ll see why I mention that later) I was mostly on there to just make friends and if anything else happened, then cool. It said that on my profile too. 

We hit it off immediately in the craziest way. Have a ton of things in common and things that we felt connected us. For example, she has a hand tat and I have a thing for those lol. It’s red just like the tattoo on my wrist. We both got them earlier this year. We both got a left nose stud in 2017. There was a lot of those stupid, meaningless lil coincidences but we liked it. We like the same sports. We think exactly alike. Etc. She gave me her number quick. And we had incredible conversations over the past few days. We then spoke for the first time (1st time with our voices I mean) and it was on the phone for three hours early Saturday morning 9/25. I’ve never spoken with a girl for longer than like 20 minutes on the phone. We had phone sex during that call which I had never done before either. 

We had super deep conversations, like super deep. She even shed tears on that phone call because we spoke about very personal things. We said relationship things to each other. Not “I love you” of course but definitely things that’d be pretty insane to say to someone before meeting in person. I can’t even remember specifically but we were in deep and we both kinda hinted that we are moving too fast without explicitly saying it. But what can I say, I genuinely felt like I was already beginning to fall for her and she felt the same. We both had never connected with anyone like this. 

During the phone call she kept saying things like “We’ll see if you still like me in person.” I straight up told her that I was gonna kill her lack of self confidence and that she had no reason to worry. 

Anyways Saturday night 9/26 she came over so we could hang out in her car. We didn’t plan on doing anything. She just was gonna come over for like an hour so we could watch the sunset at a park near my house. She didn’t come inside because I live with my mother and adult sister. Now here’s where I’m about to sound like a total fucking asshole and I’m completely aware but I’m young and dumb so please just go the fuck easy on me lmfao. 

She’s a way bigger girl than I expected. Like even the pic of her upper body where I could tell she had a few extra lbs that I mentioned earlier didn’t seem like a clear representation of her actual body. I have an ok body because I recently lost nearly 50 lbs but I’m not that desirable to most women by any means so I ain’t judging. My arms look decently lean and you can see my collarbone and stuff like that but I still have a sizable gut without a shirt. I look decent with a shirt on and women are more attracted to me than they have ever been and my confidence is high but still, a LOT of women wouldn’t be down to fuck someone with a gut the size of mine which is why all my pics on dating apps are full body or close to it and some even without a shirt. I hide nothing. 

Anyways, yeah. I’m just not that physically attracted to her and I kinda think she knew what she was doing. She completely hid what she truly looks like. I was a lil shocked when I saw her but still wanted to make her feel beautiful and still feel like I’m starting to fall for her as a person. I was very touchy and flirtatious and we kissed a lot and then we had raw sex in her vehicle lmfao because she kept bringing it up and really wanted to hook up. She even said she felt guilty after for being so pushy about sex. 

Anyways I feel like it’s too late to back out of this now esp after we fucked but long term I’m just really not interested. I know what you’re thinking. Why did you kiss and fuck her then but idk we already had a connection and I really didn’t wanna make it about looks. But even parts of the sex were kinda gross. I smelled and tasted a lot of sweat. I sound like a horrible man I know. But at the same time I hide nothing on dating apps. I immediately tell women I live with family and don’t have my own car and that gets me immediately rejected. I show clear representations of my body and that gets me rejected. I hide none of my face etc. I wouldn’t have been interested in her romantically if I knew what her body looked like and that’s so ugly I know because the connection we have runs fucking deep and it shouldn’t matter. 

I don’t want her to be out of my life because the connection we have is that real. I honestly need to work out so I kind of gently want to tell her to work out with me because I need to fix my body too. I’m already down to 170 but I need to lose the gut I mentioned. If she stays this way, I’m not interested in a relationship though because the physical attraction isn’t there even a little bit. 

Anyways I feel like if I’m super honest on dating apps and get rejected all the time (and even get my feelings hurt by it at times tbh) she shouldn’t have been able to hide what she actually looked like to get me interested cause I’d never do that and have never even attempted to do it.

57,pwbgiq,1632724450,Dating tips,"## Dating tip 1: Keep things in perspective

**Don’t make your search for a relationship the center of your life.** Concentrate on activities you enjoy, your career, health, and relationships with family and friends. When you focus on keeping yourself happy, it will keep your life balanced and make you a more interesting person when you do meet someone special.

&amp;#x200B;

**Remember that first impressions aren’t always reliable,** especially when it comes to Internet dating. It always takes time to really get to know a person and you have to experience being with someone in a variety of situations. 

**Be honest about your own flaws and shortcomings.** Everyone has flaws, and for a relationship to last, you want someone to love you for the person you are, not the person you’d like to be, or the person they think you should be. Besides, what you consider a flaw may actually be something another person finds quirky and appealing. By shedding all pretense, you’ll encourage the other person to do the same, which can lead to an honest, more fulfilling relationship.

## Tip 2: Build a genuine connection

The dating game can be nerve wracking. It’s only natural to worry about how you’ll come across and whether or not your date will like you. But forge a great connection.

**Focus outward, not inward.** To combat first-date nerves, focus your attention on what your date is saying and doing and what’s going on around you, rather than on your internal thoughts. Staying fully present in the moment will help take your mind off worries and insecurities.

**Be curious.** When you’re truly curious about someone else’s thoughts, feelings, experiences, stories, and opinions, it shows—and they’ll like you for it. You’ll come across as far more attractive and interesting than if you spend your time trying to promote yourself to your date. And if you aren’t genuinely interested in your date, there’s little point in pursuing the relationship further.

**Be genuine.** Showing interest in others can’t be faked. If you’re just pretending to listen or care, your date will pick up on it. No one likes to be manipulated or placated. Rather than helping you connect and make a good impression, your efforts will most likely backfire. If you aren’t genuinely interested in your date, there is little point in pursuing the relationship further.

**Focus outward, not inward.** To combat first-date nerves, focus your attention on what your date is saying and doing and what’s going on around you, rather than on your internal thoughts. Staying fully present in the moment will help take your mind off worries and insecurities.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pwbhuw/dating_tips/
59,pwbirq,1632724720,Am I wrong in feeling this way?,"I’ve (29F) been getting to know this guy (31M) for about a month now. We have hung out once and it went good and have talked pretty much everyday. This past weekend we were supposed to hang out for a second time. He said he changed his work schedule for us to hang out since that was the only day we could work something out. 
The night before I asked if we were still on to hang out and he said there were some medical issues with his dad that may keep him from being able to go. He said he would let me know in the morning. The next day about noon he confirmed that he wouldn’t be able to go due to needing to keep an eye on his dad. I was disappointed, but understanding and told him it was ok.
We were talking later that night and he was apologizing and saying how he wished we could have hung out, but then told me he was able to go over to a friends house to watch the football game. 
This immediately hit me wrong. Am I wrong to feel like there’s a strong chance he was lying to me about the medical issues and in reality he got another offer that was better than hanging out with me, but didn’t want to cancel completely before knowing the other plans weren’t going to fall through? Maybe I’m overthinking things. We didn’t speak today and I don’t know if I should just let it go or keep putting in effort.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pwbirq/am_i_wrong_in_feeling_this_way/
60,pwbm2s,1632725117,Why do men pursue after you’ve said no many times and have been honest? Don’t you guys like honesty? What can I do?,"Okay, so I am a med student kind of close to a military base, and apparently a lot of the military guys have a thing for the med students. My friends and I find them rather annoying.

Most will take no for an answer like the second or third time around, but there’s one guy who just refuses. And here’s the thing… I’ve blocked him twice and he literally changed his number the first time. That’s how he got back in contact with me. I blocked him on FB but I’m friends with a guy he knows who’s in my class, and he’s actually pretty cool, so I don’t block him. 
So now I have him blocked again, and he made another account on FB and SC trying to talk to me. I blocked both. It’s just too far, seriously. 
I have been perfectly honest with him. I’m one of those people who speaks my mind and sometimes it gets me in trouble lol but my point is that I’m rather blunt, so he needs to let me go. Like, seriously, LEAVE ME ALONE. How can I get him to?
And he says that what he doesn’t understand is that I’m “discriminating” against him for being in the military and brings up the whole “Don’t women want persistence?” blah blah blah stuff. Yeah, being military is a turn-off for me (a dealbreaker too), but WHAT CAN I DO TO MAKE HIM GET THE PICTURE? He has so many other dealbreakers too. At this point it shouldn’t matter what the reason is; he should stop chasing me. And I kind of feel bad for him sometimes, as he has a crush on me and I know he loves me. (He’s been chasing me on and off since 2019.) but he’s acting like a baby. I even offered to be friends with him at one point to try to compromise and he said he can’t because of him being in love.

61,pwbmpv,1632725194,Should I ask her out?,"There was a 2 day ""get to know others"" camp for my new college. My friends pointed out that some girl was checking me out (glancing randomly). Therefore I started checking her out. This went on for two days... Just glancing. We never actually talked. The camp ended and I didnt see her for two weeks. I only knew her first name. 

Later at a school party I met her and we chatted for a minute. I mentioned the glancing from the camp. She told me that she was glancing at me because I was glancing at her. Now I dont know who actually started but it happened. I had to leave early so the chat ended. I only learned her first name. I saw her only once after that in a hall and we just said hello while smiling. 

I (think) managed to find her social media even though I dont know her last name. I found her through mutuals and school facebook groups she is most probably a part of. I dont want to message her because it might seem creepy that I found her even though it was easy. However my experience with her so far is that she likes me even though she knows nothing about me (so its probably just physical attraction so far). She looks good and from our short conversation she seems cool.

What do you think? How should I proceed? Should I talk to her next time I see her? Message her? Ask her to message me?

Over time i really regretted letting her go, and we got back into solid contact over the past year and became friends again. Once we came back to college last month, she initiated wanting to see me, so we hung out a couple of times. I really wanted to prove to her I value my time with her, so i kept sex and kissing off the table for the times we hung out. 

Communication started to become less and less, and so i asked her if i did something wrong. She told me not to worry, she was having a rough time and was getting distant because of it. I initially understood, but it never got better. I’ve tried to initiate talking about what’s been going on, but she gets upset with me everytime i try.

Currently, it’s been a week since I’ve talked to her last, and this has been going on for a little less than a month. I can’t really just move on from this because of the history. I just don’t know what to do.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pwbz38/what_now/

She smiles at me a lot when we aren't busy serving food but she usually looks at me deep in the eyes.

She works part time, so next time I see her I think I'm going to ask her to go out with me for coffee because I think she's intelligent and I enjoy our chats.

70,pwceez,1632728715,I think I just realized I want to date my guy best friend from the past 7 years…..,"23F. Some other really close guy friends who I’ve had in the past and who I thought of in a strictly platonic way have ended up confessing love for me, and it has ended in me rejecting them and then them cutting me off. This was so disheartening because multiple times when I tried to have male friendships it would end like this- really started demotivating me to pursue opposite gender friendships - I lost my other best male guy friend for 6 years whose friendship I cared so so so much about.  I can’t even put into words how much I valued it and now he won’t talk to me after I said I can’t be more than friends with him. So with this past experience it kinda makes me mad at myself/scared to be realizing what I stated in the title, but it’s getting to the point where it’s impossible for me to stop thinking about. And I don’t know how to go about it, when to go about it, if anything should be done at all. I don’t want to ruin a friendship so great if he doesn’t feel the same. My friendships with males usually give them a deep sense of respect for me. When they get to know me as a friend first they can really see clearly how cool and chill I am so becoming friends first works in my advantage. 

I’ve been best friends with this guy since high school and after going through life for a little while I’ve gotten a little clearer idea of what I’m looking for in a partner. He is exactly it. He is so awesome to me, I couldn’t have a greater sense of respect for him. We are super alike in terms of what we look for, levels of independence and intelligence, sense of humor, and our general outlook on life. I am already tight with his family, I have gotten to know him so well over the years. I usually stop liking guys once I get to know them better (that sounds mean but picking a partner is hard) but with this situation I don’t think that can happen- I already have gotten to know him for so long and have a deep respect and love for him. He is independent and so am I and I think we would just enhance each others lives rather than drain each other in any way, we are the same amount of chill and can both really see the beauty in life. I really don’t know what to do about this. But I don’t feel like I can go forever without knowing what could be…. I want advice from people who have found true love. 

One more side note is that he has basically never been with girls intimately, I really don’t know why and neither do his other friends and I don’t feel like pressing the subject- but maybe I should. He doesn’t open up about that area of his life. He really really does not seem gay at all to me, he’s very desirable and well liked by girls and guys alike. me being a victim of past sexual trauma allows me to understand what it’s like to fear intimacy- it used to be a big issue for me. Fear isn’t necessarily an issue for him I know I can’t assume that but I truly feel that if it was an issue, if there is anyone he could trust to be honest and open without judgement with it would be me, I have nothing but good intentions and so much love and infinite respect for him. Have any guys out there ever been in a flipped situation? Would you want the girl to make a move or say something?

She kind of said she had feelings for me and that she actually had a connection with me, and hadn’t felt this way in a long time, and I told her that I kind of just wanted something like casual but not casual like a FWB. 

Like she would say while we were making out like “ohhh you’re gonna break my heart bc I like you,” and in the heat of the moment and bc I was buzzed and crossed, I said we could see where things go snd to not worry about it. She sort of knew that I wasn’t really telling the truth but I just sort of wanted to keep making out and didn’t actually mean it.

Like I like intimacy and love, so at least with this girl I can just separate the attachment for some reason, bc I don’t really have actual feelings for her. 

At the same time she mentioned how she was seeing other guys but liked me the best, and it came out that she’ll do coke if so someone else has it, and she was telling me how she was dancing this guy snd like I can’t take her that seriously tbh.

But he is saying that she will be in a couple of his classes next semester as well since their in the same major, and asked if I would be okay if they studied at his place or her place if that were to ever happen. I feel so uncomfortable with it. and I keep trying to be okay with him and this study friend but I constantly thinking he will cheat on me. I know it is just my bad experience but my bf has reassured me a lot that he loves me and does not want to lose me and why would he waste my time and she is just a friend and he wouldn’t ever hurt me like my past. He also says later in the future he will also be working with females for work and that I should try to be okay with it. 

I feel stuck in this situation. if I say no, he will just say I don’t trust him. If I say yes, I am putting myself in a uncomfortable position. And yes he knows this as well. I feel scared that I will lose him but I also know if things turn around, I will just dump him and move on with my life if anything like that happens. I feel like what I say doesn’t matter because he is constantly trying to make me okay with it.

All of this would  not have troubled me, however, I feel like every time I ask her I may  come across as needy?

I must also add that I have  never gone on a date before and this is the first time I asked out  someone, so maybe I didn't flirt enough for her to know that I was  interested to date her. (I asked if she was free to join me for lunch,  didn't actually use the word ""date""!)

How  do I know for sure that she is interested in me, should I just subtly  ask her something like that? Also, since she cancelled the first two  times, does me asking her out again make me come across as clingy?

When we got together she was a very pretty girl I was immediately attracted to her. The relationship was healthy until about a month in. Things started to get sexual it was normal at first nothing that was bare skin to skin but spontaneous things like she would sit on me with a skirt on and move back and forth or we would get under some covers and press our body’s against each other. This continued for around 2 to 3 weeks nothing abnormal. Then things got more intense and I’m not an overly sexual guy I never had the mindset when I hung out with her that I was going to have sex with her. One night we were alone and we started to kiss among other things then she reached for my pants unbuttoned me and in seconds we were on the verge of actual intercorse for the first time. then just out of nowhere she said “stop what are you doing” and I was just dumbfounded she then got dressed and left the room and for lack of a better term I felt blue balled but it was much more than that for me I felt mentally destroyed. I felt like I had forced her into something she didn’t want to do I felt extremely ashamed and nasty that I’ve made her uncomfortable this happed more than 7 times until then and up to the point we broke up and was the reason for the break up. Not that I was mad she wouldn’t let me have sex with her but for the fact she had aroused me then completely made me feel like a nasty horrible person.

Her last serious relationship, which ended exactly one year ago, was pretty traumatic as she was treated poorly by her ex. 

This girl, to me, is amazing, and when we are together it's just heavenly. I don't want to force her into anything, I'm taking it slow this time.

89,pwebuu,1632739001,Guy from work is giving me mixed signals,"Totally new to the dating game and need some advice.

This guy from work joined the team some 6 months back and it's been a month since we started talking over text (due to the pandemic, offices are closed and we started off that way). Within 2 weeks of speaking he asked me to meet him,  we hung out and had the most amazing time but all this while he has never tried to flirt or indicate his interest in me, it's all been very platonic. After this happened , he has been following up to meet me over the past few weeks and in total we've been on 2 hangouts together- both of which were really fun. Some things he does indicate that he really cares for me but his texts are starting to get less responsive although we've been texting daily. He recently started calling me over cell too. Idk what to think of this and I'm super confused... he seems to be a guy who's usually indirect with what he wants to say and it's making things a lot harder to read. I am really crushing on this guy but do not know if there is any meaning to all of this.

Mixed signals include: him insisting on picking and dropping me home, him showing concern with my health and things that matter - occasionally checking up on me and ensuring I get home safe, pulling the chair for me, being able to trust me (one time he was high af and relied on me to take care  when we were out drinking- not sure if this counts), laughs a lot around me. He texts me daily albeit intermittently sending snaps and memes.

Things that make me feel like im reading it wrong: our interactions seem to be platonic and he has not not asked me if im seeing someone or my past dating history but spoke of the times when he picked up other girls etc on our first meet. Whenever we plan something he sends me the link to the event but never asked me directly if I want to go, his texts have started becoming much less responsive and have reduced.

Fellow redittors,  your advice is highly appreciated. P.s kindly excuse any typos.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pwebuu/guy_from_work_is_giving_me_mixed_signals/
90,pwehg3,1632739694,Not sure if my male friend has potential interest in me or is just being friendly? We are both in college. We matched on Tinder before we ended up on the same college,"So....I've recently developed a crush on my college classmate. He and I got close during the pandemic and this summer we hung out a couple of times. It started with him asking me out for lunch, which sadly I couldn't attend. Then we played mini golf, went out for drinks and pool, and walks during the summer. I met some of his friends as well once when he invited me to come and join them to watch soccer. None of these occasions were labeled dates or anything so I went in with the understanding that we are just good friends that like to hang out.

Most recently, he started working at a college bar and last week he texted me friday afternoon, asking me if I could come. I arrived and saw him in the bar and we chatted for like half an hour, laughing and joking around. The next day, at around 11 PM, he texted me again saying he wanted me to come so that we can have revenge on the winners of a music quiz the night before. Sadly I couldn't attend that time. When I went home that friday night, and the following week, I realized that I'm absolutely smitten with him, cannot get him out of my mind-level. 

However I realize that my perception is kind of off considering I have a crush on him, and maybe he is just being friendly and this is all platonic. Can't tell",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pwehg3/not_sure_if_my_male_friend_has_potential_interest/
91,pwen92,1632740408,Am i the asshole?,"Just to preface, me and this girl are both 18. Me and my ex broke up a while back, and it was because of trust issues. Long story short, we were in a really good relationship for about six months, and then there was a point where i was not gonna see her a lot as my career was just lifting off. A month after talking about this, she started saying stuff like, ""ill never find anyone like you"", ""i cant leave"", ""if i leave, i hope one day u take me back"" and stuff that insinuated her leaving and coming back into my life at a later point. And then her ""mental health"" got worse, which would have been fine if it were true, and she used this as an excuse to break up. While broken up she texted me saying how much she still loved me and she just doesnt know the direction of her life. We were broken up for exactly ten days. And then we got back together. I later found out while she was drunk, that she slept with someone within the week and a half of being broken up. It wasnt forced and she wasnt drunk, it was a choice. Now i was really pissed because she lied to my face when i asked her to be honest, and i after that i scrutinized her for doing what she did AND saying she loved me. She even said she did it because she thought it would make him like her. Now i wouldnt have said anything but i was really mad that it took me several months for me to do stuff with her and it took a stranger one day. So people of reddit, am i the asshole fo being mad at her? While i am trying to heal, i keep thinking that i was an asshole.

92,pwerw0,1632740923,An appreciation post,"It's that beautiful moment when you notice that you've finally found someone that is perfect for you. We share opinions on everything, and I mean everything, after 3 month of daily talking! We are at this stage where we complete eachother sentences and it sounds cliché but it's not, it's wonderful. She's good looking, with one of the most unique and beautiful personalities and she is very polite!

But! She has a boyfriend.

And no, I don't want her to breakup!
That is a line that i won't surpass, and i will never do. And for some of you reading you might ask why did I flag it as success when obviously it's a tragic. Well it's not.
 I, for the first time in 5 years, after clinging to 1 person for so long after breakup and making me go into superficial relationships with no actual love, have finally found another fish in the sea! And I am happy! I am capable of love again for the first time in a long time.
And I know it might be time that made me forget but it's all working at the same time!

She gave me hope that I can find another person and I will start looking once again with a different mentality from the mentality i had with my previous girlfriends.
Sadly, I cannot tell her that nor thank her for that because i don't wanna tell her that I've fallen for her because it's unethical when she is in a relationship and I don't want to make things weird between us.
And I am proud of myself because i was always pushing her to fix things with her bf when she had problems instead of benefiting from it for my good and i've been assuring her that she is perfect for him whenever she doubts herself.

 But I wanted a memory of that moment in my life cause for me it's a milestone, and who knows maybe  in few months i might find another fish in the sea who is single and be able to send this post to girl I am writing about.

I wish that this post will bring some hope to my brothers and sisters who are clinging on someone from the past.
And i hope that this post makes you a little happier today! Have a nice day y'all.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pwerw0/an_appreciation_post/

95,pwf161,1632741997,I don't know why ghosting culture has been so normalised in online dating.,"So I am actually quite new to not just online dating but just to whole sphere of dating and relationships in general. Haven't been in one before. It was mostly because of covid that I thought of giving this online thing a try and honestly I have learnt so much but at the same time I am still so confused about how everything works lol. I'll share my most recent experience. So I met this guy on bumble and we started talking. We had a good conversation and I think he hinted towards wanting to meet me in person. I haven't been doing well medically for the past couple of months and so I told him that I won't be able to meet him just yet because of that. We kept talking and by that I mean exchanging music and just random videos but never anything deep. One day I decided to you know dive into the personal and we had a good conversation about our lives. I thought he was nice and genuine. We didn't have deep conversations frequently mostly random stuff even after that unless I made an effort to talk about something personal. After almost talking to him for 15-20 days, I asked him for his social media handles and he said that he wasn't on any except for just one texting app. He gave okaish reasoning so I decided to give the benefit of doubt and I downloaded that app just to talk to him. We talked for a while and I shared about my medical stuff with him. When I felt a bit better, I told him I wanted to meet for a date and he said ok but he was very casual about it so much so that while I was planning it he seemed uninterested and ghosted me that entire weekend mostly. So I made it clear to him that he needs to communicate better cause otherwise it wasn't going to work for me. He said he would. We talked more and I asked him if we could talk on a call and he agreed so we did once. After that he texted me the next day and we continued to talk but it was mostly just small talk. Idk why it was getting frustrating for me cause he I realised he wasn't initiating things at all so I asked him what was he expecting out of this and what were we doing. He was super vague in his answer and I think that was my que to leave but I didn't cause I understand that it's okay to not be into me or not be romantically interested anymore or just not know what you want but all I wanted was for him to communicate properly. And be clear about his intentions. After that it was mostly small talk and he ended up ghosting me completely the next week, right before my surgery. I never actually told him much about my medical stuff cause I don't ever want it to become my identity. But I did trust him enough to tell him that I was going through something. I stayed there for a week on that app thinking maybe he got caught up in something cause he had even stopped looking at my messages. But it was getting toxic for me and so I dropped him a final text telling him that I enjoyed talking to him but it wasn't working out for me anymore cause i didn't know where we were at. I did this because I don't like ghosting anyone just like that. I deleted the app then cause waiting for his reply isn't something I was going to do cause that would have been not nice for my mental health. All in all, i felt really bad cause I used to believe that if u talk to someone for what I think was a significant time period and tell them stuff, if nothing else, you  can consider em a friend. 
I believe that if you're an adult and you're using dating apps, the least you can do is follow basic dating etiquettes. Especially if you have talked to someone for a while now. I am posting about it here just to get it off my chest and of course to hear other people's perspective on this :) 
I don't know what this was. And if he wanted to text me even after I had deleted the app, he could have cause I was still on bumble.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pwf161/i_dont_know_why_ghosting_culture_has_been_so/

I have recently started talking and intermittently chatting with a guy and it seems he could be a potential date. However, I have noticed that be doesn't read his whatspp messages for hours and when I confronted him today, he took it very lightly and said he is a busy man and that he checks whatsapp messages only when he gets time.

Wanted to know the opinion of people here.
