As I got up to continue skating, this guy grabbed my arm and called my name. Turns out it was a guy that I was close to in our high school years (we didn‚Äôt date and we weren‚Äôt in a relationship). 

We spent A LOT of time together back then. I went to his football games. I was close with his mom and grandma and his mom and my mom worked together. I was always over his house (no intimacy or anything). We went on little teenage outings together. It was plain to see that me and him had crushes on each other. Unfortunately, I moved and we completely lost contact. I seen him one time a few years later in passing.

So seeing him at the skating rink was really nice. He stayed by me most of the time, he asked me twice if I had a boyfriend and we just had good conversation. He also kept saying (since it was each our first time at that rink in years) that it was crazy he seen me. So it‚Äôs time to leave the rink and I strongly felt he was going to ask for my number and he didn‚Äôt. I was a little sad, can‚Äôt lie. I don‚Äôt know if he was shy because my friend was right there and didn‚Äôt want to ask or what. 

So the next day I followed him on Instagram (he told me his name on IG at the rink). He immediately messaged me saying it was good seeing me and we should meet up sometime and I basically agreed. Anyways he ends up giving me his number and I text him. 6 text messages in (simple, casual conversation) he doesn‚Äôt respond to me, but of course he‚Äôs active on Instagram. It‚Äôs been almost a day since his failure to respond. 

I‚Äôm not clingy, I‚Äôm not going to double-text him. I guess I just don‚Äôt know what to think. It was my hope to reestablish our friendship, but I don‚Äôt want to look desperate. No he‚Äôs not too busy and I‚Äôm sure he has sent out texts to other people since I texted him. Plus he‚Äôs active on social media. Yes, we aren‚Äôt dating or in a relationship, but we use to be close so I expected this to go totally different. I guess I had high hopes and expectations when I shouldn‚Äôt have. 9/10 I‚Äôm overthinking. 

However, it may be that he‚Äôs not interested, which is ok. But why would he ask twice if I have a boyfriend, message me on Instagram and give me his number? What are your thoughts? (My apologies for the lengthy post).

I really wish I had been more well aware of these behavioral patterns so that I could identify them in some situations and avoided people who brought negative experiences into my life and dating.

For example, a phrase I only just became familiar with recently is ""love bombing,"" which is when someone will lay on the compliments and infatuation toward you very heavily, but then they do things like they withhold giving you that same attention or ignoring you after they've built you up to feel great about yourself and in turn, falling for them. It's this whole toxic behavior involving control, emotional manipulation and making you feel attached to them. I totally had that happen to me over the course of a few months some years ago by a woman I was seeing. The whole time, I was just confused about what was going on because I didn't understand the behavior. When things ended, she ended things abruptly right after she had literally just told me she wanted to go all in on our relationship, and with that, my self-esteem was pretty wrecked while also feeling like I was the one who did something wrong. She had some issues, and 

There are plenty of more terms as well, like gaslighting and everything under the emotional abuse umbrella. I think that younger people have a better grasp on these behaviors than people my age (in our 30s) did, and for that, I think it probably makes them smarter daters.

So we became friends instead. We hung out a handful of times over the course of a year, but he would still try to hint at more with me confessing he really liked me &amp; thought I was amazing. At first I didn't know what to make of it? I didn't know if he was just trying to impress me to get laid but more and more I felt maybe this guy really does like me? 

The problem though was I noticed red flags about him which was another reason I initially decided not to pursue anything with him. My gut just kept telling me not to. He's this dark, mysterious guy who's into dark, creepy shit from death, skeletons, vampires, ghosts, witches, Wicca, occult shit, aliens and so forth. At first I brushed it off &amp; thought maybe it was just a part of his rocker, musician image. The one thing we did have in common was music. We liked a lot of the same genres of music &amp; bands. That's how we really connected. Other than that I wasn't into the same dark shit he's into. 

He also likes girls who are like that &amp; are a little on the goth side. I'm more of a girl next door, classic rock, nature loving, hippy free spirit sort of chick. I can have a bit of a dark side &amp; I tend to think &amp; question about the world a lot &amp; the truth behind it all. I feel he's always been fascinated by me to am extent &amp; more so bc I never really made myself available to him &amp; never threw myself at him which I think was a part of the appeal, him liking the chase bc I felt I wasn't his normal type he's into. I found him always trying to impress me even changing himself slightly to get me to like him. I thought it was sort of cute but also a turn off. I like ppl who are true to themselves. 

Eventually I gave him a chance &amp; we dated but it only lasted two months bc he soon did a 180 &amp; started acting hot and cold &amp; noncommittal even though he was the one who kept telling me he wanted a relationship with me. He started playing games with me which I didn't like &amp; even felt he was putting me down to an extent &amp; gaslighting me. I quickly realized it was a mistake to get involved with him like I initially felt. I also found out he was still flirting &amp; talking to other girls. 

When things ended he was very nasty to me &amp; seemed competitive like it was more about winning vs coming to a compromise or peace. I quickly learned how immature &amp; screwed up he was. I stopped talking to him after that for about a year. O dated someone else in the meantime which looked promising but then that ended unfortunately.

I knew I didn't want to get back with the first guy, but there was a part of me that felt we had unfinished business &amp; was hoping we could at least remain friends. When we reconnected he did apologize to me but I could tell he was hoping for more with us. I knew if I got involved with him it lead to the same issues as I felt he had not changed. We hooked up a few times but I made it clear I wasn't looking for a relationship &amp; just got out of one with someone else. Eventually I told him I didn't think it was a good idea we kept sleeping with each other bc I'm doing a lot of healing &amp; self work not only from my last relationship but also from the situation with him. He understood but I could tell he was a little hurt &amp; disappointed. 

Since then I've felt he's tried to hang out with me &amp; he's even brought up the topic of marriage, he'll send me house listing. Its like he's trying to drop hints but ive made up my mind that I dont want to be with him. He also seems controlling &amp; possessive &amp; very jealous even over the smallest things. He doesn't really go out that much &amp; mostly stays at home even before Covid. Hes an extreme conspiracy theorist &amp; i feel like he keeps trying to change me into what he wants me to be rather than accepting me for who I am. Also I know he's still flirting with other girls. It's like I feel he's trying to get me to commit &amp; settle down with him while still keeping his options open.

After that I decided to distance myself from him more. He basically stalks my Instagram &amp; DMs me stuff from time to time. I've always felt a bit of obsession with him &amp; have even questioned if he is into voodoo. He also told me he joined a Free Mason group but didn't like it bc they were too hokie for him. He seems to have this need to control everything around him &amp; seems obsessed with power.

I met a girl at my university through a ballroom dance class. Things between us started by us practicing together on weekends, where we started to build a good connection with each other. She started showing signs of interest and the tension built up until one day, we were hanging out at school, walked back to her apartment, and ended up sitting in her room together, where I made a move and kissed her, to which she kissed me back and proceeded to cuddle with me until she had to leave for her play showing. At this point, I thought everything was good and we had a mutual interest in each other. 

At our next class, everything seemed fine and I acted normally and didn‚Äôt make any attempts of PDA or anything. But at the end, after everyone had left, I was saying goodbye as she had another play showing in 45 minutes. Since everyone else had left, I figured a hug was harmless, but she got very defensive and pulled away. I asked her what was wrong and she told me to grab my stuff and we went to her apartment again. She said she felt awkward about hugging in public and stuff. It seemed really odd to me because hugs never seemed like a big deal to me. I asked her if she was ok with me and ok with what we were doing and she said yes to both. She proceeded to kiss and cuddle me again until her play showing. 

As the week went on, I had one text conversation with her in which she seemed a little less engaged, but she still made contributed so I thought it was fine. At the end of the convo, I offered to take her out that Friday, to which she agreed. When Friday comes, she flakes on me saying that she forgot it was her sister‚Äôs birthday and was spending the day with her, but would still meet me for dance practice on the weekend. It bothered me that she would flake on me, so I said something about it when I saw her in person. She just kinda seemed to brush it off but still agreed to go out with me Monday after class. 

Monday comes and she does come with me after class. We got food and went back to my apartment, where we had sex for the first time. Afterwards, we talked and cuddled and play-wrestled in bed for hours. She even initiated round 2. Since I had to get up early in the morning, I dropped her off at her apartment at the end of the night. 

For a few days, I felt great. I mean, she definitely likes me if she was willing to do all of that with me, right? Well, I began to notice that she didn‚Äôt start text conversations with me anymore, which made me a little suspicious, but I brushed it off thinking I was just being anxious. We practice again and I offer to take her out again the next Monday, to which she agrees. She doesn‚Äôt flake this time and everything goes pretty smoothly, except when we went for a walk, she got really nervous about holding my hand, which again seemed odd. Afterwards, she agrees to go back to my apartment, and we have sex again, followed by the same stuff from before and she spends the night with me. 

After this night, I begin to see the real behavior changes. She doesn‚Äôt initiate any conversation. If I ask her to let me know about something, she either tells me really late or ‚Äúforgets‚Äù. All signs point to her not being interested, but I guess I was in denial. Why would she sleep with me if she didn‚Äôt like me? She continues her games and flakes on me some more until I confront her about it. She says she wasn‚Äôt looking for a relationship and said her friends and people from our class commented how we looked cute together, how we should date, how they could tell she liked me, etc. This apparently made her decide to ‚Äústop giving off the vibes that she liked me‚Äù and it was only ever a casual thing for her. She then said she felt we should be ‚Äúnormal friends.‚Äù

This all sounded like bullshit to me. She knew how I felt about her and kept going with it. She would pull back, then sleep with me, and repeat. If she didn‚Äôt want anything with me, why go through all that? Why not say something, but instead push me to the point of saying something? I feel lead on and like she played with my emotions. I thought she really did like me, and everyone else did too. She broke my trust and I don‚Äôt even know what was real or fake in whatever it was we had. And she was so selfish about it. 

My best guess is that she just lost attraction at some point. I don‚Äôt know when or why, but it just hurts when someone you care about doesn‚Äôt care back. I wouldn‚Äôt call myself heartbroken, but I do feel angry and a little hurt over what she did.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,781890,public,self,Hate the games people play,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nffhgp/hate_the_games_people_play/,all_ads,6,

We are both competitive, so on the way to the alley, we kept talking up our game. When we finally got to playing, he wasnt doing so hot. In our practice round, you could see his frustration building up. Finally, we placed our bets and the new game started. I had bet that if I won he would have to give me a massage and if he won he bet that he wouldn't have to. Usually he is super picky with the bet, so I asked him , ""Are you sure you want that as your bet?"" He said yes. In the middle of the game I was drastically beating him. Around that time a romantic song comes on and I wanted to dance with him a little (we sometimes do that). However, when I reached to get him from his chair he seemed hesitant   but get up anyways, just as I was clasping his hand he pushed me away and told me to go bowl, to hurry up and finish my turn. Of course I got a little but hurt, but i decided to channel that energy to completely demolishing. Which did happen. He was very very upset, saying I hate this game and he didnt want to massage me. That ended up putting me down. So I became withdrawn. The more we talked to try and fix it or atleast communicate the worse it got and the angrier he got and the sadder I became. I love bowling, but at that point I didnt want to play anymore and simply wanted to go home.

It seemed like we werent getting anywhere but I was still hoping for the best as did he. But that's not what happened. It soon erupted, we weren't seeing eye to eye. He couldnt understand why I was acting the way I was acting. He told me he was wanting to say certain thoughts that might hurt my feelings. At that point I was like bring it on. He said some bareable things but then he proceeded to show me how i looked in his eyes. I didnt like it so I left.

Like a day later we met up at the local park to talk about what happened and attempt to fix the situation. His whole point is he told me I wasnt going to like what he was going to say/do and that I [me] shouldnt give him bullshit over it. However my point is that demonstration of how I looked at that moment hurt my feelings and I wanted him to acknowledge I was hurt and apologize for hurting my feelings even if it was unintentional. After we got our points across we looked for solutions, and I pretty sure we came to a conclusion on his end but he refused to apologize, he ""didnt feel right apologizing"" is what he said. So we argued and before we went our seperate ways he said he would distance himself until I found out what my red flag was (if ever) and did the thing he wanted me to do.


Look I'm not necessarily asking for advice. I'm just hoping you'll help me find this supposed red flag. I dont see it much on my end. Sure I interrupted a couple times, and admitted to having some trust issues but I dont think it's those since we've already talked about them.

I also included additional (optional) details at the end. 


I‚Äôm a woman in her early 20s and have been seeing a guy pretty regularly the past 3 weeks. In total, I‚Äôd say we‚Äôve spent about 17-18 hours together. I know it‚Äôs still early on but he‚Äôs expressed that he likes me multiple times (verbally and physically). Even during the first date, he was already asking me to let him know if I‚Äôd be free a couple days from then. 

I recently took time to think and concluded I really do feel the same way. I told him. This was over text so I said I‚Äôd elaborate the next time we we meet in person (due to other reasons we were unable to meet that day but I really had to get it off my chest). I know it sounds like middle school crush drama. I should be able to say ‚ÄúI like you a lot too‚Äù without being so nervous. But I hate saying things I don‚Äôt mean, especially when it comes to emotions and feelings, which is why it took me longer to say it to him back. He is sick so he said he‚Äôll reply and express his feelings when we meet in person. 

My mind is just running 10000 miles an hour. I‚Äôm worried he‚Äôll tell me it was a nice thing to say, but that he doesn‚Äôt see it going anywhere with me. Or that I‚Äôll be rejected in one way or another. 


Additional details: 

I never really learned how to navigate relationships and my dating experience is more limited (I only started at 19). I grew up with an abusive childhood where we never said anything like that in my family and had a hard time trusting people when they constantly let me down. I‚Äôm not trying to blame all my problems on my upbringing and I am working on them through therapy, but I do know it has greatly contributed to my anxiety and tendencies to withdraw when I feel threatened or think about worst case scenarios. I also grew up with barely any physical touch and thought for a long time that physical affection was uncomfortable for me, but through this, it turns out I‚Äôm just highly selective. For the first time with someone, I enjoy our hugs/kisses and feel connected to him physically. 

Every time we‚Äôve hung out, even if it‚Äôs just on the couch, it‚Äôs been at least 5 hours. Time flies and I genuinely my time with him. Our conversations are so fun, lively, and my anxiety is low around him. I also see a lot of green flags in him so far: he honors my boundaries, was there for me when I had something rough going on, reminds me that I‚Äôm an amazing person who‚Äôs accomplished lots for my age and has a good future, supports my ambitions, values communication, isn‚Äôt afraid to talk about his own emotions/be vulnerable, and respects me as a person. He also supports himself on his own, has ambitions, and understands hard work. I guess the only thing is that he got out of a multi-year relationship in early 2020 that was toxic and bad for his mental health. I also got out of a 1.5 year relationship around that time that ended mutually.

Based on all the media that I've seen, the constant wave of celebrities undergoing physical composition transformations, and increase understanding of how biology works in school systems. Why isn't it as harsh of a priority for the average woman to work out in order to pursue a more desired version of themselves. 

Now I'm not going to pretend that there aren't men who blatantly ignore the suggestion to go get more active. But whenever I have been at a gym, a track, or even a group class there does seem to be more men than women in those fitness spaces. 

So despite all of the evidence, pop culture and social media demonstrating that increased fitness and a well-developed physique Garner's more desirability and attention, why isn't it a staple mainstay for single women to take fitness seriously? 

Now I'm from the United States so I understand that we have more obese people than anywhere else in the world. But still though it feels like being fitness oriented is dominated by men and lacks representation amongst women. 

Now I understand that working out requires increased knowledge of physiology, nutrition and training techniques. But I feel like for the first time in human history the information is all around us. There really is no excuse for not using it other than lacking willpower.  

And am I wrong in assuming that adherence to a fitness lifestyle and a nicer physique is going to help dating prospects?

&gt;‚ÄúNo one is truly ugly‚Äù or some variation.
Some people are ugly. Half of the world is below average in terms of looks. I‚Äôm one of those people, and I‚Äôm assuming a lot of people on this sub that are hopeless are also these people. To say that were not ugly despite no one ever being attracted to us physically, people telling us to our face that we are ugly, and getting zero matches on any dating site or app is just a lie. It‚Äôs a nice thought but no. A lot of people are truly ugly.

&gt;‚ÄúThere‚Äôs someone for everyone‚Äù
Unfortunately no. Tons of people die alone. Tons of people die virgins. Unfortunately there is not someone for everyone and a lot of us are doomed to die alone. Saying that we‚Äôll find someone eventually is just hopeful wishing.

&gt;‚ÄùYou should never settle‚Äù
Settling is a thing most people will end up doing. We all know the stereotype that women sleep with hot guys that they actually are sexually attracted to and then end up with normal average guys that are more stable. There‚Äôs some truth to it unfortunately. This is because they realize they have to settle. Guys also settle, most of us can‚Äôt get the hot girl we want so we settle for someone attainable.

Location:  Craft Brewery in town

Participants:  Me (28 y/o male) and Her (28 y/o female)

Overall Rating:  0 / 10


Girl was gorgeous.  Whipper snapper thin, 5'2"" maybe 110 soaking wet.  The date was originally scheduled at 6.15 pm but she texts me at 5.00 saying she's out of work early and if I can move it up an hour.  I'm not doing much at the point so I acquiescence and start driving to meet her.


She's wearing decent enough clothing and had a corner bench at the bar when I arrived.  Same cute girl who'd asked to meet me last Friday. So far we are doing alright, she's not a catfish!


Start off with a hug and the body language is interesting.  I'm getting a sense of Asperger's from the girl.  Her facial expressions are on point but she's unable to meet, make, or keep eye contact.  Figured it has to do with the nature of her work - she's a Ph.d in Mech Eng.


Conversation is smooth, where she lived, who she works for, the annoying traffic around our town.  She doesn't say anything offensive, rude, or surprising till about an hour into the 'date'.  Looking down at her iWatch she tells me her boyfriend is cooking her dinner and she's gotta leave soon


I'M FUCKING DEAD AT THIS POINT.


A mortified expression briefly crossed my face.  I'm hoping between her glance down at the iWatch and her Asperger's she didn't notice me politely cursing underneath my breath and my facial reaction darken.


Apparently she spent the entire weekend traveling with her boyfriend too, so she is genuinely in a relationship and go figure this wasn't even a date.


Regardless, I tabbed out / paid for us (I had 3x beers and she had 1x) and we left soon thereafter.  She thanked me for picking up her tab after the fact and we talked briefly about what her 'boyfriend' had cooked for her (Pasta Carbonara in case anyone wondered).


Well...Ummm....Needless to say there won't be anymore dates with this girl.  But I do have her number and we may hang out later

To preface, I love my girlfriend. I‚Äôm so happy to have her and she‚Äôs genuinely one of the few things keeping me somewhat happy and sane right now and she‚Äôs genuine one of the greatest things to happen in my life. I really do love her. 

However, she sometimes somewhat frequently does this thing where she gets into bouts of sadness and jealousy where she would be insecure and say stuff like how I might like other girls, she‚Äôs not pretty enough, she doesn‚Äôt mind if I like other girls, etc. She‚Äôs particularly hung up on this one girl (back in middle school) who I use to like for only about a year and who I‚Äôve asked out (and got rejected by) but never dated.

Don‚Äôt get it wrong, she loves me and this only happens sometimes but if I‚Äôm being honest, there are times where it does make me feel sad and insecure that my girl is thinking like this.

But all I know is that it doesn‚Äôt feel good at all. I just don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm good enough for any girl on the planet, like I have nothing to offer in terms of looks and other things. It‚Äôs even worse that I don‚Äôt have any friends at all in my life, so outside my parents I‚Äôm socially isolated. I feel like social anxiety and my utter social ineptitude has ruined my life. I‚Äôm also 5‚Äô8 and have never been in good shape at any point in my life and have had a hard time with my weight (I‚Äôm 230ish rn) due to a complete lack of discipline and a somewhat picky diet. I also haven‚Äôt been back to school in a while, have been unemployed since November 2019, and still live with my parents. Basically I feel like a massive failure. And I feel like my own neuroticism prevents me from trying to better myself. 

Never having a girlfriend sucks. It‚Äôs super lonely to never have someone who loves you to spend quality time with. It‚Äôs not just about getting laid.

And even with all that I feel like my complete inexperience with women only makes me even less desirable. I can‚Äôt imagine many women wanting to be some mid 20s or older guy‚Äôs first. Which is partly why I lament missing out on teenage love so much. Probably doesn‚Äôt help that I was watching some romcom anime and reading manga that made me feel worse. Especially when there was sex and virginity loss involved (these aren‚Äôt hentai, fyi but sometimes some of the stuff I see on r/wholesomehentai makes me feel awful and lonely). Horimiya and Kaguya-sama: Love is War being examples (both main couples, in high school, make it official when they finally have sex). It‚Äôs not just the sex part that triggers my depression in this (things like kissing, cuddling, holding hands, or simply seeing close friends have memories together also kills me inside), but the sex part is the worst since I view sex as the highest showing of affection and intimacy between couples, and I have always wanted to do it with someone who loves me and I have a connection with. I wish I could have lost it with another virgin that I was dating so we could be each other‚Äôs firsts and explore together. Especially since now my inexperience is something I feel like if I ever have a chance with a woman at this point, I‚Äôll have to lie about it. It‚Äôs all reminders of missing out on young love in high school and college, reminders of how alone I‚Äôve been for so long. Missing out on young love is something that has felt like a tremendous loss in my eyes. Hell not only anime can upset me but also other forms of media showing romance (Stranger Things for example made me upset when I saw the entire main cast start dating at like 14), or seeing couples, or reading posts on this very subreddit.

It‚Äôs just something that makes me feel sad, not ever having a sexual romantic relationship with a girl who loves you to pieces.
