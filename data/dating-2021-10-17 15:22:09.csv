0,qa6wc3,1634502212,Asking permission for the first kiss?,"Would love to hear y'all's opinion on this.

Been on a few dates with someone and I couldn't really tell if she wanted platonic or romantic.

Vibes were better last night and I (M) said ""You're a hard lady to read and I've had a great time everytime we hang out. Will I make it weird if I kissed you?"". I didn't want to just gun it if she wasn't into it and just be respectful in COVID.

How would you react to that? Should I have just went for it?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qa6wc3/asking_permission_for_the_first_kiss/
1,qa6wop,1634502241,My personal dating rules — thoughts?,"Just wrote this out for fun. I’m a young woman and very much a relationship person while most people my age are looking for hookups, so I’ve found success with these. All based on personal experience. 

1. If a guy is into you, it will be obvious. This is so important to me to not embarrass myself or waste time. If you’re getting mixed signals, it’s a no, and even if he becomes more interested in you, why would you wanna date someone who’s not crazy about you? 

2. Talking about crazy exes is a huge red flag. Personally, I don’t know many crazy women but I know a lot of men who are really manipulative in relationships. And if he was unlucky and actually did have a crazy unstable ex, if he’s talking about her to me then he’s probably not over it and needs to work on healing.

3. If a guy brings up sex at all while you’re talking, even jokingly, he’s not that into you and is likely just looking to hookup. 

4. Always split the bill on your first few dates because unfortunately with shitty dudes it can establish a power dynamic where he feels like you owe him something — sex, further attention, anything. Shouldn’t be that way but it is.

5. Generally, no talking stages. Super common with people my age but I think they’re a waste of time. If we haven’t planned a date within a week or so it’s not gonna happen.

6. Lovebombing or saying any variation of “you’re not like other girls” is a huge red flag. No explanation needed.

7. If they say any variation of “I don’t like labels” or “just looking to see where things go”, they’re not the one. In my experience, that means they want girlfriend privileges without girlfriend commitment and will hold themselves to a different standard than you when it comes to committing/talking to other people. 

8. If a guy is weird about you having completely platonic friendships with other guys, he probably thinks about fucking all of his female friends and assumes other guys do the same. 

9. Finally, never make exceptions for people. If you see a massive red flag, don’t ignore it because they’re hot/exciting/unique. You will get hurt and regret it 1000%. I’m embarrassed thinking about the treatment I put up with in past relationships.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qa6wop/my_personal_dating_rules_thoughts/

5,qa7ovj,1634504666,It’s so hard to online date people from the same ethnicity,"So when I used to be on dating apps I used to swipe right on everybody I didn’t care about religion or skin colour or whatever but after my first relationship and having kept it a secret from my family I realised I should try dating people only from the same ethnicity. I also had other dating apps but now I focus only on muzzmatch since it’s easier to at least find people with the same religion. But what I noticed is that most guys only have 1 picture, the app forces you to write a bio of 100 letters and most people just put in: “I don’t know what to put here”, “I’m forced to write something here”, “wiatvritaveicugwkdochevs” and “if I write something here we have nothing to talk about”. In sorry but writing a bio is not that hard like the bare minimum is just your job and hobby’s. So I decided to just pay no attention to the profiles because I noticed I swiped left on everyone because of their lazy profile. But then I got the worst conversations I ever had and they all the same... 

Him: Hey 
Me: Hey! 
Him: how you doing? 
Me: Im good I’m going to ikea today what about you? Any plans? 
Him: I’m doing nothing
Him: got Snapchat? 
Me: No I don’t and rather talk here a bit before I give my socials 

And then after that if he doesn’t ignore I always get one of these questions 

“So where you from” 
(The city I’m in is in my profile and whenever I say it’s on my profile they say oh yeah, ignore me or get mad)

“How long you single” 
(Seems like a normal question but they ask this at the start to see if you ever had a relationship and then assume you aren’t a virgin and immediately sexualise you) 

“What you doing” 
(I hate this question the fucking most. Only people on that app ask me that white guys never asked me that stupid question. Whenever I respond to that like I’m doing laundry what about you they always respond with I’m doing nothing. Okay so you staring at a wall and doing nothing. So of course I ask them something back and then few messages later they ask me again what are you doing. The same thing I was just doing? Honestly if you can’t even hold a conversation why bother being on a dating app. 

I understand why woman don’t bother with dating apps. It’s the same boring conversations. I try spicing it up by different replies but it’s always the same replies. Their profiles are the same and their names. Heck they even look all look the same Beards, same hairstyles and same clothes.  

I’m 21 and I’m already preparing myself for staying alone forever. I’m not meeting new people and never been approached either. These boring conversations are only driving me mad.

17,qa8usf,1634508342,Red flags?,"Hi everyone. I’m a 28F that has been dating a 32M for a little over a month now. We speak every day, gone on 3 dates and have a 4th one planned. 

The guy I’ve been seeing first brought up his ex a few weeks ago when he mentioned through text that he was meeting up with a friend but he jokingly said he was worried he was going to get yelled at because he was supposed to walk away from his ex basically but he didn’t. I asked him about this situation and they basically broke up 5 months ago. I’m not sure how long they were together. He said he was trying to work on things she had asked him to, to make their relationship work but it wasn’t enough so he finally broke it off. He claims he’s over her too. 

The second time was one he sent me a meme saying, “Your ex is in jail. What two words would you say?” He said, “Ha. Ha!” I ignored it at that point because I wasn’t sure how to respond but I thought it was kind of immature to be honest. 

And the last time he was talking with his friends about something and he said something along the lines of, “I need to stop it with these crazy females (meaning my exes.” I really wanted to call him out on it but obviously I wasn’t there for their relationship so I don’t know the backstory. But to me, a person who is mature takes responsibility for their actions and what happened in their past relationships and doesn’t mad mouth their exes despite what happened. 


My question is, how would you handle someone who: 
1) refers to their exes as crazy? 
2) brings up their ex/exes a few times? 
3) do I end things now as this is kind of a huge red flag?

18,qa8vq2,1634508426,Practicing patience in dating?,"Hey, all!

I've been dating this guy for 2-3 weeks now, and we've been on dates. We've both told each other we're exclusively seeing each other/screwing each other. So far, no fights/arguments. 

It's just I'm wanting more, but I know it's still new, and I know what plagued other potential relationships was my anxiety, and having conditions for things (like texting good morning/night all the time, if too much time elapsed, asking why, etc.).

For example, my date saw his family this weekend, and he told me he wanted me to see him the Thursday before that happened-- we did, and it was great. He apologized this Saturday for not returning to my text Friday, and I was like, don't worry, go have fun with your family! I'll be around. So after that, he doesn't text back, so I text him, ""hey, hope you're having fun! let me know when you get back in town."" He does, I ask if he wants to hang, and he says he has plans with a friend, but he'll let me know tomorrow when we can plan our next date.

The beginning, we would talk all the time. Maybe now he's ""comfortable""? So I'm not as much as a priority. I mean, I'm glad family/friends are taking up that space and not potential lovers. But, does what I'm saying make sense?

Tomorrow is also our birthday (yes, we have the EXACT same birthday), and I'm just not feeling it. I really like this guy, but I miss him wanting me a lot more in the beginning. Now it's like, hey, I'll talk to when I'm not busy with family and friends! Which makes sense. I don't get the sense he hasn't stopped liking me. 

One factor might be his job. He works from 6 in the morning all the way through 3-4. He tells me every day it stresses him out and he hates it. Our last date was still incredible, but he was pretty restless/sleepy because of his work. And maybe seeing his family the whole weekend and now his friend is just tiring him out.

I don't know. Am I looking too much into this? Of course I don't wanna bring anything up now because I don't want to seem clingy. Maybe I have to be okay with being away from him for a bit?

20,qa8z6f,1634508749,Feeling on thin ice with the guy (39M) I'm (35F)dating. Next steps?,"He and I had....I wouldn't say a fight....sort of a passive aggressive back and forth last night. 

We were texting about 7 or so, and I told him we needed to get together....I didn't mean right then, more just in general...his response was that I should have said something sooner, so that we could have gone to dinner. But that it was a little too late to come over to his place (I live with my parents, so he knew i wasn't inviting him over to mine.)

Probably immature of me, but I got annoyed. He's invited me over much later in the past...(usually, the answer is no, but still) And 7 at night, isn't late. So, it came across to me as an excuse, though I didn't tell him that. So, in an effort to be forthcoming, I shared my frustration. His response was that I would be getting home very late, after midnight...which...fair enough. I told him that didn't bother me to come home that late...but his reasoning made sense to me. Ok fine.

We continued texting, and the texting turned...flirty and sexual. Not unusual. So, in the course of sexy conversation, I ask him what he was doing this morning, winky face all that. He said probably sleeping in. I could text him early if I wanted, but he might be sleeping in. And...he didn't think he would be able to hold out much longer, would probably be , er, spilling his load last night, so he probably wouldn't be up for anything today. He didn't say that last part, but he did tell me he would be needing to come last night, so the last part was implied. 

Well...this just set me off. I went off on a bit of a rant. About I shouldn't have to beg him to have sex with me and how humiliating it is to get turned down, and so on and so forth. I wasn't really humiliated, persay....more just annoyed and being dramatic. Plus it's been a while, and I get cranky when I'm horny. So, it was just spewing textual diarrhea. Which...I regretted immediately, of course. 

His response....after a good while was that maybe I shouldn't be dating him anymore. He doesn't have any intention to humiliate anyone. I responded with a more measured head...he said he did want to have sex with me, just not right then. We talked a bit more, and seemed to get past the worst of it. 

We continued texting, and it got flirty again. Well.....then around 10:45 pm, he's like...""Get over here."" I was just like, ""Haha, I thought you didn't want company?"" He said I could come over, but he just didn't want any overnight guests. Sorry, what? I wouldn't be getting there till after midnight....which means I would be leaving 2, 3 am in the morning? So...I declined. I told him, it was fine...and really, it was. At the time. 

We continued talking the rest of the night. We did some video chat (he appeared to be alone in his bed). He came, I didn't. Which was slightly annoying. But...still, it's okay. I did send him a half annoyed message about not climaxing, and he replied. But, the more and more it festered....the more and more I thought about it....the more messed up I thought it was that he would effectively kick me out of his house in the middle of the night, for me to drive home an hour+ in the middle of the night....rather than let me stay over. And...the more I thought about it the more mad I got. Who would do that to someone they cared about? Heck, who would do that to someone they liked even a little bit? It seemed like common decency to let me stay out of concern for my own safety. 

I sent him a reply this morning to his last message. And I haven't heard from him since. Which is fine....we probably need some space. I do worry that...maybe that rant of mine, and his reply...even though it seemed like we got past it last night, I worry that maybe given time to think, that he will be even more bothered by the whole exchange. I worry that I crossed a line that it will be impossible to come back from. 

What should I do at this point? My thought was maybe to take a step back, give it a few days before reaching out to him. Maybe he'll message me in the meantime. Maybe not. But...then I wonder if I should just act like normal, easy and breezy and fun...so that it's like....no big deal, ya know? I'm worried that not talking for a few days will only make things more tense and draw attention to last night. Maybe talking sooner, we can move on sooner, does that make sense?

I don't hear women talk about crazy men, although perhaps our version is complaining that men are dicks. 

As a feminist, I have my own opinions on why some men talk a lot about crazy women. But in my experience, when a man has described what's happened with a ""crazy"" ex, it's usually the case that he's done something to trigger her and she's reacted by expressing that she's upset (whether proportionately or disproportionately), then he's been confused about what's happened.

But that's from my perspective as a woman.

28,qa9kt6,1634510744,Friends that lead to benefits…help!?,"I’ll try to make this short. I (F32) have been friends with a guy(M28) for about 4 plus years. Initially we were just coworkers who I found out I actually went to college with his older brother. Anyways, we were both apart of a group of coworkers and we all would go out after work. I always felt bad for him because of his relationship troubles, and he felt he didn’t have true friends so I did my best to give him advice on whatever his issues were. Slowly the group of friends started dwindling and it ended up just being me and him and maybe a few others chilling. Fast forward to now, he is my only friend who will go out with me, I wouldn’t have to go alone places anymore. On a drunken night we hooked up. I felt so bad because I know that I don’t want to be anything more than just friends. He came out and told me he would like more from me but is basically settling for the friendship, just so I could be in his life. I told him straight up that it was a no, and he kept telling me about his anxiety and what not. I felt guilted into continuing the friendship. He still continued to reach out consistently, I couldn’t escape him. Long story short I decided that I was going to do what I wanted (I have been single since 2014 with minimal dating). I felt I wanted to be selfish and against my better judgement I continued the fling. I feel guilty and I keep asking myself could it work? My answer is typically no. 

I’ve already judged myself, so I don’t need added judgment! Thanks!

I (m24) was approached in August by a girl I had liked for years (f20). We started talking and there’s was a kiss involved. In the 3 weeks we talked I fell hard for her as it felt like a personal victory against myself after all those years ( I even rejected another girl who approached me). 
After a bit I started to feel that she was falling for another guy ( m19) and after time I asked her if we were on the same page to which she answered that she didn’t want to commit. 
I fell into an incredibly sad state only recently grew out of it. 
Today the guy posted a story (I don’t follow her anymore) where he ( in poor taste) is laying shirtless under a pair of thighs (which I’m fairly sure are belong to the girl, as they were one of her most recognizable traits)

That gut feeling that has haunted for 2 months is back again and I’m not willing to feel like shit for someone who rejected me, how do I stop it?

Basically I knew this girl from high school and we were on good terms. Come college we meet up a few times and I end up asking her out. She says yes, then ghosts me. That was over a year ago. I never really followed up because I knew if she wanted to talk it’d be as simple as sending a message. 

Turns out she is in several of my courses and extracurriculars this year and we see each other 4-5 days a week. Neither of us have approached the other and we kinda pretend the other person doesnt exist. It kinda makes the day to day things stressful. No eye contact, keep walking forward, that sort of thing. 

I want to clarify that I moved on pretty fast and focused on other things. I hadn’t seen or had any contact with her for over a year.

And then the other day she sends a message asking about my opinion on something. Uses exclamation points and happy faces. I havent  responded and I dont know if I should. I feel like some explanation is needed but dont really know what to say. It kinda sucks because we had a lot of similar beliefs, interests and world views. 

I dont know (obviously lol). I’m pretty conflicted and would appreciate some advice. If I do nothing, Ill keep seeing her very frequently for the foreseeable future and that’ll generate more awkward scenarios. Is responding to her a good idea? What should I say?

I don't pressure him into talking to me because I know we all have busy lives. I simply tell him we can talk when he's free. He says he's not busy and wants to talk, but then he takes hours to reply and that just makes having a conversation hard.

We are both looking for someone who shares our values and whom we can build a real relationship with. He has a good career, is close with his family, and helps out around the house (he cooks and cleans). We we text pretty much daily (other than the one time he didn't text for a few days but apologized for being MIA and said he was dealing with personal stuff). During these few days, I thought he ghosted me, so I went back onto dating apps and matched with 27M. We really hit it off over text; he's really funny and we share the same sense of humor. He is very straightforward and says what's on his mind, and I find that very refreshing. I feel like I don't have to worry about him playing games. He said he doesn't see the point in doing that, and I appreciate that a lot. He is looking for a relationship as well, but isn't in a rush. However, I discovered that he is thinking of moving out of the country in like a year or so, so idk how that would work if this does go somewhere. We've been on one date so far, and I'd say it went well conversation wise. We had lots to talk about and laughed a lot. We only hugged at the end.

The conversation flowed pretty easily with both guys and they expressed wanting to see me again.  26M asked me to hang out next weekend, and 27M asked me to see a movie.

Should I go on a second date with 27M and see where it goes? Is it too early for me to ask 26M if he's seeing anyone else/where he sees this going?

66,qaclvs,1634521345,Help,"Hey I am new to Reddit and could really use advice. 

I been dating my boyfriend for 3 plus years due to Covid we did not get to visits each other or celebrate our anniversary. We both go to college and we live in different states. We are in a long distance relationship and we make sure to have good communication skills, we call every day and play games together and watch shows. 

I am on fall break and I decided to go see him but he planned a wonderful trip to Boston and invited me. He was there for a conference and want me to come and explore the city. I was so happy since I did not see him since August. With work and classes we did not get to visits. I was hoping to spend time with him on our trip. 


I know he has the Conference and he there all day. I am on my own exploring the city Boston and having fun. But…. When ever he is done he wants to hang out with another girl. They went to a fancy dinner and a bakery and did not invite me. All the free time he has he spends with her and when I try and make plans he says he wants time apart. When he gets back he just wants to sleep and not talk and he wakes up and I make him coffee and he leaves. 

I am enjoying the city but I feel alone and I came to spend time with him but I feel ignored. I tried talking to him about everything but he stood me up!!!! I waited half an hour and he does not text me back. We been dating 3 years and this behavior is out of no where

73,qadfdc,1634524231,Is he worth it?,"This is going to be long. Going to delete this in 24 hours.

I met my bf at work and was pretty charmed about him. It was cute at first, in my eyes at least.

We seem to get along pretty well, we both are pretty much gamers. (I myself am not that much but I play) 

I get worried when he doesn’t est so I always bring him food or make it. I’m still working on trying to give him space, because he values his space.


He told me about his past experiences where he was hurt a lot, from mistakes he made to what others did to him.

Was divorced and claims that he was being used and tricked into going to the army, other relationships involved him getting serious with one girl, only to break up over lack of communication, and his worst was when he dated a girl only to get away from his mom, (according to him and many others, she’s a horrible person.) and immediately moved in with her and everything. Only to dump her with in a few months, and then started dating me.

There were flags.
There are flags.

And I feel like I am overlooking them because I’m just… being stupid.

The first few flags, he doesn’t seem to sympathize with my own personal pain and I let that go because I feel like it’s not worth, nor does it compare to his issues, and we all have our own issues really, for some people they only have room to worry about their own.

The more embarrassing flag for me is when he doesn’t want to see me after we *ahem* do it. For the first few times I let it go until after and he told me he would like to be alone. I numbed the feeling by then so I expected he wouldn’t want to see anyone until I teased him. “So you don’t want to see me?” 

“Not unless you have some alcohol, but yeah I’d like to be alone.”


And honestly that hurt. Eventually I pretty much gave him a cold shoulder until we talked it out. 

He doesn’t consider this gaslighting but he started to explain himself with “you need to learn about how other people…” (that’s not everything of what he said, I checked out when he tried to hold my hand, so I couldn’t focus)

There’s a lot more flags I could talk about but the most recent one would be When I told him he might have to talk to my dad while I had to go visit him alone, and he was absolutely apprehensive to talk to him. 

I’m clueless about guys. So when I looked online “why doesn’t he want to meet my parents?” 

And the answers were blunt and simple.

He was never really interested in me.

I kind of thought this. For the entire time we were dating I couldn’t help but have these doubts. 

He says I love you, and I can’t compare. I won’t say it if I don’t mean it but what about him? His actions make me think he does, but at the same time he makes actions that make me think he doesn’t. 

The talks we had before resulted to him saying “you should have talked to me first before trying to confirm it with others.”

And I feel bad talking about this on here.

Am I being stupid? For dating him, for not talking to him first? 

I guess what this really comes down to is me hoping someone would tell me something because I’m hoping my doubts in him aren’t true.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qadfdc/is_he_worth_it/

We're both 16, and I have two classes with her and we both play soccer. In one of my classes, she stares a lot. Like, every day a lot. She will be laughing with friends and glance over, her eyes will linger when she glances over to look at the whiteboard, or sometimes she will outright just stare for 8+ seconds. I know she is looking at me, as we are kinda spaced out in that class due to covid, and there was a time when I was working in the hall, and when she walked by she glanced back at me.

In the other class, I sit with my back to her but close. When we get assignments, we're allowed to work together so I talk to her then. Normally she's shy, but she will laugh if I say something funny, but other people do too so idk If that means much. She notices stuff like if a sub says my name wrong, and if I ask the group a question at large she will be the one to respond. We talk about stuff like plain schoolwork, other people, weird teachers, and she never was nervous then, the conversations never stalled or anything too.

So, I ask for her number in class, she gives it to me and I texted her tuesday night, and she didn't respond. The two days after she still was staring, and still was friendly and talkative in class. So I planned to ask her friday why she didn't respond, but she wasn't at school. I ask a mutual friend to text her, and that friend hasn't gotten a response yet either. I know she checks her phone often enough to have likely seen the messages, and the number I have is the actual number. She also had her phone with her the two days she was in school. I would just wait the weekend and ask her monday, but we have a week off and the next time we're back in school is the 25th, so I can't actually see her in person for a while.

(23m)","All through middle school and high school I was made fun of for my really bad acne, for being short, and people saying that I'm ugly. I was the loner guy no one talked unless they needed answers for the homework. 

As I started maturing in college I finally found a style that suited me, a good hair style, and my acne finally started going away. And just recently 2 years ago I started going to therapy. All of this led me to have a ""glow up"". Basically anyone from my old HS that I'd run into would tell me I've gotten ""cool"" and attractive. I never knew how to take those compliments because I've literally got none before now, so I'd just brush them off. 

I've been working on my confidence and my shyness, and have even gotten some dates through tinder and cold approaches. I don't date often, I've probably gone on 10-15 dates in the past 2 years. Regardless, I usually find myself feeling confident approaching, setting up the date, and even on the first date. But as things continue I start feeling ""ugly"" and ""why is this girl even dating me, I'm not good looking or interesting"". It's all why why why why, and I can't think of anything else. I psych myself out and fall into a state of isolation where I think it's best I don't continue things, that she should find someone better, and that I'm not good enough.

I do believe that me being bullied and being called ugly when I was younger has somehow shaped me to be this way. I really want to start dating, but how can I? of course I can get a date, but I eventually start thinking how I'm not really all that cool or anything. 

I'm currently talking to 2 girls. One wants a FWB kind of thing and I'm just getting to know the other girl. I feel the same for both, I feel that I'm just not good enough, and that they should and can find someone better than me in every way. 

I've only ever had one girlfriend, which was back in HS and lasted 3 months. Although it wasn't serious, it affected me a whole lot because she used me as a rebound. I felt really used and just felt that I truly wasn't someone that would be good enough for any relationship. 

I really want to just be content with myself, that way I can finally have confidence whenever. Right now I'm just having one of those days where I feel ugly and unwanted in every way.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qaehdm/made_fun_of_in_hs_but_had_my_glow_up_but_i_still/

To begin with although I'm reaching 30, I have zero experience when it comes to dating, approaching women etc. I'm a bit of an introvert, wasn't really in a good state emotionally and due to that let myself go physically. But since two years I'm at a better place and lost weight. Looking better and feeling more confident about myself.

So last year due to corona measures and partnered sports being canceled I started out with a new activity where it was still possible to do partnered up drills. At this activity it's almost 99% of the time in male/female couples. One day there weren't enough women and a replacement came in who got partnered up with me. In short I can describe her as an attractive lady. One who I as an introvert would not dare to approach. Anyways, we had a great lesson together. Made stupid jokes which she could laugh about and got some small talk in to get to know her a bit. Then another lockdown came and didn't see her for 8 months...

FFW to this summer. At the activity I'm doing there are practice nights. So I saw the girl I was having a great lesson with someone and assumed it was her BF. Didn't want to ask her to partner up, so let it fly. But last September she was there at the practice evening and was sitting alone. I asked her and she immediately recognized me and I said I remembered her aswell because I had a great lesson back then. 

At the end of the song I wasn't really thinking of getting to talk with her because I thought she had a BF and sat down, but she instantly came and sat next to me. Wanted to talk about how I was doing, if I was seeing someone etc. As an introvert with no experience at all and seeking something longterm I usually don't want to talk too much about myself with someone I just met, but our conversation felt so natural and comfortable that I was fine to open up a bit. I asked her if she was seeing someone and she said no and that not long ago she came from a break up. The conversation lasted more than hour and afterwards she asked me if I had social media accounts, but I'm not really active at it so we exchanged phone numbers. 

We messaged each other the last few weeks and saw each other at 2-3 practice nights again. So last week I was with her at a practice night and offered to guide her back home for a short distance. She was fine with it, but wanted to eat something first. Couldn't join her because of work in the morning so had to pass. She gave me kiss on the cheek which I may have seen as a sort of signal and asked if I was coming Friday again. I wasn't sure about it and she was all surprised as if I had to be there on Friday. 

So eventually I decided to go on Friday. I saw her and she was with that guy again who I first assumed was her BF, since they were all playful. Decided to ignore her that evening, but when I was at the wardrobe to get something out of my bag she pinched me and talked to me. I wasn't really into it, but tried my best to act all cool. After the practice evening ended she left with the guy and was waving at me, but I looked away and that was it.

For this week we had something planned, but I don't know if I'm still down for it. Don't wanna be a rebound guy who is number 456 on the list, be left in the friendzone or be the sucker who she gets with after her partylife. Haven't messaged her since Friday and don't know what to do. Don't assume things and get to know her better? Ghost her and just let her go?

97,qaficf,1634532121,M[27] - need dating 101 advice,"**Background**: I have never ""really"" dated a girl before. A few months ago, a girl showed interest in me, heck! she even asked me out. Initially we started out pretty normal, talking about our interests, our dreams, etc. But after a while, the problem started - primarily because of my cultural upbringing. I have been the ""sex negative"" my entire life. I didn't even talk about these things with my friends; in fact I even felt downright awkward talking about things like sex, love, feelings, etc. So, when she tried to take things further, I would freeze - as in I literally couldn't think of a single romantic thing/suggestive jokes to drop in the moment. I couldn't even ask my friends for help, and searching online for help was waste! - all most people say is  ""the girl is already interested in you, then what's the problem take it further"" - but my problem is how? I felt like a complete idiot, as if I was living under a rock. Then a few months later she lost all interest in me and left.

So, I need serious advice on what to do when dating someone? What do people talk about on the phone, or while texting, or while walking on the street - I've seen couples while walking on the street, where guy keeps talking to her and all she does is blush? What were they talk about?

**PS**: please be as specific as possible, I tried of all listening to all the vague answers!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qaficf/m27_need_dating_101_advice/

99,qafk37,1634532316,Did I screw up?,"So I found out this girl had liked me for a while now. A few days ago she was telling me about how she was in a lot of emotional trouble lately on Snapchat. My friend who was also messaging her to figure some stuff out got left on read at the same time I got left on delivered. Just before being left on delivered I asked if it was because of her exams but she said that it was because of some other stuff. 20 hours later I had still been left on delivered so I messaged her saying that I hoped she was okay and was sorry if I did something wrong. I then went on to say that I had never told anyone about how I feel because of the drama involved (as everyone always pestered me about it) and because I didn’t know how she felt about me. I didn’t actually admit to liking her etc. I finished up by saying that I’d be keen to meet up again as we had already hung out a couple days before this but I didn’t want to pressure her into anything. This girl had also told my friend that she didn’t know if she liked me but wanted him to figure out if I liked her etc. Well it turns out that as soon as I had sent that message, her snapped popped up from 20 hours ago and it was her explaining everything about everything bad going on in her life. It was too late for me to delete my message as she had already seen it. A few minutes later she responded and said that I hadn’t done anything wrong and that she wasn’t sure how she felt and how she had a lot going on but was keen to meet up again. My stupid self then sent one of the worst messages which went like

 “Haha ok. Yeah sounds like you do. Hope everything goes well and just let me know when you feel alright to do something.”

To which I got left on seen. We’ve continued to talk on Snapchat but something feels different and her snaps seems much drier. Everyone has always told me that she liked me etc but I think I just screwed up big time. Prior to this she was very interested in me.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qafk37/did_i_screw_up/
