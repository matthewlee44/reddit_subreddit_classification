I really need some serious advice for this one. I don't know who to ask so I'm coming here.

Anyways. There's a girl from my building that goes to my high school. She's 2 doors from me and I see her every morning. I really think she's cute, so my mind was questioning my actions for 3 weeks. Countless nights of overthinking, should I ask her for a name since I don't know who she is. Weeks pass by and I finally decide to ask my friend who she is. She knew immediately who I was because she was asking about me as well for a few weeks. 

What my friend tells me is that she likes me and she would occasionally come around to see me without my knowledge just to see me. I was like over this world when I heard this. We gave each other a follow and we tried talking.

The First 2 days, it was kinda short and awkward. 5-minute talks not knowing what to say, not just me and she as well because they told me she was confused talking to me, kinda lost but from what I saw, she was into me? Maybe? The next day we were talking for about 4 hours or so, trying to get to know each other and it went well to a certain point. She asked me what did I notice about her since I see her every morning, and I answered some simple things like glasses, hair, etc. 

She also wanted to know the day before what was I talking about her with my friend, but my friend declined to screenshot our convos, or at least I was told so she didn't.

Back to the stuff, she called me in sort of a way crazy for these things. That I was ''weird''? I didn't respond with anything for like a short span of time, 10 minutes and she sent a text she was sorry. She was sorry because she is scared in a good way of me so she's not going out during class breaks. Right now after the message I was kind of disappointed, had an overthinking stare for 10 minutes sitting and asking myself what has just happened. 

Everything she talked about me with her friend she denied, because she sent me those chats just so I can see what was she saying about me. She likes to leave me on seen but she covers up with I'm blushing, I'm confused card. We both kinda have this in common because I've never had a gf and she never had a bf before. I know it's been a short period, but I really want to get to know her.

She does it to other people too yeah but when she does it to me it's just different, yesterday for example she threw another spitball at me, as usual, and when I looked back at her she said to me ''Are you mad at me? I don't want you to be mad'' and I said back to her no I'm not. I asked a female friend to go ask her about me (i know this is what  12 year old's do, but I don't want to ruin our friendship so yeah) to see if she likes me or not, or if she would do anything with me (like dating, or more than that) her reply was no i wouldn't, i got really sad after that, a bit mad too since it doesn't make much sense, and i just started talking to her differently after that. Next day AS USUAL she threw ANOTHER spitball at me and i just looked back at her and said ''hey im not really in the mood right now so stop'' and before i turn my head around she says ''are you mad at me?'' and i was like you know what fuck it, so i reply back ''yeah im mad at you, cause your mean and what you said wasn't nice'' and she replied what did i say? I reply back ''just forget it don't talk to me'' and she started acting different after that, like she kept wanting my attention, and this is where it gets confusing, after a bit she just stops, a minute goes by and i hear her say (i wasn't looking at her as i said she's behind me in class'' \*my name\* \*my name\* do you want to be friends? I look back at her almost immediately and I'm like what? she says well do you want to be friends? But she said it in a weird tone, almost as if she was being sarcastic, she did that looking down smiling thing girls do, and i just wanted to say to her so badly ''no i want to be something more than that'' so i just didn't reply with anything, i just let out a huge sigh and didn't bother looking back again after that. During breaktime i started chatting with a friend and we were far away from each other (me and her) and i kept looking at her and she kept glancing at me, and then looked away, we kept doing this thing until it was time for another class, inside, we were forced to change seats and she kept saying to me, come sit with me, or can i come sit with you? I'm like yeah sure (the teacher didn't let me) and we didn't chat at all for that class, and that's it, end of the day, i forgot to mention that i keep seeing dreams of her liking me back, not once in a while, like every single day, and i also care about almost everything, from how i look to how i act around her, i can't stop thinking about her. One of my most real friends shared his similar experience with his crush, he said to me that im probably just her toy and that she's using me, but i can't get over her anyways, i either look at her for no reason and get that love feeling i always get, or she wants my attention.

My boyfriend got a girl pregnant while we were casually dating.  I posted this on a different thread the other day and the hate that came back toward me made me reconsider how I navigate this. 

&amp;#x200B;

I do think that he without a doubt gave this girl the impression he liked her more than he did.  I think in that same time I was giving him the impression I liked him less than I did.  I think we have a group of adults that are all working on their own trauma.  I think I'm healthy but also accepting of chaos because of my life experiences.  And I think he never intended to be with her but liked the attention because I wasn't giving it to him...

&amp;#x200B;

So here we are, old AF, with him expecting a baby and us in the infancy of a relationship.  

&amp;#x200B;

If you felt a connection with someone and this ""surprise"" arose, do you think it's disrespectful of the baby &amp; mom to stay in the relationship?  

&amp;#x200B;

Would you reach out to the mom to make peace? 

&amp;#x200B;

Do you just stick it out silently and hope that the way the guy navigates it is something you can handle?  Keep your mouth shut because it's really not your situation?

I told my friend it is what it is, then I proceeded to continue with my day, not going to lie but I was a little bit jealous. Weeks later I heard they got into a fight and they don’t talk no more.

By the end of winter break, I felt that i already got over her, but the next day my best friend say that the girl still has feeling for me and she is still willing to try, after hearing that all progress I made to get over her completely vanish.

Following up to Valentine’s Day, I ask her to be my valentines, she said yes, after that we started kissing and cuddling again, weeks later she started acting cold towards me. I go up to her again and ask. Is everything ok? she said the same thing that she’s not ready for a relationship and let’s leave it as friends, I said ok and moved on with my day.

Next week she started to flirt with people in-front of me, I acted like if I didn’t see nothing and continue with my day.

My ex is commitment phobic and when we originally broke up, I did NC for 50 days before I decided to reach out to him. To my surprise, he was feeling exactly what I was - he missed me, he felt he made a mistake, he was scared to reach out because he thought I'd moved on, he wanted to get back together! I was so overjoyed and we talked through our communication issues and I reassured him it's okay to have doubts, his last relationship was very toxic, and he's not very experienced with dating, but that he needs to talk about it with me instead of running away. We agreed to this and he was so loving and affectionate we lapsed pretty easily into our old relationship.

After a few weeks, he freaked out again, same exact thing, and broke up with me. I was so confused and heartbroken because I thought we'd talked it out. But I think I was just expecting him to change overnight (or really, I guess, over 50 days) when commitment-phobia and avoidance is such a complex, deep-seated issue.

I'm at 50+ days again of NC and I still miss him terribly. He hasn't been dating (I can see his OLD is inactive still - that was how we met) and I know he's in therapy and hopefully trying to work out his issues. When we broke up, I told him that this is very clearly commitment-phobia and I don't think it has anything to do with me and our connection. He was so happy when we got back together he was crying and then WEEKS later, he freaked out again!

But the thing is, I told him that if he leaves again instead of talking this through with me, he will never see me again because I will not be strung along like this. Now I'm wanting to reach out again as he's posting sad things on social media and I know he's not happier without me and probably regrets his decision but I told him not to reach out.

Honestly, I wish I had just waited until he had contacted me the last time. I feel like I rushed him before he could really process the breakup and decide that I'm worth the fear that comes with commitment for him. Now that I've told him not to contact me I'm scared he never will. But I also don't want to rush him. From what he's posting, he's aware he's self-sabotaging and running from things he wants. I know you can't change attachment styles overnight and he is trying. But what do I do now? He HAS to come to me whenever he's ready, right? But what about that I told him not to? I just miss him so much.

He was the most amazing and sweet guy I ever met. We stayed casually friendly and distant the first couple months, and one day, he asked me out for dinner/drinks.

He then spent the night cuddling with me and it was the most magical experience ever. He told me he was single so I thought that after YEARS, I would finally have my dream man who I genuinely, really liked.

We almost slept together but I wasn't ready. However, about a week later he had another blonde girl in his room. I felt dropped and abandoned. I stalked him on social media and it turns out that this blonde girl was his GF of 2 years, and he stepped out to shout at someone the night he took me out so they must have been fighting.

Anyway, another couple of weeks go by, and his GF is apparently in the hospital for drinking and I hear the guy on the phone, telling her that he loves her, etc.

He then asked me if I want to go into his room to cuddle, since I'm right next door. He said it's not a big deal since we're roommates. I shouted ""NO""! and then complained that he takes her out, gets her nice things, etc. I feel I came off as too whiny and needy.

After I turned his cuddle request down, the GF was over the next day and then eventually she started coming over 3 days a week, 4 days a week, and almost every night. She brought him gifts, he took her to parties, weddings, vacations, and I had to deal with being in my room ALONE every night hearing them have sex next door.

I really, really thought he would choose me after cuddling (like why would he cuddle unless he liked me), so I don't know what I did to deserve such poor treatment. This torture of hearing them laughing, dating, and hanging out at my house went on FOR MONTHS until I finally moved out.

I still feel so hurt and jealous of this girl and still look at their social media, seeing them happy and smiling makes me feel like trash.

I (m24) last Sunday accidentally met a girl (f 19) I had matched on tinder recently, she started following me and we set to see each other this evening. 
I asked if she wanted to grab a drink ( here you can drink at 18) in the main city and after a bit she told me that it would be more comfortable for her to stay at the bar from my town (10k people) because it’s close to her home
She was nervous and I can tell that she is greatly affected from what other people think. 
The date went well (even considering that my cousins saw me and started rambling about beating up a guy). I told her that I would have approached her regardless of tinder and she seemed to be enjoying herself.
She told me that she had paused her account
When the date ended I told her to reach out to me for the next date to which she said yeah next time in “main city” (she probably didn’t expect me to know 99% of the people at the bar as apparently she doesn’t go out a lot so I felt her being uncomfortable about that)

When I got home I opened tinder and the match was gone (she told me during the date that she paused the account )but the ig follow remains

During our first date, i already i knew i liked him when i found myself giggling to his jokes, ""damn i hope he likes me back"". We continued talking and met up a couple times. We both have our own schedule, him being a resident so definitely crazier life than i could ever imagine. I really appreciate him taking the time and making effort to be better for me with the short period of time. He is very inexperienced in the sense of relationship and I didnt have much either, but having dated a few give me a general sense of what the red flags are/ could be.
Because of past experiences with men, i keep telling him a lot of pessimist outlook, and it kind of joke about seeing him in 2 years when hes done with residency. I got a bit drunk at one of the dinner and made a remark about i didnt care about hime being poor, as long as he was generous, as in i want him to try as much as he could and that is enough for me. He took it personal since that statement relate to his family problem. We spent the night and he talked about what happened to him and past trauma and we slept on it and everything felt fine after for me, i appreicated him opening up and just wanted to take it in and no comments. The next morning, i stayed after he left for work and accidentally found a note previous girl left him from his past relationship. It kinda triggered me as one of the guys i was with had commitment issues and kept trying to show that he was with other girls even though i didnt want to care and it was a terrible traumatic experience for me. I ended up lashing out incoherently to the guy im currently with through texts, and he was hurt by that. He finally sent me a text two days later saying that itd be better off if we stopped seeing each other romantically.

Tldr: i really regret letting my past trauma get in the way and felt like i couldnt even ask for another chance as he is the one to send the last word.

I don't know what to do, I don't know what to say, but I feel like I want to tell her a lot- but let me explain. (I'm an M22 by the way) 

There's this incredible girl that I've been meeting since December. She's my opposite: I'm an introvert, she's extroverted, I don't move around a lot, she likes to move, I'm more laid back, she has a bright and loud personality, and so on.  We went out around December and things went super great! We had chemistry, things were flowing naturally- things were perfect. At the end of the outing, we sat down and started talking about how we felt. The crucial part about that chat is that I wasn't open and clear about my feelings about her- I wasn't confident let alone assertive. She didn't like that... and thanks to that we both ended the night almost in tears. After that we didn't talk until late February... and when we talked again, things were the same.

It was as if we hadn't talked in a day. We talked on the phone and thanks to that phone call I noticed something that told me ""ok this is the one"". Her ideas on what a relationship should be, what it means for her to be a partner, exactly like me. We share the same views on relationships. So we went out again. I invited her intending to correct my mistake and show her that in that time I had grown. But something happened... something that messed up everything and made me question my feelings made me doubt. I receive a notification from a dating app. I texted her just to see if it was another fake profile like usual- I fucking regret finding out that not only was she a real person but she was the personification of what my ""perfect partner"" would be fantasy personified. She had the personality and qualities I've been looking for in a girl and it only took a couple of days for me to notice that. 

Now imagine you're in the team's huddle. Coach barked the final play and you were clear as day and ready for it. The time came, clock winding down, readying for the final shot- but while she was in the motion of taking the game-winning shot you started to doubt. You started to question you're self- you missed. You took a nasty-looking shot that hit the backcourt of the rim. That was me at the worst possible moment when I was ready to prove to her that I had changed. All because for the first time I had found someone that I was looking for. I said dumb shit, said things that didn't come across well... I simply messed up. 

I asked myself ""do I prefer to roll the dice, keep taking to the dating app girl, and take a chance at the potential of meeting my ""perfect partner"" fantasy personified? Or do I want something tangible and real, something with history and merit?"" Fantasy vs reality.  Something that I longed for vs something that I never thought I would like. Didn't take me long to realize that I had made the biggest mistake of my life. I felt sick, worried, anxious; you know that feeling in your stomach, those damn butterflies. I like her a lot. I can't stop thinking about her. And I want to be with her and I'm ready to make all the adjustments necessary to make us work no matter what. 

Were going out again to the movies. She invited me out this time. I don't know whether to talk to her before that or wait until that day. I also don't know how to express all of this and explain to her- if there's anything to explain. And she doesn't help; mixed signals and certain passive-aggressive talk aimed at me or so I think. Just makes things harder than they already are. 

Part of me is looking for some sort of advice or any advice at all, but this was mostly to let all of this out and to see other perspectives. A lot of rambling that I had bottled up.

I met this guy online and he asked me out. We haven’t been able to go out because of myself being out of town. He asked me to reach out once I was back. 

So, then I messaged him that I was back.. 

And he says this: 

“Yes, let’s make it happen 😊. Running late to work at the moment but I’ll check back in with ya very soon and we’ll make some plans”

Do you think he’s actually interested? Or seems interested?

I just don’t know if he’s leading me on.. what makes me think that is his “very soon” comment

Let’s call him Steve. On Saturday, he just broke up with her only two months to the day from graduation. She was sad the first two days and seems to be indifferent now and happy. However, all of his pictures and gifts etc.  are still up in her room. I am worried that she hasn’t processed this yet. I, on the other hand, have been constantly in grief. I have cried constantly every moment since and have to hide my tears from her. I’m not eating much and can’t sleep either. 

I thought this guy might have been the one. Steve was polite, but didn’t talk to us much. He’s a little on the quiet side with adults, but an A student, and kind of a geek. He’s active in sports and band, and she has always been there on the sidelines watching and supporting him.  Swim meets, tennis matches, band concerts, violin recitals etc. She was in marching band as a dancer, but not band class with the other students. Besides dance and in school clubs, her after school activities were supporting him. She is extremely shy and just has one close girl friend, a couple of acquaintances, and her actual best friend, Steve. They were over one another’s houses almost every day except one or two a week for four years. This year he took her to and from school every day. 

Last week, they hung out Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday. A few days were playing tennis with him (his interest not hers) Wednesday she bought her prom gown. Friday both families came together for dinner out. (Only the third time in four years. ) Saturday morning he texted he loved her as he always does. Saturday afternoon, he broke up with her VIA TEXT stating they weren’t compatible. Phyllis pleaded and Steve was cold and just said sorry. Steve has not texted her or spoken to her at school since. Prom tickets went on sale Monday. 

I feel like he cheated her out of the end of her high school experience. Although they went to prom last year and every semi formal minus Covid, he cheated her out of senior prom. She could go but I feel like there will be too many memories with his absence. He cheated her out of her final band banquet. Steve talks to everyone and she just talks to him and rarely a few other people. There will be a ceremony and a video of memories of four years of band. Only 19 seniors, so a lot will be footage of them, since they dated all four marching seasons. Graduation won’t be the same etc. 

How do you spend that long together and not even text to see how they are doing?  You couldn’t wait two months until after graduation. Or say I think we should break up, but let’s stay friends and go to prom. (He is not going at all. His mother and I have been communicating mainly her initiating asking how Phyllis is)

I am just so upset and worry that my daughter is going to have trust issues after him. Honestly, I always thought she would dump him. Besides the school activities, he is very boring. She’s very far out of his league in the looks department too. Right now, I no longer care about him just my daughter. She always did and always will come first. I just don’t understand the suddenness of it.  Every day, I think he will text her at least to check up as a friend, but nothing. He has lots of acquaintances, but he never did have any outside friends except her. I married my high school sweetheart and have been together 26 years.

He's experienced all the typical romantic stuff. Not only does he have experience, but he's way more experienced than a large majority of people our age.

I know I sometimes don't express myself very well or constructively without kneejerk reactions and getting defensive but I feel like posting this.  


I have a major chip on my shoulder, about my lack of ever attaining a relationship. Never having really dated before and obviously never having sex before either. It's a major source of guilt and shame for me and it adds to my lifelong poor self-esteem that stemmed from childhood. It makes me feel inferior and it makes me feel like I missed out on so many fundamental life experiences that most people go through by the end of their 20s. I just feel perpetually left behind in so many ways.   


I can't get over or move on from the idea of wanting a partner and needing that validation. I'm horny all the time as well so obviously that doesn't help much either so my sex drive makes me feel restless and frustrated. I see couples all the time or see posts or stories online of people meeting and dating and it just kills me on the inside. I feel so jealous, resentful and bitter about it. Even if I tried going out to do things and meet people, I'll just see more couples and that will just instantly ruin my day and start making me feel bad about myself. I'd also just be known as the Single Guy and guy friend that is perpetually single. But instead of being cool and fun and fancy free about it, it's just annoying and embarrassing for me because I would end up being Third-Wheel for couples.  


Yeah, I likely need therapy and sure friends would be nice but I can't get over the idea that I need a partner to fill a void in my life. I'm skeptical about the idea of friends because I've had bad experiences with people through out my life. You don't date or sleep with your friends(most don't, anyway) and more likely than not they're too busy to really be there for you anyway. I just don't really have that belief in friendship like others seem to, I've been poked fun at or put down a lot growing up and in HS and it translated into me being an outcast in various ways, I struggle to fit in and when I do try, I just end up not talking to them anymore because I feel insecure or inferior to them or they have a partner and they often bring it up and it kills me on the inside.  


I know that having a negative attitude is seen as repulsive(although I argue that we're conditioned to shut down all negative emotions and only allow ""good"" ones to show, which is repressive and unhealthy), but I can't mentally and emotionally get over the need for external validation in the form of a relationship. Especially now when it feels like everyone my age is in one or married, yet here I am still never having dated at all. It just makes me feel like an immense failure. It's not fun or liberating being single to me, it's just empty and very lonely going home everyday and no one gives a shit about you or how your day went.  


It's so easy to tell people to just get therapy and do other things and it'll just happen but it's not easy at all. It's extremely difficult, extraordinarily more so in my situation where I'm at literal rockbottom. Everyone has their problems, but I feel bitter and angry that I have to put in 500x more effort than others had to and not only somehow overcome my 20 years of trauma and depression and self-loathing but I have to do a Hallmark moment where I somehow get over myself and make friends who all will probably make fun of me behind my back and call me needy and annoying for being sad or emotional. I have to just get over everything on my own, and do all of this by myself. That's absolutely terrifying and overwhelming to me.  


Even if I did get therapy and could afford it, what am I supposed to do otherwise? A single 40 minute weekly session isn't going to take up my whole time. I can't date but I also just struggle meeting people and befriending them as well, so it just feels like until I ""fix"" myself, I have to isolate myself and stare at a wall in the meantime. I don't have anything going for me, I don't have a nice job or a college degree or even a car atm, which is something else I feel looked down on for. Because I don't have money or social status when it feels like everyone else does and everyone else had the opportunity to go to college and I got fucked over on that so now I have to live in poverty for the rest of my life.  


It feels like everything people say is contradictory. Some people say that I am fine and worthy of love, others think I'm a piece of shit as I am now and need to conform and become someone else entirely. It doesn't make me confident that somehow I am worthy or valid when it doesn't seem to be the case at all.  


Even if I'm distracted with hobbies or other things, the feelings of loneliness, inadequacy and insecurity just come back to haunt my thoughts again. It's just this never ending constant feeling of self-hatred, inferiority and longing for company, intimacy and validation. I do think that I bring positive qualities to a relationship, but that doesn't really seem to matter. Everyone tells me to love myself but I find the idea absurd, I can't even begin to comprehend it because it feels like self-delusion.  


People say to not have a scarcity mindset but it really does feel like time is running out for me and it feels like everyone else is dating but me and I'll just end up living and dying alone, and somehow expected to feel positive or happy about that. Not many would. It terrifies me daily that I'll never know what it's like to love or be loved. I have to spend potentially several years trying to fix myself while everyone else still gets to date and have fun, even if they're working on themselves too. Worst yet is that it'll be too much emotional baggage for anyone to want to date me and use it against it, I'm worried about that too.

The fact that she is super busy makes her very hard to get in touch with or get together with. It also makes her nearly impossible to read or talk to because we have no classes together.

Because it seems like for some guys it’s easy but for others it’s hard.
And I guess I’m “the others”.

I think it’s usually easier for extroverted guys but since I’m introverted, yeah no.

Also after you guys answer my question, please feel free to give me some advice because I think that’s needed haha.

Also just keep in mind that the “focus on yourself first” advice is straight up bullshit, I mean I understand that I’m young but if I want something/someone who/that will be a huge part of my life, I’ll might as well work on getting who/what I want as early as I can.

Do you guys get what I’m saying??

Hi there M(17). I have known this girl for about 5-6 years but have got to know her better over the last year as we are now on the same work-shifts and are in many classes together. She is 17 also. Over the last few months we have become more social with each other and have noticed that we have a lot of things in common and get along really well and can have fun together. But over the last couple of weeks there have been things that she has been doing differently which makes me believe that maybe she may want to be more than friends. Out of all the guys at work and in our classes I would be the main one she talks to or at least feels comfortable talking too.

This is what I have noticed.

1. She asked me if I was going to homecoming and if so if I was going with anyone.
2. When around me at work she becomes way more social than what she normally is with other workpeople.
3. She makes a effort to try to continue the conversation after she gets interrupted by something. This was evident today as she was wanting me to talk about everything that was in my head to be honest.
4. She kind of changes her tone in her voice when she speaks with me
5. At work she makes a effort in being near me and chatting to me while walking with me around the store helping out and trying to make it last as long as possible.
6. I catch her glancing and looking at me from either across the store and the class.
7. She waits behind for me at the end of work and and will sit near me at break in the staff room.

I met this guy online and he asked me out. We haven’t been able to go out because of myself being out of town. He asked me to reach out once I was back. 

So, then I messaged him that I was back.. 

And he says this: 

“Yes, let’s make it happen 😊. Running late to work at the moment but I’ll check back in with ya very soon and we’ll make some plans”

Do you think he’s actually interested? Or seems interested?

A few weeks ago I decided to approach this random girl, Problem is outside of school she was far away behind me going down, so I decided to wait around the corner to talk to her, Which I personally think Is fucking weird I don't know why I did that, So I complimented her shoes, she said thanks, and dipped before I could even start a conversation, then I proceeded to walk the same path as her home (I always go that way home I'm not following her), But in her perspective It seemed like I was following her, Even I would be creeped the hell out If an unattractive girl did this.

For context, my 22 (F) girlfriend and I have been in a long-distance relationship for a year now, and we are about to meet in a month's time in her home country. However, I've been feeling uncomfortable for months now with the idea of her remaining in contact with her ex-FWBs and old sexual partners.

I voiced this concern of mine and was met with ""You don't trust me!! I only talk to them in the event of an emergency!! You keep bringing this up!!"" and she had a complete breakdown. Now, for reference I have only brought this up two other times, one when we closed our initial close friendship to start a romantic relationship, and two when she had one of her ex-FWB around to help her set up her laptop and after I asked if she still had any sexual feelings towards him she told me that she couldn't stop thinking about ""his musky cock"". She also said that they joked around sexually (verbally, no physical contact), and I immediately told her I was not comfortable with that, to which she agreed to stop joking around with them for good. She has also had a moment where she put on a specific perfume and said that it reminded her of an old sexual encounter, and then another where she went out of her way to tell me that some lingerie she had was a gift from an old sex friend (she thought she was being honest and helpful) and that there was no sexual context attached to it; he just thought she'd look good in it.

I know she has been faithful and will remain faithful in this relationship as we love each other to bits, but I personally would be a lot more at peace if she just removed and blocked her old sexual partners. I do trust her 100%, I just don't feel comfortable with having old sexual partners still in our lives as I do not trust them, not even for a single second. That, and the mental image of them together sexually is not something I am comfortable with.

When we really talked about this topic again a few days ago she said that she doesn't even talk with them anyways unless there's an ""emergency"". So when she says that it really confuses me as to why it's such a big deal for her to remove+block them so we can look proceed into the us future. She did have one old sex friend help her out with a legal document (signature as reference for Tax card), but again, why can't she just have another friend do that? Even if he is reliable imo that's just not appropriate.

I am absolutely fine with her having friends of the opposite sex, in fact I've spoken with them many times online and get along well with them. Hell, there's even one that turned out to be an old e-date boy who shares hentai with her (he's bi and like her supportive girl friend now), but I still get along with them after he told me he never had interest in her, he was just following through with a dare (which I know is true). So yeah, I have never had an issue with her having male friends, it's literally just the old sex friends that I do not want to linger around, and I'm confused as to why she is so reluctant to wave goodbye to them for good. Sure, I understand that they are friends with her, but again, she has other friends, why is it such an issue for her to remove these old sex friends out of her life, especially since in her own words they are only there to talk to in case of emergencies.

At this point I don't know how to proceed, because I know that for me this is a boundary that I need to follow and have followed for me to be comfortable. But I also know that I cannot control her, her choices are her own to make. I also respect that she has her boundaries and I have mine, I just don't know whether I should put my foot down here for my own peace of mind, or whether that's going too far and potentially letting a great relationship die.

Now, we were both kind of drunk I guess, not much but still like tipsy at least and then he like started touching me even tho I was telling him to stop cuz his hands were cold and and I couldn't stand it.
But then I smh agreed to have sex with him in like a couple days idk why I did that tbh. So we texted like all day and hung out for coffe like the day in between cuz I wanted ti get a vibe from him if I wasn't drunk, and the conversation was okay I mean kinda fun I guess.

He walked me home and been texting constantly for these past couple days.
Last night he asked me to skip work and go over his place cuz his brother went out and would be late but I said no and then he tried ti guilt trip me several times before I just turned my phone off and watched a movie.
