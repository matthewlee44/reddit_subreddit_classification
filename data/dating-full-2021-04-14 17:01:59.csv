But let me vent just a little bit before coming for my neck.

It's unfortunately not the first time I go on a first date with a guy, have a blast, the dude texts me first telling me he had an awesome time, would like to see me again. Next couple days keeps somewhat texting (I initiate the convos, too), maybe even sends a picture at work, and then... Silence. 

Well, not really silence. Intermittent silence. Replies Start taking more and more time. One day, after a couple weeks that person pops up and seems excited to talk again, and I start thinking ""well, maybe I was overthinking it, and they were just busy"".  But soon after you realize, that's not the case. I test them asking them if they want to hang out, and decide if I should just block and delete.

I understand, they probably lost interest on pursuing anything with me, and I mean, that's fine. But it's confusing for me. When do I cut it? Are they really busy? Am I going too fast? Do I just assume we are not seeing each other again? If I say something about it, would I be rude? 

I honestly, and whole heartedly, prefer to just be ghosted. Seriously. Just. Ghost. Me. Vanish from my life. It's fine, no rancor. Or maybe communicate and tell me you just want to be friends. Or show me you are really not interested and shot every conversation down. I'll get it. 

But don't keep popping up and then fading again. Until I just have to block you one day because it's going nowhere. 

The obvious answer is to just keep talking and dating other people meanwhile, I know, I know.

On the other hand, whenever I ask to come over, he’ll either say he’s busy or he doesn’t feel like it. We never had a talk about whether or not we’re still officially “talking” so I’m unsure if he’s just actually busy (we’re both in college) or he’s just not interested in me anymore and is just using me for sex which I’m starting to think is the case. I don’t know if I should just end it or talk to him about it. It sucks because I know if I talk to him and find out he’s not interested in me anymore I would be broken. And once he stops texting me for sex, he probably won’t be in my life anymore, which sucks even more because I think he’s a great guy. But I also don’t like the feeling of being used anymore.

I was however in a scenario where the tables were turned. I was the ghoster and pulled away (2x), only to deeply regret it later.

Sometimes life isn’t linear. Sometimes other things take priority over dating. Sometimes you feel like you’re drowning from the cacophony of your life’s direction and dating falls to the wayside. Sometimes it’s not a reflection of how much you are into someone, but more of a mirror reflecting how your life is at a moment of time.

Does this justify it? No. Is it still immature? Yes. Could I have communicated what was going on with me better? Of course.

Nothing hurts more though than knowing you f’d up, going back to the person, and hearing it’s too late-that they moved on to someone else. That’s totally respectable- they had every right to and they are a catch. And then knowing that if I had told him what was going on then that would have made a difference.

So  I matched with a girl who didn't have a photo (or clear photo of  herself) on her profile. I only really swiped right because I liked her  bio. Well we texted and the convo with her has been good and I asked for  a photo of her and she gave me her instagram. Pretty much I don't  really find her attractive like she isn't ugly but she isn't attractive  either so what should I do. I don't really want to ghost her (if it can  be avoided). I thought of either A) Asking to just be friends (but could  maybe be a slap in the face as I think she is looking for a  relationship or B) ask her out on a date and see if it can be overcome.  Any advice from someone who has been in  a somewhat similar situation? I  just don't want to play with her emotions or anything.

I (30M) connected with this amazing woman (29F) on OLD almost 2 months ago. Before we went on our first date we chatted back and for for a couple of weeks since she was out of town at the time. Consistently we text each other 1 for 1 and usually respond in intervals of 8-24 hours depending on what's going on. She's a very busy person and does not respond in a regular fashion. I try to not to come across as clingy/needy by mirroring her or giving her space/time when responding.   


**1st Date** \- coffee, 3.5 hours of just talking and getting to know each other on the surface. Ended with me walking her to her car and giving her a hug. We indicated about a 2nd date and I followed that up with a text the next morning to confirm.

**2nd Date** \- about 5 days after the first - walk in the park in the evening - lasted a little over 4 hours. We talked about family, phobias, career, and just general topics that were deeper than the first. The walk ended with us making out for a short minute before we had to go our separate ways for the night. 

Here's a caveat - both of us had plans for out of town trips and such and so we had basically 3 weeks of us being away from each other. We sporadically texted back and forth - sometimes we went a few days without a responding. Again, kept it low key so that it was not overwhelming for her since I knew she was with family/friends on her ""vacation"" away from town.

**3rd Date** \- I took her to dinner. We talked about our time away and what we did. Then the topic of past relationship came up indirectly. I told her I was divorced after 6 years in a LTR (1 year of marriage). She indicated she had a similar experience but was not married, but out of a LTR but that was a couple years ago. I told her she was the best date I've had since I've been dating again and she indicated I'm the most comfortable person she's been with so far. We then went on an evening walk for the next hour. Ended with me driving her to her car where we made out again. I brought up seeing each other again and said absolutely but had plans for the weekend - so most likely the following week

Another caveat - I just got a puppy over the weekend (she knew I was getting one since our 2nd date)- have been a little overwhelmed with that (I broke down the other day because I thought I made a horrible mistake getting a dog). I know she's had a few social events with friends and busy with work. I'm trying to make plans for a 4th date that is low key again - something outside and maybe will extend it to her coming over to see my new little guy. But I'm also not sure where exactly we are in terms of dating. We've only had 3 in person dates, but have been in contact for 2 months. 

My heart tells me I want to be exclusive with her since she meets the expectations for what I'm looking for in a potential partner. I haven't talked with other women since our first date and I don't want to give her the impression I'm seeing other people. But my mind says I also do not want to put pressure on her and make her think I'm moving to quickly into DTR territory as I think that might push her away. The texting gaps are understandable to me given her personality and her use of a phone (she never had her phone out when she is with me), but the waiting for a response makes me anxious and she has not initiated making plans with me. I've had to do the date planning - which I guess is normal?

Ultimately, I want to see her more often. I am not so much concerned with having to text every day - but I want to have plans to see her regularly rather than suggesting a date and time days after our last date. More regular dates to me would mean we could move the dating process along to hopefully become exclusive and towards a committed relationship. 

But when is the time to bring exclusivity up? Do I let her initiate that conversation? 

I'm also not sure if I have an anxious attachment style. I'm seeing a therapist to hopefully get a good idea of what causes my anxiety issues, but it seems this need for communication is giving me stress and worry I should not really be concerned with.  But I think I just want to have a more defined idea of what her and my ""dates"" are moving towards. I feel like the waiting around for our ""next date"" is torture as I'm someone who likes to have things set in stone and defined.

Am I just overanalyzing the hell out of this situation and trying to hard?

I know this was a long read, so I appreciate those of you who take the time to read it all. 

TLDR: I've had 3 amazing dates over the course of 2 months of being in contact with a girl I really want to be exclusive with - but I'm not sure if it's too early to talk about being exclusive, or laying out expectations, etc. I have anxiety over communication and the time between dates because I'm not sure if that indicates her not being completely 100% bought in on me or not, but it has been giving me anxiety that maybe we're nowhere near moving along to something more than just ""dating"".",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,714568,public,self,"I'm confused about what stage of dating I'm in and I'm not sure what to do for the next ""date"".",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mqz9w3/im_confused_about_what_stage_of_dating_im_in_and/,all_ads,6,,,,510f5454-abc9-11e9-b4d1-0e0bbc704af6,dark,

Nice to meet you!

So as the title suggests, I’ve been single for a long time. I’m a 20 year old college student and I’ve really struggled with dating ever since high school. First relationship lasted a year and a half. I started young; a girl in my fried group liked me and I liked her. After things ended, however, I never really had luck with love ever again. I didn’t care for some time after but I realized maybe a year later that I wanted that feeling of love again. I did what most people would do: meet new people, try new hobbies, take better care of myself, and tried a dating app (in this case, Bumble.)

So I tried all of this, and obviously I’ve had no luck. I met the occasional girl I was interested in but... no luck. My feelings were never reciprocated. I’d get so close to a girl and then just get shut down one way or another, usually being designated as a close friend or like a brother. That’s ok! I enjoy being a friend or close to someone this way. But if that always happens, it starts to really get old. Not only this, I’ve been told I’m flat out ugly by girls I’ve met on dating apps and discord alike. I know I’m not the best looking guy, I’d say I’m around a 6/10 as a baseline but I don’t think I’m that bad. I’m already doing my best to lose weight (with some minor success believe it or not) and while that helps, I don’t feel any better emotionally. 

On Bumble, I received no likes. Like, none. I did bumble premium for a few months and only got the occasional likes which usually turned out to be either people who wanted my money for... “services” or deleted their accounts shortly after starting a conversation. I deleted my account with no likes, no dates, and conversations going. 

So yeah... I think I’m about done. But I don’t want to be. I want to find someone special and experience what I’ve been missing all this time. I know it’s not always a good time and that stuff can be difficult but I want that. I want to experience it, even just once. But as of right now, I can’t believe I’ll ever find anyone, and I’ll die alone. (I’m not in any danger by the way, it’s just how I feel.)

But I cannot pinpoint exactly what was missing. They looked just fine, they had good plans in life, the conversations were nice and they seemed genuinely interested in me....

I came her a while ago asking for advice after being rejected by the same coworker twice via text. Some background - high interest shown from both sides, both students, some flirting. We exchanged numbers and I pursued her quite aggressively (meaning I was always flirting or asking if she was busy, when she’d be working next, even face timed her once). Never dated before and rarely communicate with women I find attractive. She initially accepted my date offer but at a late time - specifically when restrictions were lifted. She started by making her messages short and further and further apart to where she ghosted me a few days and I texted her after two days hoping she was doing well. 

She sent a soft rejection mentioning she should’ve told me before that she was interested in someone else but didn’t want to hurt my feelings but Really wants to be friends. I told her I was disappointed but appreciated her honesty. She texts me back 4 days later saying hey sorry I didn’t even see your text til today but thanks. I had pretended to delete her number and she said laughed. 5 days later I told her I was kidding and hoped school was going well. 

1 week later, I told her I don’t know when we’ll see each other to say. I was interested in a few women but genuinely felt there was potential between us and if she honestly meant she only saw friendship between us I acknowledge her decision. She addressed me as ""homie, I really want to just stay friends, sorry if I hurt your feelings but I am not interested in being in a relationship with you."" I walked away and she then texts me back 2 days later blaming her friends for that text and it sounded super rude. Also, I am seeing that guy I was interested in so I hope everything’s cool and we can still be friends!! 

I texted her back two days later saying I’d appreciate some space. Now, I’ve made numerous mistakes in my approach as I’ve had one full month to reflect. She is now imposing a manipulative character at work. She tries to get in my face when walking by by showing a face of disgust at me. And even has told other people about this. When I posted this earlier I had a lot of people advising me to not ask a women twice and I now understand. 

I’m strongly convinced this women is narcissistic, her behaviour reflects this and she isn’t letting this go even though I have and I don’t bother her at all. I’m an attractive individual that gets many looks from women but my inexperience makes me fall short. I feel she constantly gets an ego boost putting others down or trying to embarrass other people. I haven’t mentioned it as I don’t want to escalate anything further than it has - as I’ve clearly made a mistake and it would be best to leave it alone. She will not drop this and it’s driving me crazy. Now I’m worried she will bring her friends to work to antagonize me next. Please any advice aside from not asking out a coworker next time ? Thank you.

So I’ve been talking to this girl for a while, we FaceTimed things were going really really well. She seems to have a really bad relationship in the past it it’s obliterated her confidence and trust. 

Thinks were going really well, we spoke daily enjoyable chats and we arranged to meet. I personally thought the date went really well. Good chat, no awkward silences and very enjoyable.

Post date when I arrived home she seems to have been spooked. Conversations such as she didn’t feel a spark but doesn’t know whether that’s due to protecting herself.

More conversations went on that she doesn’t know where her heads at and just seems so confused. I was her first date after the ex and something between their relationship was bad and clearly brought up a lot of emotions for her post date. But in our chats it was a lot of mixed messages saying that I’m great but can’t promise a relationship, saying she doesn’t want to open up and like me and leave herself vulnerable and also she was catching feelings but then apologised and said she’s pathetic.

She’s now asked to keep talking whilst she figures out her head. Now I genuinely enjoy talking to this girl I know we’ve met only once but I really enjoyed it. Had a deep chat and she said today she was waiting for a ping moment.

I am not some 90-day fiancé guy whose trying to import a woman from Russia, for any of the many cliché reasons Western men do this. Exactly how I met the Russian lady I've been communicating with is not important, and doesn't really have any bearing on what I want to ask. But I met her on a dating website that allows international connections. 

Everything has been going really well, and we've really enjoyed talking over the phone (WhatsApp), sending messages, videos, and texts for the past month or so. One thing has kind of come to my attention, but I don't know what to really think about it. I know that she is talking to other men that she met online while she's been talking to me. I genuinely do not care at all that she is talking to other guys. She is not my girlfriend. She lives 5,500 miles away from me, and we have only been communicating for a little over a month. I do not have any other online ladies I am talking to, but that is just because I don't really like to text 2, 3, or 4 different women at the same time. It becomes mentally exhausting. 

What does bother me then? I have no way to know this for sure, but I think she must have been receiving gifts from men all this time. She's told me several times that her Moscow apartment rent is so high she struggles to afford it. But within this month alone, she's shown me photos of a new necklace, a new dress, a new bracelet with her name on it, and yesterday she showed me a smart watch that she got which costs as much as half a months rent for her. Again, I do not know what these are gifts from men. I could be completely wrong. And... I genuinely do not think that she should NOT accept gifts from other men, just because she's talking to me now. I cannot think of a single line of thinking that could justify me thinking that she owes me any level of ""monogamy"" or even an explanation. What DOES bother me, though... if these are gifts from other men... her showing them to me as if she bought them for herself... it just seems shady. 

However, since I do not know any of this to be the case, I can't really ask her, *""Hey are those gifts from other men?""* ...can I? That sounds out of line, right?

I've been told that not everything I see on social media is real and that I dont know what peoples relationships are like behind their awesome or cute posts. But like seriously what are the chances that they have a toxic relationship behind what they post about each other on social media.

Besides social media, I get really anxious and lonely when I start thinking about dating and believe me I do my best to keep myself distracted and focused on other things, but its really tough especially now, where if I am not doing something more often than I'd like, I find my head drifting to the thought about being in a relationship with someone, then I start thinking about my friends who all have really beautiful and awesome girlfriends who love them just as much. Then I get reminded of the rejections I've been given by girls.

My problem isnt that im unattractive physically or have an unattractive life, I just hate being single and when I'm alone. I've been diagnosed with minor anxiety so no matter how busy I try to be, there are moments when Im not doing anything when the lonely thoughts start drifting back to me. And thats when my anxiety starts up.

I've been told that if you want a relationship you have to be comfortable with being single, but obviously I cant.

This girl and I had been dating for just over a month, dates twice a week. I felt we were both very interested in one another. Everything was honestly going great. I mentioned on the 3rd or so date that I wasn’t in it for casual sex/hookup, and she said she was in the same boat.

Now let me go ahead and say that I’m a virgin and was all throughout college. Not by choice at all, but also not because I was never given the opportunity to lose it. I’ve gone far enough with and had situations where girls were expecting sex on around 30+ occasions. Sometimes with the same girl, most of the time one nighters. This girl I mentioned is the first “relationship” I’ve had in the sense that I’ve never actually dated a girl formally.

The reason I’m still a virgin is because I’ve never been able to keep an erection long enough to have sex, sometimes not even at all. The first couple of times I blamed my nerves. Next few times I blamed the alcohol. Nowadays, I have no idea. I don’t feel nervous with girls at all anymore, but it’s just that thought in the back of my head telling me that it will happen again. The only time I’m able to get it up is when we’re just chilling on the couch watching a movie or something.

The whole point in saying all of this is I’ve tried 6 times with this one girl that I really dig and not once could I perform. Things would get hot, I’d focus on pleasuring her well (she would tell me I’m incredible with my hands and mouth; skills I’ve had time to perfect over the years since they were the only tools I had...lol) but as soon as she reached and felt a limp soldier the mood would seriously go 100 to 0. Every time I would assure her that it has never been and will never be her fault, that I liked her and really enjoyed being around her, and that it’s something that I’ve been dealing with. We kept trying and trying and on the 6th time I guess she just gave up. I still got the feeling she thought it was her fault deep down, despite my efforts to convince her otherwise. She also said sex was an important part of relationships for her, and she didn’t want to continue to be let down time after time, and said it was time for us to call it quits.

At this point I knew I had to tell her I was a virgin. I couldn’t believe I let it slip out, but I did. I could tell she was absolutely shocked, and probably didn’t even believe me honestly. I told her she was legitimately the first person I’ve ever told (which, by the way is 100% true... I have never told anyone that I never had sex with any of the girls I brought back), and I stayed over for another hour just talking to her about it and why I’ve kept it a secret all this time. She told me it’s really not a big deal, and should really tell girls something like that sooner. She said it was definitely good to know, as she can see now why I wasn’t able to perform.

The thing is, she still decided then and there to not continue the relationship, at least not right now. This leads to the ultimate reason for this post. Now, I didn’t expect telling her that I was a virgin to suddenly solve all of our problems. However, I asked if she would be willing to work with me on it and, although she didn’t outright say no, I could tell she was not keen on doing that at all.

I figured if she truly cared for me like she made it seem and wanted more than just sex like she had said after the first few dates, she maybe would’ve been willing to continue seeing me. It honestly has me a little broken up, because it feels like all that time together was a lie and not real.

How do I rationalize all of this? I feel it’s partially my fault that I didn’t tell her sooner, but can’t help but feel like I was “thrown away” like the past month was nothing to her. She said I should go out and “get it out of my system”. I interpreted this as “go have sex with another girl”, as if she didn’t give a shit what I did. We agreed to be friends and maybe grab drinks sometime in the future. 
Overall I tried to end it on good terms and act cool and really understanding, but was honestly kind of angry at the whole situation. 

Am I wrong to be angry and upset about the way things ended?

I'm finishing my last semester of college, he's in his first year of residency (a doctor). We started talking on the app, and right away he asked for my number, moving the conversation to text. He would only text once per day. I instantly got a crush on him even before we met, he was so cute and a very handsome doctor haha! I felt lucky as a college student to be going on dates with someone like him.

He asked me out, and we went and got dinner within a week of matching. I have to say, I felt like before we went on our date I really didn't know much about him at all. His texts were super, super, superficial and he only texted once per day. I thought this was because he was working 80+ hours per week. He is super busy, after all.

Immediately after the first date, he texted me asking if I wanted to come over to his place next time to cook and watch a movie. I said I would love to. I was traveling for the holidays for two weeks though, so we weren't able to have our second date for three weeks after the first date. We did stay in contact those two weeks, although again, it was extremely superficial. He texted me once every 1-2 days, and often it was just a short sentence; we didn't learn anything new about each other. 

On our second date, I instantly got the vibe that he was being extremely flirtatious. He didn't really ask things about myself; rather the vibe was just very fun and flirty. We started watching the movie on his couch, and he started kissing my forehead and holding my hand. I really liked it, and pretty soon we were on his bed making out. I’m a virgin with past sexual trauma so sexy things can be difficult for me. I told him I had sexual boundaries, and he said he wanted to respect those boundaries and make me feel safe. He was pretty assertive/a teensy bit aggressive though with trying to touch my chest. I did have to tell him more than once to stop doing that. When we took a break from kissing to watch the movie he asked if he could put his hand in my bra and play with my nipples. I thought that was a little weird but just thought this guy was super into touching boobs haha.

Once we got up from the bed and I was getting ready to leave, he kept kissing me in very loving ways. He kissed my forehead, put his arms around me, and while we were cleaning up from the cooking, he kept kissing me randomly. I really thought this guy was super into me. He walked me home, and before he dropped me off at the door, he pulled down my mask and gave me the biggest, sexiest kiss ever. I loved it. He didn't ask for a third date though.

We kept texting for a few days after this second date. Again, the texting was very superficial and light. I really just thought he was a very bad texter. I texted him a few days later asking him to get together again. He took a few days to get back to me (not unusual for him), and he apologized for this saying work was super busy and he suggested a date which would be within 2 days.

I texted him asking him if he wanted to come over to my apartment and I could make dinner for him. He said that he already had dinner plans but would love to hang out after. He asked me if I wanted to just come to his apartment like I did last time. I said sure, although I was kind of disappointed. He didn't seem like he wanted to put in a lot of effort. I asked him what time he wanted me to come over, and then he responds an hour later stating that he was starting to not feel well after getting his COVID vaccine the day prior. I felt really sad; I had been looking forward to seeing him.

I then texted him two days later, asking him if he was still interested. I told him that he had seemed super interested on our second get-together with the kissing, but his texting and this past weekend were giving me the vibe that he wasn't interested. He responded apologizing for his lack of communication and told me that he had an awesome time the last time we got together, but that due to his schedule the next few weeks with his residency he didn't have time to hang out and ""give me the time and energy I deserve."" He also said ""But I hope we may be able to hang out in the future"". This was three weeks ago. I haven't heard from him since. I just don't understand why a guy would be so sweet and give me loving and caring touches and kisses on a date, and then just never want to see me again. What did I do wrong? Was it me or was he just not looking for a relationship? I'm definitely looking to have a serious relationship with someone, but I had never stated that to him. In the beginning, he had seemed like he was willing to put in effort because he biked to a restaurant that was super close to my place on the first date, but then the effort got less and less. He had seemed so eager to see me again on the first date, but after the second date everything dwindled. What happened? Some people have suggested to me he only wanted sex, but if he just wanted sex, why not just ask a random girl on tinder to come over? Why meet a girl for dinner and cook with her if you’re just looking to fuck?

Fast forward three months later, we end up matching on Bumble. I reach out via text to tell him “Hey, I saw we matched on bumble, how have you been?” and he literally just never responds 😢 I could cry so hard right now. I wish he had thought our kissing was wonderful and wanted to do it again. I wish he didn’t just ditch and kick me to the curb.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,714953,public,self,Feeling pretty shitty and worthless right now...,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mr4rrd/feeling_pretty_shitty_and_worthless_right_now/,all_ads,6,,,,,,

I’m a 20F who has been saying a 22M for almost a year (our one year would be April 26) we live an hour away from each other and he’s been the only one for me as I have lost a lot of friends in the passed couple of months. 

Sunday, he broke up with me, on text. I literally feel empty inside. I just booked us a hotel and restaurant reservations for his birthday next month and was looking forward to our one year. He told me I am too pure and nice for him and since i’ve been in only one really long relationship whereas he’s been in 10+ really short relationship our views on relationships are different and he doesn’t think he can give me what i deserve. he started to cry and told me i’m too perfect for him and i deserve someone better 

he messaged my friend the next day to make sure i am gonna be ok and so far I am literally empty. I’ve cried every night, haven’t had a meal in three days, cancel all my plans, and don’t even have the energy to shower or do my homework. I don’t have many friends anymore and they all left me as I previous stated and my phone is dry and i am in bed all day thinking and I feel like my heart is gonna explode.

My ex before him was abusive, and whereas this one wasn’t the sweetest, he had a soft spot or me. Despite being cheated on and had many bad relationships he tried his hardest with me and he said he needed to figure himself out before he can prioritize someone as amazing as me.

I don’t know what to do. Honestly i genuinely don’t know what to do and it’s killing me. Do you think he’s going to come back? Am I being dramatic?

i matched with this guy on tinder and after talking for a while we decided to facetime. as soon as i answered the call, he said “wow i wasn’t expecting you to be so beautiful!” i literally get this all the time. people always tell me i look better in real life and it actually pisses me off and reinforces my body dysmorphia because i cant look at myself without feeling like i see a distorted image. anyway, i gave an obligatory thanks and tried to have an actual conversation.

every time i asked him about himself, he would pause and stare blankly at the screen and then just say, “sorry i was distracted by your beauty, can you repeat yourself?” this made me feel like he wasnt listening to me. especially because whenever i spoke, he would interrupt me to say “god you are just so fine!” 

it honestly turned me off really badly. a lot of guys only pursue me for my looks and try to harass or flatter me into sleeping with them and it just makes me feel like a piece of meat. i dont enjoy having a big deal made out of my looks because i feel like there are so many unique character traits i possess that get glossed over because i’ve come in contact with so many guys who would rather focus on looks! 

he really wouldnt stop with the excessive complimenting, even after i started rolling my eyes and then finally painfully, OBVIOUSLY grimacing every time he said it. so now im thinking to myself, he cant even pick up on my facial expressions! i got so disgusted with him that i just told him i couldnt handle all those compliments and ended the phone call. and then he texted me and told me i should work on my self esteem and confidence! i dont feel like i did anything wrong here.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,715020,public,self,was i wrong for not accepting excessive compliments?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mr5gfb/was_i_wrong_for_not_accepting_excessive/,all_ads,6,,,,,,
