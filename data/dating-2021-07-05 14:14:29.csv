0,oee61o,1625512497,How do you accept that you are ugly and unwanted?,"My only saving grace could be my career in the future but most women take care of themselves these days and don’t need men for support. This idea that most women are gold diggers is false. Even good looking broke men have women taking care of them trying to “fix” them. I have good personality qualities as I’ve been told by friends and even strangers but that doesn’t mean someone will or has to be attracted to you. 

I’m trying to accept that I’ll be the one that is always single all their life and never experience what it’s like to be liked by someone. But it’s hard. Everyone else gets married or at least get to date and have some experiences. But I guess it’s natural selection and I’m not one of the lucky ones.  As a guy I don’t get unconditional support or love and if I’m not good looking, rich, or comedian level funny. I’m pretty much worthless in the eyes of society. 

I don’t even have high standards. I’d just want someone who is female gender, over the age of 18, and isn’t a drug addict or violent.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oee61o/how_do_you_accept_that_you_are_ugly_and_unwanted/

I can’t tell if he’s using me for sex or if he likes me. He make plans for our dates in advance, usually a few days in advance through text. However, he only asks me on dates once/week. Not sure if this is a bad sign. We have been on 6 dates in the past 6 weeks. I tried to ask him if we could text a bit more in between dates (I’m aware this probably came off as needy, but I’m someone who is big on texting and it’s important to me). He told me he isn’t really a texter but that he would try texting me more. However, he didn’t. He really only texts to set up dates, which I’ve come to accept. He usually takes me out for drinks or to a hookah lounge in the evening typically around 8 PM and we’ll be out and about until 2 AM. After, we always go back to his or my place and have sex, and usually (4 out of the 6 times) spend the night with each other. He cuddles me, kisses me, and occasionally calls me pet names. He’s told me he likes falling asleep with me and cuddling me. He’s kissed me on the forehead and hugs me goodbye.

When I ask him about what he wants, though, he tells me he wants to go with the flow and get to know me more.. But I’m not sure what to think. I’ve asked him if we could hangout more than once/wk, but right now he’s working part-time and studying for the MCAT, so he claims he doesn’t have the time. I don’t know if he’s making excuses though. I’m not sure if he’s even all that interested in me, or if he’s only sticking around for sex. I mean, we only see each other once a week, don’t text in between dates other than to set up a date, and sex is always expected with every date.

8,oeeq77,1625514161,Not committed after a year and a half. Need advice!,"Hello All, 
So I am in a little bit of a predicament and I would love peoples advice! Because I’m just not sure how to move forward. I will try and make it as summerized as possible while also give the main details. Okay here goes, soooo me (24F) and the guy I’m seeing (36M) met on tinder in February of 2020! We hit off so well right from the beginning, sexually and emotionally/ compatibility. Though, he had just broken up with his ex of 6 years 2/3 weeks prior of us meeting! Very intense. But he told me he had been emotionally checked out of the relationship for the past year or more and had just been getting up the courage to finally break it off after so long. So we agreed to be in a FWB situation because he obviously didn’t wanna be in a relationship again, but shared with me he doesn’t like seeing lots of people and just wants to find someone he connects well with. So he asked me to be exclusive FWB. I was hesitant at first because I was almost about a year from breaking off my previous relationship of 4 years so I could easily put myself in his shoes and respect how he felt. But I wasn’t sure if I was ready to be exclusively seeing someone, I was enjoying my freedom. But I decided to agree to exclusive fwb because I really liked his company and figured it would actually be healthy for me to simmer it down and focus on one person again, in a casual way.

More back story: his ex and him had a lease together so he agreed to let her keep the apartment til the lease is up and he will go stay with parents. That way he could also use this time to pay off some debt as well so it worked out for him. Anyways. Within like 2 weeks of us starting to see each other we became extremely connected very quickly. We have very similar lifestyles and get along GREAT. We communicate beautifully and seamlessly as well when it comes to day to day problem solving/ and saying how we feel. So we started working out together every day etc. and basically started acting like a couple. Except all the romantic things that come with being a couple of course. But we still go out together etc. he just doesn’t necessarily do romantic things or like take me on “dates”. 

So I am also young and living with parents currently, which means we both live in a compromised living space hahaha ahhhh and it feels like high school. Ugh. But! Oh boy oh boy the sex is ridiculous. Amazing. The most chemistry I’ve ever had with someone sexually and that’s (obviously) a huge basis of our relationship too. We both say we are having the best sex of our lives. 
So we did a lot of car fucking and then would try and get a room every 2 weeks or so to spend more time together etc. 

Long story short about 8 months down the road I express that we are super duper connected and basically a couple so why have we not become one yet? Again I was waiting and giving him loads of space. Never brought it up but in the back of my head I’m thinking like this does notttttt seem like any FWB situation at all. We are basically dating. And also exclusive remember! But I like him a lot so I went with it! I figured okay it’s only a matter of time before he asks to be his gf. But upon having that conversation he felt differently and his excuses were as follows:
1. I live at home and don’t feel like I’m in a place where I can offer a solid relationship. (Valid and I respect it if that’s the truth but I mean, you’re basically in one dude.) 
2. I don’t want to be committed. I’m enjoying my freedom and he very specifically said not freedom with seeing other people but freedom to not be obligated to what a relationship entails ( valid and I understand but again, it’s been 8 months of basically being in a relationship and he also went on to say that his ex is super jealous type, always asking where he is etc. I am not like that at all and have exemplified to him that I am nothing like her so I said if he and I were in a relationship you wouldn’t be dealing with those things it would be different, he still said he needed time ) 
3. He’s scared of what the ex will do if she finds out. She still possess his belongings which furnish the apartment she is staying in and also watching his dog until he gets a sufficient place to have the dog. So he’s scared she will take the dog or ruin his belongings. ( valid but if he really cared about that he could make a change to fix that issue)
Again I want to say I totally respect all of these things if they are truly his feelings but something just seems off based on how committed to me he actually has been so far. I would expect those things to come from someone I see maybe once a week and all we do is fuck, maybe sometimes do other things but we aren’t super committed to each other’s times and involved in each other’s lives so deeply. I actually have met his parents and did early on. It happened informally but now I actually run and manage his fathers retirement business for him! I know all of his family but here’s the other thing. He REFUSES to meet mine. His excuse for that is that he loathes meeting parents even if they are just his friends parents ans it’s been like that since high school and I believe him…but come on man. Grow up. 

So now we are at a year and 5 months of being exclusive with this guy apparently just as “fwb” 
He still refuses to meet my parents and I’m just about getting over it. But I REALLY REALLY REALLY like him and we are honeslty so perfect for each other in so many ways. I’m hanging on to that and hoping he will finally man up. Because a part of me doesn’t care what our label is, I’m just happy to have his company and share what I do have with him that’s why I’ve been around for so long now. But I’m at the point where I feel super ready for a relationship and I have so much love to give and I want to give it to someone, specifically him! 

When I bring it up he still says he doesn’t feel stable enough for a relationship. He says “I just need my own apartment again and my dog back and then things will be better” I’ve waited a year and a half for those things to happen! Why does he give me every reason to believe he wants to be in a relationship with me but actually doesn’t!!!! Should I wait and see if he comes around or tell him it’s time to lock me down or move on?  I’m soooooo sad about doing that cause again it will be like an actual breakup. We do lots of day to day thinfs together and I would miss that. But I also think maybe he needs to experience that and miss me a bit to realize what he’s missing. Idk. But I’m also scared of losing him. There is that part of me that wants to keep him locked down haha ;) and that’s why I haven’t tried to set an ultimatum.

He says he wants to take things slow to get to know one another, but then made the claim that he feels he really knows me. He shared that he wants to fall in love but then keeps a distance from me. He also only asks me to hang out the day of, as opposed to giving some notice. It's made me feel like an option.

Last night I went out with some friends and we ended up getting some fast food late at night. Low and behold the guy I am seeing was behind me with a woman in the passenger seat. I recognized the woman in the car as someone he's described as one of his best friends. I tried not to think anything of it since I've met her and she knows we are dating.

This morning, I asked him how the rest of his evening was because he hadn't texted me back all night and I wanted to see if he would say what he did. He said that he got fast food and sat by himself all night. I was so taken aback for a number of reasons but mostly because if this is a friend and there is nothing to hide, why omit that information?

12,oefd0x,1625516080,Trying to understand after a breakup.,"Its been almost two months since we broke up. We decided to end it because it was the best for both of us and we tried to stay friends but before we broke up I found out that 2 weeks into our relationship that she kissed a close friend, and at the time even though I was moving states away I thought that we could move past it because it was so long ago, but I couldn't trust her so very wrongly I snooped through her social media and other things (I know i should not have done this and it was very wrong there is no justifying that) and found out that during our relationship she was messaging other guys, posting lewd pictures behind my back when I told her I didnt like it and she got dms from guys who saw those pictures, she also sent money to a guy all while we were dating. And two weeks after we broke up, we were talking as friends and I find out that she spent a copious amount of money $50+ to uber to another guys house late at night. I honestly would be dealing with this better but the thing that bothers me most is that during our relationship she asked me not to talk to other girls, especially a best friend of mine since middle school, and she asked me to wait a while after we broke up to see someone because it would hurt if i found someone right away, she asked me not to do all these things and then I find out that she did all of those things and tried to hide it by lying about it. Im over being mad about it to be honest, it is what it is, but I just wanna understand why a person would ask their significant other not to do something but instead they do it themselves (i also asked her not to do these things). So genuinely can someone help me try to understand why someone would do that? I've been trying to give reason to why she did those things but I just can't. The only reasons I can think of is that I was not enough for her, or she did not find me attractive or lost interest at a certain point.

I like to think that I don't look monstrous. I am pretty overweight, but it doesn't show as much as my weight measurement would supposedly indicate.

Many people I know have expressed without prompting on my end that I am a fun, intelligent and kind person, the extent to which I believe them varies from day to day though. This lack of dating and intimacy has been affecting me negatively for years as I do not have any other source of affection in my day to day life. I have been living away from my family for the past 7 years.

I tried dating apps, and put my best foot forward, using pictures and writing my bio with the help of multiple people, but after weeks of trying I never managed to speak to anyone on those apps. 

I don't lack in confidence, at least in everything not related to women, but seeing the complete and utter lack of interest from women in anything beyond friendship is utterly demoralizing. As everybody around me is constantly slipping in and out of relationships, I can't help but compare myself to them and end up at least a little envious. I also maintain a decent social life and I have a hobby or two on the side.

Instead of placing the blame on others, I'd like to look inwards and see what part of that is manifesting outwards and keeping women uninterested.

15,oefilh,1625516542,"How to not personalize feeling rejected when guys just want to ""chill"" instead of actually going out? (I'm the female)","I think it might be related to my physical appearance.


I'm having this problem with my neighbor.

 I moved to my apartment a few months ago &amp; met my neighbor when he brought a package to me that went to his building instead of mine. a few days went by &amp; I saw him again coming home from work. I'm not exactly a social butterfly, &amp; I'm really nervous/shy. So I'm not big on small talk without getting uncomfortable fast. It's been months since this happened, but in, April I was taking some bags out my car &amp; saw him again. He asked if I needed help. I genuinely did not need help lol. He stayed by my car &amp; said ""I know I never asked but...do you have a man"" I said ""no, I don't"". Then he sadly replied ""We should chill sometime""


I ""chill"" all the time in the comfort of my own home, I'm good. That was what I said to him. 


I don't accept chill as a form of going or hanging out. It translates over to I just wanna hookup. So that was that. Few weeks go by, I see him here and there. Last few days I've been seeing him alot more than usual, either checking the mail, coming in the parking lot as he's taking his garbage out. Yesterday he came to my door. I opened it and he told me happy fourth. He asked if I'm watching the fireworks tonight and I said no. He asked what was I doing and I said I'm making bags &amp; finishing some sketches. He said ""do you need help?"" I said no, have a good night &amp; closed the door.



Idk why I feel bad but idk how to stop personalizing the behavior. I always see it as a red flag when a guy just wants to hang out instead of actually going out. And it's not just him, even with dating most of the time for me, the guy never wants to date, only Netflix and chill. I'm not dating or messing around right now. Trying to work on my self esteem and self worth. But I'm starting to think that I'm not physically attractive, &amp; men who only want to chill just want to sleep around and not actually take me seriously as anything other than someone to sleep with.


Idk if it counts for anything, but I am fat. I'm 5'4, 190, I usually have my hair braided or in an afro, I'm brown skin. I dress normally I guess you could say? Lol. I mostly wear graphic tees, jeans, leggings, when I work I wear scrubs. I'm not girly though. I don't skirts, heels, dresses etc, I was way lighter last year, I gained alot of weight during covid. Guys NEVER approach me in person, and it's been taking a toll on my self esteem. Why am I only good enough to chill with, what's wrong with me? I'm very kept to myself, I mostly go to work and go home. I started eating cleaner and started going to the gym last month, I haven't yet saw any results, but it still makes me really sad to know that he just wants to see me in a chill setting and not a dating setting. He's never even asked for my number. Is it because I'm not pretty enough to date? I'm really wondering. 


Most of the time I feel like the female that guys just wanna sleep with, not the female that guys wanna date and take seriously. But after deciding to focus on just work and my mental/emotional health, I haven't been dating. I deleted all my socials including the dating profiles. I just feel so cheap and not good enough when I'm only viewed as the woman to sleep with. I don't think it's my vibe or I give off any weird energy. I'm pretty soft spoken, really bubbly, kept to myself etc. How do I stop feeling like I'm the problem? I know it's not personal, but when it happens repeatedly it feels as if it is.

I wrote her to hook up and she quickly replied on IG with yes. We wrote a little bit not much, mainly because of me. And hooked up.

We first started to chill on the couch and ate something, also we pretended to watch some movies. First one was boring, but thanks to that we cuddled, got a little bit closer and ended up in bed at the second movie. We cuddled and had sex the hole night in bed. I did teach her something she didn’t know that she like and she me also. We both wanted just sex. We made that clear at the beginning. But we also talked about everything. - Really everything what happened in the last years, talked about my ONS partners, her relationship and a lot of other things (friends, family, ..).

The next morning we smoked one together and drank a coffee then she went home. Currently we’re writing.

I feel like girls I meet IRL all have a boyfriend, and yet they are the most interesting and the ones I have a lot in common with.  
I'm single since 2019 and this is getting kinda hard lately. I feel really alone even though I have a hookup I see once a week. I need to  share more than sex with someone.

25,oefz47,1625517987,Is this rude of me?," I've been talking to this girl for about 2 months now, she's very nice and we met on Hinge. Although sometimes we'll be texting and she'll disappear for like a day and respond back so it's kind of hard to have a text conversation, I get it because i'm busy myself and prefer meeting in person rather than texting forever. I've asked her if I can take her out a few times and she always says yes but kind of goes AWOL on me before we can fully plan it out. I told her that I was going away for the month of July for training and that they'd be taking my phone, and she said she wishes she would've known that earlier because she's been taking her time to know me and now i'm leaving in a few days, but still continues the disappearing game. The other night she texted me ""hey"", and I responded and didn't hear back from her for another full day when she said happy 4th of July. Lol. Then she said ""we should do something tomorrow so we can get to know each other"" and I was cool with that, so I asked her what time works best for her? . So I sent ""I hope you have a happy 4th, can't wait to see you"". Well it is now tomorrow and almost 2:00 in the afternoon, still nothing, and I got curious so I looked on snapchat and noticed she's been active all day. Kind of over it and feel like it's a waste of time to pursue, so I sent a message saying ""Hey, you're a very nice girl and it was nice getting to know you, but I don't really have time for the disappearing act. Hope you find what you're looking for"". Am I the asshole or am I just missing something. I mean it kind of sucks when you don't want to make plans with anyone else all day because you told someone you'd hangout with them, and you're just waiting on them to give you a time but they never do and proceed to post things on snapchat.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oefz47/is_this_rude_of_me/

I went on date with a guy (25M) to an arcade, he was very pushy with kissing me and I caved in after being touched deprived for so long,

We went to his apt and after talking to each other non stop, we started talking about his profession (pharma) and we found out we were both psychedelic heads.
We both took micro doses and we had laughs, deep conversation, and non stop sex in-till 4 am.

We feel asleep and woke up, he kept trying to look into my eyes and tell me how beautiful I was. I said I had to go but he was asking me to stay a little bit. I initiated sex again, then I went to take a shower, he followed me in. On my way out he for a kiss goodbye but I was half way out of the door. 

We didn’t really text a lot before, and I was okay with it because my days were pretty packed and I wouldn’t use my phone all day.

Now it’s Monday- and I haven’t heard from him. That’s answer enough to know he doesn’t like me enough. I have a feeling he goes through a lot of girls as he had a drawer full of sex toys.

I feel like I was used only for sex, and I think I should just stop trying to find companionship. I feel so much regret as of now.

I deleted his number and contact, I know when a guy likes you he at least texts you if you came home safe, but I guess not.

Girls. In the real world,  you won't meet a millionaire or someone who comes down in a limo car and take you to a exclusive fancy date. Stop reading 50 shades and wake up. Doctors or guys with big bank accounts find ladies irl and they will choose someone in their own circles and class. 

Guys. She won't be blonde or brunette or whatever is your type"" and have the looks of a sexy actor with DD cups. Stop mixing porn with dating. Unless you look like a underwear model, model looking girls will not match with you, they are way too shallow to accept you. 

Instead. Find a match that is cute ""enough""  on your level someone who will see something in you too, chat, talk, get to know them a little. 

Focus on how they make you feel. Are they kind to you? Are they making you laugh? Do you think they're cute / handsome? Do you feel that you can be yourself around them? Do you like how they smell? Do you admire who they are? Do you feel like they see you? 


You should be picky. But for the right reasons.  Don't judge what they wear or what food they order or what job they have or other pointless details things that doesn't say much about who they are, be open to getting to know the person inside the shell.

57,oeiiji,1625526199,"Hey guys, gals, toasters, apache helicopters, would you mind giving me some advice or encouragement at least?","So dumb question, how does one really go about ""finding,"" or meeting the perfect person? I guess in better terms, how does one look for someone or at least have some success?

I'm 23, male, never had a girlfriend, and mostly just an average guy. I've always been shy and socially awkward. I've been trying to come out of my shell more and more and talk to people while in college and at my job. So working on that, I go to the gym, I'm physically fit for the most part, little chubby around the belly but good everywhere else. I'm not an ugly guy, but I'm not Tom Cruse or Chris Evans when it comes to looks. So like I said I'm an average guy.

With that being said, I'm not depressed or sad about the fact I've never had a relationship or girlfriend. I'm at the point where I'm ready to settle down and start a family and whatnot, which doesn't happen overnight. I've tried different dating apps: Tinder, Bumble, Facebook's dating thing, etc.. I'd get matches but the conversations just end up fizzling out. I do my best to keep them alive and going but the other person just won't reply. So no clue if I'm doing something wrong or not. The same thing would happen if I try to talk to someone at a restaurant or if I'm out and about. I'm talk to them, find something of interest I know a great deal about, and then the conversation never really goes much farther then that.

I don't really have much social interactions with people growing up since I lived a pretty sheltered life being homeschooled. Never had any childhood friends or went to school with people. I did some reading and try to be myself when talking with someone and follow the points buuuut nothing get's off the ground or becomes anything.

TLDR: An average 23yr old who has trouble making conversations with girls. Lived a sheltered life and has tried several dating apps to meet people. I work fulltime and have have my own home and everything. Any advice on making conversations seem more interesting or at least get replies back.

I decided to take matters into my own hands after my mom suggested women for me to marry and all of them either turned me down or I’ve turned them down. I’m Muslim and we don’t really do dating, only meeting with the intention of getting married. I’ve tried some of the apps, more specifically Salams, which is the Muslim version of Tinder and Bumble because it lets women initiate the conversation. And obviously I’m not getting anywhere. I’m thinking of reasons why I’m not getting anyone matching and/or messaging me. Maybe I’m that unlikeable? Maybe I’m 32 and still am trying to get my life together? Maybe I still watch cartoons and anime? Maybe I don’t feel comfortable taking my shirt off at the beach or the pool? Maybe I don’t have any close friends? Maybe I’m too religious? Maybe I’m not religious enough? Like what do I have to do to get more swipes on the apps? Or should I just sign up for more apps?

72,oeker0,1625533136,I (30F) have a hard time choosing between what I truly want and what my family/culture wants for me.,"I grew up in a culture that is pretty traditional when it comes to marriage/settling down. So like we're traditional but not traditional to the point of having arranged marriages ok?

We (mainly our parents) value education, status, money (sadly) – as it is a sign of power, and other superficial things like that. Of course, OBVIOUSLY, good character, respectfulness, moral values, etc are also very important but those other things are just as equally important. These are traits and characteristics women (men too but more so women) and their friends and families look out for when finding a suitable partner. All this makes it nearly impossible for women from my culture living here in The West to find a ""suitable"" guy that meets all that criteria because guys like that who live here are very much accustomed to American life and don’t choose to settle down until late 30’s-early 40’s, leaving my only options at this age, 40 year old guys who are ready to marry in 6 months to a year after meeting. Which is not what I “desire”.

I know these are some common things in American culture but just imagine what you all go through and then times it by a million, that’s how my culture is.

Now, I grew up very American too. I’ve had my fun like any normal American teenager/young adult. I’ve had bfs, relationships, gone on dates, did all that but I didn’t feel ready for a relationship that would lead to marriage until I’d say 28. And I started to see how my dating pool, based on my culture/family standards and the dating culture of America, was not what I “desired”. I had no interest in settling down with some guy in his late 30’s+ who’s just looking to wife anybody. I kind of have a wild side to me, I’m not gonna lie. I desired younger, more care free men and I could easily get these guys’ attention but I kept telling myself no no you’re getting older you have to settle down and marry as is expected of you.

I just recently moved out on my own. I used to live at my parents’ up until 2 weeks ago (very common thing for someone my age in my culture). Anyways I feel so free. I have a very good job and I’m going back to grad school so eventually I’ll be making even more and ok I’ll be honest, I also have wealthy parents too so I don’t think money will ever be an issue for me. Meaning money is the reason I would need to partner up with someone.

When I think about what I want from a guy, I think of someone who I can have fun with like just be silly and go on adventures and have lots of sex, gooood sex. Not boring marital sex. Someone I can be vulnerable with but not dependent on. I want my own life, my own freedom and he also has his. We’re monogamous but we’re not prisoners stuck in a relationship or marriage.

Idc what anyone is about to say about how “I just haven’t met the right person” because 

EVERY MARRIED COUPLE I KNOW IS MISERABLE AF.

Ok maybe not completely miserable but idk I don’t see true happiness in majority of the couples I talk to. Or even their interaction with each other gives me weird vibes. Keep in mind I mainly am thinking of examples in my own culture. Like all the girls who settled for the ""well-off doctors who are 10-15 years older"". Like I sense the suffocation in their faces lol.

So here is my issue.

I was running errands at the mall last week and I saw this guy at Nordstrom, he worked there. He was so cute, he made feel excited in a way I haven’t felt in a very very long time. You know being stuck inside for a year and then before that most of my dating was done online, I missed that feeling of seeing someone cute in person and getting butterflies for them. Anyways, I couldn’t stop looking at him. I was at customer service resolving an issue I had with an order, he was helping another customer but he eventually left that area so I decided to ask his co workers if he’s single and how I think he’s so cute and they were all so eager to set me up with him. I gave the girl my ig and told her to tell him to add me. My order issue had to be escalated with another manager, so I was there for quite some time (it was eventually resolved for anyone wondering lol). This guy eventually came back to that area and the girl who was assisting me previously pulled him aside and I’m assuming she was updating him on what I had told her because when he came back, his demeanor was different, he kept looking over at me. Anyways like I said my order issue was eventually resolved and I left. He requested to follow me as soon as I left the store and messaged me  asking me out.

I’m so conflicted. I think this guy is so adorable and I went on his Instagram page, we totally have similar vibes. He’s artistic, he's stylish, creative but all I keep thinking is how my mom is going to be like “you’re dating a guy that works at Nordstrom?????” or my friends will be with their professional bfs/husbands and view who I’m with as a loser or a low life. These are stupid thoughts that have been put into my head my whole life. I come from an extremely judgmental culture and family that has turned me into a judgmental person as well to the point where I even judge my own decisions.

I don’t know what to do? Like where is this going to? I feel like even if I go out with him and date him or whatever I’m just going to have to call it quits one day right? I will eventually have to marry someone “suitable” AKA be miserable. I feel like well what’s the point then? Why delay that process, why not just do it now that I’m young and have a better chance of ending up with someone who’s just slightly cringe and not absolutely horrid.

I have no one to talk to this stuff about. I literally cannot confide in anyone in my life about any of this. I have today off work and just relaxing and anytime I have downtime, my brain just goes all over the place. I enjoy working for this very reason, because I don’t think about my own life and problems.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oeker0/i_30f_have_a_hard_time_choosing_between_what_i/
73,oekhoh,1625533427,How do I meet women in real life in my late 20s?,"In short, I'm sick of online dating. I get a match every few months or so, and even if I do go on dates with them it ends up going nowhere. It's also nowhere as intimate as meeting someone with whom you really ""click"" in-person.

Where can I meet women nowadays? Work is not an option as there are simply no women in my age category there. The bar/club scene isn't for me. I've yet to develop interesting hobbies and skills (I know, this is something I need to work on). Moreover I don't have a lot of time for leisure.

I feel that, as I approach my older years, the prospects of me finding a quality partner might drastically diminish, especially for someone who has zero experience in relationships or sex.

Then this weekend we went bowling. I was picking up a little on the flirting game and touched her hands, back, shoulders, knee, feets. I locked eyes with her several times and she looked down after maybe 2 seconds or so. So I touched her face and lips actually. She seemed turned on. She put a hand on my shoulder while telling me some sort of story. I locked eyes with her for probably 5 seconds and wanted to kiss her but didnt because it seemed crowded and so on. So I dont think I can doubt that she likes me anymore. I just feel like I have been so slow at puzzling it together. I feel like I should invite her out again as soon as possible so this doesnt fizzle out. She is generally pretty bad at initiating things so I have to ask her. She is avaiable almost always. So this weekend maybe? I am so overthinking this right now. I just have to go for a damn kiss. Even if I for some reason are stupid as fuck and misinterpreted all the over the top signals over the last weeks/months and she rejects me, we are still friends and I can move on with life like nothing even happened. If I chicken out, I am probably still kicking myself for it 20 years down the line.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oem3q4/building_up_the_courage_to_finally_kiss_her/
91,oem966,1625540101,I need help understanding a girl I am talking to.,"Girls can be confusing - I need help understanding them. I divide it into context, what happened recently, and the question. You could skim over the context if you don't feel like reading all.

I have been talking to a girl from Brazil that I met online on discord (I'm from Canada) for two months now. She has given so many mixed signals, and it was very confusing. Below are some of the signals that she either considered or considers me as a potential partner, and that she potentially likes- and the mixed signals being she either wants to distance herself from me or she sees me as a friend. I appreciate any help in decoding what these could mean and understanding her, but not only her but also how girls generally behave or how to read girls.

**The context:**

* *After the first day we met, she was the one to ask if she can call. She also asked for my phone number in the call. Before closing the call, she said ""I like you already."" She also said despite your age (I'm 23, she's 25) you act very maturely- usually guys mature later.*
* *The next day, she called without asking and she was drunk on her bed. She asked if I had a girlfriend. I said no and I never did, and she was surprised, and also said ""that's better, I like it"" She also asked if I would still be talking to her if I had a girlfriend. I said depends on my girlfriend's comfort level and boundaries. She also said unlike other guys you have opinions and can talk about deeper subjects.*
* *She asked for my instagram.*
* *She used hearts in texts, did kisses before closing the calls.*
* *All of our calls were video calls.*
* *We watched many movies together, which I consider to be somewhat of an intimate/romantic activity and would not do with girls I have no interest in.*
* *She picked all of the movies, and she said ""you have to watch this with me, you cannot say no"" - she was assertive, which showed she really wanted to watch them with me*
* *There was one period where we did not talk for a considerable time (3 weeks), and it was when her mom got covid. - we still texted though. During this time she asked to watch movies but kept rescheduling them. She only told about covid after she rescheduled/delayed a few times. And she was apologetic for not connecting. However, refer to this point after you read 'then this happened' - it may also have to do with that, maybe.*
* *In general, she is a very busy person who works two jobs (TA and private tutor) and is doing her master's full time. Plus she's dealing with her parents going through a divorce while still living with them. Yet despite being busy, she is devoting considerable time to me.*
* *She initiated most of the calls we had.*
* *Multiple times she said she missed me, and whenever I said I missed you too, she would always say something along the lines of no don't lie, and I would always tell her she is being too suspicious of people.*
* *The day she met me she posted an instagram reel saying 'oh no I hope I don't fall' - this might be a total coincidence.*
* *One time she said ""start to practice your Portuguese"" and she named the places she wants to take me to in Brazil.*
* *She sometimes sends me songs she sings. When I told her having someone in the household that signs or play instruments would be nice, she sang me another song saying ""So they tell me that you lookin' for a girl like me"" - this may or may not be a coincidence.*
* *She asked me to read her a specific poem in my native language (Turkish)*
* *After the first few weeks, she started calling me a friend.*
* *Recently on June 26 when she was drunk she sent me a voice message saying ""I like you, okay? You're a good person."" - and the next morning she said ""sorry for the drunk messages""*
* *On June 30 also recently (the fact that these are recent is important for the reason I'll give you), she said about a photo of mine ""Ooh, look at youu, you're so cuute""*

*· I am also attaching a chart of when we talked for context in case it is of use.*

**Then this happened:**

On Sunday July 4th, she told me that she is dating another guy- two months in after we started talking. But she also said she is not very happy with the relationship. In fact, she said she felt happier when he went on vacation for two weeks than when he was with her- primarily because he does not respect her boundaries and it makes her feel uncomfortable. Unfortunately, she thinks she is not normal for having stricter boundaries and thinks she has to tolerate it and live with it. So she is saying she is not sure if he is the right person for her. She started talking with him two days before she met me. May 4. In June, she saw him physically for the first time - she does not remember the date (they met online, he's Brazilian).

**The question:**

So all of this is a bit confusing. I don't know what she feels towards me. As a guy, I would not be talking to a girl 1x1 and watching movies, spending this much time, and doing things that might be considered flirtatious if I had a girlfriend. She said her date is aware that she talks to me. There were multiple times she said she is frustrated and wants to have an active sex life. I understand that, and respect that. After all, I think it's unfair to expect her to not date anyone especially if we are long distance and it is difficult to meet physically. But I just don't know, and struggle to understand where I fit and struggle to understand her actions. I also don't understand why she did not tell me about him for so long while giving me confusing signals. So I am asking for some decoding of her, especially from other girls. Because to me it is full of confusion and mixed signals. Even if this goes nowhere, I want some insight so I can understand girls better in my next endeavours.

Any help or opinion is appreciated. Thank you! :)

94,oemlsy,1625541441,what’s going on?,"THIS IS LONG SO SORRY BUT I FEEL THESE DETAILS ARE NEEDED 

I (20 f) met this great guy (26) through tinder back in January , we have been taking EVERY SINGLE DAY since then. We decided to get to know eachother and wait to meet til we were fully vaccinated(late may) we went on a super fun date and he even brought me this cute animal plushie of my fav animal!! let’s just say I’ve fallen for him. 

Before meeting he always was like “we should do this” “we should do that” “we’re gonna do a bunch of stuff this summer” but so far , we’ve only been on that ONE date from early June. Since I’ve begun to let myself get feelings for this dude I’ve been feeling like we aren’t progressing as much as we should. I’ve already gave him the “talk” of “hey if you’re just not into me anymore it’s fine!! pls just lmk” and he’s responded saying that he’s still into me and wants to keep moving romantically. 

Now , every weekend he’s “busy” doing something and I’m not one to push about going out. But I really would like to see him more often to see where this goes. I’ve tried to mention it and he’s promised that we’ll hang out more soon but I’m getting tired of waiting, and I genuinely feel like he’s been pushing back even though he’s given me that reassurance.... 
 
I’ve opened up to him soo much this isn’t a normal thing for me, things just don’t feel the same anymore. Since we’ve been talking for so long I feel bad talking to guys online , but I check tinder and he’s still on it .... and ngl it kinda hurts... but I have no right to be mad since we aren’t together r


Advice please ??? Should I just word vomit and tell him how I feel or should I be patient and give it time... I really like him🥺",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oemlsy/whats_going_on/
95,oemnx3,1625541670,I’m 26 years old and still never kissed a female.,"It’s surreal, to say the least, how I’ve gone this long without even kissing a girl. I’m not ugly, short, or fat and It’s not that I don’t go out,I used to go out all the time in my early twenties. But I never approached any woman because I was  scared of rejection or they’re gonna to say something to insult me or embarrass me and make me feel uncomfortable. And my friends wouldn’t ever help introduce me to anyone.  I haven’t been out to a bar or club in years now. And I still haven’t found the courage to approach anyone in public. I just don’t think women want to be bothered at all when they’re walking down the street or at the mall or anything. Even on Reddit a lot of women will say that they don’t want to be approached. I feel terrible how I’m getting closer to 30 and I have less dating experience than a 15 year old child.  Dating apps don’t even work because I’ve been shadow banned on all of them for swiping right too many times and no matter what I do to make new accounts, the apps always remember me. And even if I do get a few matches I always end up being ghosted. Messaging girls on social media won’t work because many of them already receive a shit ton of DM’s from other men. Most of the time they don’t even see my messages.  It’s just frustrating and depressing how I’m going through my twenties without making memories with any females. These are my prime years and they are gonna end once I hit my thirties. If I don’t find someone by the time I’m 30 Idk what I’m gonna do.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oemnx3/im_26_years_old_and_still_never_kissed_a_female/
96,oemqmp,1625541957,Approach on an online matches friend?,"Question guys. Would love your advice and thoughts. 


Last year during quarantine I matched with a girl and we chatted for a few months via text and face timed a decent amount of times. Thought the girl was cool but felt like there was no real romantic connection.  Also, due to quarantine and about 70 miles of distance, we didn't even meet up.  It was just a bunch of FTs here and there, with the understanding that we'll eventually meet up when we both feel safe and comfortable with the number of cases in our area.


We've connected on social media, and so I saw a small glimpse into her life and would see her friends in her posts and stories. Eventually, our chatting and facetime fizzled about after a while.  We did make plans to meet, but it never happened because she got held up at work, which is fine, however, I then think it's on her to re-schedule. So kind of left the ball in her court and she never really brought anything up. Eventually, the chatting fizzled out. I was perfectly fine with it.

Fast forward to now, I see one of her friends on these dating sites.  I definitely think she's cute and would like to send a message and try and match with her. 

However, one, after chatting with her close friend for about 5ish months, is it sleazy to do so?  I'm sure as close as they are friends they probably talked about their matches, etc.  Secondly, if I do match with her, and whether she knows or not, should I bring it up just as a heads-up that I did match with her close friend but it didn't really go anywhere, just facetime convos.

Any advice, thoughts would be appreciated!  If it helps I'm in my mid-30s, and both the girls are early 30s. Woman out there, would you care?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oemqmp/approach_on_an_online_matches_friend/
97,oemuj0,1625542374,I ran into a girl I used to be wild about and it shook me up,"In December we hooked up. I was unemployed and living with my parents and 5 years younger. She didn’t want anything out of it, which was fine. She wasn’t nice about, but I didn’t do anything immature or react poorly. I just don’t think a 28 year old looking to find a long term partner wanted a 23 year old living at home. I invited her to a few things after we hooked up and I just ended up deleted her number for my own sake when she never followed through with plans. Haven’t talked to her since maybe March or February. 

So I got employed, moved one neighborhood over from her place. I usually try to avoid a certain supermarket because I know that’s where she usually goes. I needed to go there and I thought to myself “huh, wouldn’t it be funny if I saw her there?” 

Sure as shit in my first trip going there, there she is. She was right in front of me and I felt I needed to say hi rather than stand awkwardly behind her. 

She greeted me with a hug (I think? I was kinda out of it when I said hi) We talked for like a minute and I told her where I was living and what I was doing for work. She was nice. It wasn’t awkward. I made sure to cut it short and not drag it on and keep walking. She said I should text her because she misses hanging out( we were somewhat friends before we hooked up, but I doubt she meant it). I told her I lost my contacts from the last year (I didn’t, I just deleted her number) and she said she’d text me. She hasn’t since lol. 

She probably won’t. She was probably just being nice. But she looked as good as I remembered. She seemed the same person that I remember. It was so easy to forget why I deleted her number in the first place.

It threw me off all day and just made me sad. I feel like every 3-4 years a guy meets a girl who’s personality and looks make them just take a step back and go, “whoa.” It does t help that my dating life has been the Dead Sea since we last saw each other.
