I think he's funny, kind, we have the same religious background and he's consistently taken  me out on nice dates (AKA he hasn't solely invited me over just to hook up). he even asked me if I wanted to be exclusive and I agreed to that. We live about 40 minutes away from each other but would manage to see each other at least 1-2 times a week. I've never dated someone that didn't live in the same town as me so while the distance isn't too far the communication has been a little difficult. When we were first getting to know each other he would send the standard goodmorning/goodnight texts. He would even send me little tid bits about his day which would spark good conversation. But one week he didn't respond to my texts for 3 days. I called and talked to him about this and he said he was going through some stressful events with family and work. I told him I understand that he needs space but in the future if he could just let me know when he needs space so I don't assume he's ghosting. I then gave him space and we did not talk for about 4 days. Then he reached out to me apologized for being distant and we went on another date a couple days later. It was so much fun! But now it's happening again! I have initiated all of our text convos since the last date(  which he has barley responded to) and now it's been 3 days since I've heard from him, again. It's really bothering me and I'm not sure what my next steps should be. Communication is really important and I don't want a relationship where I talk to some every 3-4 days. Am I being demanding/clingy? Is this normal? 

TLDR: I've been dating a guy for about 2 months who initially talked to me everyday but now will go 3-4 days without responding to my texts.

Dating Life

Closed down, withdrawn,
Fucked off, love torn,
Step back, stand tall,
Keep moving, don’t fall.
 
Hold on, keep up,
Rush around, always fuck,
Come back, go away,
Cuddle up, don’t stay.
 
Come together, push apart,
Shut off, open hearts,
Fuck around, stop start,
Live life, making marks.
 
Sitting on, dick throne,
Laid back, prone bone,
Cuppa tea, nice chat,
Lost time, don’t match.
 
Stay awake, all night,
Never listen, alright,
Loves high, one minute,
Touching souls, don’t limit.
 
Ring fenced, blinded eyes,
Pure sense, mesmerised,
Lost minds, sex freaks,
Next minute, don’t speak.

Hooking a catch is only part of the fight after all. Even the most beautiful fly, will fail to bring fish home if it is attached to a weak line with shoddy knots. The line is our personality and the knots our experiences - together our wisdom. Are we strong, resilient, and prepared to cast out time and time again until we are successful? At the end of the line is the person controlling the rod and who crafted the fly. This is really the most important part of the equation, because it is where the choices are made. The perfect set-up will not make up for a lack of a prudent plan. Everything could be right, but you are fishing in the wrong spot, or at the wrong time or not fishing when conditions are ideal. The person also controls how to deploy the fly and line - sometimes giving sometimes taking - but always thinking. This is how we must approach dating if we want to be successful.

The date was okay… it was a little awkward. I wasnt sure what to ask since I didnt want to ask the generic questions. I also didnt want to pry too much. I know I was awkward and maybe even boring. I had trouble figuring out how to talk to him. He kinda would say “nothing matters” and he kinda spaced out a little. I felt like i couldnt really carry a conversation. He pretty much would just say “nothing rly matters and we have no purpose” so it was hard to keep the conversation going. It was confusing because he seemed smart but also kinda weird. We ended up fooling around and we wanted to have sex but I couldnt since I had just started my period. Afterwards we tried to go out to eat but didnt find a place so he took me to my car and we kissed goodbye. I messaged him when I got home thanking him for taking me out and saying we should “make out again sometime”. Anyway I had a lot of fun fooling around with him but he never texted me after. I messaged him like 2 days later but never got a reply. Honestly I dont want a relationship right now I just want someone to hook up with. Anyway I dont really know how to proceed. I want to just fool around with him nothing serious. I have no idea how to do this honestly I just got out of a 7 year relationship with my high school sweetheart and am new to dating.

He wasn't really my type but I decided to swipe on him anyway and we matched. We started talking and we went on a date after about a week. We lived an hour away from each other and he said that he usually doesn't drive an hour to meet someone, and that he didn't think he'd consider dating someone because he just got out of a 2 year long relationship recently, but that there was just something about me. We also made out a few times, and we were flirting and stuff.

We kept texting for about a week after the date. He told me that he was obsessed with me and falling for me, and that he could see himself spending his life with me, and that he might be my perfect match. I've never been in a relationship before and only went on 4 dates total in my life, so I've never had someone say those things to me before, especially not someone so attractive and talented at everything.

We had a disagreement and he said that it seemed like I wasn't sure if I wanted to be with him, and he couldn't be with someone who wasn't sure if they wanted to be with him. I sent a bunch of messages asking him to reconsider, and he said that I was acting crazy and that I made him lose all of the feelings that he had for me, and that he'd have to have sex with me to see if he could get the feelings back. I didn't want to have sex with him so soon, after one date and a few weeks of knowing him, so we went our separate ways.

This was 2 years ago and I've gone on 4 dates since then, but I still think about him sometimes, and I haven't met someone since that I had such chemistry with, someone who felt the way he did about me.

I'm F and we were both 19 throughout this. Context of the nature of our relationship: Neither of us were looking for a relationship and we had a strict relationship policy. What i look for in a hookup is pretty much friends with benefits. I want to actually be able to enjoy time together, i work a lot and sex for only sex is hard for me to get into even if i did have time to arrange that kind of hookup. I took him out to eat a few times and paid for it, basically dates except more of a sex thing. So what we had going did look kind of close to a relationship, as one of my male friends pointed out (my roommate and i have overlapping friend groups and for awhile Caleb was over all the time so he met a lot of the new friends i have in the city i recently moved into). But i did not want a relationship, for many reasons, with this dude in particular. he really is not ambitious, and i enjoy listening to him talk but he hyper focuses on really uninteresting things and also has a tendency to mansplain really simple stuff. Nothing so over the top that i was uninterested entirely, as he would respond well when i called him out about mansplaining etc. So at the beginning we are hooking up and hanging out frequently, he has even met my brother and his friends while they were visiting and was there when my bro smoked weed for the first time ever, a moment important to me as a stoner big sis. The first weeks of us hanging out Caleb would offhandedly mention that he told his parents about me (he lives with his, i live in an apartment with a roommate) and i pointed out his behavior was looking like he wanted a relationship. He said he wasn't treating me any different than other girls he would hook up with. (he is pan with a lot of experience and pretty kinky) and i trusted that. However the general consensus with my friends was that he was my bitch. He did a lot for me in terms of what i value, he would meet me at work so i could hit a bowl before i went home, would rarely hesitate to get up and grab something for me, etc. Small things that overall i realize aren't amazing effort but in the moment i know it does take effort.

Well, we both got pretty busy with life (he works for his parents' business and community college classes started for him) and what was once a nearly every day thing turned into about once a week, sometimes more but pretty consistent schedule. Then a few weeks went by of us not talking except snap streaks (ik i hate our generation and i hate participating in this but it's how i keep in touch with many people who actually mean a lot to me, but yeah just the snapping empty face pics back and forth throughout the day). He turned me down when i asked him to come over a few times, and he finally told me that he was thinking about getting serious with the one other girl he'd been fucking. I asked if we were going to hang out again or if this was it, and he said ""he was for sure going to get serious with her but we could still hang out for now"". Neither of us are trying to have me mess with his new relationship, but he hadn't told her about his feelings yet, and couldn't tell me when he was planning on doing that. So another week passes of not actually talking and i ask why he is ghosting me. he says he's not, i ask to pick up my plants which had been at his house for a few months from when i had gone on vacation. on that particular day i was extremely depressed, did not want to be alone. i had wanted to make him be the one to initiate hanging out because he had been rejecting me every time i tried, but that day i really just wanted to be held. when i got there we smoked and fucked and fell asleep and then i put my plants in my car. he wasn't expecting me to want to stay the night and i knew he didn't want me to but that day was a really low point and i begged him to let me stay because i didn't want to be alone and told him i would stay on the other side of the bed, his whole thing was that he did want to sleep alone that night. So we go to bed and he fucks me again and when we're done i'm close but not touching him and he tells me ""scooch"" pretty much as far way from him as possible. i should've just left but he lives kinda far. he fucked me again in the morning and i left. that shit hurt so bad. he was a complete asshole but i also put myself in that situation by imposing myself on someone who obviously didn't want to spend time with me. what hurt the most is he looked in my eyes and i know i looked so fucking dead inside that day but he didn't care. the way the dynamic was before i know he actually cared about my feelings but it was just turned off and he was all of a sudden okay with treating me like shit. i even texted later against my better judgement asking if he was okay (him and his friends do harder drugs and he is prepping to take dmt and that kind of shit can affect how you treat other people if it starts messing with you) or if it was just the other girl. he confessed he had just lost interest and wasn't really into the sex that night. i told him that it wasn't even what i needed from him, i just needed his company. i knew when i went that that would probably be the last time i saw him because the plants were just kind of a loose string. i got any sex videos he had of us and we haven't seen each other since. we stopped snapping and it's been about 3 weeks but he still texted ""happy birthday nerd"" on my birthday. 

my whole thing is, i am not upset he found some other girl, i really do not want to date him and i'm not trying to keep him hostage in a half hookup/relationship thing, i know i can't expect loyalty and i don't. We had both been honest about how many other people we were seeing. I am okay with this thing ending just not in this way. What I am upset about, and i told him when he first finally fessed up about his feelings for the other girl, before everything else continued to drag on for a few weeks, is that he didn't tell me until i pressed him about it. If the situation were reversed, i would have expressed to him that our ""thing"" would likely be ending soon the moment i had caught interest in someone in a way that may go beyond sex.

One theory i have, spurred by my roommate insisting he was really into me at the beginning is that he really was kind of looking for a relationship and being stuck in the fwb got unfulfilling for him, this girl is willing to go for a relationship with him and he has moved on, doesn't care anymore about me in any capacity and i have to deal with that. On the other hand, what if he was taking advantage of me the whole time? He never took me out even when his money issues started straightening out, even though he said he would before. He could be a narcissist who enjoys playing with emotions. He would talk about how girls pine after him once they stop fucking and that was a red flag but i ignored it because again, i wasn't looking for a relationship and even though we would ""hang out"" we never hung out without having sex. It was a sex-based relationship, and i had to be the one to call out that fact that it wasn't the same. He would have just kept stringing me along for as long as possible with as little interaction as possible, i think, like a backup option. Honestly, i would've been okay with being ""backup"" if it didn't work out with her, but not anymore because of the way he disrespected me in the way it ended. He had basically told me he didn't have time to give her the attention she needed and also entertain me, that he wasn't a sex machine. THAT IS NOT WHAT I EXPECT, I ACTUALLY VALUE YOUR TIME JUST AT THE SAME TIME WHEN WE DO SET ASIDE TIME TO MEET UP THE NATURE OF OUR RELATIONSHIP IS THAT WE ARE FUCKING, IF THATS NOT WHAT YOU WANT JUST LET ME KNOW. 

Basically, i know not all of these can be answered but i would like a male perspective on some of this and also i know you ladies would have some experience with this more than my friends do. My questions are:

Does it seem like he was playing me the whole time to boost his ego? Or did I make a mistake in believing we wanted the same thing and accidentally pushed him away by being oblivious that he actually liked me? Am i crazy for expecting the level of communication i expect in a casual relationship? Was I an asshole maybe because it seems like i made him feel like i only valued the sex? 

tl;dr:
my fwb/hookup/situationship ended because he is getting serious with another girl, i feel disrespected by the way he ended things (by basically having no effort in maintaining anything until i ended it) and am trying to figure out if he stopped caring about my feelings at the time he gained interest in the girl, or if he didn't value them the whole time.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1048245,public,nsfw,"Why did he disrespect me so bad at the end of our ""relationship""?",0,[],0.75,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q21qxv/why_did_he_disrespect_me_so_bad_at_the_end_of_our/,promo_adult_nsfw,3,[],text,t2_8fj25obt,False,False,,,,,

He’s been great and I really love our relationship except for when I need to talk about something that’s bothering me. It’s usually just small things that come up and I will tell him what is bothering me and that it makes me upset or annoyed. What I want is to actually talk about it and address it so I feel better but all he usually does is just say he’s sorry and that’s it. I will make more comments about the topic hoping he will say more but then he just sits there in silence and I have to wait for him to talk which he never does. So I’ll have to keep telling him to say something and then he will say he has nothing else to say basically other than that he’s sorry and I’m right. This bothers me a lot because it makes me feel like he doesn’t care and just says sorry as an automated response and wants it to be over after that.

I’ve told him several times now that if he needs to think about what to say that I need him to say that out loud to me so I’m not sitting there waiting like an idiot. I just need him to say *something*, and he says he will but then it comes up again and he still doesn’t do anything differently. This has been getting to me more and more lately.

I told him I was annoyed about something, he said sorry, I clearly wanted to talk more about it, but then instead of continuing the conversation with me he actually started playing a game on his switch.

as a very self-pitying and bitter post, but to be honest I guess it is and I'm looking for advice on how to pull myself together and get over my negative thoughts - because recently they've been consuming me.

I'm a 23-year-old female and until May this year, no-one had ever shown a smidge of interest in me romantically. I went through school and four years of university without ever kissing anyone or even flirting with anyone. The closest I got is confessing to one of my good male friends that I fancied him and he said he didn't feel the same.

Of course, I understand I am not entitled to anyone/any attention (and I should point out me and my crush are still friends). But it's also natural that I crave a relationship/love/sex like the majority of other human beings and I just feel like I'm missing out on this huge part of life that seems to come so easily to everyone around me. 

That's really the key to all this - it seems to come so naturally to everyone around me and truthfully I feel a lot of resentment. All my female friends in university had men express interest in them/approach them etc, while I was the odd one out and just tried to suppress my feelings of inadequacy.

I'm not going to lie - I'm a little shy and do have low self-esteem, so I think that affected my experience in terms of meeting guys in uni to a degree. But it's weird because my friends are the same, some even shyer, more anti-social and less chatty than me, but still received attention and had that quintessential 'uni experience'. I just don't get it. There's also the possibility they're just more attractive than me - I was a little overweight (not by much) in uni admittedly, but it makes me feel sad to think that was the sole reason.

Anyway, since graduating from uni last year, I decided to take charge and joined dating apps to try and catch up. I've had my first kiss, had sex etc, and men have shown interest in me. But deep down I'm a hopeless romantic, so the idea of telling my friends and family that I met my future husband on Bumble or Tinder just makes me feel so awful. 

I've realised I don't enjoy getting to know people on dating apps. I just wish it happened 'organically'. I wish someone got to know me offline and showed interest in me in real life. I wish it wasn't so contrived, so 'obvious'. And ultimately the deeply feminine side to me wished I didn't have to go to such efforts to 'look for' or 'seek' attention and interest from men - I wish it came to me, like it seems to come so effortlessly so many other women I know. I realise this is quite fucked up but, basically, I wish it was a guy in real life taking the lead.

It doesn't help that two of my friends, completely independently of each other, recently told me that their male friends had asked them out after getting to know them and they are now in relationships. It just seems to fuel my mindset that everyone - or rather the people around me - is living a different life to me and I'm very abnormal and fundamentally undesirable. And I know I shouldn't rely on male validation to feel desirable - but when something seems to be happening to everyone else, I think it's natural to question what's wrong with you?

I know a lot of what I've said is fucked up, entitled and frankly whiny. But in all honesty, I don't know how to shake it and I often cry about it. I'm speaking to a guy I know from Bumble currently but I've decided if it doesn't work out, I'm taking myself off the apps entirely and seeking out this 'organic' connection I so badly crave. That's how much it means to me.

So there's a French exchange student in my university and I'm a master's international student. She's told me about her life, her family and that she loves a French dish called ""Galettes"" ( the savory kind - from what I know it's called Galettes de Sarrasin). 

Since I like her, and she's here only for 3 months so I thought I should make my move fast ( we've hung out only twice) .. because there's only 3 months. ( I hate how this sounds) . But yeah, I'm somewhat of a romantic... so if things workout then I don't mind long distance as France isn't that from from the UK.. and I'm thinking of moving there in a couple of years.

So she's been missing her family a lot because of something that's going on ( personal ) and she had told me that. So I was thinking of making her her favorite dish this Saturday...Infact, calling her over to make it together at my flat. 

I was thinking of asking her friend if she might be interested in me... and tell her about what I've planned . ( this is because she's a little shy, but oh boy when she talks... I just love it... love seeing/listening her talk)

What do you guys think? What should I do? Or do better?

To give some background to her situation is she recently left her job, has a side job she’s trying to keep up with, and is taking an extended vacation away from home this month. 

We share a lot in common and I like this girl but at times it bothers me that we haven’t hung out again. Initially I asked her what she was looking for and she said just messing around and had a terrible experience on tinder so prefers to get to know people in person first. 

Ok so that’s fine by me and I remain cool. Well we meet and grab food and take a walk around town at one of her favorite places and it goes well. We agree we each had fun and planned on doing it again but I thought something was up when she said I was a “super cool kid”. 

Well after that she remained really busy and the texts haven’t been as frequent as I’d like, once or twice a day but not very often like I had gotten acquainted to in my last “relationship” (if you could call it that). I’d say we text at least 3 days of the week. Anyways we chat often and I was getting annoyed that she wasn’t interested anymore in being friends so I asked directly and she replied that she was and sorry she made it feel that way.  

Now I know I may have messed things up by asking to be friends but honestly I don’t mind at all. She’s awesome and we share a fair bit and common and even though the conversation not as frequent as I’d like i still want to at least be her friend. 

Hopefully we can go out a second time and maybe I actually call it a date this time instead of a hangout but the question remains. Should I see where this goes or just cut all expectations of a romantic relationship?

I believe that is the basis of a relationship.** If that is not what you looking for, I respect that.""

Is  this absolutely insane or what? I am dumbstruck and feel absolutely gut punched. First of all, in no way did I hesitate to spend the $150 last  night, or the $100 on our first date, for food, gas, and event tickets.  She did not thank me at all when I took out my credit card and paid for  everything.

Also, what's even more  crazy is that we had a conversation about men and women being equal in a  relationship last night as well. We're in the same career profession,  and her salary is close to mine.

I have no clue how to respond. I really did enjoy my time with her and this text just feels absolutely insulting.

The problem I tend to find after much thought though is the time frame between dating someone and knowing if I actually like them that much to be in a committed relationship with them.

Years ago I used to jump the gun pretty quick, after maybe 2-3 dates on average before asking a woman I'm currently seeing if they actually want to be in a committed relationship. Pretty much all the time this turned out bad due to many various reasons such as lack of mutual interests, different lifestyle/schedules but most of all insecurities I didn't know until later on in the relationship. A couple of the nicest women I dated turned out to be the most narcissistic individuals I have ever met yet.

Due to this the past few years I have been cautious and taking my time in getting to know my date when seeing someone. However, by the time I'm sure I want to pop the question it's either they see me as a friend, just want to be a FWB relationship or they are actually seeing someone else already.

I guess my question is what time frame do you usually give yourself before knowing for sure you want to be in a relationship with someone you are dating?

\------------------------------------------------

Today he sent me a selfie, I responded to it and then he wrote me “love you”.

It's not like I lead them on, I tell them I am looking to date and we go out a few times and that's usually when I lose interest. 

It seems like I just don't click with anyone but part of me feels like it might be another problem too. I never really dated in college except one time but that didn't end well so I didn't really date for the rest of undergrad. As a result, I only really had physical relationships and it got me really used to that. After a while though, it didn't make me all that happy so I tried dating this past year. 

It got a little harder after that since it felt like everyone I wanted to date didn't want to commit either and the girls who wanted to date me I just didn't have an interest in.
