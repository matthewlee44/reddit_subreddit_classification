So I haven’t liked anyone for all of hs (I just say I’ve rly never “liked” anyone before) , and out of the blue I suddenly *think* I may like someone, but I’m not sure. We have a LOT in common- actually more than nearly everyone else I’ve met. But I’m really not sure if he’s “My type” which despite not being interested in people or dating, I have a very clear idea of since I’ve taken time to think and reflect upon my likes and dislikes in ppl (both alone and with my family!).

So I’m not sure what to do! He has a lot of traits and things in common w me that I like + would want in a potential bf/partner, but I feel like some aspects are missing. That aside, I really enjoy talking to him and he’s really sweet. He actually got my number this week because he heard me telling a friend of mine, and saved it and sent me a random emoji out of the blue (which I found funny)- so I feel like that could (???) show that he’s interested (not sure in what way though).

Now, we’ve each initiated text convos twice, and have talked and texted every day this week. Let me put this bluntly when I say that for some reason, I don’t know if I should text him today- I left class early and wanted to ask him abt the work since we worked tgt a little and hope a convo would spear from that (but is that the right way to go?!). Would it seem clingy? This is where I’m a bit lost- but it’s likely that I’m overthinking it (I’d sent a meme yesterday and he laughed at it and I texted again, but no response. Whereas the day before he texted me out of the blue w a pic that reminded him of a convo we had).

My mom and aunt recommended just going with it and seeing how I feel and how our convos flow, and I do like that advice. But to be real, I’m a little shaky about the whole texting-and-how-much-initiative-and-interest-to-show aspect.

So today I was talking to a coworker about how a new employee was telling people he’s into one of the girls that’s worked there for a while. We were talking about how the guy is brave as fuck to start a new job and put himself out there like that, and when I joked that if I’m into someone I just kind of awkwardly make eye contact at them from across the room, she laughed and said ‘I’ll need to watch out for you doing that so I’ll know “he must have a crush on him”.

I didn’t even correct her because I didn’t realise what she’d said straight away, and after it felt too awkward and insecure to be like ‘I’m not gay’ afterwards, as if it even matters lmfao, although it’s gonna be weird if she’s been telling other coworkers she thinks I am. I just thought it was interesting more than anything. I’ve never been attracted to any dudes in my life, but I’m very much not overly masculine. I’ll openly admit liking songs or movies women tend to like, I’m not overly forward when I’m into someone (see the conversation I had above lmfao), I don’t date that much, I’m quite shy and don’t talk about my personal life a lot, I’m polite and a bit of a people pleaser and always fooling around, never really being too serious.

This isn’t an isolated incident either. My guy friends joke about how I must be gay because I’ve never had a girlfriend (but that just seems like typical stupid male ball busting), my dad once asked me earnestly when I was younger if I was gay and that I didn’t have to be ashamed if I was, a couple of girls in bars I’ve talked to have thought it before, etc. It tends to be women that think it for the most part; it’s like in Friends where all women seem to think Chandler is gay, but none of the guys do, which is funny because I actually act a lot like Chandler does too generally now that I think about it.

Anyway is there a way I can kind of stop putting out this vibe? It doesn’t bother me too much, but my romantic life is empty enough already and I could probably do without people’s guesses about me before they know me well ruining my chances even more before I’ve even done anything.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1127916,public,self,I’ve noticed a lot of women seem to assume that I’m gay and I think it’s harming my dating prospects,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qxwu0q/ive_noticed_a_lot_of_women_seem_to_assume_that_im/,no_ads,0,,,,,,,

LACK OF ‘ECONOMICALLY-ATTRACTIVE’ MEN TO BLAME FOR DECLINE IN MARRIAGE RATES, STUDY SUGGESTS.

The average man makes 58% less than required by the average woman. At the same time the average wage gap is just 21%.

Therefore, the average man makes 58-21=37% less than what is needed for the average woman to be interested.

If there were absolutely no income inequality at all, the marriage rate would drop to nothing. There would be marriages at all.

The only reason why society still manages to have some level of marriages (and births) going, is because of the existence of some stubborn, residual income inequality.

However, the politicians are currently working overtime on stamping out this very last bit of income inequality. It is obvious that this will solve all problems.

No, on average it is not.

1. Be Happy- If you're not happy this can affect your game a lot. Your game will sound forced and scripted. You have to truly be happy and enthusiastic with what you're doing. Give latin grins and give happy vibes. This way, you'll say the right things. 

2. Be High Energy- You can't be low energy and have good game. You should be the loud and very energetic. You do not wanna be depressing. You wanna exert energy in a boss way. Mike The Situation from Jersey Shore is an expert at this. If you're at a party, dance and be very sociable. Low energy makes you look tired and your game will be wack. 

3. Look Good- I'm not referring to facial features when I say this. You must get your swag up. Get a nice haircut and look swagged out. If you look good you feel good and will have more confidence with women. Your swag and vibes will attrack these women and you can get them in the bag with your game and wordplay. 

4. Love Rejections- You must actively seek rejection from women. This will take away the fear to approach them. You must seek it like a fearless warrior. Rejection gives great experience to improve your game. If you've never approached women and fear rejection, I implore you to get rejected 10 times so that you get experience and see that rejection isn't anything. Me personally I love getting rejection by women because it helps my game and acts like a warmup. For every 1 rejection is 5 more kisses from different girls in the club! 

5. Have An Abundance Mentality- There are 4.5 billion women on this planet. If just 1% like you, that would be 45 MILLION women on earth who like you. That's an insane amount of options and if even only 1% in the world like you you'd never be able to meet all of them. No reason to fear rejection or get hung up on a girl with that many options. 

6. Be In The Present &amp; Do NOT Be In Your Head- You must be in the present when spitting game to women. If you're up in your head, you might get anxious and become awkward with her. Just take a deep breath and converse with her. Do not think about the future or the past. Just think about talking with her. 

7. Be Yourself- That's literally it. Be yourself. Dont try to act a certain way to impress her or any of that. Forget all of those guys telling you you must act like this guy or that guy. When you try to be someone else you develop multiple personality disorder. Just be yourself. As I said, if even 1% of women like you for you, you'd never be able to meet all of them and being yourself is the easiest for natural game. 

With these steps, you'll be able to develop natural authentic godly game in no time.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1127935,public,self,Guide to improve your game with women,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qxxkdm/guide_to_improve_your_game_with_women/,no_ads,0,,,,,,,

I am a 27M in the Army and have been serving since getting out of high school. My first assignment was to fort bliss in el paso Texas where I met my crush. She was also in the Army but in no way resembled the average soldier. She is sweet, beautiful, and just an all around great person. We would have long conversations on a daily basis where we would laugh, joke, smile, and just chat. It never got farther than that though, because at the time, she was married and has a son. Morally, I would never allow myself to interfere with a marriage, nor would I feel right being someone to break a marriage up. They were unhappy together though and she often expressed her frustrations. Eventually they would get a divorce, but this would not be until I left fort bliss.

 I go overseas for 3 years, get an international phone number, get rid of all social media (just because it is a waste of time to me), and continue just focusing on me. I thought of her often and always wondered to myself how she was doing. 

Fast forward to this week... I have finally returned from being out of country, I've deployed, gone to a new assignment on the east coast, and am very focused on my career. I get sent to a training to help advance my career and have to spend 6 weeks in a new base. I run into some old friends I knew from fort bliss, and we reminisce about people from the past, and I happen to mention my crush. I hadn't thought about her for a while at this point because I have been so focused on my career and doing my own thing. 

While in this temporary location, I cross paths with her, totally out of nowhere! My stomach dropped and she smiled at me and I smiled at her, incredibly excited. Unfortunately, I could only see her en passing so I didn't have a chance to have a talk with her. About 10 minutes pass, and I get a text.. its her! I still had her number saved, and evidently she still had mine. Like I said, I had an international number while I was gone, and I decided to get my number back when I returned. She invited me out with her friend and sister, as she was only staying for that one night. 

Eagerly, I said yes. And I met up with the trio and went on a fun filled adventure with them. Good food, good conversation, good people. I talked with her all night, we drank, we joked, we laughed, and then conversations got serious when I told her about my crush on her from bliss.... she didn't know about it at the time, but after I said it, a lot clicked to her. 

Mind you, she is now divorced and is single, totally crazy how all the stars were aligning for me. We talked very very deeply about a lot of different things. Her sister and friend were constantly telling me every time she walked away that she was totally into me.... 

We kissed. We had been drinking so driving wasn't an option. We ended up sharing a hotel room nearby so we slept in the same bed together (nothing sexual occurred as much as we both wanted it, no good decisions are made while drinking). Since that night I have been constantly thinking about her, messaging her and just catching up with her. 

I have no idea how long it will be before I see her again, as she is going overseas for a year very soon and I return to my actual duty station in a few weeks....

I guess what I am trying to say is I'm terrified that I may be overthinking and suffocating her with all my attention towards her. I'm genuinely terrified I might lose a great opportunity to be with someone I have held these deep feelings for, for a long time... what should I do in order to try and build this opportunity into a healthy relationship? 

TL;DR ran into a long time crush and hit it off. I don't want to miss an opportunity to develop a relationship with her and need help.

He's very good looking, has a great body, does a lot of sports, outdoor activities, loves traveling, smart, etc


But for some reason, I'm just not into him.
The thing is, it seems like he's really into me.
He's always planning for the next time we'll see each other. Always texting me, sending me pictures etc


He's looking for something serious, which I have trouble finding on the app.
So I've been telling myself to wait and give it some time, and maybe I'll develop something for him. Because for once, I met someone with all these criteria and who's into me.


We met twice, and at the end of the last date, we kissed, and I really didn't enjoy it. It felt like the guy was eating my entire face, and the noises he was making were a real turn off.


I still asked him if he wanted to come up to my apartment, to which he said no and that he'd rather savor each thing on its time.


I was relieved when he said that, I don't know why I asked him, but I already feel like I won't enjoy having sex at all with him.


He wanted to meet again this weekend, he suggested we go hiking and said that he'd love to stop by my place before the hike (probably for sex), I lied saying that a friend is coming over, just so I don't meet with him.
At this point I feel like I'm just buying some time, but at the same time I feel like I'm forcing myself to spend time with him.


Yesterday, he sent me a video of him, doing a mini strip tease and saying ""I thought about you this morning, here's something so you don't forget me this weekend"".


I texted him that I can't watch the video because I was at work, to which he replied ""ofc you can"".
I didn't, and saw it once I got home, then texted him that it wasn't appropriate for me to watch this kind of stuff at work.


And to be honest, I found it cringy.


He went on saying that it was supposed to be exciting and to turn me on, that that was another failure from him, that he was sorry he finds it difficult to be on the same page and that he'll need time to understand me.
An hour later he said something that kind of pissed me off: ""I think it's a cultural thing, we don't play the game of seduction the same way"".


I moved to this country 8 years ago, but this really has absolutely nothing to do with culture.
If it came from someone I was into, and if it was done a little smoother than that, I would have enjoyed it. But not in his case.


I don't know if I should try to end things with him or give it some more time.

I met her at a party and slid into her dms and asked for her snap and she gave it to me. However, after I got her snap, I found out from a mutual friend that she had a boyfriend so I texted her infrequently just to get to know her better and talked to her at parties, but did not flirt with her. After a month of knowing her, I found out that she broke up with her boyfriend so I began to text her more frequently and flirted with her a little bit. For example, I asked her what she was gonna be for Halloween and she told me and I said that it was a boring costume for someone so interesting and she saved it in Snapchat. I was at a Halloween party with her and I flirted with her and put my arm around her and she flirted back with me because she put her hand on my chest for a few seconds, was comfortable with my contact, and shared a drink with me. Many Redditors agreed that she was flirting with me. I decided to ask her to dinner as friends because she just got out of a relationship and didn’t want to rush anything and make her feel uncomfortable. She said she’d get dinner with me, but added that she’s not looking for a relationship right now. I said that I understood and we’d get dinner as friends and she agreed, but the day before the dinner, she texted me and said that getting dinner together was a bad idea because we have different expectations and that we don’t get along that well. I haven’t talked to her since then except saying hi when passing by, but my roommate is having a birthday party on Saturday and she’s coming and I don’t know what to do or think. Was she just using me for attention or just looking for a hookup and got scared off by my feelings? Do I ignore her at the party or talk to her? Do I bring up the rejection and talk to her to get a better understanding of why she rejected me? Do I flirt with her and act like nothing happened?

For context: I have an eye condition and I have been using eye drops to keep it in line since I was a baby, one of the side effects of those drops is depletion of fat in your eye area, giving you a hollow/sunken eyed look. To add to that, my glasses prescription is quite high so they distort my appearance even more. Btw despite all that I still look decent-good facially on my good days because I’ve been lucky enough to be blessed with good features at least(square jaw, prominent cheek bones, good lips etc).

All I ever get is rejection no matter the woman. They often come up with some stupid excuse why they don’t want anything but I know the reason deep down.



The only thing that matters to women is if you have a good looking face honestly. That’s why I don’t think being short is all that bad, yeah I’m tall but I’d much rather be shorter with a good face than what I am now. I’ve seen time and time again how they prioritise facial beauty over any other thing in men.

On the other hand you can be busted up as a woman but if your body is good even the highest value men will still find you attractive(seen this millions of times in person).

Honestly isn’t fair. Only thing that can make up for it is to be proper wealthy which most people will never be.

Also neither of us have dating experience.

Despite not being able to see each other for so long, we would watch movies (we've seen over 30 and I was putting her on the MCU movies) almost every night till like 3 in the morning while on Discord. She even made a playlist that was almost 4 hours long for me to put me on a new music genre.

We would talk through text with a lot of interest in each other everyday and we both wanted to eventually end up in a serious relationship so for the time being since we weren't able to meet each other but still liked each other a lot, we agreed to be exclusive to each other and not talk/see to anyone else. I wasn't gonna ask her out until we met at least 3-4 times. We would reschedule a date every time it got postponed due to her excuses which I always found valid and genuine.

About 2 months in, she asks me ""what if I don't want to date you?"". And I replied saying that I would ask why since we agreed to be exclusive to each other and she put so much interest and effort into me but I would understand and respect her decision. She then told me how she wants to date me because she likes me but also doesn't want to date. I thought she was just afraid to commit but her reasoning for why was that growing up she noticed multiple people's experience who are close to her get really mistreated in their relationships, recently her sister getting cheated on, and knowing how a relationship will end all really bothered her and so she didn't wanna lead me on so she changed her mind on wanting to date. I told her that other people's experiences shouldn't stop her from dating but she said that she can't seem to convince herself enough to try so she just doesn't want to date but wants to stay friends with me. I felt like she wasn't expanding her thinking and was thinking kinda immaturely but I just said that I was glad that we could at least stay friends.

Now this was a few days ago and we still talk everyday. She still asks a lot of questions with interest in what I do, how my day was, etc. and I reciprocate by asking the same back. Now I said I would respect her decision to not date me, but I feel like she'll change her mind again sooner or later. It's just that I would have to make some kind of moves to convince her to consider dating since she still does like me and talk to me with a lot of interest. I am keeping my options open since we're technically not exclusive anymore. I kinda wanna give her till the end of this year to see if she changes her mind and if I end up seeing someone else by then, then that's that.

I spent most of my life thinking I was above average, but after hanging out with a really pretty friend who consistently got attention and compliments from men around my presence, I started to understand what above average really meant, and it was quite a shattering realization for me.

I was hurt pretty bad by one person in the past, my first and only love, and despite many years passing, I still remember the pain vividly whenever I hear of anything slightly related to cheating.

I honestly think some people process things differently, and Im happy some people can find the confidence to bounce back quickly, but even if I moved on from this man, it still impacted my view of things a lot. Now, whenever I’m talking to a guy, I for some reason imagine a scenario of what would happen if he would meet my above average friend, and I don’t believe at all that he wouldn’t fall for her charming smile, beautifully shaped lips and curves.

I just feel like its all vain, like I could make a lot of efforts to find the perfect match, but theres always going to be someone prettier, more charistmatic, more intelligent than me, who could charm the man I am talking to. My intention with this post is not to complain but honestly, I just genuinely want to know: considering that my past history really affected me as a person, and that Im overall a pretty sensitive person when it comes to relationships, would it be best if I stay at peace and single? I remember when I was hurt it affected me professionally too and really took a toll on my mental health for many years, Im only just now more at peace with myself and I dont want anyone to shake my world again.

I wanna start by saying the first 18 years of my life i absolutely understand why no one would want me.

I was the very shy depressed kid. I took awful care of my self and was overweight with awful posture.

Start of 2020 I started to make allot of changes. Since then I have lifted and got buff. A little tummy fat is left but barely much. I fixed my posture and walk straight now. I started rock climbing as well for fun and socially to meet people and hopefully friends or even a date if it came to that. Keyword I did it for myself and for fun firstly.
I am still shy and introverted but if I’m comfy I am great socially I think? I can be awkward but can have deep conversation. VERY FUNNY and making people laugh and feel
Good about themselves. I feel like my personality is good. 

I also wanted to volunteer at my animal
Shelter and have a fresh start in college but due to covid I can’t attend either. IMPORTANT: I think honestly I will be really happy once I can do both of these. For the social aspect and for fun enjoyment. Making friends and possibly finding a date.

I also started using hinge bumble
And badoo since I am looking STRICTLY for something serious. I am not looking or wanting to be a player or fuck 100 supermodels a year. I LITERALLY only want one relationship. Someone I can fall in love with and eventually marry.

I know dating apps are garbage for most men but fuck what else am I supposed to do with Covid and masks mandate. I will admit my bio is straightforward  but my pictures are garbage. I don’t take pics of myself and it’s so hard finding a good pic or places to take fun natural pictures. 

The apps make me so fucking depressed barely a match a week if I’m lucky. And they either don’t respond or give a one word answer. I matched with a girl and got her number two days ago. I suggested an arcade date and she agreed. After finding out the distance was far for her I suggested a new place we can both meet halfway. Of course this ended with her ghosting me. Guess I was just a free date/dessert ticket lol.

I write detailed thorough messages and try to be engaged and not one women seems to have any interest. I am starting to grow bitter tbh.

Not once in my fucking life has any women looked at said yea he is good enough. Or I want him or wow he is cute. Not fucking once have I been wanted. 

Of course I have female colleagues and people I interact with who complain about having so many options and choices. I started to lose empathy and growing resentful. I know it’s not healthy but my god I’m not asking for a million dollars or to rule the world. Guess finding love is so fucking unnatural I’m not supposed to ever get it.

For this final part I wanna address some points that I am expecting to here. Please don’t say it will happen eventually. Those are empty words and no guarantees. I also hear dating gets way better when you are in your 30’s. Yea I’m supposed to be happy about a good dating life when I am 30 and already a third of my life is gone if I’m lucky.

Also forget to mention! Most traumatic or horrible experiences I have had in life was due to women. Most women in my family have mental issues and are very rude. Two female teachers embarrassed me so bad I still remember it to this day.

I have even hear some complaining about attracting black men or finding them unattractive.  I mean , to each person their preferences and I respect that .

I didn't see once a mixed race woman say :"" I prefer black men "" or "" I love black men"" . At best what I hear is I don't have a type .

We're both 26 f and m

I was not at a good place when we met and he effortlessly took me to a better place.

Like he encouraged me to be better without trying. 

We became really close and now things are much not intimate between us.

We have recently planned a trip for just us. He went over the top extra.  We'll share the cost ofcourse but he will be taking to bigger share for some reason. 

But recently, he hasn't been sharing important stuff or even things like how was your day
Ans- it was good. Met frend or busy day with work. That's all and nothing else. 

He will go meet his nephew and he will not mention it at all.  Or any celebration of joyous activity he did and he won't mention it at all. 

This is making me feel like I'm sharing too much or like he's suddenly closed off with his personal activities. 

We have discussed and have had mature conversation. He says that he has always been closed off and that I please please ask him if I want to know anythingn (his exact words) 

It seems like He really tries. And he does take interest in me the same.

But he was not like this to me. Otherwise we wouldn't have gotten close in the first place. 

I'm not sure I want to bring this up again and again. But it's causing me a lot of worry and I'm scared I'm messing this up. He is also worried that I'm worried.

I have always told him that be open even if he hates me because in that way I'll know.
