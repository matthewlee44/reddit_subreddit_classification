I love love but it apparently doesn‚Äôt notice me at all. I‚Äôve felt invisible my whole life when it comes to attracting the opposite sex. Don‚Äôt know how many times guys would tell me how beautiful my sister was. Lord knows no one ever said that about me to her though. Growing up chunky didn‚Äôt help, but even after losing a bunch of weight, I‚Äôm still not noticed. Like WTF??? Then when I do manage to attract someone, it‚Äôs the worst of the worst. Just a bunch of liars who want a piece of ass on the side. I‚Äôve always been naive when it comes to love and unfortunately that leaves me vulnerable to a bunch of vultures. I fear that by the time love really does find me, I may be to bitter and broken to notice üò¢ 

And yes, I‚Äôve been married. Been separated for awhile now, finally divorcing legally lol and there are no hard feelings. My ex and I are the best of friends. We met at a time when both of us desired freedom from our overbearing mothers and so we quickly moved in together. I‚Äôll admit I rushed marriage because I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd find anyone else that would want to be with me. My ex wasn‚Äôt really my type, in fact I thought he was gay the first time I met him (i was sort of right, btw üòù) but he enjoyed my company and I his, so figured I‚Äôd better shackle him before someone else came along to steal his attention ü§™ Our marriage was good. We never argued or any of that dramatic shit. Always had a good time in each other‚Äôs company. The intimacy was severely lacking though and that‚Äôs just something that I truly needed to feel. We had sex but I never felt desired. The best compliment I‚Äôd get was, ‚Äúyou look decent‚Äù. I know we could‚Äôve easily stayed married, but it totally was turning into a platonic type friendship and I just wasn‚Äôt down with that. Plus there was some infidelity on his part (with men). Didn‚Äôt bother me really, because I knew he had only dated men before we got together, so figured he missed them. What bothered me was that I felt like I wasn‚Äôt enough. We had an open marriage at the end. He was much better at finding decent guys than I was lol. 

We have two kids together and there‚Äôs absolutely no drama where custody is concerned. He‚Äôs currently engaged and I even get along great with his fianc√©e. Sometimes it‚Äôs hard seeing them all lovey with each other when he was never like that with me, but I‚Äôm glad he learned how to show affection because it‚Äôs important. I always remind him to tell his fianc√©e how beautiful she is, because it‚Äôs important for a woman to know that her man desires her. 

So, here I am at 40, back in the dating world and it‚Äôs worse now than it was when I was younger. My cuddle buddy is a pillow. Don‚Äôt really even have friends to hang out with. They‚Äôre all married/taken and already have their close knit circles of married friends/family. I have no idea where to meet people because I‚Äôve become a socially anxious introvert. Oh well.

It was an absolutely wonderful day! Perfect weather and the dogs had a blast at a couple of dog parks along the coast. She was mesmerized by Portland Head light that she‚Äôd never visited. It‚Äôs kinda sad that many lighthouse lovers skip it on their Maine trips. It is far and away the best experience. Not as beautiful as Nubble, but the park lands, old fort, cliff walks and incredible rocks make for a perfect day of picnics and soul refreshing.

The down news. Zero rooms or cottages, pets allowed, since we‚Äôd had a stretch of weather that drew insane crowds to Maine. 

So we had fun. Talked endlessly about family and only once did I feel like a witness being grilled by the prosecutor.

We ate greasy food at Old Orchard Beach, where the scenery is bad/good for an old mans heart. Discovered that my 3 year old, eternal puppy, is indeed an incredible chick magnet. She got so many ear scritches she was overwhelmed. Little new walkers giggling at the puppy and quite a few adults thanking me for the therapy  my girl provides.

On the ride home, I nearly crapped as she began an in-depth discussion of sex. What she liked and hates about her former husband and boyfriends. I was literally drooling and after about 30 minutes I dug deep down and popped the question. ‚ÄúWould you like to go back to my home for a bottle of red and whatever?‚Äù

She kinda said yes, but then the day of sun and walking crept up on both of us. Beach tired is a thing. And the mood made a 180 when she drew out the long, ugly history of my loveless marriage. She asked when was the last time I had sex and I told her the truth, which is not always the best policy. It‚Äôs been too long to mention here, but the temperature in my car completely changed.

We parted at the park and ride with hugs and a drawn out goodnight that included a commitment to do it again with advanced reservations in two weeks and of course, plans to meet at the dog park this morning.

I put up a profile on match a few days ago and quickly matched with 4 different men that appeared to be attractive and decent all-around people.

The act of logging in and having the text conversations just seemed so onerous I decided it wasn't worth it. I found myself nit-picking things about their profiles looking for excuses to un-match- so I decided that meant my heart wasn't in it and I was wasting their time.

For my entire adult life, I've been fit. In my pre-kid years this was because I loved to (and still had time to) play sports, and when the kids were little I had enough energy to get up at 5am to get my springs and workouts in. When I was 42, I came down with illness-related chronic fatigue which impacted my ability to get up at 5am, but since my kids were driving (and thus ignoring me) and I was in a dead bedroom with a wife who preferred going out with friends rather than hanging out with me, this gave me no shortage of time to spend my evenings taking long walks, running sprints and going to the gym. 

Then last year I unexpectedly ended up on the dating circuit (after my wife of 25 years left me), and met someone (53F) who is so very kind and attentive. And suddenly I no longer am free in the evenings since we usually spend that time together, if not doing something fun then at least doing something cozy/intimate. But since I met her, something strange is happening.

I'm starting to put on weight. And enough weight that my SO likes to tease me a little bit about it. 

Am I ridiculously overweight? 

No. 

But my abs, which were defined just a few short months ago, are starting to disappear behind a thin layer of whatever, my fitted shirts are getting tighter, and I'm getting a little winded those times when I do take long walks or run up stairs. And my SO likes to tease me a little bit about my evolving body, although she still makes a point to point out that she thinks I am sexy. 

I never thought there'd be a time when I'd start to wonder about my weight. But that time has arrived. But what I'm finding most unusual is that I""m not overly concerned about it. As I type this, for example, my SO is at the office finishing a presentation, and I'm tempted to break a sweat a little bit, but I know she'll be home soon, and then if I'm waiting for her she'll give me a big hug and a lingering kiss and then we'll chat happily as we make dinner together, and I'd MUCH rather wait for that then risk missing her while I""m running or walking. 

So I'm trading my once kick-ass 51 year old body for a 52 year-old softer version of me. And I'm so very happy about this. Because what I know from experience is that it is far worse to be fit in a dead bedroom, then to be a little overweight in a loving one. And I'm just so grateful that I""m learning that at 52 that the term ""Fat and happy"" is an actual thing, most especially the happy part of that.

I've noticed a lot that knowing so many things up front about a person (as much or as little as the person wants to share on their profile) kind of creates deal-breakers that didn't exist before. With more pieces of a person's line of thinking, personality, etc., you have more options to say yes or no about what the person says on their profile. 

Some details are important, but too many before meeting just seems like a kind of broken cheat code that may otherwise be cheating you out of forming a real relationship with someone, and perhaps accepting or compromising on some differences as you grow as a couple, but this certain detail or that initially made you turn your nose at a stranger. 

It's kind of like how you naturally tend to hold less judgment and understand or have empathy for someone you know than someone you don't. 

Does anyone else find this to be the case for them? Is it sometimes just better to take a chance on a profile with little information, or try to ignore some of the things you don't particularly like?

I‚Äôve known him most of my life and he holds a very special place in my heart. 

He really struggled through the years. Working long hours in physically demanding jobs. His ex stayed home with the kids &amp; mismanaged money. They had 2 bankruptcies and lots of debt. When he finally put his foot down about money, she took off. Left the kids with him. 

He‚Äôs trying to clean things up, but he‚Äôs still struggling with money. He gives in to the whims of the kids, buys them almost everything they want. 

I don‚Äôt have kids, so I don‚Äôt understand it and I know I have no right to judge, but the way they talk to him infuriates me. The ex is also combative and condescending and guilt trips him into taking on more. He rarely gets worked up about it or confronts and stops it. He is passive and mellow about everything. 

He‚Äôs 45, gets 4-6 hours of sleep a night, does everything around the house and takes care of the menagerie of animals the ex left behind, too. 

When he comes to see me, I will pay for the flight. On one visit he whipped out a plasma donation credit card to buy lunch. He donates regularly. It really rubbed me the wrong way. It‚Äôs a metaphor for his life. Draining his life essence to pacify people who don‚Äôt give a crap about his health.

I can see doing this in your 20‚Äôs. But he is not young, he‚Äôs exhausted all the time. He is getting forgetful. He just shouldn‚Äôt be doing it. I asked him to stop. To find a way to use his skills to get odd jobs instead.  He‚Äôs been wanting to start a business &amp; I have been actively encouraging him. 

He donated a few days ago after saying he wouldn‚Äôt and I lost my mind and ended the relationship. I know I overreacted and it‚Äôs probably not the donation itself, but I am so sad. I just see this as a dead end. He has no savings, no boundaries, no plans, no real foundation. Just work hard until there‚Äôs absolutely nothing left to give. 

I can‚Äôt be witness to this. I love him so much and I know he feels the same way about me, but he can‚Äôt prioritize himself or his health, the kids get all of him and I feel that, in turn, our amazing relationship would die as a result. I can see so many scenarios in our future that end in major sadness. Frankly, I don‚Äôt want to get wrapped up in the mess, either. It seems so out of control.

I‚Äôm dating for the first time in years, using online apps.  It has gone pretty well so far.  Certainly better than some of the horror stories and dread that I hear.  I‚Äôm not overly challenged or overly stressed by dating, as I am outgoing, have a fairly high emotional intelligence, don‚Äôt get crushed by rejection, am fit, and so on.

It makes me less confident than I otherwise know I should be.
 
I have decided to do a hair transplant.  My reason to post is not to discuss whether I should or shouldn‚Äôt, and so no need to post things like ‚Äújust shave it and own it‚Äù or ‚Äòwomen dig bald men‚Äù.  I have already decided.
 
My question is around the first couple months after the transplant, and generally speaking, how forthcoming to be about it with women I meet and am dating.  The doctor has told me that my hair will look like a monk for the first while until it grows in, as they have to shave certain areas at the top and middle.  Plus there will be scarring.
 
I met someone last week from online.  It was the day before she was going away for a couple weeks.  The day after we met (her first day away) she messaged me and said what a great time she had and that she‚Äôd like to do it again.  With how timing works I‚Äôll see her again a day or two before the surgery.  Should I tell her?  If not, how should I deal with the next four weeks where it would be obvious.  Should I tell others I meet?  Or should I just lay low from dating for a few weeks until it is no longer apparent?

I‚Äôll spare you all the gory details. We had our first and only fight - over something that seemed completely inconsequential to me - and she broke it off.  

I was crushed. It physically hurt. I'd had this vision of getting to know her kids, and a life with her and growing old together and now it was all gone. I did not think at my age someone could get to me like that. She cut me deep.

In retrospect, I can see this relationship wasn‚Äôt going to work. There were a number of things that were problematic that I won‚Äôt go into here. They say love is blind, yadda yadda. You can‚Äôt see all the flaws while you‚Äôre standing in too close. Still, it hurt. Heart bleeding out on the pavement. And I will be very reluctant to have things move along so quickly with someone ever again. 

XX 

So let‚Äôs get back to the present. I went on a few dates last summer mid-pandemic, all with the same person. Pandemic dating was a little weird and all the dates were outdoors, but I don‚Äôt think that was it. My heart still wasn‚Äôt in it. 

Jump to now. I am trying to get back in the game. Have not given Red a second thought. If you‚Äôd asked, I would have said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm completely over her.‚Äù  Actually went on a date last week ‚Ä¶ and it was fine. Not sure if that is going anywhere - we met for dinner and drinks, and we might meet again for coffee. I left it open ended ‚Ä¶ this person has not actually finalized her divorce yet.  

So the other day I was watching some stupid new sitcom on Netflix and one of the characters bore such a resemblance to Red (all except the red hair) - down to her mannerisms, the shape of her mouth, everything, and it still just ... hit me like a semi truck to the chest. There it is, knife to the heart. She cut me deep.  

Honestly, if anything I‚Äôm disappointed in myself. It‚Äôs been over two years! What is my frikking problem? Sigh. If I shared any of this with my buddies, they would say, ‚ÄúDude, you just need to get laid.‚Äù Maybe. I have had one night stands in my life, and I have to say they aren‚Äôt my jam.  

Give me advice, Reddit people. Is this what it‚Äôs going to be like now that I‚Äôve moved past fifty? I know they write songs about you and your broken heart for a reason. It‚Äôs just that I finally thought I was on the mend. I would really like to find that person who gets me, and I get her, and you know, we have each other‚Äôs back against all perils great or small.

In the 7 months that we've been in a committed relationship (known each other for 10+ years), there have been two occasions in which he has gone low/no contact with me for 7+ days at a time.

And another week-long+ stint is about to begin Sunday night.

You see, along with being in a romantic, long distance relationship with myself, he is also in a long-distance parental relationship with his 2 children (30F, 32M). 

So, when one or both of his kids come into town to visit, they stay for extended periods of time (at least a week). Now, because my SO is the most incredible father, he dedicates all of his free time to visiting with them until he goes home to sleep (they stay in their mother's large house, not his apt.).

His children know about me and they're fully supportive. They're also in healthy, happy, long-term relationships of their own. Because of all the distances between us, I've yet to meet them.

Typically, SO and I speak every single night, and multiple times during the weekend, which is often difficult to coordinate as I'm 2 hours ahead in a different time zone. My nighty conversations with him usually begin after 9:00 p.m. every night.

The issue is: when his children are in town, I'm meant to step back and not expect any contact from him. If, in fact, I'd like to wait until he's available to talk in the evenings, I'd have to wait until, at least, midnight.

Whereas I'm not jealous and I've never mandated that he alter his schedule to ""fit me in,"" I can't help but feel like he's concocted this conflict in his mind where he has to choose between them and me. Obviously, I lose every time.

I'd be lying if I said this didn't sting. I just feel like the back-burner human. Also, I feel like this raises red flags. If I'm on one side and they're on the other, there will always be a choice to be made. I feel like this is absurd. If it were me, I'd manage to balance my family and my romantic partner...and my family would be incredibly understanding. I would never imagine that I'd have to turn the lights off on him so that I could shine it on them.

I've talked to him about balance. I've talked to him about being able to have us all and not chose, but he's incapable of managing to love us all at the same time. And I often wonder if even his children, who are fabulous human beings, wonder why he's never in contact with me while in their presence.

I just don't know if I can go on knowing that I'll always be ""the loser.""",True,False,False,datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,55981,public,self,"I'm not jealous, so where is this coming from???",0,[],0.88,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/p8h4cv/im_not_jealous_so_where_is_this_coming_from/,some_ads,7,b50cbf0c-3935-11e9-a609-0e217b8f2048,Seeking Advice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I‚Äôm writing this post on an anonymous blog mainly because it‚Äôs one of the few places I feel like I can express myself without getting pity or scorn. I want an honest opinion though on what is the likelihood of me ever finding someone in a reasonable time frame( I don‚Äôt count finding someone as a geriatric bc that doesn‚Äôt count).

I‚Äôve always been introverted in high school, and I never had anyone interested in me at that time. I met someone in college, he was a manager at the store I worked at and he was 16 years older than me. He was my first serious relationship, and I was with him for 4 1/2 years, mainly because I contracted herpes type two from him and felt like that was going to be a dealbreaker for evermore for anyone else. Unfortunately, the relationship didn‚Äôt last, and I spent the rest of my 20s pretty much alone.

I met my most significant relationship at 28 and we were pretty serious, minus being physically intimate, because he was a strict Catholic and didn‚Äôt believe in premarital sex, so the herpes wasn‚Äôt an issue for him. However, the relationship wasn‚Äôt without his drama over the five years we were together, and he admitted to me several times that he didn‚Äôt really find me attractive and that I wasn‚Äôt the type of girl that would attract guys sexually, and that they had to be willing to get to know me to be attracted to me.

After we broke up, I had a rebound relationship that lasted six months, and I knew this guy was a bit of a player to begin with but I didn‚Äôt care and I thought he was interested in getting involved long-term, because he said all the right things. However, he was turned off by the herpes and I basically had to beg him to be willing to sleep with me ‚Äì I hadn‚Äôt had sex in almost 10 years at this point ‚Äì so it was pretty humiliating. He did finally sleep with me, but we broke up a couple months later.

I have basically never dated since despite moving us to New York City and living there for four years. I finally decided to have anonymous IVF so that I could have a child because I could tell my time was running out. Luckily, that worked and I had my son when I was 38. Since New York was pretty expensive I moved back to my home state and agreed to have my mom move in with me to provide free childcare pop, and let her save her Social Security money. It‚Äôs been working out, but I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs another limitation, as I feel like I can‚Äôt really go out and have social life, even with friends, because she won‚Äôt go out and have one of her own, so I don‚Äôt  feel like I‚Äôm using her as a constant babysitter.

So now here I am at 42, and watching all of my nieces and nephews get married, some for the second time even. I won‚Äôt deny that I feel jealous and resentful at times, and wonder if the door is completely shut or I have too many barriers against me. I posted it in the MI ugly thread but haven‚Äôt had any response yet, I can post my picture here if anyone wants to give me an honest response. I know I‚Äôm overweight, but I feel like the combination of that, being unattractive, plus the herpes, plus the single mom thing pretty much blacklist me at this point. What do you all think? And if you agree with me, can you tell me how to get past the resentment so that I can live my life and that feels so bitter sometimes? I feel a double edge sword now that my son is starting preschool and he‚Äôs starting to see obvious family differences and I feel like I don‚Äôt know how to tell him he doesn‚Äôt have a father figure.",True,False,False,datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,56007,public,self,What are my chances?,0,[],0.9,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/p8vcz2/what_are_my_chances/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We've texted back and forth all day every 15 minutes or so. By 11 pm we were really, really turned on from flirting - no sexting or anything like that - just 2 very similar personalities So, of course we had to ask each other about our deepest fantasies. I told him mine, which is really a mild version of massage porn plus some foot licking lol üòÑ His was really a jaw- dropping-could never-ever- would have guessed fantasy about sexing me with another guy first by watching us then by participating to reclaim his wife/pu**y. It was hot the way he described it and i thought about it too in the past for a short while while watching porn.¬†

I told him i just can't do it because

1. I'm a romantic, passionate, jealous woman. I'm a sensitive soul. I want to love and feel loved deeply. I don't want to be shared. I don't want to start dating someone who enjoys watching his woman being fu**d by another dude!!¬†

2.Maybe if I was in my 20's or 30's I'd say let's try it out and experiment and see where this goes, but in my 40's, when father TIME is no longer my friend, and looking for a partner and a relationship, i have to make good decisions from the beginning, or try my best to do so lol üòÑ

3. What if I love the experience so much, the high/ dopamine release i would get from it could be so intense - that nothing else sexually could top it? You know the stories about women overusing vibrators, and not being able to or having really hard time reaching an orgasm with a guy? Or people who try meth for fun at a party and then go back to it over and over until it takes over their lives? What if I'll like it so much that I'll seek the same experience with whomever I'm dating, but would lose potential relationships with good guys by suggesting something like this (and immediately being judged as a cheater or weirdo)? 

I'm really curious if any other women have been proposed this before or had this type of experience?¬† How was it? Will you do it again? Amazing? Biggest mistake ever?¬†

I don‚Äôt know if anyone remembers my post about connecting with someone through OLD and how i felt butterflies and how i was really into him cause he was cool. well, we meet last week and yes, dude‚Äôs physically super perfect, and i love his nerdy brain. he was giving me lots of attention the week prior to meeting, texting etc. after we met, we kissed on the second date and talked about previous relationships. well, he has some major issues to work out, not only about his ex but just his own insecurities. he takes everything personally in random conversations, making interactions challenging. he grew up in a very dysfunctional home, i totally understand why he reacts the way he does, and i truly don‚Äôt mind getting through it with him as long as he gets help or works on himself, somehow. he‚Äôs super open and receptive so i suggested talking to someone and told him how therapy has changed my life. i used to be super self conscious about everything and very insecure. i used to have horrible anxiety and would make dudes the center of my life and attention, seeking their approval. my therapists helped me be more assertive and to always put myself first. i told him how caring for myself first had helped me not only deal with my own dysfunctional family but  also being realistic in relationships. i explained all this to him and he said he doesn‚Äôt want to talk to anyone. he said therapy has never worked for him, and that he doesn‚Äôt want a therapist to tell him he has issues. i tried to explain that therapists don‚Äôt approach healing that way, and how in the end, we all have issues and there‚Äôs absolutely nothing wrong with it. he changed the subject, and we continued talking about other things.  he then got super annoyed because i explained how i found it challenging to believe in long term relationships, when theres so many divorces. He said he believes in LTR, and that relationships are partnerships. well that was it for me, i laughed so hard in my head. if he believes relationships are partnerships, how does he plan on working things out when things get tough with someone without working on himself? After that i had to distance myself. it really hurts when a person with so much to give doesn‚Äôt open themselves to working out their baggage. Maybe he‚Äôll do it for someone else, if he falls for someone else? who knows, i wish he did it for himself. not my problem to solve or worry about.

However, having moved to the Bible belt of the country (not by choice , by any means), I've found that it's a big deal for a lot of people here. I have lost count of the number of people who put faith first in their lives, or go on about how important religion and God is to them in their OLD profiles. 

I've gotten to the point that any mention makes me want to automatically swipe left. But if I did that, it seems like I'd practically be left with either unemotionally available people looking for something casual, or out of towners who left their app on or are in travel mode. 

BTW, travel mode is so annoying. Every time I see someone somewhat promising, I scroll down and see travel mode. Ugh. 

Like, if you are a religious person and have God in your life, cool. I'm not really gonna judge that, but it's not a big interest to me. But, I'm not going to truck my happy ass to church for any reason other than a wedding or a funeral, so if you're looking for a partner to help you fill the pews on Sunday morning (or Wednesday, or whenever people want to go to Church), that ain't it for me. 

It does seem like if you're mentioning it on your profile, then it's pretty damn important. Or, IDK, maybe it's just something people mention bc it is the Bible belt and it seems important?
