Some months ago my long-term relationship ended and now I started dating again. I've been on a first date with a few guys and there's one of them I like, in fact, we like each other a lot. He's a super smart and attractive guy, our second date was amazing, I'd say it was the best date I ever had. We have common interests and great chemistry. 

Everything was perfect between us, lots of fun together, deep conversations, great sex, but one day, he told me he wasn't sure he wanted to continue going on dates with me because he's still destroyed after his last relationship :( I kinda was in the same situation but dating him helped to heal my broken heart.

One week ago he texted me again asking how was everything going, I replied and asked how was he doing, then he asked if I had any plan for the day after, and before I had the time to reply he had deleted the message. I didn't feel like asking him why did he do that so the conversation ended there.

Do you think I should ask him out again? I know he wants but there's something in his brain stopping him and I don't know what to do.

Started talking to a guy (26M) on hinge. Soon exchanged numbers and hit it off instantly, we had the same interests, likes dislikes and all that. After talking a bit we realised that i'm looking for something serious and long term whereas he's just looking for casual sex. We still decide to keep talking to see where it goes because we clicked really well. He soon started making plans for where he'll take me out on dates when the lockdown gets lifted (my city is in a lockdown still) which i thought was a little too soon to think about that.  Soon conversations started getting flirty and sexual. Told him i'm not comfortable with this and explained him why. He told me that even though he's really sexually attracted to me he will respect my boundaries. After some time he proceeds to flirt again and i again tell him that idk what to respond i get awkward with these kinds of things. Next day we decided to talk over a phone call. It went really well. I enjoyed talking to him. He told me about his past and a traumatic relationship he'd been in and thats why he wants only casual stuff now. I explained to him too that i've had a phase where i was only hooking up with guys and  i've had to deal with a lot of fuckboys and i ended up falling for 2 of them and that i've been ghosted too. Basically i have some trust issues with guys. So when any guy tries to get sexual with me now i just can't do it casually anymore and i get weird. I also told him that i like him and i am attracted to him too and that just give me some time for me to get comfortable. 
He seemed to understand. He also told me to not  worry about this and that he likes me and wants to stick around until i get comfortable with him even though having is patience one of his weak points he wants to do it for me because i'm worth it and that he'll respect my boundaries from now on. Next 2 days its fine, little flirty but i don't mind that i engage even.  But yet again after 2 days we're texting and he gets extremely sexual. We have an arguement again and i tell him to stop flirting he agrees again. After this he becomes a little distant. I try to talk to him normally as a friend would and try to get to know him more. I just didn't get the same energy back, conversations seemed forced with him now. 
I texted him a lengthy text basically saying i like you and i am attracted to you, but i need time to work on my issues and i can't give him what he wants so soon. But i would like for him to remain in my life as a friend for now as we genuinely get along well otherwise. He just replied saying 'okay, i understand. We'll be friends' that's it. But he hardly texts first anymore, i keep initiating conversations. What should i do? Should i just let it go?

I am very mistrusting and have to work on that. I sent him a long text, telling him that I can’t deal with his late responses or that I feel fooled. 

He is ignoring me ever since last Saturday. I tried to reach out several times via WhatsApp and called one time. He isn’t responding whatsoever. I tried to apologize and everything, but nothing works. 

He still has my number saved him, since I still see his photo and he has it on „only for contacts“. Of course he still could have deleted the chat. He didn’t block me or sth like that and still follows me on Instagram. It’s really weird.

Our topics would only revolve around work and the pandemic (and srsly no one wants to talk about those all the time). After days of texting, I was finally able to get his name. I suggested video chatting to mix things up but he rejected the idea from the get-go. As for me, I wasn’t really comfortable talking to someone I haven’t really met, and not having able to put a face to the person I was currently talking to. Not giving me his name upfront too was also red flag for me. I don’t think being shy is an excuse not to give out your name. 
Now, I’ve been replying late to his text messages and sometimes not replying at all, which is rude, I know, but he’s so insistent with texting me every single night. I seriously don’t want to waste each other’s time and I also don’t want to ghost him because other than it’s rude, my dad’s friend would also be offended if they knew.

I was balding and have decided to have a shaved head and I do go to the gym.

Previously I've had a lot of issues with self confidence and was insecure due to my appearance and bullying. I still have some insecurities but after seeking professional help I'm in somewhat of a better place.

I've never had any success with the ladies, either online or in person. During my late 20's I got a desperate and paid for two dating platform but never even got a match. I even tried asking my friends if they had any single friends who they can introduce me to, it would usually result in either I getting ghosted after a few texts messages or them saying they already have a boyfriend/not ready for a relationship.

Due to the nature of my job I have to take care of myself (like hygiene, grooming, and clothing), and as mentioned earlier I go to the gym too. I'm completely lost here. I want to have at least one relationship in my lifetime, I also want to experience my first kiss.

Last night, I kissed him and it ended up going a little further as well. We went upstairs and we were about to have sex until he stopped me and said he isn't ready for sex yet and wanted to continue kissing me. I was totally okay with it and continued till we slept together (no intercourse).

The next morning we had a small chat, and he asked me if I was willing to get an STD test, and I asked why. His exact quote was ""as much as I like using protection for sex, it doesn't quite feel right until I do it without protection. So I always want to get tested along with the lady to make sure having unprotected sex is an option"". I know getting the test is the right thing to do, but it just felt super awkward being asked that and I don't know how to proceed with this.

I’ll try to put everything that might be important so maybe you can get a better sense of what happened, and I apologize in advance if my English or writing skills aren’t the best.
I (24,M) have been chatting lately with a girl from my university (22,f).
I still don’t know her very well, but from what I have understood for now is that she is a very kind, gentle person, she speaks in a very soft voice, very intelligent (one of the best in our university, and our university is very big), she is shy and introverted, kinda awkward sometimes, and I think she might have some OCD (she doesn’t cross the road unless in some specific points and other weird things).
At first she was very warm and friendly, then we started to get into politics, and she got kinda cold from that point. 
I was starting to feel kinda interested in her so it was disappointing, but I said to myself whatever and I let the conversation die off. 
Then she writes me again, but the friendliness was still gone, and she was just asking for help in statistics. Again, weird, she is like levels above me so why should she ask me? I didn’t want to keep the conversation going, so I let it die.
Then she writes me again, but ended in the same way. Because every time I try to be friendly but she acts very cold and it didn’t give me a good vibe.
This pattern goes on for a while, Until three days ago she gets back to being friendly suddently. Long story short I compliment her, she takes it well, make a couple of jokes, it feels like everything is going well, and I ask her out. 
We went out yesterday evening, and I really liked her and passing my time with her. I thought it went great.
She writes me again yesterday night thanking me for the time passed together, I answer her this morning with a light joke and complimenting her smile (which I really think it was amazing, maybe she thought it was cheesy?) and a heart. And then the dreaded answer “😊”.
Another thing that might be important: every time I was “too kind”, in the most general way, she would back off a little.

I (M22) had a visceral connection with this girl (F23) I met through tinder, who was super into me and I was her, but this was at the beginning of the pandemic. We talked a lot, sending long messages, discussing our passions and hobbies such as painting and Animal Crossing. We zoomed once and talked for like two hours, she genuinely seemed interested in me, and would ask questions about me, asking my opinions on things. The sad thing about all this is I never actually got to meet her, as both our parents were incredibly strict about COVID, so meeting in person wasn’t an option, except I was fine waiting till after the pandemic as I’m a very patient person.

As of September, this girl went to grad school in the UK, so she moved away (we live in the states), and left my last message without responding. We had talked about her going away but never touched on where ‘we’ stood. I had asked her if she wanted to zoom again, I decided to give her some time and let things flow, as we both suffer from depression. I didn’t hear anything back from her, so I sent another text in January, saying I’m still interested in meeting up. Still nothing. A few days later, I see on her Spotify that she has a playlist ‘fucking depressed’. A month after that, a playlist of hers popped up with the title ‘LDR’ she had made. These threw me off because I thought they were about me (songs in her playlists that we used to talk about). I also understand being single in a different country (I wouldn’t necessarily want to be tethered to someone I haven’t actually met)  

Recently, she had another Instagram account pop up, this one about Animal Crossing. I thought this was dope, so I hit that follow button. A few days progress, and she removed me on all social media, except switch and tinder (???) I’m having a hard time getting closure or figuring out what to do.

I really like her, and I thought she felt the same but it feels like she is pushing me away. I’m not sure if me following that new account triggered her depression, but I just want to know where we stand. She returns from grad school in August, so I want to reconnect with her.

So I'm a little worried. I (18F) know that a guy (18M) is going to ask me for a date in a few months but I don't know if I should agree. (He's 18, I'm 17 but he's planning to ask me on my 18th birthday) 

On one hand, I have developed strong feelings for him. I'm completely smitten and blinded but I don't want to get myself hurt. 

On the other hand, I don't think that I can trust him. 

He was a player but I don't know what happened, he suddenly got obsessed with me. I was indifferent and cut contact with him because at that time I didn't want to be associated with such a person. (Once he did pull a risky stunt just to be able to see me) 

Now, he has transformed himself completely (as in he has become more understanding, ambitious about his career and all that). I have respect for him as he isn't just being a bully, he is actively trying to work on himself and his mistakes. 

We reconnected about an year or an year and a half back. He has been such a positive influence and I have never felt this way. I have never even dated anyone purely because I never wanted to but now I feel a little different. 

Is the past a problem or should I forget how he was? 

I feel like he truly cares and is genuine but I can't help it, I don't want to see myself hurt. My closest 3 friends have been in abusive relationships and 1 is pregnant right now. I live in a third world country and almost everyone is against them now, they've become so weak. I want to continue being their support, not be stuck in an abusive relationship.

The problem is, our worldview is very different and our perception of happiness is very different. I feel lucky to get to know her and really appreciate her effort, but at the same time, this makes me kind of uncomfortable and I feel repelled by what she tries to make of me.

I usually cut people off very easily once I find they are toxic, and I am scared that I will cut her off eventually.

Yes, I want to sometimes have fun in my life but I'm a more goal-oriented person and she doesn't seem to understand this. She is a very light-hearted, down-to-earth type of person.

I didn't know how to react and she obviously misunderstood what I responded and got suddenly angry (she thought I said ""you should know yourself.""

I texted her a long message about the miscommunication and things that are making me uncomfortable because I knew that if I don't deal with it, I would cut her off.

I'm not what I would personally consider attractive, despite being in okay shape and not overweight, but I'm also not terrible to look at. I guess...middle of the pack? Average?

I've been online dating on and off for years, largely because I get uncomfortable being around large groups of new people/strangers and because I'm more introverted than not.

I'm definitely on the more geeky side of hobbies, but some of my more mainstream ones are cooking, performing stand-up comedy, pets, and writing. I'm a graduate student looking for a post-pandemic job while finishing up school for advertising/marketing.

Admittedly, I haven't had nearly as much time spent dating IRL/in-person, and COVID obviously took a year and change from everyone's life outside, but even before lockdowns and what not. I've put work into my online profiles and pictures, but I just get this sense that a lot of women aren't interested in dating an Asian man, whether it be biases, stereotypes, etc. I've also encountered studies done on online dating which seem to reinforce this point, and I'm getting a little frustrated with how much effort I'm putting into dating/making connections (online until California reopens), but not really getting anything out of it.

I guess what I'm asking for is advice, opinions, and input.

probably a big thing is that she's moving back to france for the summer, and she only has a few weeks left in the summer. Taking this into consideration, I recently sent her a follow-up text to see if she'd like to hang out again before she leaves... and nothing since then...

- Guys who didn’t really put efforts when we were going out  then came back saying “I should’ve tried harder”. No problems, but I moved on with someone already. They kept coming back after a few months checking on me and suggesting going out as friends. I’m fine with that. But until I talk to them in a friendly way they left me on read lol

I met this guy while I was travelling to a nearby city for work. We’ve been talking since February. Prior to leaving on vacation to see his boys for Memorial Day weekend, he texted me to say that he needed to get his last fill before leaving. We went back and forth for a couple of hours and I wished him well on the trip. He returned on Tuesday evening, but I didn’t wanna reach out in case he had the post vacation blues. 10 days passed and he finally texted me. We had a very great conversation and at the end he said, “I wanted to make sure we didn’t go out of touch because I do like talking to you a bunch. I have a tendency to be shitty with reaching out, but didn’t want to let that happen here.” Furthermore, he called me a gem and said he would keep the train moving somehow.

3 days pass and I text him to see how he’s doing. Not just that, but I let him know that he was on my mind. I realize this was very forward of me. He responded by saying he thought his novelty would’ve worn out by now. Wished me a goodnight and said, “You know you’re in my mind, too.”

Up until our last interaction, he has given me absolutely nothing to distinguish whether he sees me romantically or as a friend. I’m not used to talking to someone for this long and not knowing where we stand. I could ask him, but I don’t want to make the situation uncomfortable and risk losing the bond we’ve built.
