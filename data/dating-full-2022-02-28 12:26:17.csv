Good date and less great dates with same guy

So had mostly good dates with a guy met his parents on the last date. For some reason I felt like on the last date I was quieter and that makes me feel more boring I wasn't asking as many questions. I just internalize it think they will lose interest. Although he has said to me on dates too sorry if I am quieter today(although I never thought he has been). I feel like most of the time it flows well-but any time it doesn't or I feel more reserved I just uber internalize it.

On other dates he has talked about us travelling together

He always talks about doing things in the future on dates including this one

Today he said-I have not told my friends about you-didn't explain why and I didn't ask I thought it was odd and took me off guard. But am I being crazy I mean i have met his family....and that went well he said they liked me

Is it normal to feel like omg every date is amazing wonderful great convo or is that unrealistic. I just feel a lot of pressure to be interesting/engaging

Mostly for OLD. I am starting to feel pessimistic and unexcited about first dates. No matter how good I feel a first or 2nd date goes they dont find what they are looking for. Its not like I dont sometimes agree that we are compatible or turn people down, but the rate of failure is so high. I know that is how dating goes for many, but I feel I need a break and figure things out.   


I go through confident times and then lose it for a couple days or week. I workout, eat healthy, have a career, have hobbies, etc. I take care of myself and believe in a growth mindset.   


Recently a friend got it in my head that another friend seemed interested in me. I didnt know if that was the case as I've felt some mixed messages, but thought maybe she was a bit awkward. So I made a few small advances and felt a stone wall. Now I feel like I just need to clear the air with her so things arent awkward and we can just be friends if she has no interest. It was frustrating to yet again sense that women did not see me as a potential partner.  


Im feeling undesirable. Im in the best health of my life and felt like I have good things going, but my ability to attract women are awful.   


I have an apt to start seeing a therapist so im excited about that. I think prior to trying out dating I had a higher view on the turnout. I think I believed that more women would be interested, but what I am finding is that I way overestimated my ability to attract women. Silly I know, but im find the reality is that women are not impressed at all by me (not that its the goal), but while I show interest in others hobbies and successes, I dont feel a return in that.   


I do a lot of things like cooking, working out, reading etc and apart of the reason is to feel more confident and better about myself and my ability to be a good partner and hopefully some day a father.

We clicked a lot, when we are together it’s amazing, we speak everyday and we tell everything.
I know that I just met him in December but I was actually so exciting about him.

We are planning an small vacation next weekend. Today he told me “before we booked everything I need to tell you some news” and then he told me that he is leaving the country in June.

Now, I don’t know what to do. I’m already attached to him and I feel that if I go on vacations with him or if I keep talking to him I’m going to hurt myself but I also want to see him and I know life is crazy.

So I decided to text him last night and said “Hey would you want to hang out sometime? And I mentioned who I was. So far I’ve noticed he’s not that good of a texter because Saturday night he texted me and said hey told me it was him from and I got excited because I had thought he wanted to text me on his own. But I then I replied said hey and he didn’t respond till the next day with “ I wanted to ask if you could switch shifts with me today?” So I felt so stupid in that moment because I was clowing myself that he was probably interested.

I’ll be the first to admit I showed up late to a few of our first dates because of work, traffic, and putting in the effort to get ready as ladies tend to do. It was usually 5-10 minutes, the longest was 15 minutes with him waiting in his car downstairs. Most of the time it was because he’d ask if 15 minutes before the original time we agreed upon would work, and I’d try to meet that. Then he started showing up late, and I get that parking can be hit or miss, but he even showed up 10 minutes later than the postponed time with me just standing on the street looking like a dumbass. On the next date, I asked him what time is good and agreed to his suggestion. I followed up asking if the time still works and he said yes but he forgot he had to be on a call for an organization he’s a part of. So our date started off with us not talking in his car for 45 minutes while we listened to this call and drove to our destination. He did agree to my idea for the date activity over his, so maybe he was put off by that and retaliating a bit. I like him but it felt weird to start a date like that. What is everyone’s thoughts? Was he wrong or is it a gray area? Should I talk to him about it? Thank you!!

TLDR: He started our date by taking a 45 minute call during our date while driving us to our destination and we weren’t talking.

Your dating stories are so encouraging and I’m glad I’m not the only one who deals with this!


I’ll explain what happened because reading all of your stories is really invigorating my self-esteem. Thank you so much for sharing what happened to you in the most painful times that you might be experiencing.
 I (34f) was seeing someone for the past four years. He had done his residency in my hometown and we met on a dating app.
At first, I enjoyed the attention, he love bombed me the first couple of weeks, saying he wanted to “marry” me (he said he was joking) spending hours on the phone, seeing one another. 
I thought he was a nice guy, but I wasn’t really that attracted to him physically. He wasn’t really my type but he had amazing qualities and I thought I should just give it a shot. Everyone kept pushing him on me and saying that, he’s giving me so much attention and he is a doctor. I didn’t care so much for his profession but there were things he did that caused me some concern. I work in behavioral health and research, so I recognize that he was giving me too much attention and promising way too much so early. I also noticed that when I had to leave his place early to go to class or my father‘s birthday, he was upset but very passive aggressive.
My gut was telling me, these are qualities that would be amazing on the person really for me. I brushed them off and listened to everyone else.
Going forward a few months down the line I asked him if he wanted to see where things would go with us, and he let me know that he wasn’t ready for a relationship. I assumed he was seeing someone else and was letting me down gently. It didn’t feel terrible but I felt rejected and stopped messaging him. I thought, well, I’ll be okay. I was honestly ok after a day or two. 
He wouldn’t stop messaging me and even kept going. Sending me pictures of his family, more promises, more lies.
Again, more pressure from my friends and family saying to make it work, to try it out, to do more.
I didn’t want to. I didn’t want to break my neck or be inconvenienced. I just wanted to live! So I did and saw other people.
Fast forward to now, last week he was over my place and we fooled around. He’s gained a significant amount of weight that he waddles when he walks. I felt concerned but I respect him and didn’t want to say anything to hurt his feelings. I’ve been on a weight loss journey and I didn’t want to be preachy.
I asked him while he was there if he still wanted to spend time with me and do all the things that we had planned. He said he wanted to spend time with me and everything. He kissed me, held me so lovingly, and I thought to myself, I could really try and work on this now because I do wanna relationship and he’s here.
Just last Friday, he reached out to me and said that he met someone and he’s never felt like this before. All I texted back to him, was the question, what was I to you exactly?
He said he really cared about me and we could be friends and talk about anime.
I didn’t respond and immediately deleted every single thing on my phone. Pictures, social media, and his number.
I could have been vicious and say cruel things but there was no need for me to do so.
I have taken rejection so personally my entire life. I have always felt that I had to earn my place in peoples lives, that I never deserved just to be there because of who I was. I forced relationships and friendships just to prove that I was good enough.
My life has been changing so much lately, with the weight loss, with getting a great new job, with moving to a new city, with accomplishing things I never thought I could do.
I feel so grateful honestly because for the first time in my life I feel really good about the future and I don’t feel scared because my security blanket was pulled from me and that I’m going to be 35 with no man or no children. I feel like I can be so strong and that I am strong, I feel confident that I can have the love that I want.
I don’t feel like what he did is a definition of me for the first time in my life.
So many people, my friends and my family, have apologized to me for not listening to my concerns over the years and to also accept those apologies for them pushing him on me and always encouraging me to try with him.
I’m proud of myself for some of the boundaries I set and I forgive myself for the ones that I needed to. I should have let go sooner! Way sooner! 
I always thought that if this happened to me with him, I would be so damn devastated.
I just feel so free. I just feel so optimistic. However, I do feel disrespected that he slept with me and promised more lies. If he had not slept with me and told me he was seeing someone, I would gladly be his friend. 
If someone wants to leave, let. Them. GO!
It’s OK if you tell yourself things to make yourself feel better, you might need that right now so when you don’t need it anymore, you’ll be just fine.
So that’s it.
That’s a story I’m glad anyone reads and feels good about themselves and their decision. 
It’s worth to hurt now to be better later.

Now to the point, I (23m) have fallen out of love with my girlfriend(20f). This has been a slow process over the of course of the past year in a relationship of three years. There is one big problem in our relationship that persists to be a huge problem and that is insecurity on her part,this insecurity has been a problem that has persisted since honestly the beginning of the relationship, and honestly it was pretty bad in the beginning, it has gotten much better (ik sounds cliche but I will give proof of examples further within the post although it got worse before it got better). 

 Now for history of the beginning. She has always been opposed with me having any interaction with people of the opposite sex. Even in the beginning she didn’t want me hanging out with my best friend (who is gay, female) because she thought I was lying about it until my bsf sent her a picture (I’m sorry I’m not too familiar with terms and am ignorant in some categories please get me on speed in the comments, but basically she dresses and looks like what society has normalized to be “masculine”) that’s when she was okay to the idea of it, but as far as any of my of my female friends that were into guys I essentially cut them off to compromise in what made her comfortable. The reason I did this is because I’m really serious about relationships and compromise because I didn’t see it as a problem I believe I was thinking too long term. I was thinking, “when I’m married I don’t think I’m going to have these friends anyway because I can’t realistically see me FaceTiming other women talking for hours while in bed with my wife” or just having a level of connection that I consider substantial enough to have a legitimate bond, the thoughts of three years ago.This is my gf not my wife (the realization).

However as you’d expect the insecurity didn’t stop just there. She began to have conversations with me saying that she didn’t feel comfortable talking to girls at all unless I have to, and further elaborated that if I did to keep it about the reason I needed to talk to them such as conversations only about work or just about school assignments if it was a group project that the teacher assigned. Obviously I didn’t do that because that was stupid which I told her and she would have breakdowns about it, so immature me just told her what she wanted to hear in order to protect her feelings. Which I’ve grown out of as I grew more self-respect and respect for her and realized that it was wrong to do that even if it hurts her feelings and honestly it was a lame move as I did it because I lacked the backbone for tough conversations sometimes because I was so stressed at times with her.She began to start adding stuff out of nowhere like she didn’t want me to add or follow any girl on social media which I actually followed suit on because I didn’t think it was a big deal. What messed that up is that she had passwords to all my social media because I have nothing to hide, and then I started noticing changes, realizations that she was removing people. People I’ve known all my life, girls I went to school with were friends with before I cut them off etc. not because they were being extra seductive on social media, but because she said she felt they were prettier than her and older than her and that she feared I would see how pretty they were and how much better their body looked and they they were older and that I would leave her for them. That’s when I started doing some self reflecting and coming upon the idea that I was feeling so restricted in my relationship. 
 
This was year one, year 2 starts And then I really began talking to her expressing how I felt and she had breakdowns and cried and we argued and it was tough but she slowly started coming around. She started changing how she thought she became okay with me adding girl on social media, she became okay with the boundary of not having my passwords, and overall changed her overall mindset on a lot even took on doing therapy as I suggested, but It didn’t fix everything. She still would have occasional episodes of insecurity and it lead to a slow but now high level of resentment that I feel now, it’s been times I’ve broken up with her for short periods of times never more than a day because I felt so fed up but persistent on trying because of the progress. She would’ve even come to my house when I broke up with her and since I live with my mom (who I don’t have a close relationship with) and that I don’t tell my business as I don’t want her telling my business she would just let her in as she likes my gf even though she wasn’t aware of those situations ( I’m sure she had an idea sometimes however) this has added to the resentment. 

Now (present) She’s still uncomfortable with me making or having friends(still have 1 that’s the bsf) of the opposite sex everytime I bring up the topic she just says “I don’t know” and that she needs time to think on it and come around and I don’t do anything unless she gives me the okay she’s comfortable with it such as the social media thing. She asks why it’s so important to me and I reply that I just don’t like feeling so restricted with who I decide I want to bond and be friends with and honestly I really miss some of my friends they were good friends I’ve had for years, some needed to be cut off because of history, but the way I see it, what’s so bad about having friends of the opposite sex as long as you’re transparent and set respectable boundaries and if boundaries cross cut them off after explaining why. 

My main takeaway is, I honestly just fell out of love this past year, year three because although she’s much better mentally and we don’t nearly even argue as much about the same issues, I just feel like it was so much in the beginning that damaged our potential to be closer and that all the insecurity and arguments killed a lot of the intimacy because the fact that the problem still persists even at a much smaller level 3 years later leaves me feeling bitter. Even though she’s made a lot of progress I find myself feeling unsatisfied and the fact that she still is holding on to some insecurity such as the no female friends thing I just feel like the progress is too slow for me as I feel in 3 years it shouldn’t be an issue especially when I showed her I was willing to compromise and follow her requests even if I disagreed. The annoying and sad part is ik I have to break up with her but she will constantly show up to my house and then I  will have to cold shoulder her until she leaves me alone. I still love her but not in a romantic way. I just want to go my separate ways

He contacted me in july 2021 and we had ended on ""okay"" terms, we had a few friendly chats around the start of 2020 but we went almost a year with zero contact. When we first started talking it was friendly but then it started escalating and things were getting flirty and he was eager to meet up. I had mentioned about us getting back together and he expressed that he wanted to wait until we met up. He would always accuse me of leading him on because it had been 2 months since HE messaged ME and I wasn’t ready to meet up yet so he’d get in a mood and say I’m leading him on and try give me ultimatums :/ Anyway, about a month of him basically begging to meet up, we finally did (September 2021) I really regret this but we ended up having sex. The next day he messaged me saying he doesn't want to be in a relationship, I honestly felt terrible and used. I was in a bad place at the time in general and I later decided that I didn't want a relationship atm
either and just wanted friends with benefits, I thought it wouldn't be as stressful. But then be got super controlling, he wanted to know what I was doing, who I was talking to, he’d try to go through my phone, asking where
I was (he gaslit me in to sharing my location) also he can go out with friends and I wouldn't hear a single word from him for 8 hours, but when I don't reply for an hour he's blowing up my phone -_- he wanted relationship benefits without being in a relationship. He eventually stopped
calling/texting as much as he used to, he would be cold and distant and less affectionate, he even stopped having sex with me lol, I’d always find him doing/saying things just to trigger me. I
felt so lonely and ridiculous, everything was always my fault according to him, he never took any blame for anything. He then started telling me he would like to marry me :/ I was confused af, it almost felt like emotional and mental abuse. January 2022 I had enough and wrote out a whole paragraph expressing my feelings, I was getting mixed signals because who tells someone they’ll marry them but don’t want to even commit to a relationship?! :/ I basically said I need to know where I stand and if he don’t wanna be in a relationship with me then I don’t want to continue wasting time arguing with someone every single day that I’m not even in a relationship with and not even having sex with, I just felt like an emotional punching bag, just someone he can take his anger out on after a bad day :/ I’d ask when am I seeing him again and his response would be “idk I’ll let you know” but was always going out with his friends.. anyway, he didn't care and didn’t take me serious so I told him I don't want to be in this situation anymore and don’t want to talk. the next day he messaged me “good morning love hope you slept well” as if nothing happened and I didn't respond. He even threatened to call my mom if I don't respond to his calls/texts, he even contacted me on a whole different number and a whole new instagram account :/.

He is completely head over heels for me from what I gather. Here is the thing, I just don't have any sorts of feelings back for him.

He is a great guy and on paper does represent the guy I want. He is smart, kind, caring, good with kids, educated, determined, motivated, would be willing to take on a child care role, wants a career-oriented educated wife, and is a virgin who believes in commitment over sleeping around. I have been praying for someone like him.

But truth be told, I just don't like him. That spark just isn't there. He is a good person, we get along, I like him as a friend. But I just do not see myself dating him. Why? I am honestly not sure and I feel really bad about the reasons that could be there. Firstly is that i just don't find him physically attractive. Yes he is tall (6' I think) but beyond that I just don't like the way he looks. Despite exercising, he is overweight (and not in muscle). His glasses and tendency to wear dress shirts and khakis, combined with his general appearance, give him that nerd look that I just can't find myself attracted to. He also is from a South Asian background and I just don't find guys from there as attractive. I am not racist, I'm just attracted to people from that ethnicity and I feel really bad about it. I do not think he is necessarily ugly per se, just not my type.

There is also the situation of class. I grew up upper-middle class, went to a private school, have a cottage, am a daughter of a businessman, parents are landlords, etc. He is solidly middle class, was low income went younger, has no cottage or investment property, etc. For context our college is mostly upper-middle and upper class private school educated white kids and tends to attract smart and ambitious kids and where we live and grew up (Canada) income is not the barrier to education here the way it is in the US. I am cognizant of my privilege but having hung around smart, ambitious, rich people my whole life I just don't find the allure of a smart, ambitious, non-rich person. I also will likely outearn him based on chosen careers. In short I just find his lower financial class to be a turn-off

A mutual friend of ours (F20) thinks I should give him a chance; that attraction develops over time and to not reject people based on superficial grounds. But I truly have no attraction to him. How should I approach this and how can I reject him without breaking his heart?

He would reassure me time and time again that I wasn't just a booty call and that I meant a lot to him and that what we had was more than a sexual connection. Anyways, throughout the time we spent together, there were many red flags. For instance, we spend Valentine together and he said he didn't believe in it and that valentines were a capitalistic thing. He told me he was grateful I was with him and that he had never experienced valentines day with someone before like me. Anyways, I went home and although I didn't have him on Facebook I did take a look at this profile that day and noticed that he had shared a photo memory from 2 years ago of him and his ex spending valentines in Toronto. I was so upset at this, especially because he had posted this while he was with me. But I didn't say anything and continued with him. Another thing he did was hide his Instagram stories from me. I noticed this because I was in my finsta and looked him up and saw that I couldn't see his stories on my real Instagram ( were we followed each other). But what did I do? I stayed and kept quiet. I guess I was living in the delusion that maybe just maybe he felt something for me the way I felt for him. He was such a smooth talker in person, but when it came to communicating when we weren't in person he was distant. He would ignore my texts and not communicate. I would write him romantic things and we wouldn't even respond to this but talk about food or something like that. One time when we were having sex, he told me ""can you control your emotions"". This took me by surprise because he knew how I fell and that I really liked him. I asked him to be honest with me and over and over again he reassured me I was special to him and that we had more than just sex. But clearly, it was all a facade. Anyways, he told me he was moving to Colombia and the day before he left he told me,"" I have women in Miami and stuff but you are the only one that's wifey material"". WTF, I should've said something. I should've left a long time ago. I should've demanded the respect that I deserve. I end up saying nothing and looking back I think I did this because I knew he was leaving and I wanted to hold on to the few moments we had left together. The day he left we had an argument on the phone and he gaslighted me so bad. Then he proceeded to block me everywhere. This has me hurting, I know that I should have left and blocked him a long time ago. He was a bum. He was 28, didn't have a car, worked at Walmart, smoked and drank every day, didn't finish college, and lived messily. And here I am a 22-year-old college senior with so much potential crying over him. Shit, I uber to his place so many times and he never offered to pay for any! I know I need to work on myself and demand better. But at the moment I'm hurting so much and feel heartbroken. I really loved him and cared for him and he didn't see that, didn't appreciate it. I wonder what was I to him? Why did he not appreciate me? Why did I give so much and he gave me nothing?!

I’m not exactly hard core dedicated to searching for my next relationship, but always keeping myself open to the possibilities of new people and dating apps are a good way to passively look.

I also have some spare cash so every once in a while I buy premium on apps like bumble or tinder if nothing else other than being able to see the people that have liked my profile. 

But I’ve grown to notice some sort of anomaly I suppose. You see I’m a perfectly average looking dude, I get… maybe 1-2 likes a week. But after not continuing my subscription, in 1 week I’ve received up to 30 new hits. This is way beyond my average. I didn’t update my profile, I didn’t move location, I just stopped paying. And now I see 30 blurred profiles of possible dates. Frankly All Im really thinking about is what kind of shady emotional manipulation these apps partake in to get me to drop more cash rather than having any actual excitement about people having interest in me.

I’m also no idiot, I get these apps are born to manipulate you into spending money and feed on your sense of FOMO, but I actually wanted to make this post to see if you guys have had similar experiences with dating apps treating you better when you cancel your sub rather than when you regularly pay them. 
I’ve seen suggestions that “new” profiles get almost twice as many hits because they algorithm pushes them to the top of peoples queues.

Now, we've been dating for more than half a year. It's pretty discouraging and honestly a turnoff that she'd wonder with her mom whether I really did visit my parents for a week (I had sent her plenty of photos during my stay), or after watching Tinder Swinder, ""feeling sus"" about me. I realize these may be jokes, but it *does* get to me in combination.

We're not even connected on any social media. My Instagram and Facebook requests are still pending. 

Fine, I get that she doesn't use social media often, and one could argue that it's not a ""genuine"" way to connect... But that feels like an outdated view. Who refuses to add their bf to Instagram because they're ""not ready"" and only prefers to text and call? Texting is inconvenient for me because I can't send large media without it compressing, there are no enhanced features like backgrounds or reactions (I don't use iMessage). 

It feels like she *still* doesn't fully trust me and is setting herself for minimal heartbreak in case we separate. Is this something to be concerned about? Is it unreasonable to want to be connected to her through other media? Am I right to feel like she doesn't trust me? Should I bring up these feelings to her and explore her side more?

We clicked immediately, many things in common, great connection, we could vent to eachother about mental health and such.

We met a bunch of times, got intimate and such, i was very happy and it seemed she was genuinely too.

Then the most unexpected thing happened.

I didn't hear from her much during christmas time.

I really wanted to see her again.

Time passed and it was minimal texting.

The day before new years eve she told me she got a boyfriend a couple days ago (then)

I was heartbroken, but she still really wants me as a good friend.

I've now since been keeping in touch with her, we've been thinking of meeting up again as friends...

But nothing ever happens, she doesn't really give any energy back.

And i still hurt a LOT, from what we had, and what could have been. It's literally tearing me appart, ripping any sort of happiness away.

I have a feeling the only thing that can help is to forget everything and move on.

Should i send her one last text saying goodbye forever?

I'm so unsure, she is a great soul, and i don't want to hurt her, but it's again, tearing me appart. I can't think of her without getting depressed and beat myself up mentally.

Fuck... I'm such a people-pleaser...

So, I did some digging to find a way to contact him. I went to his college's website and there was a student lookup page, where you could enter a first name and a big list would appear of each one with their major and email. I eventually found him after going through each and every person with the same first name in the list, and so I emailed him. I even phrased it in a way that I acknowledged the circumstances were odd, but I would like to get back in touch if he wanted. So I left him my number and he texted me and we chatted a bit. He just asked me ""how did you find my email anyway""? And because we haven't been talking more than a few texts back and forth, I'm wondering if he's put off and creeped out, or genuinely wants to know how I found it.

I’m writing this post to see what others think I should do to try and fix this and get my boyfriend to accept this part of me. This is my first ever relationship and his 2nd. We have an amazing relationship and no problems overall except one thing. I used to do sex work when I was younger and have been retired for about 2 years. ( I know being underage and doing that type of work is wrong and have done therapy about the topic. It was all online) among other questionable things I’ve done in the past. this is our only problem but I think it’s a make or break depending if he’ll be able to accept it or not. This relationship means a lot to me and I really want this to work and try and do everything I can do be the best girlfriend and offer support and am 100% honest and open as I know the topic is touchy for him and makes him uncomfortable so I want everything to be on the table. 
With this issue has come lots of talks and discussions about our feelings and where we’re at. He is much less experienced than me sexually as I’m the 2nd person he’s ever been with and the idea of me having slept with around 20 people (all Hookups) makes him upset as well as me still being interested in sex workers lives as I like stripper Tik Tok and just think it’s interesting but have never engaged in it as well as wanting to do sex therapy once I graduate. He is very ethical and moral and is graduating med school in a few months and this worries him. I remember a few months ago this topic came up and he said he was always terrified of being with a woman like me and throughout our relationship when this topic comes up he doesn’t know if he’ll be able to get over and accept this. I’ve tried to show him who I am and do everything I can to show that but I’m worried it won’t be enough. He struggles with anxiety and depression and worried and over thinks, I do the same. 
When he expresses his worry for the future it makes me kinda shut down and not know what to say. I waited a really long time for someone like him and he is the most kind and genuine person I’ve ever met and makes me feel like no one else has. I want this relationship and I want a future with him and we’ve agreed we both want that. But he’s worried that maybe we’re just too different. These conversations bring up a lot of past relationship trauma and how I always felt like I’d be alone forever and that being a former SWer even though my life is different now and I’m on the “right track” and have done the work and therapy to change myself for the better I always felt like I wasn’t good enough for anyone to want a real relationship with me and this makes me feel like that. I want this but I’m not sure what else I can do to show him I’ve changed and have him accept what I did. Will be answering responses and any questions you may have.

Recently I have decided after a 6 year hiatus (focusing on my professional life) to get back into dating. It’s been a bit difficult and overwhelming navigating the territory and I’d appreciate honest thoughts on the following below:

- What is the age range where you think I’d find the most success in today’s dating pool? My preference is typically younger versus older (like mid 20’s versus early 30’s) but I’ve always dated older in the past (1-2 years) so I don’t have a reference point on what’s acceptable and works in a serious relationship with larger age gaps.

- Where are the best places for me to focus my efforts in meeting and connecting with single women? I’d describe myself as a more reserved academic type of personality.

- Is online dating worth my time as an option? If so which apps or services?

Additional information: I’m from the NE USA moving to the south, I am fairly introverted but can be conversational or outspoken when I feel comfortable and I’m looking for long term dating/ultimate marriage as my goal. Moderately conservative background and average in terms of being health conscious.

We planned it for weeks and I was super excited to meet. We’d been speaking for 6 months at this point due to the pandemic, and hadn’t met properly yet as travel was of course banned.

I decided to go meet her, flew from uk to see her, we had a nice night at her place and cooked dinner together. It was sad leaving after, and after getting home she said she couldn’t possibly do long distance, even tho I could be there every week. (Ryanair flights are £7).

It was a Sunday and we decided to make spontaneous plans to meet up at a climbing gym and my first impressions of her were great. She immediately went in for the hug, she carried herself very well and it seemed already it was like we had known each other for years. She was so bubbly and overall just seemed excited to be there as was I. 

She apparently had worked at a climbing gym before and was much more experienced than I was and showed me a few tricks. She was very athletic and had a great body haha. 

After about two hours climbing and chatting we decided to grab some food and drinks at this local bar and that’s when the stars aligned. We really had a chance to talk about what we’re both passionate about,  looking for and past experiences. She really opened up to me and I could tell she was comfortable so I made my way over to her side of the booth and continued talking for another 10 minutes or so. 

The bar was playing amazing music all night, but then they started playing this awesome hip hop song about love and right then in there I went in for the kiss! I could tell she was waiting for it all night because she latched onto me so fast and we grabbed each other tightly and it seemed to last forever. It was like something magical out of a movie and right then and there I felt a connection I’ve never felt before on dates. 

I paid for the bill, walked her to her car and we kissed one more time before saying our goodbyes until next time. 

This could just be the hopeless romantic in me talking, but even though I know this was just one date, I can honestly say I could see this going someone real!

I texted him, then he asked on Sunday afternoon if I was free Tuesday. It is now Monday afternoon and I have been in class as well as maybe coming down with something so I took a nap for a few hours.

It's been 24 hours since his text and I was just thinking about how to say ""How about this weekend instead"" when he hits me with ""I'll take that as a no lol""

Is it bad if that immediately made me go ""Ugh...""? We're in grad school, we're busy. I get that he waited a day, but idk the tone rubs me weird. Am I being too judgmental?

We were talking and we found out that we actually live in the same apartment building and go to the same college, and then when we walked home together that night she gave me her number. Since then, whenever our shifts coincide, we try to walk to and from work with each other, and I find myself always looking forward to walking with her. We always end up chit chatting, talking about the shift at work, our classes, our interests, and the like.

On days our shifts haven’t coincided, she texted me that she missed me at work. She wants to know when I am and not in at work, and each time we walk home together she reaches out to give me a hug. There was one week or so where I wasn’t in at all when she was and the next time she saw me at work she ran over to give me a hug in front of everyone. I’ve never seen anyone light up upon seeing me the way she has, it’s the first time I’ve seen anyone look at me like that. Now she’s been embracing me each time we greet each other and whenever we say goodbye to one another. When we walk together, we always laugh at each other’s jokes, and she has this really sweet and inviting presence that I just find myself smiling often around. I also find myself looking forward to running into her and embracing her. 

Here’s where I’m conflicted. Apparently she has a boyfriend though. Her Instagram is filled with multiple pictures of them as a couple, most recently being a post on Valentine’s Day of this year. Due to this, I’m inclined to believe she’s just being overly friendly and wants to be friends, but at the same time, she’s never mentioned her boyfriend in conversation with me, and the way she gets all excited when she sees me gives me mixed signals. 

She mentioned having nobody to go to a concert with and then we started making plans to go to one, and she seemed really excited, hearting and laughing at my messages while we were texting about getting the tickets to go. Unfortunately the artist tested positive for Covid and the shows got canceled, I was really looking forward to a night out with her. I really wanna get to know her some more and still do something with her, but I’m unsure on how to proceed. Does she like me? If so, do I or do I not proceed? Or is she just being overly friendly? Do I save myself the trouble and heartache, or go for her? For someone as sweet as her, she may be worth it. What do I do?

Update: We grabbed coffee before work our last shift and ended up walking and talking past our work because we got there early. We’re definitely teasing each other a little more and enjoying each other’s company. Still not sure what to do, would appreciate any input I can get.

We've said we're exclusive and I know that he likes me a lot. He's been really keen since the first day we met and he's asked me to come with him to visit his hometown next month and meet his parents essentially. I've also met all his friends and he wants to hang out pretty much every day. 

But, when we first met we would literally text back and forth so much all day. Before we actually met in person, we would stay up until 4am texting each other back and forth quite quickly. And in the morning we would text back and forth really fast as well. But, now he doesn't respond as quickly. He now often takes anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour to respond.

Obviously, this is pretty much normal. But it just bums me out a bit. I just got out of a 2 1/2 year relationship that ended up a relatively bad note. We sort of grew to be that classic couple that you dread to end up being like, not having sex ever, barely texting, not showing much love. Now I feel like I just worry about this happening again. 

I know that in a relationship, you're not gonna text each other constantly. But, we haven't even known each other 2 months yet and I feel like the honeymoon phase is starting to wear off which makes me sad. We have literally seen each other almost every day the past 2 months so I feel like it has rushed our relationship a bit. I don't know. I still text him back quickly so it just makes me sad that he doesn't seem to have that sense of urgency to text me anymore like he used to.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1162562,public,self,Guy I'm seeing doesn't text as often anymore,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/t3r4v9/guy_im_seeing_doesnt_text_as_often_anymore/,no_ads,0,,,
