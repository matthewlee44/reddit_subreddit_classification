As I'm standing there, a guy approached me and asked was I working for the night. I'm not a dancer, so I was confused at what he was asking. I told him that I was just trying to find the person that invited me. He then asked if I'm interested in hanging out... I said idk. He said I was very beautiful and he world like to get to know me. We chat a little more and then he again says, we should hang out. He said how about 500 to get out of there with him and we have fun. I agreed and we left. He actually wasn't a creep,  and held my hand crossing the street. I thought that was a very sweet gesture and made me feel relaxed. He even opened the door for me and brought me something to drink from the convenience store. 

He then stopped by a friend's house to pick up what I discovered were E pills and coke. But he trusted me to go with him and actually introduce me to his friend. I thought that was very cool of him. Once we got to his apartment, he asked if I would do some E and coke with him and trust him, so I agreed. He said i would be okay and he would even do it first. I felt absolutely AMAZING.  It was the best feeling ever! We talked so much and He started sharing personal stories with me (even things he probably shouldn't have shared like his horrible dating past) but he said he wanted to change and stop sleeping around and cheating. I told him he had some toxic ways but I believe he can change and he agreed.  His eyes looked sad and I felt that he was being genuine and I started to feel something for him. We did have a ton of sex and I even rimmed him,  which I never really do,  but I really enjoyed pleasing him. I would only do that if i really felt something for a person. Even when it started to hurt during sex he would stop and not force me. When I was going to leave,  he asked me to please stay. He said he likes spending time with me and I'm a great girl, the sweetest girl. I really felt like he was being honest and I believed him. So I stayed and we even cuddled. 

He started to act weird at one point and he kept showing me videos of him having sex with other girls and then bringing up threesomes. He saw he was making me uncomfortable so he asked am I okay, which I thought was really sweet. I told him I just wanted to spend time with him,  he said okay and stopped pressuring me about the threesomes. He said he had really bad anxiety and i really felt for him, so i have him a nice massage and helped him relax. I just wanted to soothe him and he let me. I also told him he was making me uncomfortable about the issues with his ex girlfriend leaving shit on his car when she found out he had a girl over his place, he said he understood and apologized. He said he only brought it up to me because they just broke up a day ago and he felt bad. I felt really bad for him too. He seemed to notice these little things and care about my feelings.  He said he just wanted to get dinner with me,  so we went out and ate together. I felt so happy to be with him, I know I was high but like I felt so happy when he would my hand and kiss me. I honestly never felt happier and I felt like the feelings were genuine. He was nice to me and would even rub my back and kiss my forehead. I felt like I was falling head over heels for him. We eventually fell asleep but when we woke up he was a little stand off ish and it made me feel a little awkward and sad. I eventually left but he did end up checking on me and asked if I got home safe. We talked and he mentioned getting dinner again sometime. I didn't think he would want to see me again, but when he asked about this, I felt that maybe he liked me too or he wouldn't want to see me again. 

So my question is should I see him again and try to get to know him in a normal setting or is he not a good potential date and I just felt something for him because of being high? I really do think he is willing to change. He's 40 now and says he's looking to eventually settle down and start a family. I just don't know how genuine it is if he was willing to pay just to spend time with me and I'm not sure if that's a great way to start a relationship. 

Sidenote: I haven't dated someone in sometime now,  I usually spend a lot of time to myself. I would like to get out my shell and date again, I could be quite introverted when people approach me. I would just like to give someone nice a try. 

Update: I paid for dinner with the money he gave me and then left the rest with him when I left his house. Also, I never took E before, so I wasn't sure if it was JUST a high or if some of those feelings are actually real.

The breakup was a big surprise to me as there was no warning signs whatsoever other than a little bickering back and forth. 

The last few days, we’ve been in contact to sort out finances, apartment deposit etc and obviously we had a couple of chats. My now ex has said that he didn’t think I’d move out of our apartment so quickly (I moved out the next day after we broke up), he doesn’t know if he wants to be a couple anymore but he still loves me, he’s feeling incredibly lonely etc. 

When we broke up he said he doesn’t know if he sees a future with me, he sees me more as a friend than partner and he doesn’t know if he wants to be a couple anymore. So of course, I took this that he was breaking up with me. 
Id like to add that my ex is going through a really rough time at the minute (recent passing of close family member, his family are fighting, starting a masters in top of a full time job) so he’s been really down, which I’ve been by his side to support him and be a shoulder to cry on all throughout. 

He’s seeking help himself but keeps telling me that he needs time to figure things out which I am very supportive of. The one thing that has been playing on my mind throughout all of this is, are these the actions of someone who truly loves me? When you’re going through tough times, wouldn’t you lean on your partner rather than push them away? Would you keep telling them you need more time to figure out if you want a relationship?

I text her that night and she seemed really eager saying she was waiting for my text etc and said she'd let me know when she's free to meet here. A couple of weeks go by and I hear nothing so I call, she's once again really enthusiastic and we meet, have a great first date full of laughs and meaningful insight, she said she'd love to see me again and would let me know when she's free from her cabin crew shifts... history repeated itself and I'm in the second phase of hearing nothing atm. 

It's given me time to reflect though and some things she said just don't seem right in retrospect. Like labeling all men in my new country misogynistic and all people as rude, she also explains that she's very judgmental of people that stay in low paying jobs their entire lives without any hint of mindfulness that this may seem prejudice. Most of my family live here as natives and she knows I came to reconnect with them as well as to learn the culture and language, so to put so much toxicity in my head on the first date was kind of a red flag for me.

Upon reflection I'm starting to question more and more (I'm basically spiraling), is the age gap a factor? She doesn't speak very good English so am I just a language immersion tool? Does she do this often despite stating otherwise? Does she expect me to put in all the work and chase her or is she just not interested despite stating very clearly otherwise? She doesn't seem great at her core if I'm totally honest but she's drop-dead stunning and I want to give it a fair and honest try without jumping to conclusions.

AITA for calling out a date for ghosting me in the middle of their new date

I (25M) matched on tinder with her (20F) and talked to the point I added her on Snapchat. We talked for a while and is into fitness, same as me. The conversation turned to the fact that my regular gym closes at 11, and due to my work and class schedule I can’t go to that gym.

At 7:00 she invites me to join her for a workout by sneaking me into her gym since the staff leaves and patrons can let themselves in, only thing is her gym is 20 miles from where I live. I agree because it’s a straight shot to my job, so my timeframe is at 10:00 I drive 50 minutes to her gym, workout for an hour and a half until 12, then head to work on a 30 minute drive and arrive at work at 1:00. 

When I’m 10 minutes from arriving, she tells me the gym staff are still there and apologizes. Already having invested almost an hour getting there, I just buy a $25 membership and let myself in since it’s all automated and find there’s no staff. 

Her pics were a little outdated on tinder so I didn’t notice her during my workout since her hairstyle changed (my eyesight is garbage,but I was wearing glasses so no excuse) and once I was done with my workout, she send me a Snapchat post workout and it dawns on me that she was that girl. I ask to reschedule, and she agrees, and tell her I’ll be there the next night, and she replies she won’t be there.

Turns out she is there when I go, and she’s with some guy. Once I saw that, I completely wrote her off, but I felt pissed because the night prior she wasted my time lying about the staff after I made that trip. The fact that she was with some guy didn’t mean anything to me because we’re essentially strangers, and she doesn’t owe me anything, but what she did made it clear she didn’t respect me or my time enough to just cancel 

So I walk up to them, call her name, and tell her that wasting my time was scummy, but thanked her, since I appreciate the gym recommendation and continue my workout. I also plan to keep going there and stew in the awkwardness which she brought into her hometown’s gym, at least until mine becomes 24 hour again",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1154874,public,self,Date ghosts after I drove 50 minutes to her,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sd5gd0/date_ghosts_after_i_drove_50_minutes_to_her/,no_ads,0.0,dating,,,

Unfortunately, this is where my most recent ex (35F, we'll call her L) is living. L and I met online and were together for a few months before she decided that she couldn't commit and broke up with me. I met M about two months after that, and we started dating. She knows about my experience with L and has been helping me pull the glass out of my feet from that experience. There's no lingering feeling of sexual or romantic feelings for me, but plenty of negative feelings.

I reached out to L about if she was still living there, because that would be a major factor. In the end, M and I decided on not moving to the townhouses for different reasons, but L still responded by saying she saw M and I together and is happy for us and is currently in a committed relationship/no hard feelings aside from a ""lack of grace.""

So I’ve (f27) been in an ambiguous phase with this guy (m24). We work together and we like each other, although nothing serious has happened. 

People on Reddit have been saying this guy is weird. I posted here couple times.

He took a photo of me in the first few weeks of me joining. I happened to see because the phone camera suddenly turned to aim at me. 

He made contact with me by touching my thigh with his thigh and holding the contact for a bit. 

My colleague helped me out by trying to find out more about him. Apparently, boss said that this guy cannot be a good match for me who is looking for something serious because he deliberately made his ex cry one time and then tried to coax her the next day. 

Am I dealing with a narcissist? Should I just drop this and leave?

I’m a bit sad because we did have some good moments and he can be sweet at times. Although I’m not sure if he’s just faking it. 

My heart is reluctant to drop this even though logically I know I should. 

Another thing is that when I met him four months ago, I fell in love with him who was this nerdy shy helpful and quiet guy who has now morphed into this good looking competitive aggressive sales person. Idk how to feel about this too. 

Just looking to the Reddit community to give me advice. 

Now he’s stuck in his country due to worsening covid situation and flight cancelled for a month. I feel worse.

Last weekend was the ""three month since we met"" mark. I believe this is a classic situationship where we are exclusive, hang out 2-3 days a week, go on dates, hold hands and kiss inside and outside, hang with his friends who I've met like 20 of. Both of us have high sex drives so the entire relationship is so fun, lusty, romantic. It is also my first relationship, I've never dated in high school or college because I grew up pretty religious and career focused, therefore I am very excited by the new experiences. I am not looking to get married until 8-10 years from now, but just have a first relationship to do a bunch of fun things with one person, make memories, and have experiences I couldn't during my teen years.

I wanted to keep this going for the next few months at least, so labels seemed obvious to me? Like... fifth graders who hold hands call each other bf/gf.... why can't we? I've tried to dtr 3 to 4 times and it is met with reluctance and excuses every time. His perspective is that we have a great thing going and we are in an exclusive relationship, just not ""boyfriend and girlfriend"". And all his friends consider us a couple, that he cares a lot for me but doesn't want expectations or burden of an ""official"" relationship. Don't really know what those are since I've never dated. When I asked ""Don't you wanna keep a good thing going?"" he just seemed sad and defeated, like he was helpless and said its my decision if I stay or give up on him, since its not fair to me to be ""patient"". 

I just thought calling each other boyfriend and girlfriend was just a matter of convenience because he already gives me everything I expect and don't understand what burdens he is talking about. He did explain he had an ex who tried to control his drinking, smoking, who he was friends with, his schedule, using the girlfriend card. He also says he doesn't want to disappoint me or create expectations, and just keep things how they are - casual and happy. Are these excuses/immature of him, or a valid relationship style?  

Most of my friends are like ""you deserve better"" and ""labels are the bare minimum"" but I don't know if it's rose colored glasses and wanting to keep having fun since it's the first connection I've had... why should we break up when we literally both like each other?

TLDR: my guy won't call me his girlfriend. his friends do, my friends do. I don't really understand why we can't just label, since he treats me well... Should I just keep hanging out or cut him off?

27F, you always hear things like no men are good etc. I’m sure men say similar things about women.

Before I met my current partner I went on all sorts of dates that were meticulously planned at expensive restaurants or well thought out day trips to the mountains...

While I don't tend to think its the norm, I do think there is a demographic of people who enjoy the excitement of new interactions and then become swiftly disillusioned or frightened by the effort required to maintain and develop a real connection. Sometimes this is lovebombing, other times its just people being open minded and desiring to meet new people without any real commitment in mind.

One guy who lived an hour away from me took me snowshoeing, we hiked up into a beautiful valley (yes my friends knew my location), and spent a blue bird day sitting in snowdrifts talking endlessly about our experiences with life and travel, then he took me for afternoon tea at a tiny mountain lodge and drove me back to my car. I didn't really hear much from him afterwards, but I was ok with that. While he made all the necessary efforts and made an excellent first impression and didn't pressure me for intimacy, or even a kiss... it was clear that the good experience wasn't enough for him to commit to what I wanted. He was wonderful, but he wasn't for me. Not every date has to end with one person being the bad guy.

But of course, on other occasions I have had an incredible time with dates, only to realize that their insistence on paying for the lavish dinner or the efforts they made were a bartering tool for sex or a way to pressure you into a timeline of their choosing. I've had men cook me dinner, and take me to shows and I learned that having a great time with someone doesn't really mean too much if you don't want the same things. 

Don't take it personally when you have a great time and they suddenly drop off. The real work of relationships is not how exceptional the first date, or even the second date was... it hinges on the mutuality of the interaction more than anything and whether there is not only consistency, but open and direct honesty about taking those steps forward together.

so I (W21) just got out of my first relationship after 6 years. we lived together and we were the first big love to each other. I broke things off because I felt I couldn‘t grow any further in this relationship and that I still want to experience life since I‘m in my early 20s and very outgoing. we just didn‘t want the same things anymore. 

On a job I met this guy (M30) who is the opposite of my ex. outgoing, knows what he wants, has ambitions and males me laugh a lot. He is all I didn‘t have the past 6 years. We have a very special bond and the chemistry is great. during the week long job we had the best sex and conversations all night. since our ways split (he lives in another country an hour flight away from me) we talked over the phone or facetime every day for two weeks and I am going to visit him next week. 

we both felt that we appreciate the love and affection we give and show eachother without having strong feelings. but now I dont know what I really feel since I never dated and got to do what teenagers do. 

He is leaving for LA for 3 month. He wants to stay in touch during his trip and defenitly wants to see me after. but he also wants to go on dates and meet girls during his stay in LA. We never really talked about how we feel about eachother and what we expect from this situationship (I dont know if this is friends with benefits or else). I want him to feel free to do whatever he wants but I dont know if I want to stay in touch when he is affectionate with other women. and I dont want to be in another relationship right away after my breakup. but I really really like him. I have never been treated with this much interest in me. and the sex is all I could wish for. I feel like he is my soulmate. 

now I wanna be able to talk with him about my feelings. will I lose him when I tell him that I might not wanna be in touch if he is fucking around in LA?

Me and this guy friend met on a dating app. We’ve known each other for 7-8 months or so. Went on three dates. We made out but never slept together. 

I did tell him about my feelings after the 3rd date but he said even though he likes me and had a great time, I live too far away (an hour) and our work schedules are too different. (At the time I worked nights, I work days now so our schedules are similar). 

We tried to hang out in between then and now but something has always gotten in the way. 

Well this past week we finally hung out for the first time in 3-4 months. We went to his favorite restaurant. I was hoping to finally have some clarity on the situation because I’ve been struggling to bury my feelings for a while. I thought seeing him would either confirm or deny. But I’m more confused than ever. 

I feel like I feel like as long as we’re still talking, I’m just gonna want more or hope he comes around. 

He seems attracted to me but I don’t think he wants a relationship right now. He seems very emotionally unavailable. And I’m just not into that. He does compliment me a lot. Like if I post a selfie on my Snapchat story he’ll respond telling me I look beautiful or something like that. But we recently we were talking about the whole dating scene and he was asking if I was dating right now. He said “I thought you’d given up on dating right now?” I said “no I haven’t given up, but it just takes up so much mental energy so it hasn’t been my focus and dating kind of drains me. He said he hasn’t even looked. I followed up with “it’s draining but it can be fun though.” And he proceeded to ask “was I fun?” And I told him I had a lot of fun with him. To which I asked him if I was fun. And he said “oh you were” 

It kind of came off to me like he was fishing for info. But then when I saw him the next day, I really didn’t get any signals that he was into me like that. So I figured that was that. 

I just don’t know if this friendship is working out for me. I like him as a person and I don’t want to let go of the friendship I have with him because regardless of the feelings, I do think we have a good friendship. But I’m not sure if I can be friends with him and I think it’s not good for me.

after that i kinda felt like maybe he wasnt interested and i was going to back off. so i didnt see him all weekend. monday i decided to stay low so i wore a hat and my hood up lol i passed him at the dummbell rack and he smiled really big and said hi, so i said hello! back and carried on. i felt like he was watching me in the mirror.

Last weekend we went out with friends and everyone was getting tired and wanted to go home except for us, so we stayed at the bar and played darts and just socialized with the people around us. Eventually we were too drunk and needed to go home, but he INSISTED on walking me, and then when I said it’s ok I’ll Uber so he doesn’t have to (he lives by the bar) he said he would still Uber with me to make sure I made it home safe.

I live next to a Taco Bell and I realized he probably just wanted Taco Bell (he’s obsessed) but he still insisted on walking me the rest of the way to my door. I didn’t invite him up/nothing happened, but I asked him to go to a show with me this week since we realized we both love comedy shows. We’re supposed to go tomorrow night. 

I also remembered that the last time we went out we went to probably 6 different places (it was a day adventure for a friend’s birthday) and he was sitting next to me at every place - I wasn’t intentionally sitting next to him and I feel like the odds of that happening are weird.

He just doesn’t make any effort to talk to me so maybe he’s just a nice guy? He never initiates texts, doesn’t like my social media (but I’m pretty sure he’s on it), etc.

The past 2 weeks, I've gotten more experience with dating than I have in the past 2 decades. It is hard to believe that I just had my first kiss this past weekend, but when I was in middle and high school, I subconsciously had low self-esteem, which made me believe that I wasn't worthy of asking any girl out, despite the fact that I wasn't ugly. Maybe race had something to do with this, but then again it may have been my undiagnosed social anxiety. 

In college (2014-2019), it was a similar story, except that's when I started to pay more attention to the fact that I was perpetually single. I first started posting to Reddit about all of this under the username u/fa9cmy6w34i6y98ctrqc, but I stopped posting with this account. Back then I was still somewhat reserved, but also had low self esteem. I was also at a tech college with an 80-20 male-to-female ratio, yet I lived on campus without a car. 

I transferred to a larger school near home 2 years later. Part of this was for academic reasons, the other part for the lack of dating opportunities. Over the next 3 years, I joined a club and a sports team, which became my primary social outlet and where my friend circle grew from. Yet I was still extroverted, but socially anxious. The thought of losing my virginity, being a virgin and having never kissed a girl grew prominent as the years went by. 

After graduation, I served in a national service program for about 6 months, traveling the country for disaster relief in a program with about 150 people, in the 18-24 age range. Again, I had a secondary goal of progressing with dating in all of this. Nothing came of it. 

The pandemic hit. I went from age 23 to now 25 in this time, living at home with my parents and without social interactions. I tried using dating apps for 2 months, paid $70, and got nowhere. I deleted them to try and get my sanity back. I reinstalled them, had the same problem. In December, I did it again, but this time I used Facebook Dating, which was where I found the girl who I've been talking to and been on 2 dates with since Dec. 24. She lives an hour away. Prior to meeting her, I had only been on 4 dates in my life. I've had 6 now. 

She knows that I'm inexperienced with dating, and to be honest, she's pretty isolated and shy too. Yet she's still been in a relationship or two since maybe 18-20 (she's 24). Which is expected. Still, I find myself having anxiety over our interactions. We text every day, maybe about 8-10 messages. I think things can progress well, but with the lack of privacy I mentioned in the title (we live with our parents), the only intimacy that we can have is likely in my car or a hotel room, two uncomfortable and awkward options. Yet physical intimacy is the skill that I lack. The 2 kisses we had were basic and juvenile, but then again, if I've never kissed how am I supposed to practice?

I hope she isn't losing interest because she senses the lack of experience. I'm not sure where I should turn or how to think.

(28 F) I am not from the US and come from a culture where the man usually pays.

When I dated in the US, the guy would pay on our first date (because I didn't know how to ask them if I could pay and was afraid they'd take it the wrong way). But they did let me pay in the subsequent ones so roughly, we kind of paid the same amount in the end. My dates and myself were not in a very good place financially so I thought it made sense we share the costs.

Those all ended cause they left me for someone else.

I had 3 that varied between 1 year and 6 years. The 6 year one ended when I found out she was secretly dating her best friend for the last year and she just wasn’t gonna tell either of us the other was romantically in the picture. I only found out when I walked in on them FaceTiming and I had to confront her about why her friend was freaking out so much to see me with her. Turns out she told him we weren’t together and was telling me he’s just a friend.

I had one that lasted for a year where she lived an hour away with really toxic parents. So to fix that I signed over my car to her (I had 2 at the time) so that way she could get out of her house more. I was working and studying full time then so I didn’t have time to pick her up constantly when pushing 60-70 hour weeks. Did she ever use it to come see me? Not once. But she did break up with me 3 weeks after signing it over and used it heavily to start a relationship with another guy a couple weeks after that. 

And then I dated this other girl for 2.5 years who fucked my brother, and then threatened to kill herself if I showed that I was upset about it. And then she told all her friends I was making her want to kill herself so they all start texting me to harass me about how dare I make her mental health worse and that she just made a mistake and I was overreacting. Funny thing is she left me cause she found someone else after this (as you can tell, this is a theme)

Honestly I’ve just been burying this stuff or blaming myself cause there is plenty I did wrong in these relationships. But I’ve also been in therapy for several months now and I’ve been encouraged to actually be in touch with how these things made me feel instead of instantly being like “oh I deserved this” like normal.

However, I'm not sure if that's just me being unreasonable or not, so I need some unbiased opinions. I'm going to list (in no specific order) some of the stuff that has been bothering me about the relationship, since I'm not really good with paragraphs:

1. **Very high maintenance.**  
Very dependent and jealous, to sum it up. Refuses to sit anywhere but by my side (won't even sit across the table) anywhere, family events, date night, etc. Will argue with me because she thinks I look at other girls; has gotten upset because I was looking at the dancers in a concert, as well as once going onstage (I'm a DJ) and arguing with me because ""I was flirting with a girl"" (later that night, the girl and her bf hired me).
2. **Stubborn and self centered.**  
It has gotten to the point I got a ticket because she threw tantrums and refused to wear a helmet on my motorcycle; she even got mad when I got upset with her, replaying that, as payback, I wouldn't need to give her a gift (I had promised a few days earlier that she could pick something as a treat). I've fully paid a NYE trip for the both of us, during which she acted like her being there was a favor and that I should be thankful it. She didn't help with a single chore during the trip (I don't mean money, although she could offer a lunch or something for once) and I even had to carry her bags around the airport. Also, did not thank me for the trip.
3. **Treats me like she's my boss.**  
Bosses me around and cries/gets moody around my friends/becomes cold when I refuse. When she sleeps over, wakes me up 2 hours before MY work so I can drive her across town to hers, will play the ""you're my boyfriend and makes more money then me so cut me some slack because ubering everyday is too much"" and cry whenever I refuse. Also does this for me to drive her around and even got to the point of comparing my actions to her dad's, with whom she has a terrible relationship.
4. **A) Acesses my phone without my consent.**  
I've caught her doing this twice, it has surely happen more than that. Since I have nothing to hide, she'll check my Recently Liked on Instagram and get pissed whenever I liked other girls pictures, even if they're my friends. I get pissed at this because it strikes like she is digging to find a reason to start something.  
**B)** Continuing A, she might even have cloned/installed spyware ob my phone, since a lot of her behaviors changed overnight, without me addressing them, after I discussed them with my therapist via Whatsapp.
5. **I feel like she is too attracted to money.**  
I do think she likes me, but I feel like money plays too much of a part in this relationship since I make way more than she does. She is planning a 3-month trip later this year and wants me to drop everything and tag along; however, she has no means to do so since she has barely saved enough for a two way ticket, which makes me think she wants me there partly to financially support her when she inevitably runs out of money.
6. **Emotionally manipulates me.**  
As mentioned, she will cry, victimize herself, anything, whenever we get into fights or things don't go her way so she gets the ""upper hand"". She'll almost always use money and/or her upbringing/relationship with parents as excuses for her behavior. This has made me postpone breaking up several times, since I always end up feeling bad for her whenever we fight.
7. **I don't feel like getting intimate anymore.**  
The ""hormones"" are still there, but whenever we get intimate, it's her starting it. We've recently had a 12 day vacation overseas (the one I mentioned on item 2) and had sex only 3 times. She has also forced sex with me once when I was drunk and was explicitly denying it because I was feeling sick after drinking a bit.
8. **I feel more anxious.**  
I was diagnosed a few years ago with anxiety and depression, I've made some progress the last couple of years and finally got off the drugs last year. Now, however, I'm always anxious about going out (may that be for DJing/working or anything else), about my work and even about bringing her along for family and friends events. I get anxious from looking at the crowd from the stage since I can never know if she is gonna go nuts in the middle of my performance.
9. **I am afraid to break up.**  
All of her actions have pushed me away from a lot of my friends and family, which makes me afraid of breaking up and being alone. I also pity (not sure if this is the right word fot it) her a little since I provided her with some nice trips and gifts which, in my country, is very unlikely for her to find with anyone else or even afford herself. So I feel a bit responsible for her because I showed her to a lifestyle that I can take away at any point. Not sure if this makes sense, but it's what's mostly of me breaking up.

Also, not a native English speaker, so sorry for any mistakes or things left unclear.
