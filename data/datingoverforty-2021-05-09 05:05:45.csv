So she pointed out some glasses that we both ended up liking a lot. As we were checking out different frames and talking, I felt like there was some interest/spark. I didn’t really try to flirt, as I figure most women who are working get annoyed with guys trying to hit on them.

7,n8g6t1,1620573157,Flirting while masked: How do I read signals?? (story time + question),"TLDR: I think someone was flirting with me, but I can’t tell because I’m dating-illiterate and he was wearing a mask. Help! 

So....yesterday (Saturday) morning, I’m queuing in the “come get your kid” line after my daughter’s gymnastics class. 

We still have a few more minutes before the kiddos start streaming out, so I’m just looking around at the usual faces, thinking about lunch. Then I look left and notice a Black man staring at me, from behind his mask, of course. 

For context, there aren’t many “brown” children (or parents) who train there, so naturally, when I see another POC, I am intrigued.  Hell...to be completely honest, as a single woman-of-a-certain-age, if I see a lone (and ringless) man in any setting, I’m intrigued, but that’s a whole ‘nother post. 

So, i meet his gaze and he’s looking at me with such intent that Im thinking we know each other.  Happens often with these masks. He says “Good Morning”. I return the greeting. He’s still staring.

About me: I haven’t been in a relationship or dated in over 5 years. Not all that long, but Ive always been the relationship-type, don’t really know how to “date”, and the current (NYC) dating scene is depressing at best. To boot, I am very much an introverted extrovert. I’m chatty with friends, but detest “small talk”. I can be quite social and engaging; however, I am very anxious around new people. Crowds induce heart palpitations and “the spotlight” makes my stomach do backflips. I am told I’m graceful, but usually feel pretty awkward in my skin. Ugh. Anxiety be damned!! (Work in progress!)

Considering this, dude staring but not speaking almost makes me want to throw up my hands and scream WTF?!?!, but I stay quiet and say (to myself): girl, he’s new and checking out the scene. Probably equally surprised to see another Black face. Chill out! 

I’m not even looking at him, but he’s speaking to me again! He says “how are doing today?”  

Me (again, to my introverted self): WHY is he talking to me? Doesn’t he see me standing here with my arms crossed and looking down scrolling my phone so I don’t have to look up and acknowledge his gaze? Can he not read body language??? (deep sigh from the depths of my soul)

I turn to face him and his eyes brightened and kinda lifted, as if he were smiling.  I reply ”I’m doing very well, thank you! How about you?”  He says “I’m good. Really good”.  Still staring. Still smiling. Not missing a beat. 

(Me taking to me again): wait a damn minute... is this man flirting with me or have my allergy meds rendered me delusional?  Girl just shut up and wait for baby girl to come out and you can eat. 

So the kiddies start coming out and reuniting with their parental units. His daughter comes out before mine. He gathers her, turns to me, pauses, smiles, looks me square in my 4 eyes (I wear glasses) and says “I hope you have a wonderful Mother’s Day.”

Ok so that touched me in a profound way and I have no idea why. Such a small gesture of kindness and I was just about floored. And in that moment, I felt myself soften. And for the first time in our brief exchange, I smiled. 

Then stupid, anxious, self-sabotaging me ALMOST said “I hope your wife or girlfriend does as well”....but my Guardian Cupid firmly smacked me across the face and i came to my good, rational senses and instead thanked him and said “and I hope you have a wonderful weekend as well!” And this time, I did not look away. 

So the question is...was he flirting or am I trippin? I’m a little slow at times, but definitely no dummy, and kind of feel like he could have been, but how would I know?  In our current, masked, society how can you tell that someone is flirting with you when it’s subtle, non verbal, and most of their face is covered by a mask??  I just need some help y’all because I am clueless. 

But one thing is for sure, I’m putting on mascara next Saturday. 😉 

Thanks for your input and good luck to you all in this 40+ dating landscape. This crap is harder than childbirth. 

Lastly, for anyone concerned: the potential flirting did not offend me, as much as it clearly offended my anxiety. ✌️",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/n8g6t1/flirting_while_masked_how_do_i_read_signals_story/

I found an interesting experience of feeling VERY weird even considering offering to pay for a date.

With the man I’m dating now, as well as previous, they both invited and picked very nice dinners. It felt like it would be offensive/disrespectful/ridiculous/a sign I didn’t really like them if I offered to pay or split. 

Instead, I usually offer to have them over and cook for them or maybe order food in (my treat). I pay for my Uber/parking, or might get little thoughtful gifts or offer to get little things like coffee/event tickets. (I’m not stingy or entitled.) And I always make a point to thank them for dinner at the end and again at the end of the date.

Also, with both, we had a great time and ended up at least holding hands/kissing/affection. 

Splitting feels platonic, if not insulting, etc. I would only do this if I don’t intent to see the person again.

- all their profile pictures feature men with ice blue eyes (I’m wondering if there is market research on attraction levels to men with eyes of this color. Too me, they look like serial killer eyes!)

- many of them say they are “god fearing” in their profiles

- they’ll say they’re from the states but invariably say they’re been educated at some foreign university

- they say they like football but then show a soccer ball, which is a dead giveaway that they’re not American

- many of them say they’re doctors or military affiliated

1) Don't be afraid to take a chance. I was just about ready to call it quits on dating.
2) It's ok to let your guard down. When you're not constantly waiting for the other shoe to drop, living in the moment, your best self shines.
3) Communication is key. Talk. Often. Talk about what you need and expect, what you're willing to give. Talk about everything! 
4) Be flexible
5) If you feel it, say it. You owe it to yourself and your partner to be honest. 
6) Time together is a gift. At our age we have so many responsibilities. Don't be afraid to ask for time alone. 
7) Be a good listener. Pay attention. Be attentive.
8) Learn yours and your partners love language. Then learn best how to speak that language. 
9) Don't be in a rush. That which grows slowly endures.

On date #2 I told bf the feelings we had were just hormones and would fade away. Remarkably they haven't. Limirence is still high. I made a decision not to be so guarded and we talk about everything! We are building something. Right now, it's a strong foundation for meeting and growing a relationship with his pre teen son. I know it will be better because WE are on solid ground.

I can feel disgusted and enraged at the thought of having to deal with him, yet I struggle emotionally. I have a history (PTSD, anxious attachment, some relationship experiences), and go to therapy, but can’t get my head around my reaction and feeling dumb and immature about it.

I want to unfriend/block him on Facebook but I’m +40. How immature is that? Shouldn’t I just be able to not look at his profile or not care if he see what I’m up to or what I post? But I do care. You don’t get the same access to me after the breakup as you did before - you chose to have less with me and I want to make sure you lose something you did like.

I haven’t blocked his number or email, but I’ve taken all his contact info out of my phone so that I can’t reach out to him. I should be able to have the willpower to not text, especially when I’m upset, and I know and get why that’s the mature, ‘big of me’, right way to be. But I can’t seem to, so I delete his info. It’s a solution, and I’d usually be of the mindset that as long as it works and doesn’t hurt anyone…but it makes me feel immature and out of control. I’m basically doing anything I can to avoid having a temper tantrum…at age 40…when I should be mature enough to make better choices, have self control, and be okay with communication channels between me and an ex. 

Not sure what I’m looking for. Been a long few months, plus cabin fever and lack of social anything thanks to COVID.

32,n915d9,1620642190,Can we be Friends After a Weird History?,"""D"" (mid 40s M) and I (mid 20s F) met in our grad program last year and went on a few dates before the pandemic set in. When things closed down we got in a routine of hanging out at his house twice a week, fooling around, cooking dinner, and talking for \~6 hours. It was casual, but when we started spending more time together and things seemed on the verge of getting serious, he prompted us to take a ""pause"" and think about what we wanted while I was out of town for a few weeks. 

While still out of town, him and I talked over video. I wanted to date, but he said he wasn't comfortable with it because A) he worried about doing something that might affect his relationship with his kids (14 and 17 at the time, he had a pretty amicable divorce \~10 years ago) and B) he felt that it would bother him down the road when I couldn't relate to his aches and pains of turning 50, 60, etc.

I accepted these reasons even if I didn't agree, and thought that was it, but when I got back into town next week, he invited me over to hang out, and it was clear he still wanted to fool around. Nothing happened, but after one more time of this I told him we couldn't be friends like this, and I was done.

I spent the next few months getting over him, improving my life, and one day he texted randomly, inviting me over to hang out. I was curious and bored, so I went. We fooled around, and I decided I was all for it, as by then I no longer had feelings, and figured a purely physical thing would be mutually beneficial. Well, the following week I texted him to see if he was free for another hookup, and he texted me back ""I think we should refrain from having anymore se\_ual encounters"". I was confused and hurt, but it made it clear there was absolutely nothing for us to have contact over in the future.

We stopped talking again for 6 months, then this year when he heard one of my family members passed away, he reached out to ask how I was doing. Since then we have had 0 se\_ual contact, but we have hung out a handful of times. He has been kind enough to fix my car on two occasions, meet me for coffee to help with schoolwork, and the other day he came by to help me with some painting. He never takes money for any of this or shows any se\_ual interest, but every time we spend 4+ hours talking after the fact talking about all kinds of things: his dreams, my career goals, our mutual hobbies, his kids and how they're becoming adults, etc. The other day before he left, he said something about how much he loved being able to talk like we did. It made me think back to all the talks we have had in the past. Last year I had gone over to his house to drop off a jacket he lent me. I had been in a hurry and never even got out of my car, but he ran outside when I drove up and spent half an hour leaning in my car window talking to me like a teenager. It was pretty funny.

I am wondering whether we are both at a point where we can just be friends. Is this possible after our history? When we were seeing each other he never once raised his voice, spoke unkindly to me, or was bad to me, however I felt so hurt and disrespected by what he did when he called me after months of healing, only to fool around once, and then cut it off the following week. I am much more cautious and guarded with him now, but I still enjoy talking to him so much.

38,n981fv,1620661250,Ex’s. Ugh.,"My fiancé’s ex has no boundaries and I feel like she’s hanging off in the shadows. 

Last spring my fiancé found selfies of her drunk in bars on his 13 year old sons phone. She had been messaging them to him. I found this highly inappropriate and concerning coming from a woman that was a mother figure to him for six years. My fiancé told me he handled it- was direct with her, telling her to not contact him or his son again. Then he blocked her from his and his sons phone. He also had a conversation with his son on his this was inappropriate and he was not to interact with her any more. 

There’s much more history- during their relationship, she would create fake FB profiles and harass women he worked with, and his sons mother. After they ended the relationship, she has sense befriended the sons mother and they are friends. 

Last night I found that she is friends with the son on FB since the fall and she likes every one of his pictures. Even after she was told to have contact with his son. And after the son was talked to as well. 

This does not sit right with me. I’m frustrated with my fiancé too, as I felt he brushed off the incident last spring and he should’ve been more aggressive with her.  I’m worried she will always pop in and create chaos. I would have to deal with her, if she had a child with my fiancé. But they don’t. She has no reason to keep coming around, especially when her interactions have been inappropriate!

39,n98l74,1620662349,"“Good morning, beautiful”.","I guess my question is more so directed to women, but I’m also happy to receive any male perspectives.

What do you think about receiving daily “good morning beautiful” texts from a guy that you’re technically only “having fun” with, as opposed to consensually dating or in a committed relationship with?

What if he sends this text every day, but you barely hear from him the rest of the day? (To be fair, some days you communicate all day long, while on other days, it’s the only time you hear from them).

Do you ever feel like he’s just copying and pasting this message to a slew of women?

Do you think that it’s generic and lazy at best? (Compared to “good morning, &lt;your name&gt;)?

At first, I loved it. Thought it was cute, endearing, complimentary. It made me smile. But now, I kind of feel like it’s just something to say to be able he said something. 

Where I used to smile at it and become excited by it, I am now indifferent to it. Rather than return the greeting, I usually ask a question to encourage dialog (how’d you sleep? How’s your morning so far?). I usually get a response, albeit, only 1 to 3-words. 

I want to (and likely will) say something to him but would love some insights and informed opinions from you all first.

So, I shot her a quick message on Hinge because I could. I complemented her Phillies gear and mentioned that we matched on Bumble as well. Haha...isn't that a knee-slapping hoot? That kind of thing. 

I just checked Bumble a minute ago...she deleted the match and never responded on Hinge.

I pay the bills. I take the trash to the dump. I remodeled my own home and did about half the work myself. 
And I don’t think it’s the best way to live. By the end of the day a nice dinner is a maybe. How are people supposed to do it all well? 
My entire life I’ve wanted to be a stay at home mother but I’ve also had shame about that most of the time. 
Even as a kid I’d beg to stay home and clean to get out of going to school. What can I say, I’m a home maker. 
Is that attractive to any men? I would never ever bring it up I have that much shame around it.
To be clear I don’t want to sit around doing nothing. I’d take care of the kids and animals and garden and house. I’d pay the bills and deal with the trash and groceries and cooking. I love to clean as weird as that sounds. 
I like a nice environment. 
I was also a chef and an acupuncturist for 15 years each. I’m an artist and I’d love to make some art as well. I can fix your back pain, make a great meal, and paint you a mural.

This was my second post in a day so it was rejected which gave me time to think. 

The reality is if I had help with these other things work wouldn’t feel so like just one more thing. I’m guessing so many of us feel this way and it’s really about what works for you. 

In some households both people work in and out of the house and in others it’s one or the other. 

I think I’m better suited for running a household and would love to meet someone who prefers to deal with work. 
I also draw buildings and maps and help people get building permits. I have skills. We’d both be able to relax and focus on what we love is a better way of framing it. I don’t know why I have so much shame around it other than it being about where I grew up. 

Anyway. It would be nice to know if I’m just tripping when I refuse to even mention how much I’d love to be a stay at home mom. Should it be something I’m up front about? Would that scare people off?

Not typical because it’s a pretty big online community. Anyway, we don’t look like an obvious match but we have the same dry sense of humor and I really like his intelligence and quick wit. The last time he started chatting with me directly and by the end of it asked to meet over dessert the next day at 6:30. I had plans. He was like “bummer” and that was it. Then I had to drop off. But I sent him message after the session with “raincheck?” — I’m very proud of myself people, as I’ve never “nudged” a guy about a date before. He replies with another day/time that doesn’t work and I throw in a couple of options that don’t work for his schedule. He was like “Oh well. Guess I’ll see you around online.”  Okay, so much for that. I figured he’s not that interested. A couple days later he sends me another message and we have been communicating by chat for about a week now. I really enjoy how he thinks. But here’s the thing: he won’t share anything personal. At all. I’ve shared where I’m from, that I have a kid, my occupation, even my heritage. I’ve asked, “what do you do?” enough times and in enough different ways to be sure he doesn’t want to answer the question. Red flag?  I contemplated suggesting we give another try to finding a day/ time to meet over dessert, but his withholding is giving me pause. Should I wrap this one up and move on?

Seeing as the AGR sub is mostly 19 year olds seeking affirmation that they are emotionally mature enough to date a 52yo, I am posting this here.

I am 43F dating 61M.  We get along in every way. Except... after what he describes to have been a 30 year long sexless marriage, I am so sexually frustrated due to a lack of it now.

He and I have been together almost 3 years.  There is great chemistry and I honestly enjoy all of the messing around. However, sex never lasts more than a few pumps.

He grew up and was married in a very stringent religion, so I have tried to give him as much time as possible.  I even introduced him to online porn and regularly encourage him to ""enjoy"" himself; hoping that might decrease him ammo.  Yet he will not take matters into his own hands (organized religion sucks!).

He's talked about taking the little blue pill, but he also has AFib and I am not willing to risk his health over sex.  But I am crazy frustrated.

I finally mentioned something a couple days ago and I know it irked him.  I didn't say I wanted to look elsewhere (I don't), but I also made clear my needs.

We still messed around the next day, but haven't spoken about it until tonight. Unfortunately over the phone.

We constantly bust each other's balls and he loves it when finds something that actually gets to me.  But this one is more difficult to take.  

I don't know. I don't exactly have people to talk with this about.  I can't think of anyone who needs to have that kind of info.

During our 2 yrs of dating, he spent a total of 4 nights at my home (he lives 3 miles away, travel time is minimal). I always had to be at his place. I was sleeping over 4-6 nights a week. I never questioned this because I was so into him and enjoyed his company. He gradually tore me down with criticism and fed on my insecurity.

After a yr, in my gut I knew what I was doing was gross, but I needed him. I was lonely and pathetic. His criticisms and controlling behavior backfired on him. I began to work on myself and figure out why I was with a person like him. I was vulnerable and desperate for attention from anyone who would give it to me. It hit me hard.

62,na1tfv,1620752544,Death by 1000 cuts,"So this will probably be a little long winded.  Will do my best to keep it brief.

About 3 years ago, my wife and I separated, after a long period of divorce talk.  Because ours was an international marriage, it necessitated that I move to Europe in order to ensure the kids had both parents.  While I wasn't keen on leaving North America, it was the only realistic option for the kids to have both parents.  My marriage was pretty bad, and I spent a fair bit of time talking to a therapist to root out and deal with my codependency and other cringy behaviours.  

Fast forward, I met a woman in Europe.  We matched on Tinder, and at the time, I was splitting my time between her city and the city in which my kids live (200 miles apart).  We seemed to hit it off.  She was kind, empathetic, and early on I felt comfortable being vulnerable around her, and shared some of my past and present fears.  

I decided to plan our first weekend together out of the city, so I asked her if she'd be interested, to which she enthusiastically said yes.  Due to my co-parenting arrangement, there were some logistical challenges with flying to Italy or somewhere really romantic, and it became clear I'd have to organize something in country.  She was still keen.  I think settled on a city about 200 miles away from her residence, and about 200 miles away from where my kids lived.  I called her, pitched it, and she was keen to go.  I then said, look, the only challenge is that on our return day, i need to pick up my kids around 3pm, so rather than driving you 200 miles back home and then driving a further 200 miles, I'll buy you airfare to fly back home, and ill drive directly to my kids (saving me 200 miles).  THis resulted in an immediate meltdown and a cancellation of all plans, as it ""wasn't a weekend together if i didnt drop her off at home"".  It honestly confused the hell out of me, as up until that point, she'd been so accommodating everything (often times things I didnt even ask for or want), that it seemed like suddenly the Matrix had glitched.

Things continued on quite well, but at a certain point, as my job didn't require me to have any physical location, i decided i would no longer rent two apartments, and instead would maintain a single residence 200km away from her.  We discussed it, and I understood it might be a deal breaker, but she offered her apartment for me to come stay at so that we could continue the relationship.  

In the meantime, she was still super nice, super kind.  She would get me birthday gifts on the monthly anniversary of my birthday--which seemed super sweet...but also a little much.  I tried to gently tell her that all this gift giving wasn't necessary--though it was nice.  Anyway, a month or two later, we are standing in her kitchen, and she's being super nice, and at a certain point, i said to her, ""hey, look, it's awesome that you're so accommodating, but I want to know what YOU want as well that will make you happy"".  To which she responded, ""Nothing, you're perfect, you dont need to change a thing"".   We then discussed that I needed to sign my son up to a sports league, which she fully supported, understanding how important it was for me to ensure my kids didnt get short changed as a result of divorce.  Fast forward a week later, i signed my son up, and unfortunately, this reduced the amount of time i could spend with her by 1 day, from 4-5 days a week to 3-4 days a week, depending on the week).  And once again, meltdown.  First, a few days of silent treatment.  Followed by, ""You're the most selfish person, do you ever think of anyone but yourself?"".  

And from that point on.... It was a slow decent from hero to zero.  She demanded that I support her year long trip to an asian country (for work, cancelled due to COVID), but kept telling me that I wasn't giving her enough by spending 3-4 days a week with her.  Suddenly I was an ""unhappy person, who didnt love himself, who was selfish, who didnt ask her enough questions and wasn't sufficiently interested in her life and wasn't planning enough trips with her (during COVID!)"".

In the end, I tried to break up, but the loneliness of being in a foreign country was too hard, and came crawling back, thinking I'd screwed it all up and the person I met in the first six months would come back if I just fixed things.  Which I'm sure if you've read this far you've realized didn't happen...nor could it, because that person wasn't real.

In the end, I realized all her people pleasing bull$hit was just that...bull$hit.  Her real desire which she confided to me in the end was that I'd move in with her full time (and presumably abandon my kids).  

This is the kind of thing that makes people not want to date anymore... (and yes, I'm sure i have plenty of blame to carry here).  Thanks for reading my rant.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/na1tfv/death_by_1000_cuts/

3. For the bold guys who lead by providing the erotic novel version of the ""Naked Man"" from ""How I Met Your Mother,"" does that really work? Because I just snark and block.

4. I ask how you found me, and you say you read my comments and post and think I am charming and intelligent, but I have stated many times in my comments I am not dating, I am looking for friends, etc and I say that to you. Still, the conversations seem pushy and hinting toward feeling out if I mean that. Does that ploy work?

5. You have an account that is new, has no posts, but you seem really astute at finding me to ask for help as a new Reddit user? Does that really work? 

I am just curious how well this works for dating on here? Any success stories? Any funny stories? How often do the scammers accidentally connect with another scammer to have an 80s sitcom moment?

65,na6opr,1620764528,Feedback wanted,"I’m just curious what the general consensus is on how often people in a relationship see each other on a regular/weekly basis. I know everyone has what works specifically for them but just wondering what is the “norm” per se.  I’m in an exclusive relationship with this guy and we’ve been together for over 2 years.  As of now we only see each other 1-2x a week. Usually one weeknight date for a couple hours and then one weekend day/night for a little longer.  

We don’t live together and only spend overnights together if we take a trip, which is usually 2-3 short trips a year.   He has family living with him at his house so it would be awkward for me to sleep there. And I have 3 teenagers so he is very cautious about staying over too long (long story, I was in a bad living situation in my last relationship which affected my kids quite a bit) and he doesn’t feel comfortable spending the night at this point. (My kids and him do get along great though.) 

We used to see each other almost daily pre Covid but that’s because we worked at the same company so we’d do lunch almost daily and say bye to each other end of day and go out after work a couple times a week.  Now I work somewhere else.  We live about 25-30 min away from each other.  

It’s getting harder on me the more the relationship progresses to be apart so much and I’d like us to see each other more. I also want to respect his level of comfortability without pressuring him. 

*Side note, he also has his own side business that takes up some of his time in addition to his regular job. *

We haven’t always had the best communication because he struggles with it and isn’t used to transparency and being straightforward.  We both have been in bad relationships and had bad parents so there is insecurity and sensitivity that comes into play when bringing things up. I’m more open to talking than he is but he’s getting better overall for the most part.  

My questions are how often is normal for 2 busy adults to see each other and how can I bring this up???",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/na6opr/feedback_wanted/
66,na9acx,1620771245,I don't know what to say to him,"I was seeing a guy casually last year. We agreed it was casual. He was literally working on the Covid vaccine trials for Pfizer and was working crazy hours. I get it.

I felt like after the second time we had sex he was dropping off like he wasn't as interested. He would go four or five days without answering a text. Also it was really weird because he didn't want to have me over to his house and wouldn't say why. And please don't tell me he is married. I know for a fact that he is not. He could have been seeing some one else for sure. 

So he kept saying he was busy and I said it takes ten seconds to text some one that you are busy. I finally just told him I wasn't interested anymore but wanted to stay friendly. We met in a support group (thats how I know he isn't married unless he has been working a long con for 6 years.) That was in November. 

He would send me memes and and I would respond but then I just kind of dropped off. I got a text from him last week and he was asking if I wanted to go out and do some thing and ""have some fun"". I just ignored it. Maybe I'm turning into a horrible person. Then he texted me again on mother's day with all these compliments and wished me a good day. 

We texted a bit then last night he asked if I could come over to his house Friday for dinner and a movie. I'm assuming Netflix and chill. I know this sounds stupid but I don't know what to say. I feel like he is buttering me up to have sex and then he is going to breadcrumb me again. 

My friend suggested that I just tell him I think we want different things or ask him what has changed from last year. I know the trials aren't as bad as they were. He said he isn't as crazy busy as he was in the past. 

If he were just some guy I was never going to see again I think it would be easier to know what to say.  I don't want to jump into a relationship at all and I'm not gaga over him. But I would like to have some honesty. Maybe he has avoidant attachment style. 

I like spending time with him and the sex was good but I really don't want a fwb and that is what it felt like he wanted.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/na9acx/i_dont_know_what_to_say_to_him/

74,nakt59,1620812663,"Been months no real progress, also dating in another country, observations and questions","Two more months in it has not gotten better at all. I think I have still learned a lot but it has not translated into any real success at least here in the States. 

I wrote this [other post a couple months](https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/lh2ak6/first_time_dating_in_20_years_sucks_some/) ago, for some reason I find writing this therapeutic. I was kind of ticked off when I started writing and I feel great now. 

Well, I cannot say anything has improved at all.

I have pretty much resigned to the fact that I need to move from where I live to meet anyone.

All local dating has come from apps, any attempt to strike up a conversation with a woman in person has been **terrible to catastrophic**. There are no single women apparently where I live. 

**Improving profiles just increased noise**

I spent a bunch of time improving my dating profiles. At first these seemed to be working I was getting way more matches and messages.

But now some time has passed I have noticed these do not translate into relationships or sex. 

Where I live there are lots of tourists, they match with me and then just want to chat on the app. They never want to hookup or even just hangout, it is the biggest waste of time.

I have had women match with me and say they just wanted to say I was cute. Great, to be honest if you do not want to date me, I don’t care if you think I am “cute”. I can see why some women find unsolicited compliments annoying.

I had another match say she did not want to meet but then she wanted restaurant recommendations.

I had another out of towner match and want to meet, so I went to the bar to meet her, she stopped texting as soon as I got to the bar so I was just standing around like an idiot. I think I saw her at the bar but could not be sure. The next day she texts again and asks I  want to met again. I was like “so you can stand me up again?”. She got made and unmatched me. 

Another wanted to meet but only if I brought a date for her friend. 

**What standards?**

I cannot seem to lower my standards enough to get many dates.

When I first started dating I thought I would find someone like my late wife, smart beautiful, fit, highly educated and successful ….

My standards now are pretty much if you are not morbidly obese or on hard drugs I guess I will give you a chance.

For the guys out there, who think you are not doing well online because of your looks/weight. I am kind of ripped, I have basically a six pack. I work out with guys in their 20s and run circles around many of them. It has not benefited me at all. 

I don’t have shirtless pics in my profile, maybe I should try it?  Feel like I have nothing to lose.

In past two months I have gotten 3 dates, I guess that is good?

**1.** **No Chemistry**

First one, She pushed to have a date right away, which frankly was super refreshing compared to usual wishy-washy interactions I have. 

Unfortunately I was not attracted to her, which kind of sucked because she seemed actually nice. I have no idea why people would want lead people on, I felt bad even though I did not do anything wrong. I hated that this lady was interested, and I could not reciprocate. 

**2.** **Ms Not Available**

The next one was almost the exact opposite of me in every respect, but she worked in the same field. We had absolutely nothing in common at all. I had zero hope or expectations.

We had a great date, I thought “wow, I think I could see spending a lot of time with this woman”. 

Problem she has two kids , a big job and is only free one night a week, unless there is something to do with work comes up in which case she is not free at all.

She also does not do “casual” relationships.

I do not understand the committed one night a week relationship, what am I supposed to do the other 6 nights a week? I guess I am used to relationships where you spend time together and do things like go on a trips together. 

The whole thing was stressing me out, how could make this work? This lady seemed super interesting.  I honestly was probably thinking about her way too much.

We had another date lined up but something came up. I had a huge opportunity to do something I have always wanted to do. So, I asked to reschedule, she said she could not but she understood.

She has not returned my calls since. She was texting me about daily minutia every day, which sounds annoying, but I sort of liked it. 

**Update:** Since writing this she texted me with no acknowledgement of not responding, seems chilly now. I would try to get her to do a second date but have friends in town on the one day a week she is available. 

I feel like it would be stupid to ditch my friends to just buy her another dinner and get another hug. 

I am starting to question whether a **woman having great job is a positive**? It just means they are busy all the time. I don’t need money from a woman, I need companionship. 

**3.** **Young and Drunk**

The next one was this bartender, I met her on swipe app and gave her my number and did not hear from her again.

Then a week or so later I get a text from her. She says we must meet in person because text does not work, so I say ok.

She is a heavy drinker and 15 year younger than me. 

She proceeds to come up with 100 obstacles to meeting, finally I lose my patience and pretty much say “Meet me right now, I am driving to where you are”

It works, we meet hang out for a few hours seems to go great, she seems really into me. She texts a bunch, we were supposed to meet at this pool by where we live yesterday (she lives right down the street).

She disappears, finally texts me hours after we were supposed to meet and says she is not coming.  Not really any explanation so I guess this is done.

I did not have high hopes for serious relationship, but she was pretty sexy so still not happy with this outcome.

**Update:** Since writing this, this one also came back, made tentative plans and **disappeared again**

So yeah, the whole thing is pretty f-ing depressing, but I did have something go well.

**Dating in other countries**

I went on a trip to Costa Rica to fish with some guys. 

I have dating apps on my phone, just on and I guess pinging wherever I am.

As soon as I landed, I stated getting pings, like dozens of them. I think I had something like 150 matches in the first 24 hours.

Where I live there is very few single people, so I did have the filters wide open. Ages 25-50.  I got matches from all ages, all backgrounds, lots of local women but also a lot of expats from USA or Europe. 

Where I live, I might get a date a month tops, here I had multiple dates a week.

**This is what it is like for some women.**

I have way more understanding now for women on apps, because this is what it’s like for some of them. There are so many people to sort through, and it almost stressful.

Weeding out the ones that I was not interested in, the bots, the escorts/prostitutes etc. was very time consuming. 

A lot don’t speak English and I don’t speak Spanish so that is a deal breaker for some, but only some.

Trying to figure out who I should met etc sort of stressed me out as well.  I actually canceled one date last minute, something I would never do or could do in the States. It felt terrible, honestly.

**Differences between there and the states**

· For one almost no women write anything in their profiles. 

· They tend to push to meet right away, the whole lets text for weeks stuff is dead there. They are not scared at all to give out phone #s or meeting in person.

· I had many texting me repeatedly first, which almost never happens in the states.

· Some send sexy messages and images, without much preamble. Never had this happen in the states.

· They don’t seem to care that much about age. In the States I hang around a lot of young people because of the sports I am into. I have had multiple young women compliment me, feel my muscles, say I am “handsome” or a “Badass”, but they **don’t date or sleep** with me. It was different down there.

I ended up dating a woman I met IRL who worked at the one of restaurants near where I was staying. She was having a birthday party with her friends at the resorts pool. We talked for bit she said she wanted to work on her English and we went from there.

I also dated an expat from Canada, she was from tinder. She was great but time was limited and the local woman I met would show up at my hotel when her shift got out and sort grabbed all my attention.

I got super catfished a couple times which is funny now but very annoying at the time since I was only there for a little while. One I just walked in saw her, just shook my head and walked out.

Frankly after taking care of my wife for three years while she died and then being alone almost another year alone, I really needed this to remind me that there is not something wrong with me.  **Why is dating so terrible in the USA?**

Now instead of debating on where in the United States to move to I am considering just going down to Costa Rica for a couple months. I work remotely, why not? 

I am sure someone will tell me that the foreign women just want money well let me preemptively respond to that

· I don’t care, I have lots of money. If women want to date/sleep with me in hopes of using me for money form a line. I’ll take all I can get.

· Women in the states care a lot about how much money men have as well. “financial security”, “financially stable” etc are just code for “has money”. 

· The expat women I dated probably has more money than me, there were local women with good professions that matched with me as well but were just too far to meet. 

To add to the conversation prostitution is totally legal in Costa, and its everywhere. Do you think that radically changes the dating pool? 

I mean if every toxic guy who just wants sex with nothing else can just buy it cheaply and easily, do they still date? 

If you look at the all the complaints by woman online of being “used” or lied to for sex. If all those guys could just pay, it seems like there would be a lot less of that.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/nakt59/been_months_no_real_progress_also_dating_in/
75,nakywp,1620813342,Reached out to an old flame and now I'm in a tailspin....,"A little back story.  Mary and I were best friends in high school.  We never dated, but mainly because we both always had other things going on.  We went to different colleges and our lives moved on without each other.

When I realized I was going to marry Kelly, I completely cut all communication with Mary.  I knew it wasn't fair to either of them if I continued my friendship with Mary, knowing I had a thing for her for a very long time.

In Jan. 2020, Kelly ended our 20 year relationship, with no prior discussion about martial problems, by having months long affair with my best friend.  Needless to say, 2020 was a rough year for me.

But, I'm back.  I have my legs under me and I'm actually doing really, really well.

So.......I found Mary's one and only tiny social media presence and I messaged her.  I apologized for ending our friendship.  I said straight out that I've always been interested in her as more than a friend.  We haven't spoken in 20 years.  She lives on the other side of the country.  I asked if she would be interested in reconnecting.

It took her 4 days, 4 long, freaking terrible days to respond.

When she finally responded, she was not extremely direct, but it sounds like she might be married and that her marriage is coming apart.  She says she's dealing with a lot and is very stressed out.  She said she knows she won't be able to offer anymore more than friendship for a long time.  She gave me her number and said she hopes we can catch up about the last 20 years.

I can feel the pain and suffering in her response.  If she said she needed a hug, I'd be on the next flight out.

I switched the conversation to text messaging since she gave me her number.  At 5pm, I said I'm excited that we can reconnect as friends.  I took full responsibility for ending the friendship and explained why I did it.  I explained what Kelly had done to me in 2020 and offered to be someone that would listen if she just needs someone to vent to about whatever she is going through.  I said I didn't want to add stress to her life and can go my separate way if that's best for her.

I sent a second message about an hour later, trying to lighten the mode.  Yesterday was a major day for me in my career.  It was a massive win.  So I just wrote her a few sentences about it.  Trying to move the friendship forward.  I have a ton of female friends that I text with nonstop all day long, so I decided to put Mary in that group that I shoot the shit with.  I said I wasn't sure what her schedule is, but I basically don't have office hours, work from home, and would love to hear from her if she wants to talk.

5 hours later, trying to lighten the mode I sent a final message.  Jokingly, I said she didn't need to call as it's super high pressure and that I'd accept a text which is low pressure and what all the kids are doing now a days.

Nothing.  No response.  Just dead silence from her.  I don't know what to do.  I have a million and one questions about what she's been up to.  She friended me on the social media network I found her on, and all her private posts are available to me.  She looks to have been living an amazing life.  There are no posts of a SO, but tons of a super cute little boy she has.  I have a million conversation starters, but I feel like I'm pissing into the wind when she hasn't replied yet.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/nakywp/reached_out_to_an_old_flame_and_now_im_in_a/

I got the feeling he was interested (staring at me, and one time while staring at me walking into a wall, giggling, trying to hug and touch me in a nonsexual way, etc). I kept waiting for him to make a move but he's so incredibly shy and so am I so we were friends. He would talk often to me, opening up about his life and me to him. We had the most compatibility of any guy I ever met, including the same interests. He had a lot of personal issues he was dealing with like his mom was sick and running a store so for a while, he wouldn't be a good boyfriend and I backed away at times. 

Eventually, he moved 4 hours away and we lost touch for a few months (he moved right before Covid) but have been talking. At times our conversations have been flirty (at least in my mind) and enjoyable. He mentioned me moving to where he lives and how lonely he is (because of not being with me or just in general, not sure). Tonight I revealed that I've always had a crush on him but was afraid to tell him. He works a lot (he's trying to recover finances after the loss of his store) so I haven't heard yet but sure I will. I felt awkward telling him but figure if he doesn't like me or want a relationship I know. 

Meanwhile, around the time I started chatting with him I reinstated my OkCupid profile. I started getting responses but long story short, found out most were seeking hookups only. However, a couple of the guys claim they are seeking serious relationships but my experience with online dating shows me many of them lie. I guess my question is what would you do? I plan on visiting my friend in July, and not sure if I should meet these guys before, or not at all. I'm torn, part of me says to wait and see because my friend is the one I want but on the other hand, us not getting together in the past might mean something too.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/nb9rzk/telling_guy_friend_im_interested_but_still/

90,nbhxar,1620916134,I've scared myself out of dating over fear of STI Am I being irrational or do other people think this too? How do I handle?,"Just to give you the gist of my situation. I'm in my early forties just out of a 20 year relationship. I haven't had sex with anyone in 20 years. I've been single I've played around a little bit ( making out, oral) but that's it since no relationship has gotten past that point ( for other reasons) 

 I watched a YouTube video about herpes and have scared myself to death because a condom doesn't necessarily protect you from herpes ( and I love oral sex) and most STD tests don't cover herpes since that has to be asked for separately. When I read that 25% of women have hsv 2 and 20% of men do and then 80% of everyone has hsv one . So in my travels of life I might already have it or either and probably so do you. 

Is it reasonable to request all of these tests from a future sex partner? And has anybody had any good success with that because it's hard enough to find a person I even like let alone somebody that will go along with all this.  Every thinking about this for 2 days straight and I have a constant headache and have just given up on finding any love or fun sex for the rest of my life. I figure people in our age group probably have been exposed.

94,nbs5e9,1620941980,How will you ask the other person about their Covid vaccination status??,"So the oddest thing I have said/asked to someone lately is ""I am fully vaccinated, do you mind if I sit closer to you?""  This has been in response to having conversations in public places, but far apart (social distancing and all) from one another.  I personally don't like to talk across a room, so I will say something all these lines and usually the person will respond they have been vaccinated too and I move next to them to chat.

Now that the CDC has stated that fully vaccinated individuals won't have to wear masks (in most places - how this is going to work is for another conversation), lots of states have relaxed/done away with restrictions, and the US is nearing a point where (for the most part) if an adult wanted to be vaccinated, they would be in the process or fully vaccinated.

I personally am not interested in meeting up with a potential date if they aren't vaccinated.  No offense to them, it is their choice, just like being vaccinated was my choice - I see this issue as a non-starter for a ""relationship.""  

So, my question to you all is: how are you going to ask?  Will you ask for proof?

95,nbtccq,1620945254,I have an online crush and not sure what to do,"Half of me wants to say how awesome it is that I met this man, but at the same time I know he’s not interested in me and we are not compatible age wise or life wise

Things I usually avoid:
* recently heartbroken men
* young men (he’s almost a decade younger than men)

We’ve never seen each other in person or on video but we’ve talked a bit and have a mutual online community.  

The kicker is that he gave me his password to Reddit.  And I’ve seen a bunch of his posts and comments.  I asked if I could read his personal messages, too and he laughingly said no and said it wasn’t anything anyway.  But I got curious and read a couple conversations because I kept seeing so many matches.  I’ve gotten to see so much of him and I’ve learned so much from him but I know he’s one of those guys that could probably handle like 20 of me and needs someone much better than me.  Like, I have no goals in life and he’s got many and a young kid he adores.  He has so much love in his life.

What do I do?  I really value his friendship and learn so much from him and he talks to me and makes me feel safe about all sorts of life situations.

I also don’t want to meet him because he’s super hot and I’m not.  I feel like I’m only getting to learn so much cuz he has this imagination of who I am.

How can I keep engaging with him but not feel so much disconnection?  I’m so happy how he treats me when I’m just an online person, but have no one to share this good news with either.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/nbtccq/i_have_an_online_crush_and_not_sure_what_to_do/

97,nbuwie,1620949401,Short guy dating issues,"My bf’s best friend is 5’2”. He’s a really nice guy. Smart, funny, kind. He is 50 years old and has a horrible dating history. He’s definitely sensitive about his height. He does OLD and the women he meets seem to either A. have no interest after the first date, or B. string him along and treat him like crap. A lot of it is his approach. He doesn’t take hints (or doesn’t want to) and keeps coming back for more, even after it’s clear the women aren’t interested. All this has made him very depressed. There was a time he wanted a family. I think he’s beyond that at this point and would just settle for a healthy relationship. 
He reaches out to my bf a lot for advice, but he’s at a loss at this point. We’re not sure how to help him. Any thoughts?",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/nbuwie/short_guy_dating_issues/
