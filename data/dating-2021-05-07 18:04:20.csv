1,n7bvbp,1620429623,I don’t get it,"I’ve been casually dating this guy for 6ish months. For the last couple months we’ve had loose plans to go on a weekend trip together. 

On Wednesday he told me he got confirmation from work for his dates for time off (he’s taking a few weeks) I replied a few minutes later saying those dates worked well for me and we can do the trip toward the middle/end of those dates if he’d like. He didn’t reply. But a few hours later he opened a snap I sent earlier in the day. 

I gave it a couple days and then finally asked him a direct question about an hour ago asking what’s the plan with a smiley emoji. 

I am not sure what’s going on. This is a trip he wanted and I feel like he wouldn’t give me the dates and then just immediately not want to go. I will also say he’s not ever been the best at texting.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n7bvbp/i_dont_get_it/

5,n7c71t,1620430598,"Small vent from my last dating experience, aka please don't be me","This one is a bit of a doozy on my end, I will be the first one to acknowledge that.

So I (23F) was seeing this guy (23M) for about a 3-4 weeks. I really really should have broken things off sooner, like after date 2 or 3 because I realized that I didn't really enjoy spending time with him. One big mistake on my end is that I realized I wasn't super attracted to him. After getting to know his personality better, the attraction got worse it did not improve. Also, I don't think our sense of humor or boundaries were on the same level, here are some minor examples that kind of built up over time:

* Went over to his parent's house, he played the show ""big mouth"" on full volume when I suggested we watch something else (truly, there are a select few shows I can't stand and I'm not even that picky but I can't do creepy cartoon humor kind of shows they make me extremely uncomfortable nevermind that this one is just about sexual stuff). I did not understand how he wasn't uncomfortable doing this with his parents and sister home.
* I felt like I was being put on a pedastal all the time, and it made me extremely uncomfortable. He would text me all the time and honestly it was a little too much, I communicated to him my texting habits and that I don't expect to be talking every second of every day. This didn't change on his end.
* He would say things like ""you're so tiny"" and ""wow look how short you are it's so cute"", not exactly the compliments I am looking for (and again I'm not that picky and not looking for compliments all the time or that frequenly) and honestly it made me really uncomfortable. He also would make a point of lifting me up without asking me and I would tell him to put me down but he would continue to lift me up/hug me because he said it was ""cute"" and ""funny"".
* He wanted to spend his birthday at my house after only talking to each other for a week. I told him you really should go and spend it with your family, I already had plans with my family weeks in advance for that night. Eventually he convinced me that I should have him over for his birthday (mistake on my end) it was just too much too soon on his end. Just too too much interest after talking once or twice. Personally even if I really liked someone after dating for a week I wouldn't make a point to spend my birthday together, again I feel like our boundaries and expectations were very different.
* He was too into social media in terms of it effecting us hanging out together. He would be sending ""snaps"" to friends or texting his team every 5 minutes. Also he was obsessed with tik tok and would send me no joke 5 tik toks a hour during the day and say ""look at this it's funny"". Again, very different wavelengths here. I'm not here to say what you should or shouldn't do for fun/sharing jokes but our ideas of fun were not the same here with social media/phone use. 
* I broke it off with him over text after 3 weeks/hanging out 5 or 6 times and that was that.

If I were to give myself any advice: after the 2nd date when I knew I wasn't super into him and getting ""weird"" vibes I should have cut it off then and there. Please don't be me this whole thing was so uncomfortable. I've had better experiences than this in the past so I know what is out there, but I think after covid and going through a lot I made the mistake of wanting to talk to someone just because I was lonely.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n7c71t/small_vent_from_my_last_dating_experience_aka/
6,n7c8f0,1620430717,"I crave having close intimacy with a partner, when you can sleep/cuddle beside them in comfort and feel loved, it's so important","I'm gonna share my thoughts here after coming to a realization that being able to be completely intimate with your partner and be at ease is so important for a relationship to work. I really came to know just last night that I think I really do love, and would totally want to spend the rest of my life with him...  and that's probably because actions speak so much louder than words. I just want to express I guess that when you can 100% trust your person with staying within boundaries, and to top it off know that they've shown to really care for you.. it's really the best feeling and something I think others should strive for... 

Why I'm posting this, I'll share where my thoughts are coming from... My partner (20m) who isn't able to be around very often, was with me (21f) while we were watching road to el dorado on the couch... and it was a jolly time, classics are the best. Well the scene with chel and tulio making out briefly had come up, and I guess that was the turn on for him to want to initiate something. I wasn't really feeling sex though, and we don't see each other often so I'm sure it was a let down... but like he's totally cool with it and ops to bring me strawberries/sweets! Now ***that*** was a turn on to some nsfw stuff. Anyways 

For those getting into a relationship, I'm just putting my 2cents about having that intimacy, especially when you do want to actually cuddle, sleep together, oral, ect ... it does wonders for a relationship I think",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n7c8f0/i_crave_having_close_intimacy_with_a_partner_when/

10,n7cgqe,1620431453,I think I made a mistake,"It's kinda funny how fast thoughts can shift. After my last post and reading some of your comments I realized that everything made sense and it was my mind that fucked me up.

While it was true that I crushed on a girl, after thinking logically for a second and putting myself in her shoes I understood why it was impossible for her to have romantic feelings for me. The points were logic and sound and I totally agreed with it. The reasoning was as plain as daylight to her but boy could I not see it. Cue the fuck up. Due to this discrepancy, I had very different expectations and naturally this led to me putting pressure on our relationship. She decided to go cold on me soon after and here is where I am.

I realize that at that point of time I was having different thoughts and hence different expectation which led to me doing not so reasonable things that caused the relationship to fall apart. I also realized that she is a great person to chat with. This is in a genuine sense and not romantically which made me feel that I've lost a great person to talk to due to my own mistakes.

It's been about a month since she went cold on me and about two weeks ago I sent her a sort of ultimatum wishing her good luck in her life.

20,n7e466,1620436997,Message to the ladies,"I don’t know why I hear this from some women that I have encountered. There’s something a lot of women say and they always use when it comes to dating. They always say, “He doesn’t want to date me because he is intimidated by a strong independent woman.” Ladies this is far from the truth most men are NOT intimidated by your independence or intimidated by you in anyway. To a small amount of men it’s actually attractive, but most don’t care either way because it’s honestly not a huge priority to men. The guy probably didn’t want to talk to you not because of intimidation but selfishness. Some men bail out because a majority of women only think about what someone can do for them and never think about what they can do for someone else or why someone should choose them over any other girl. I sometimes like to ask a woman what can they bring to the table in a relationship. Most of them say the same thing. They are kind and fun. Those are normal traits that a guy could find in a dog or any other woman he comes across. If a man is expected to provide multiple things in a relationship a woman should be able just as much as can provide in different ways it doesn’t have to be the same things men provide. So if a man asks you what can you provide in a relationship really think about who you are as a person and why he really should choose you instead of any other girl.

21,n7e7t2,1620437343,Body language matters,"Well then. It appears that the person that I called out on bad behaviour and threats to myself after telling their ex that they could ""roundhouse"" myself and then ghosting me after I discussed the displeasure of the matter has decided that they are not taking said discussion of their bad behaviour too well.

Went out last night. They appeared in the same area later on during the night and the effort put into body language to show negativity was highly toxic and profound to the fact that it out most people there on the offensive and I had several people come up to ask whether I was okay as it was so noticeable.

People. Please be respectful to the fact that body language is a thing. If you are that volatile in being able to control your own emotional responses then it would be wise to leave said area instead of trying to make the other do as such.

Turning your back, scowling from across the room, avoiding eye contact when they walk pass to stare at a wall, locking your jaw and trying your hardest to pretend that person is not in the vicinity of you is not the best of answers. It's uncomfortable as hell when the other party is just there to enjoy their own time and then has to try to shield themselves from the extreme behaviour.

Not that I minded as much as they thought, if they thought that it would make myself leave. It just made myself very clear on the decision that I dodged a massive bullet due to extreme red flags.

22,n7e9l5,1620437513,An amazing experience turned to confusion.,"So. I (30M) am at the bar last night. It's sex toy bingo night which was hilarious. Enjoying a beer scoping out for cute girls, having a good time. It's about 10 pm. So I get a bit bored. All the girl are leaving. Fuck it tonight is a bust.

So I'm heading out the door. I quit smoking 6 months ago, but I'm a bit depressed. I see a guy at the top of the stairway out of the underground bar. 

 I'm new to the area so I need meet friends too. So fuck it. I ask to bum a smoke and introduce myself. He introduces himself, his friend and his girlfriend. His buddy and I start talking libertarian politics because we're both on the same level and we're bonding over our similar political views.


Then his sister come out of nowhere. As soon as me and her Locked eyes I immediately knew something went boom.


Let the flirtation begin. They invited me to the bar they were heading too, got us shots and bought me a beer. Awesome people.

So. His sister and I immediately hit it off. We're at the bar talking, touching, getting close, it was fucking insane. We ended up walking on the pier, locked as talking about family, relationships and everything you can think of.

Now. This girl hinted all night she wanted to go home with me, but my female roommate does not like women coming to the house unless we talk about it respectfully. So I unfortunately had to play it off. We exchange snapchats and she was acting really down to meet back up tonight. No bullshit. With how the chemistry was going and the tone in her voice she wanted me. She talked about how we need to hangout, go places, hit the dance floor, take car rides, she seemed so real.

So. They all take a cab home and I'm lovedrunk asf. I'm experienced something I've been craving for a while. She tells me she's off at 3 and I need to contact her. I send her a brief text on SC telling her it was great to meet her and her brother and I looked forward to meeting up the next day.


Open my phone in the morning. Left on read. 

Ok it's cool. It was 4 am. No harm no foul.

Fast-forward to 3:30 pm the next day

I text her ""Hey, we still on for tonight""

Text wasn't opened (and still isn't) for 2 hours 


So after to hours I ring her. No answer


So I'm left with no choice but to let it go unless she contacts me, but after how she was as a person I wouldn't expect this. She was literally a smart, amazing human being.

I'm not the type of person to go out to bars and make conversation with random girls. I naturally preferred online dating becasue right off the bat you know some things about the person so you can be more selective compared to walking up to random people.

I've had both tinder and bumble for the last 7 months and have gotten very little matches. All which lead to her no longer messaging me or most recently cancelling a first date without any communication afrer. Its frustrating, I put the effort in to continue the conversation, I put the effort to message back whenever I get the chance compared to other people that play that stupid wait a day between texts game. I l take the effort to look up fancy coffee shops in my area that I never been to becasue I dont like coffee but your bio says you like coffee dates so I put the effort to do something you enjoy. I put in the effort to schedule and make time to meet someone just for it to never happen becasue they cancel...what's the point? 

I just want to go out and get to know someone. I want to get to know someone to eventually form a relationship so I can spend my youth sharing my time with someone. I'm a simple guy I just want the normal things. I want to plan last minute road trips with someone, share all the new songs I learn on guitar with someone, go sit by the water and talk for hours and spin someone around in the headlights of my car with our favorite music playing, binge watch movies all day, so on and so on....

I'm just craving the thought of meeting someone and forming a relationship becasue I value who iam and know what I can offer to someone. Iam a great looking guy, very kind and funny, I just graduated with a bachelors so on and so on but instead I mindlessly swipe all day and every once in a while I get to talk to someone and have hopes just for the convo to die or plans get cancelled and the cycle continues.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n7eaab/why_does_online_dating_have_to_be_so_hard/

26,n7ewcs,1620439729,First Date Mystery,"So I have a strange pattern in my life. I’ve been dating for about the last year now. 24M and I’d say I’ve been fairly lucky with getting dates. Not to be conceited, but I’m attractive both physically and mentally. I’ve always been told I make a good partner. However, this thing keeps happening where I have a near perfect first date, only to be ghosted right after. I’ll explain what happened most recently, but please know identical situations have happened to me repeatedly and I really don’t understand.

So I was talking to this girl over Snapchat for a few weeks. We vibed pretty well together. We began sending flirtatious messages and hit it off. This went on for a bit. One night she messages me and says she wants to meet, that very night. She wanted to come over to my place. Not how I normally do first dates, but with the way the world is I agreed.

She comes over, and since it was the first time we actually met it was very casual at first. We sat on my bed and listened to music while just talking about anything and everything. Things were going great. Eventually we lay down, no contact. We continue talking, then she puts her head on my arm. Now we’re snuggling together and talking about more personal things. She tells me how bad her ex was. Abused her, cheated, used her, never put her first. At this point we’re completely wrapped in each other’s arms. I’m rubbing her back and she then tells me how her ex never cared enough to do things like that.

This continues, then we start making out. Making out leads to rubbing and kissing more than just each other’s mouth. Nothing wild. We had some small amount of foreplay, but nothing beyond that. She let me know she didn’t want to go any further and I respected it. She tells me how I’m the first new guy she’s been with in about five years. I ask her if she’s comfortable and she says yes. I tell her that she’s the priority and my only goal is to make her feel good and be happy while being comfortable. We continue having fun for about 20-30 minutes. She keeps telling me how amazing she feels and how she can’t believe she found a guy like me. She’s just staring at me telling me how beautiful I am. I can tell that she is completely into me. No doubts about it.

It’s now pretty late and we both had to work pretty early. As she’s getting her stuff, she remarks how she’s not that pretty. So (in a respectful way) I grab her and drag her into my bathroom. I have her in my arms and I point at her through the mirror. I tell her how beautiful she is and she needs to see what I see. We make eye contact through the mirror and I know that just swept her off her feet. That leads to making out in the kitchen for probably ten minutes before I walk her to her car. Then we make out for about five minutes before she finally leaves. 

She messages me when she gets home. She also sends a lengthy message about how good I made her feel. She tells me that I “showed her what true love should feel like” and that “she’s never felt more appreciated in her life”.  The next morning I message her to make sure she made it into work okay, she tells me she did.

Six hours later I message her only to find out I’m blocked. No explanation. Nothing but feeling terrible and questioning everything that happened.

This has basically happened three times this year so far. Almost every time I’m told how amazing I am, only to be ghosted either completely or with extreme vagueness as to why.

Honestly it hurts pretty bad. I play it off when I talk to my friends about it, but when I think about it by myself, it really makes me question myself. I would love some feedback, specifically from women, as to what I can maybe do differently. Or if anyone else has had these problems?

29,n7f46v,1620440501,Dating Immigrants,"Disclaimer: I’m not attempting to soapbox or promote an agenda, just reaching out to see if anyone shares my experience.

I (31YO White male) have decided to exclusively date second or (preferably) first-generation immigrants until I’m married.

This obviously doesn’t apply to EVERYONE by any means.

But I feel that, based on my own experience, first-generation American immigrants (especially) have more reasonable expectations of a dating relationship, marriage, and partnership than many of the natural-born Americans I’ve dated.

I don’t exclude myself from this equation. Especially in my twenties, I had unreasonably high expectations of my life, my job, my future, and my relationships with women.

But after a lot of hard interior work, I’ve realized that mistakes and suffering are just as valuable as happiness. I’ve realized how lucky I am to have been born into the circumstances and family I grew up with, to have the opportunities that were available to me.

These realizations were hard-won and don’t come naturally to most Americans. We take what we have for granted and we always want more.

This has also proven true in most of my relationships with American women. I often felt like I was expected to fulfill a punch list of expectations that grew longer every time I completed it. Any sign of being human (expressing anger or sadness, having needs) was met with revulsion. 

I felt like I was expected to be a mindless, need-fulfilling robot, with no needs or demands of my own. Frank, open communication was nonexistent.

Generally speaking, the bar in my relationships with immigrants has been set at a far more reasonable height. Communicate openly, work hard, treat each other reasonably well, and love each other, and you have a happy relationship.

Better still, I find that my OWN attitude improves when see how hard-working and appreciative of this country my girlfriend is. She has no sense of entitlement, and doesn’t EVER complain about work. She inspires me to be a better person instead of complaining about the fact I’m not perfect.

Has anyone else had this experience dating immigrants vs natural-born first-world citizens?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n7f46v/dating_immigrants/
30,n7fayt,1620441168,Funny how things work out,"I’m 33 and have never had a girlfriend. I’ve been clinging on a couple of things as a prophecy of something that I’d be okay. When I was like 16 my cousin asked me if I was gonna end up getting married. I tensed and shrugged. “I hope so.” My cousin looked at me for a while, acting like he was deep in thought. Then he smiled and told me, “It will happen for you.” That blew me away. No one had ever told me anything like that before. Every indicator seemed to say things weren’t looking good. By the end of high school some friends told me lots of pretty girls liked me and tried to give me a confidence boost.

Fast forward to 33. Those were the only positive indicators I ever had. That I might actually have a shot. Literally everything else in my life has been discouraging. No wonder my confidence wasn’t great.

So now I’m about to start a new life in nyc as a doctor. I actually have a lot of cool hobbies now and I easily make friends regardless of gender. I don’t see me ever being capable of cheating on anyone or anything like that. I think I would be good for someone probably. But now I’m scared to date anyone. I look around and it looks a lot like everyone is trying to get the best match they can get. And they’re never satisfied. Meanwhile, I’m just extremely behind. And I still get 0 matches on the dating apps and can’t seem to interest anyone in that way. I feel like when I finally do it’s going to be for all the wrong reasons. Someone’s gonna take my money and status for a ride and cheat on me behind my back. Something like that.

I’ve been holding on to what my cousin told me all those years ago this whole time. Holding on to that idea that all the girls liked me at the end of high school. But holding onto those things doesn’t make them true. And it doesn’t mean a relationship would be good for me. My cousin was wrong. That’s not the way things went for me. And the girls never noticed me in high school. No one ever has. Time to stop believing in magic and fairy tales and accept what your experience has been.

So whenever there is a news and im not aware of it, he’ll say things like,’oh I thought you knew already since you keep with with the news so much’, i mean it sounds totally normal but to me it sounds like he is jealous or competitive. The other day while i was charging my phone, there was a new guideline out from the Govt that my state will be in total lockdown due to covid19, i was not aware of it as I was helping my mom that time, so after i got hold of my phone i called my bf, he told me about and i told him i had no idea and he said,’well I thought you knew cz you are so wise and keep up with current news’. I felt like that was really toxic, instead of sending me the info he said those things to me and laugh. I may sound sensitive and wanted to know whether having a bf who says things like that is toxic or not, to me he sounds like he wants to be better than me, i mean i have no prob he could definitely be better if he wants but i feel there’s a better way to communicate. Need advice on whether i was overthinking or this is actually unhealthy. He is sweet and caring to me tho. He would make comments and jokingly smile while hurting me. I feel like he wants to underestimate me if that makes sense. I want to have serious convo with him but i feel he’ll ‘jokingly’ hurt me again.

I felt like scared to get hurt or rejected and decided to self sabatoge in the moment. He follows a lot of hot girls from tinder but never mentioned sex to me and seemed pretty chill. He was rlly nice and enthusiastic seemingly. We were gonna hang out in the morning but then the day before one of the proposed days, I asked him about Friday? Made a lame excuse how my friend wasn't free and I was driving to him so I told him before I was visiting bc of my friend. Having a friend before or after meeting would soothe my anxiety meeting him. 

And then my tone writing to him was kind of disrespectful, the next day I was like, fuck it. I'll just go through w meeting him and asked if he was free that day at 6. he didnt rpely until the next day after that and was like saying to go for the next day. 

I didn't respond until later and asked him about the time, which he didn't respond. That day, he posted about himself drinking and feeling lonely and stuff


The same day later i asked my sister what I should do about my 'friend' . And she gave me rlly bad advice. Basically I was really apologetic and not chill. I asked him if he was free and the tone was not the chill time as before. I messaged him that.

That night, before we were supposed to meet up, he gave me a lame excuse also, which is obv very fake. I don't know if he was just reflecting my own excuse, bc mines didn't make sense and was kind of a mess. Obv I didn't wanna scare him and tell him I wasn't feeling well mentally before but I think I fucked up.

So I replied and told him it's okay ! . Although I wasn't okay and I feel like I don't wanna intiiate. 

He viewed my story after which was kind of sad in general. That's our last interaction.

What are your thoughts? Will I never talk to him again? It seemed pretty final and certain, like itd not gonna magically come back or anything. 

I rlly wanna meet up w this dude and I feel like I'm in a much better mental state. But also, don't know if he felt his ego got hurt and I was flaky or it wouldn't be a good time. Prob a combo of all. What should I do?

38,n7g52p,1620444068,Is this long distance man showing any red flags?,"28F here.

This cute guy added me on Instagram months ago. Lately he has commented on more and more of my incredibly random story posts, which is nice because he seems to want to get to know me. We have had some flowing conversations from them. 

I’m not normally into dating long distance, but I really click with this guy the more we talk and subtly flirt. 

A few things have made me worry in the past few days, but I’m not sure if I’m just overreacting:

1) Yesterday, we were talking about how I streamed video games on twitch a few times, years ago. He asked to follow me, even though I told him my channel isn’t really being used anymore. Gave him my username. He said he looked through pages of people before he was able to find my username. I didn’t understand the point but ok. 

2) Today, he said we should stream together. I told him my pc isn’t working and, again, I haven’t streamed in a long time. It’s low on my priority list because I’m moving apartments soon.

3) Tonight, he asked what video games I play so we can play something together. Turns out I have PlayStation and he has a Mac, so that’s a dead end. He said he’s going to look into getting a PlayStation so we can game together. I told him he must really like me a lot (to buy a console to play with someone he hardly knows). I didn’t say that last part. The conversation would change but somehow kept landing back to what games we can play. 

4) Showed me an awkward YouTube video of him from 7 years ago, no context.

4) He told me I have a very cute philtrum. ?????",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n7g52p/is_this_long_distance_man_showing_any_red_flags/

42,n7h16j,1620447275,Not sure if I just got ghosted or what,"So a few weeks ago I started talking to this girl on tinder. She didn't have a profile picture but seemed interesting by her bio so we got to talking. One thing she noted was that it was her fifth time reactivating tinder after deleting it, saying that she gets overwhelmed using that app. We quickly moved to instagram where it was easier to talk by sending voice messages, videos, pictures etc. Well she's beautiful, really down to earth, and fun to talk to. We would talk almost all day about our lives, family, futures and wants. So about a week into talking I ask her out for something simple and casual, coffee or a dinner date of sorts. She said she was really nervous about meeting anyone since she'd never met anyone off a dating app before. 

So the day of she cancelled on me saying that some of her family came over and she couldn't get away, which was understandable so it was fine. So we just continue talking and getting to know each other, talking for multiple hours a day most days. So for this weekend I once again asked her out. She seemed excited over it once again and says she wants to meet but said she had to check her schedule to see if she could make time. As a sidenote, it is Ramadan and she is Muslim so I understand if she can't make time since most Muslims here (in the UAE) spend Ramadan primarily hanging out with friends and family. On Wednesday I opened my tinder app and noticed that our chat had disappeared so she either unmatched me or deleted her account again, no telling. 

So she either unmatched or deleted tinder again but I didn't think much of it since we were talking on instagram and continued to talk that day so I figured she was interested and just deleted it, so whatever. Well for the past 4-5 days when we would tell each other goodnight she'd send me a kissy face or heart emoji and Wednesday night she did as well. She would also compliment me on my looks and I hers, so we both were interested in each other aside from having a lot in common. So Thursday I message her asking her how her day's gone and get no response. Was at work so I also shared some memes as we would do, still nothing. Friday I messaged her again asking how she is and if she had plans. Nothing. 

Now it's Saturday morning her and still no response whatsoever, and on top of that she seems to have turned off her online status. We both have private accounts on instagram and follow each other, and she didn't unfollow me or remove me as a follower either so it all just seems weird I guess. Do you guys think I got ghosted? I know it's only been several days but it's not like her at all to not respond almost immediately when I message her. I know she's been around since her online status showed before she turned it off but like I said she never responded.

Dating is hard for me because I tend to get very nervous and it shows. I stutter sometimes, my body feels stiff just being in public places and I get self-conscious about myself.

50,n7hze0,1620450841,I don’t know where it all went wrong.,"I was in a pretty serious long distance relationship with a girl for the last nine months. Things were great for a long time, she shared all our hobbies and we were both really happy. We would write long messages about what we liked about one another and how we helped each other. We shared everything and would talk from wake up to the early morning. Of course things weren’t without occasional strife, but we would always talk things out. She had told me once the academic year began she would be different. Along with this she shared much of her past trauma. Needless to say, I was fully prepared for the relationship to be strained over these last two semesters. One day she said she didn’t feel that she loved me, we seriously talked about this and decided to give it some time and discuss it during the summer, as that’s when much of our relationship was build. Despite summer being less than a month away, she decided to talk about it now, finalizing the break up, but also assuring me I did nothing wrong and we could still be friends. She assured me she didn’t leave me for anyone. Judging from the title of the post, I’m sure you can tell it didn’t work out like that. She said she needed space so I began messaging much less, a simple good morning and good night, maybe a hi in the middle of the day. Sometimes she would message back or even engage conversation. I took this to mean things were ok between us. Then she just stopped replying entirely. I figured she just needed some more space and continued as we had been. Throughout the relationship she had issues with trust, always scared I would hurt her and leave because we were online. This was a fear we both had, but I trusted that she wouldn’t do that and worked hard to make her feel comfortable. We had taken a break like this once before, but we had continued talking as usual. It doesn’t seem like that this time. She doesn’t seem to know what she wants, saying that she didn’t want to be friends, but not giving me a firm answer when I asked if we would ever talk again. I just don’t know what to do, I know she probably wasn’t emotionally ready for a committed relationship but it just hurts like hell. I think about how she lashed out at me for trying to get her a birthday gift, accusing me of trying to buy her. Even worse, now a guy who confessed to her while we were together has changed his profile picture to them together. I know they are friends but I can’t help reading too far into it. I don’t know how to feel, she assured me she didn’t leave me for anyone but I don’t know anymore. Everything hurts and I want it to be ok. People tell me she’s not worth it but I don’t know how to heal and everything. I don’t know when it all went so bad.

Since we first started talking, we’ve texted nearly every day and we’ve seen each other pretty sporadically over the past few months because of lockdown/school schedules/other things going on in our lives. We have so much fun together, we have amazing sex, and he really seems to be putting an effort in to getting to know me which I’m not entirely used to. The only thing is though, he told me he only wants something casual but is “open to anything really”, while I’m looking for something serious. He gave me the go ahead to continue to see other people to find what I’m looking for, but I haven’t found anyone in Hinge since him that I’d be interested in meeting. 

Even though we have a ton of fun together and our sex is great, I’m not really getting the emotional fulfillment I want right now. I don’t really know what to do about the situation. Because of lockdown, he’s the only reason I ever really leave my house and it’s nice having that social outlet and somewhat of a sex life. I’m not fully invested in him quite yet, but I do like him and like spending time with him but because I’m not getting that emotional fulfillment, I don’t really know if this is a healthy relationship I should continue. 

He’s not holding me back from meeting others, and I don’t think it’s hurting me in any way. I also don’t think we’ve spent enough time together for me to tell him I like him or ask for anything more out of him, because I still feel like there’s so much we don’t know about each other.

I don’t drink, I don’t smoke, I don’t have casual sex, I’ve never done dr**s, I don’t swear/curse, I volunteer at an animal shelter, I’ve got a masters degree and I love my friends, pets and family. My hobbies include running, reading and scrapbooking. 

I just finished my degree and am currently working part-time at a bar, while I search for graduate jobs/internships. Working at a bar has made me so depressed and hopeless on the dating front. 

I’m not exaggerating when I say that ALL the men I meet are not very nice. I see hundreds of men a day who are cheating on their girlfriends, doing drugs, DUI, acting inappropriately towards me, being perverts and offering me money for s*x! Lots of men harass me verbally and I have even been stalked to my car by a man in the short time that I’ve worked there. Lots of men have also tried to touch me while I’m serving them drinks. I sometimes go into the bathroom at work and just cry.

The other barmaids say they are just “used to it now” and it’s just “lad culture, so don’t take it personally.” But it is scary to me and really unattractive! It’s really made me believe there are no decent men out there and I feel so hopeless. My ex of 4 years also cheated on me and left me for another girl, which I guess hasn’t helped my opinion. 

I just want to know, are there any nice guys left out there and if there are, where/how do I find them? Thanks!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n7ix0r/do_nice_guys_exist_and_if_so_how_do_i_find_them/

We really clicked and I think he’s one of the rare guys I found really comfortable talking to. I know this sounds dumb but I found him attractive so I kinda got attached quickly lol.

We started out with a wholesome conversation and just friends. Very casual I would say. So our first convo happened like 2 weeks ago. Then last Sunday, we ended up talking until Monday, 2AM. He said, he was looking forward to talking to me again. My last text was a sleeping emoji.

Came Monday morning, the message was seen but I never heard anything back. I know I shouldn’t assume since we aren’t even dating yet but I felt really hurt not hearing anything from him until that time.

I really wanna follow up and text him again coz he has not blocked me but my pride is telling me not to do it because I might end up looking needy. It’s not in my nature to be like that. But also I’m very confused? Because I really wanna talk to him????

By the way, he’s been really slow in responding too. Like it takes him 3-5hours to reply. But I kinda sense it’s not in his nature to text people and he might be busy from work too. I work too so I don’t understand but it’s the weekend can’t he at least ask me what I’m up to. :-( idk I just need someone to slap me with the reality that he might not be interested or it’s a sign he’s just gonna ghost me in the end lol.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n7j7xh/not_sure_if_i_should_ask_how_he_is_doing_or_not/

64,n7kcwq,1620460944,Things I wish people told me when I started dating,"1. Stop being bitter. I’m serious stop being bitter about your lack of success with the opposite sex. This is very obvious and off putting, you will have a much more difficult time trying to attract women if you’re always coming off as bitter.
2. Be fun, funny and playful. Dating is supposed to be fun and everytime I get on here I see that’s lost on many of you. No one wants to date a downer or at least most don’t. Think about what excites, what humors you. Pre-game your dates and outings by watching something funny and getting in a good mood.
3. Be kind. I shouldn’t have to say this but many of you think women only like “bad boys” and that’s just not true. I’ve treated women well and also like shit and have success with both. However If a women stays with you even though you treat her like trash she doesn’t love or respect her self and vice versa for women.
4. Be spontaneous and thoughtful. If you really want to woo a women study her and surprise her with things she loves. 
5. Only accept the love you know you deserve. If someone treats you poorly or with disinterest cut them off immediately. Don’t waste the precious gift of life on people who don’t value you.
6. Invest in your looks. Ik some of you don’t wanna hear this but know one sees your personality immediately. Invest in your style and have good hygiene. 
7. Have no expectations. Don’t interact with a women with the expectation of getting her number, having sex, or getting a date. Talk to her because you find her attractive or looks like and interesting person to talk to.
8. Know what your partner likes. In life, in bed, at the dinner table. Be thoughtful.

If all else fails and you’re feeling toxic just love bomb, gaslight and ghost. That was my go to when I was on demon time. DISCLAIMER:  results may vary.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n7kcwq/things_i_wish_people_told_me_when_i_started_dating/

67,n7kz80,1620463670,I need to clear some of my confusions before tying the knot with this girl.,"I'm a very simple guy. We have a family business and we're very well off. I belong to a country where marriages are mostly arranged by parents. Nowadays, they allow the couple to understand each other before they can make any decision.

So here's the situation. I went to her house with my family and met them. I found her to be very decent, confident having a charming personality with neat and tidy clothes and matching shoes. Good looks, less talkative and nice and small family. 

So my parents asked for my opinion and I gave them a big ""YES"" after which they arranged an engagement event next day. They gave me the girl's personal number so that we can know each other.

So we have been talking on phone for like 6 months, here's what I found now.

She requires all of my attention during phone calls and always insist on video calling. she always wants compliments on her recent pictures/selfies which I'm forced to give. She never sees things from my perspective. She shows and boasts that she's bold but in actual lacks courage. Looks good naturally but still uses too much make-up. Likes to wear branded dresses, branded perfumes, watches and cars. She always taunts me for being too simple and says that she will change me and my dressing sense. though she always says that she loves me and wants to see me as her life partner.

I like some of her things, but we don't have a deep connection right now, the only reason I've been talking to her right now is LUST. because she's attractive and charming, I can't help myself stop talking to her.

My parents are asking for my final opinion so that they can decide a date for wedding. I'm still confused. Please guide me.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n7kz80/i_need_to_clear_some_of_my_confusions_before/

69,n7l8qn,1620464841,I realize maybe I'm hard to approach difficult conversations?,"34f I don't think I'm intimidating, but I have been told by people I can be. I've also been told by men I can be hard to read sometimes.

Here's the thing. I'm not like other women when it comes to romance. I'm not a girly girl. I am feminine but I have strong opinions. I don't pick up easily on gestures or hints, so if a guy likes me he has to be bold &amp; verbally tell me so.

I hate social media as a way of expressing how someone feels for me. My biggest pet peeve is decoding someone's feelings for me. Its a time waster &amp; stressful. I've had so many guys post subtle messages online to try to grab my attention or tell me how they feel but because they're so passive &amp; unclear in their feelings I can't tell if it's directed at me or someone else because let's face it, he can be posting it for several women or another woman &amp; this has happened to me before where I assumed it was for me &amp; it wasn't.

So at some point ITS IMPORTANT FOR ME TO HAVE A CLEAR CONVERSATION WITH A GUY ABOUT our feelings. However, I feel whenever guys try to approach me &amp; I get the sense that they're trying to feel me out to see how I feel &amp; I ask them straight out where they're going with this or to try to get some answers as to what's on their mind, almost always they bail out &amp; say its nothing but look disappointed. 

That's their perfect opportunity to say something then! If a man wants to be a man in the relationship then he needs to step up &amp; take lead!!! 

I had an old flame who I've been recently seeing casually. Every time I hang out with him lately he's been bringing up the topic of marriage, houses, etc. to me very casually. I dont know where he's going with it, but its so annoying because he can never just say whats on his mind &amp; whenever I give him the opportunity to come forward he doesn't. He keeps sending me houses he finds randomly that are for sale. I finally asked him why he keeps doing that &amp; he just says its because he figures we both like houses &amp; thought he'd casually share it with me.

First I want to say I have to intention of building anything with him because he's already showed me how immature &amp; not ready for a relationship he is even though he thinks he's ready I know he's not &amp; is just caught up in the fantasy. Also we never dated that long, he's fickle &amp; you don't tell a girl you want to live with her by sending her a bunch of houses online. You sit her down &amp; tell her you have feelings for her &amp; see a future with her &amp; would like to build something with her towards the future. That's how you have a conversation LIKE A MAN. 

Maybe I am a little hard to approach but it's because I'm tired of dealing with little boys &amp; need a man to step up &amp; be a man. Too many guys say they want to be the leader in the relationship but never take charge to do so. I'm tired of dealing with cowards &amp; need someone who can be transparent &amp; clear with their intentions &amp; desires with me. 

How do I tell this guy I don't want anything serious with him? I feel like I've already told him &amp; he's not getting it. I just can't stand how he handles things &amp; his super passive aggressive approach.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n7l8qn/i_realize_maybe_im_hard_to_approach_difficult/

Love is not something that comes natural to us, we learn to love and to be loved. I believe that now a days movies, books, and everything that’s meant to entertain us has fed us up to a point that make us believe that we deserve everything and the thing is we don’t deserve anything, we are not willing to fight for. 

If you’re a person sitting on a couch all day complaining that no one’s going to love you, or you’re not pretty/handsome enough, jerking off all day, if you’re not willing to step up and to go out, get rejected. You are not going to be loved and you don’t deserve love because you’re not willing to work for it. Relationship take time, effort, and a power of will to keep going on until you make it and even afterwards you have to keep going.

So if you’re up to this point reading, take this as a challenge, to take actions for what you truly want, if you want love, go out, work out, talk to that person you want to talk to, stop complaining and make an daily effort to fulfill your desires.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n7ltcw/you_dont_deserve_love_right_now/

75,n7lxf1,1620467821,Not sure how to interpret and go about date's signals,"Dear r/dating 

I'm a male college student in my early twenties looking for advice concerning my last dating experience.

I recently got to know a girl studying at the same faculty as me over an online dating app and after a bit of texting we went on our first date. The date went great and I had the feeling that we are on the same wave length. On the date she told me that she also uses dating apps just to get to know people on a non-sexual level, but I think I made it pretty clear that I'm only interested in romantic pursuits (not necessarily a relationship but sexual none the less). 

A week after this we went on our second date which went even better. We had a really good time, cherishing each other's humor and company and ended up at my place, where I made my move and we started making out. She was hesitant staying at my place for the night because of the corona curfew and bc she had to work early the next day, so after making out for a while she went back to hers.

The next day she texted me and said that she really enjoyed our last date and that she wants to see me again, so I was like ""Nice, it's on :D"". However, when we met again (kissing when greeting) she told me that she is more interested in seeing me on a friendly basis. This is where I started to get confused (because of our last date and her reaction afterwards and since she did not reject kissing me at the beginning of this third date). She also told me that she's been feeling down and pretty emotionally the last few days bc an acquaintance of hers died of an overdose.

However, we still ended up at her place, drinking with her room mate and his gf. After a while we went to her room and started making out again. This is when she told me again that she is unsure about whether we should have sex bc she doesn't want me to think that she wants to get into a relationship with me. From what she said I also gathered that she seems to have general troubles building emotional connections of a sexual kind (for whatever reason, I didn't want to overanalyze her psychologically), but I explained that I am not necessarily looking for a relationship and that I am fine with casual sex.

Fueled by us being tipsy, we continued making out and finally had sex, however we had to stop after a while bc she said that she isn't really present with her mind and that the last few days have been really hard on her. Even though I would've loved to finish, we let it at that and cuddled some more before sleeping. 

The next morning we made out a bit, cuddled some more and talked about how to go about our situation from now on and she made it clear that she is not down for anything but a non-sexual friendship thing. 

I really like her and am pretty confused about her seemingly paradoxical statements and actions. I feel like the reason could be her having problems making intimate connections, but maybe this is a bit too far fetched. I guess she is probably just confused as I am about this or just can't properly communicate what is up with her.

How should I go about this? On the one hand I would love to keep seeing her, but on the other hand I definitely want to pursue a sexual relation with her... Should I just tell her that I am definitely  looking for something more than a purely non-sexual relation in case she makes up her mind?

In any case, I'll try to not obsess over this and keep on dating other women.

I made sure to tell her beforehand that me asking her out for coffee (I actually asked for dinner but she said dinner was too serious so we would just get coffee) was me being interested in her. She knows that I wanna date her

So we went. And things were going well, not amazing, but good, we were talking and laughing and making jokes. All of a sudden a friend calls her. I can't hear the friend but I can hear her ""Oh yeah, no problem. I'm at *place where we were*. You can show up"" and 10 minutes later her friend (girl) shows up and just sits there with us and starts talking to her

I just sat there surprised and she must've noticed I was annoyed because she told me to ""cheer up"". I excused myself to go to the bathroom, called my friend and he told me to leave. I agreed, so I told her I had to go, gave her the COVID elbow bump, and left

Am I being harsh on thinking this was an extremely rude thing to do? Or did she not do it maliciously and didn't think it was a date (which I don't understand, I made it very clear what I wanted)? Even if she didn't do it with bad intentions, should I continue trying to date someone so oblivious?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n7m39t/was_this_rude_or_am_i_overreacting/

80,n7mbgi,1620469427,How do you let someone down who is obviously not ready to date?,"I went on a date with a lovely girl, lots in common, smart, funny, beautiful but... she told me she was one week out of a relationship and after her saying that the longest she's been out of a relationship has been a month (she's 30) I don't think she's in the best headspace. She told me a lot about her past relationships and I think she needs to look after herself right now (I recognise the same manic behaviour I had after my last big relationship ended). I would happily date her if she was in a better place but I don't think I have the emotional energy to be what she needs.

81,n7mvhc,1620471720,Dating seems pointless (in college),"Let me start this off by saying that I have never been in a relationship, well except one ""relationship"" that I had for a month when I was 15, which I don't really count. I have had a lot of flings and situations where I was close to getting into a relationship, but once things that getting serious I always end up losing interest. Now I am almost 21 and I have never been in a real relationship and I don't want to be. It seems, at least for the time being, pointless. I am not really a very romantic person and I don't idealize the idea of being in a relationship, even when I like people. In fact it actually kind of stresses me out. It seems like a massive time commitment. Maybe I'm a ""workaholic"" or something, but when I am not studying I am working on my side hustles, or trying to learn new things, or hanging out with friends, or just consumed by hobbies/trying to improve myself. I don't see the point of pouring so much time and energy into building a relationship with someone, especially in college, if things probably won't even workout. Another thing is the fact that a lot of people tend to not remain friends with their ex's. Like why would someone put so much effort into building a relationship with another person to not even remain friends when things don't workout romantically anymore? I am working on so many things right now that spending time on someone that I will end up breaking up with seems completely pointless. Not to mention that relationship are expensive, can become very emotionally draining, and overall feel limiting. I guess I am a ""free spirit"". I don't like feeling like I have to commit to something that isn't necessary, and I know you might be thinking like this sounds like an excuse to just sleep around, but it's not. It has gotten to the point where right now while I am in a situation where I like someone a lot and they like me too, and I still feel this way. I want to tell them I think we should just be friends because I think you are dope as a person, but I am just not a relationship person. I know like that might sound like a classic ""fuckboy"" line, but I actually mean it. I like them so much as a person, that I don't want to risk losing them by getting into a turbulent relationship, and then just breaking up and not talking anymore. I want them to stay in my life for the long run and stay by my side, even if it means just staying friends. Do any of you feel the same? Also since I plan on moving abroad after college and tend to move around a lot that also doesn't make to want to get into one either. Like if I really like someone for their personality, wouldn't it make sense to just be friends with them and then if I am more just attracted to them sexually, just have sex with them? Sure there is no problem for being 20 and still never getting into a relationship, but I love being single. In fact I think that I might like being single a little too much, so much so that the thought of being a relationship sounds like something that gives me a headache, more so than joy. People spend so much time trying to make relationship work or just trying to find love in general, but why would I spend all of that time and energy into finding the ""perfect"" person, when I can just become my own perfect person (in my eyes). I want to build myself to become my ideal version of myself because I am going to be with myself until the day that I die, but relationship tend to just be temporary, and well let's not even get into the topic of marriage.

90,n7onvb,1620478535,What do you perceive is going on with my ex-boyfriend (35M) and me (26F). Advice?,"I’ve been dating this guy for about 8/9 months. We’re 9 years apart and I don’t notice the age difference. 34m, 25f. We get along like a house on fire, always laughing together. He tells me regularly ‘I laugh so much with you’, I know his friends, his family know about me but we haven’t been able to meet due to Covid. He used to call his parents every Sunday but since we’ve been dating, it’s become less and less. We normally see each other a few times a week, sometimes less or more depending on our schedule. He invites me to all the 'big' things in his life, for example, we were going to go to his medical ball together (he would've been seen with me in front of other girls if there is anything nefarious). When we drive or hangout in different areas together, he likes to look up the prices of houses. He's also said in front of me how cute kids are and that he can't wait to do that one day. Signs to me he's testing my reaction and seeing if I want that as well.

A few months into dating, he asked to make sure that we’re not seeing other people. He isn’t into casual sex and I think exclusivity is important to him. A few months ago I was anxious about what we were - he hadn’t asked me to be his girlfriend and I thought this is something that he would’ve wanted to do. He’s traditional, wanting something serious such as marriage/family. We had a few talks about the direction of our relationship, he said there were a few things he was a bit concerned about, a few things we maybe didn’t have in common (he’s very risk-averse and overthinks everything).

He’s studying so after that conversation he said he would decide at the end of his exams, his exams have finished now. He went away recently with some of his University friends, he was unsure of whether to go (seemed like he wanted to be with me, haha) and wanted to see me before he left. I’ve felt good about everything between us post-exams as I had a feeling he was going to slowly contact me less and less and try and see me less - due to his uncertainty.

One night on the phone, I told him that I wasn’t quite sure whether continuing to have sex with him was a wise idea as we aren’t boyfriend/girlfriend. He was confused that I said it was casual. I said ‘well, we aren’t in a relationship’ and he said ‘you are my girlfriend’ I’m certain he went onto say ’I thought we’ve known this since we started dating’ so I then asked him ‘well if I was to meet a new friend of yours that I haven’t met, would you introduce me as your girlfriend? And he said yes. Unfortunately, he has to repeat his exams so I may not be able to see him for a while, I do need to clarify that he actually meant this.I just wonder why he had this hesitancy a few times when we had the discussion a few months back though? There was even a point where I suggested we should end things because he wasn't so sure and he agreed. Maybe this is natural though and a reflection of his risk-averse attitude about things. There were just some uncertainties on his part. He said he could've been overthinking it. As a result, it sort of made me more anxious and I suggested we should end it.

He said it’ll be good to have a proper chat about things as we’ve both been putting things off, as so he said.

I got to his house, he said yes I have been his girlfriend all along and he doesn't know why I would think otherwise. He said that he feels it’s not going to work because of our age gap and he claims we're very different people. I personally do not see this as I feel like we share the same values, we're compatible in a lot of areas etc. He told me that he finds me beautiful, loves my sense of humour and that we get along and have fun together. I did mention that we handle conflict differently but our only arguments have been over text/call and since that's such a poor form of communication - it's hard to tell.

He started to cry (this is the most emotion I've seen from him), saying he won't be able to cook me any more dinners and our memories shared together. He then went back and forth and said he doesn't know if he's making the right decision, that he will never find someone like me, I am out of his league etc. He said maybe he's just one big idiot after all and he's made a stupid decision. I was calm in my response and he said ""why don't you get angry? this is making it more difficult"" in a somewhat cute way. He just kept saying that lately everything has been solidified in his brain that it's probably the most responsible decision. He asked me if I thought he was being unreasonable.

Now I feel like since we've been arguing quite a bit the past few weeks and he's been stressed, possibly his decision is skewed. I hadn't seen him in 2 or 3 weeks due to exams and I asked whether maybe we just got cold feet because of us not seeing each other. I remember months ago he said he sometimes questions us in absence.

We spent over 4 hours talking and it was like he didn't want me to leave nor did I. He then asked if we should go to dinner together. He finally walked me to my car and he couldn't stop crying.

Something in me decided to message him the other morning after I left:Me - Morning 📷 I don’t know if messaging you is the best idea, but I hope you haven’t woken up too sad. If you ever want to catch up on neutral grounds, a coffee or lunch, don’t hesitate - I still consider you a friend. Even under these circumstances, it was nice to see you last night and I am saddened I won’t be able to have more of them with you. That’s all 📷Him - Morning! I was in two minds as to whether to message you with the same sentiment 📷 I feel very much the same. Like you say it’s always nice seeing you, and it’s hard for me to think we won’t be sharing more moments together. I really hope you’re feeling ok today 📷 Enjoy the rest of your weekend 📷Me - Aw, well if you’re keen to catch up in a week to come or a few months, let me know. I’m trying to not make this any harder for us but it is difficult. I didn’t react with anger because that’s genuinely not how I feel about us. I miss you, enjoy your morning eggs 📷Him - Will do 📷 miss you too, at least you can have your eggs with olive oil today 📷Me - These thoughts are best discussed in person but I’m not sure if that can happen and they’re weighing heavy on me. I do think we could work through the issues as I feel there are more positives than negatives. I am aware that the past few weeks have been pretty nasty for the both of us but I’ve been particularly harsh on you. If I don’t hear back from you, I will, of course, assume you do not feel the same way and will accept your decision.Him - I thought I did explain that although the last month or so has been really difficult, it hasn’t been the main reason why I reached the decision I did. Of course I’m always really happy to talk to you about anything though, so if you still want to talk things through naturally I’m happy to do that 📷He went onto say that he hates that he's upset me and that it's all really difficult for him but he **thinks** it's all for the best.

We caught up and went to the beach together. We had a good time, he just feels at the moment he thinks it’s the best decision, although he isn’t fully confident he’s doing the right thing. He said maybe in a year it’ll make more sense and we realise we’re fit for each other. He said that he told his mother we broke up and she got really angry. Something was quite odd, he told me his friend (who I know) broke up with his girlfriend but they’re back together. We then went back to his for a cup of tea and we talked a bit more. He admitted that he does get in his head a lot and could be overthinking things. Said again that he's scared he's going to lose someone amazing but feels it's the right decision **right now**. Again, I feel because I've been arguing with him over text lately and he feels overwhelmed. When I left, he said he wants to see me again in a week or 2.

We spoke on the phone and I told him it’s really painful catching up with him and I don’t want to feel like an option to him or being left on the back burner, he said that wasn’t his intention and he would never do that as he has too much respect for me. He said it was hard catching up with me recently as well. He said he agreed to catching up because he felt like it was something I wanted. We spoke a bit more and he said that if he has a change of heart in the future, he won’t just sit on it. He’ll tell me. He told me he hopes I know how beautiful I actually am.

He ended up calling/messaging me over Christmas and NYE. I do feel like I am the one who predominately initiates contact with him first, I’ve been sending him sort of lengthy messages and he claims he’s overwhelmed by it. Recently we’ve been having an hour or so conversations when we usually would never have that as he was never one to speak on the phone. He expressed doubts about our break up as per usual and said he’s probably one big idiot after all. He told me he’s been on 2 dates with 2 girls as I asked, said he’s sort of interested but it hasn’t gone anywhere. I was quite upset and he assured me he wants to stay single for a while, he also said it’s not like he even wants a relationship with them. He said to give me some context that there were girls before we met that he was interested but it didn’t go anywhere. I was quite offended because he went on dates with girls that he basically broke up with me for. He broke up with me over an age gap but then went on dates with girls my age? Makes no sense. He said it’s all really regrettable and then told me that it's not that he wants a relationship with these people and said they’re just friends he wanted to get to know better. He said he wishes I could see his phone. Near the end of the phone call, he got teary about the fact he thinks I'm so sweet and don't deserve this.

He said over a month ago that a catch up would be good to clear the air. He also wouldn’t directly answer the question when I asked if he just sees me as a friend. I’ve decided to pull back, but it seems like he wants to catch up. At the start of this month, he offered to call about something, I think he was sort of surprised by that as I usually am jumping at any chance for us to speak on the phone. He sent me a message about the date/time tba (which I didn't respond to) and then he sent me a follow up message about a week later saying “Morning, when works this week for you?” with a smiley face. He then said whenever is fine, to choose a day/evening and let him know. He then said he hopes my mother is doing okay. This was 2 weeks ago and I didn't responded. He sent me another message 2 weeks later saying he hadn’t heard from me in a while, was wondering how I am and asked if my mother is okay. I replied and I was friendly, but brief. He replied and said a few things and then said ‘we never caught up in the end, let me know if you would still like to’ we talked a bit more and then I told him that I feel he just wants to catch up to free himself from guilt and that we can only catch up if we both feel it’s best for us to be together. He responded with saying that he understands and he didn’t think it would still be really difficult but he understands and there is a bit of truth in wanting to free himself but he thought it would be healthy in general. Apologised for the pain he’s caused me and wished me all the best. I told him that I just felt him talking about clearing the air was ominous and I just wanted to have dinner with him and not talk about us. He said that he understands how that could have caused it and apologies and said it’s the furthest from how he wanted to make me feel. I didn't respond and almost 2/3 months later, I sent him a message telling him what I wanted to tell him if we had cleared the air. He positively responded to it, told me things have been really difficult on his end, he still thinks and misses me all the time. That he basically feels the same, it’s just really hard and he doesn’t know what to do and doesn’t want to mess with my head so he tries to leave me alone.

Advice? What do you think he would benefit from telling me he still thinks about me all the time/misses me.

I don't mind that much anymore unless I think about my breakup. Doesn't happen that often now. Recently I met a cute guy on a dating app. At first, I didn't feel much, but we have a really good connection with each other, and the other day when we hang out we started flirting a little bit more. Aggressive flirting lol. 

I felt great, I had a tingling sensation, maybe the so-called butterflies in my stomach and I saw him in a new light. I mean I always thought he was quite cute but the sexual tension was never there until that moment. 

The thing is, since I'm fine being on my own and I do care about this guy, I don't want to get into a relationship without actually wanting to. And in September I start school again and the possibility of meeting new people is exciting. 

What would you do if you were me? I want to clarify that this guy is not really pursuing me like he's not making an effort (yet at least) to be with me, so this is just me thinking if I should do it or not.

I went on a date with this girl last week. We hit it off really well. That evening she invited me inside. We ended up making out on her couch. I was moving a bit fast for her and she simply asked me to slow it down. Not a problem. I did just that. So we didn’t do anything beyond kissing.

Last night I took her out again. Went back to her place and we caught a movie. She was cuddling next to me a and was gently running her fingertips over me so I knew she’s in some type of mood. We make out and this time I’m proceeding with caution so I don’t do anything she’s uncomfortable with. Ultimately I’m able to finger her. I knew she had “finished” and we kinda left it as is. By this time it’s 3am and we’re both kinda tired at this point.

When I left, I couldn’t help but to think that I should’ve escalated it more? I know it’s a strange worry of mine, but I didn’t want to be placed in a position that I was making her uncomfortable so I didn’t push it further.
