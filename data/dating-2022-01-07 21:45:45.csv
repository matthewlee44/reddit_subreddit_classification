7,ryqvjr,1641614644,Is my singleness a result of pickiness or just not meeting the right one?,"
27F, I’ve been on and off the dating apps for years. I’ve complained to my mother enough and she has always reassured me that I just haven’t  found the right one, been hearing this since I was 21. I feel like I could have been in a relationship or at least “dated” if I went for the guys that have pursued me. However, I got tired of the ones I didn’t like back approaching me and have decided to use bumble. I’ve met up with two guys and didn’t feel them either. It’s only been twice BUT like I said I tried the other apps for years. My life has always been the ones I want don’t want me back/aren’t serious and the ones that like me I don’t want back. My mom says that she really loved my dad and she’s been with her current bf for years but I just don’t get the appeal of either of them (seeing them as if I don’t know them or aren’t related to them). She says she didn’t settle but I just don’t get how you aren’t settling if you aren’t physically attracted to the person. I do feel I will genuinely end up alone, rather be alone vs being taken and miserable. Not that this matters but I don’t really have an active sex drive, I don’t enjoy masturbating and haven’t had sex in years. I saw someone very briefly 3 years ago and while he had a decent personality, I wasn’t physically attracted to him. That was my closest to a relationship, you’re seriously telling me I haven’t been able to find anyone since? It’s like the universe is telling me I can’t do any better, I have never even introduced anyone to my family going on 30. Social anxiety is something I deal with but not that much of a contributing factor.

I said we should remove each other off of everything too. I didn’t want to go back on my decision. I only said this so he didn’t feel confused about me blocking him. 

I don’t know how to stop at this point. He said something sexual before we even went on our first date. I tried to play it off like I didn’t acknowledge what he said but he continued. I told him I wasn’t onboard and then said we’d be better off leaving things as they are. He kept apologising and trying to fix it but I knew we had to stop.

I’m (21F) and have never been in a relationship before. I’ve gone on a few 1st &amp; 2nd dates with a few guys but haven’t gone past that point. I feel like I’m not awkward with guys either as I have a lot of male friends who I hang out with frequently and play games with.

I’m honestly pretty content with myself and what I do. I enjoy the time I spend by myself and with my friends and family. So don’t really see a point in dating a guy if I don’t enjoy the time I spend with him more than myself ya know?

That being said it does get pretty lonely sometimes. Mainly only like the end/beginning of the year during Christmas, new years, and the lunar new years. Happy to see all my friends with their BF’s on their socials but sorta jealous myself that I don’t have any special person to share this time of the year with.

Maybe I’m just picky, but like I just want a guy who is also my best friend, like how my mom is with my dad. My only reqs is that he has a decent job/career, same height or taller than me (I’m 5’5), and asian american as I prefer someone with a similar background to me.

If you haven’t read my previous posts, please do so, as they provide context. That being said, let’s begin. I’ve decided, after much consideration and advice from the people in this community, to break up with him. I realized that I was in a very bad situation with him. I want to return his things to him, but subtly. I’m not sure how to do this, either. I also plan on saving money to pay him back for everything he has done for me. That being said, I can’t really leave him just yet. I have to put up with him for a little while longer. I’m not sure how I can avoid seeing him physically, though. He’s always on about seeing me, and whenever we do see each other, his only interest is showering me with compliments and trying to touch me everywhere. In public. This is a side note, but I realized kissing him always made me feel uncomfortable. I’m not sure why.

Long story short, if you look at my last post, a good male friend of mine and i made out a few weeks ago at a party( i am female). We talked about it admitted we both had feelings but wanted to take it slow. His ex wants to suddenly get back together and randomly messages him, and he considers it. He meets with her and decided that they go separate ways. We take time apart to figure out what we each want, since he was being inconsistent with me on what he wanted us to be. A week later, we talk it out and he tells me he’s not ready to date and needs to work on on some struggles, i suggest that we continue being friends. We decided to not let this get in the way of our friendship. 

Suddenly, seems like I’m getting ghosted, or at least ignored for hours. Why’s that? We had a good friendship and it seemed like we were on the same page to go back to normal but he’s acting distanced….

I took off one headphone. She asked if I was using this area (pointing to the area I'm standing in) or that area ( the other empty side of the room) ""What a dump question"" I thought. I answered that I'm using only this area. She stood there for a second as if she was waiting for something then said okay and went to the other side.

She did ab crunches for less than 5 minutes. Then left. It took my dumb self a couple of minutes to realize that maybe she was trying to start a conversation.

24,ryt3u5,1641622173,I have a question about Tinder and Bumble,"Now let me just put out an explanation first.
So a few days ago I signed up for Bumble and Tinder and have definitely learned a lot about the 2 since then.
I’ve had a little bit of luck on both at first, I got some likes and a couple matches on both sites/apps but after about 2 or 3 days, absolutely nothing happened and I ended up wasting some time.
So then I did some research and learned about the elo systems and the algorithms, and based on what I’ve heard about Tinder, you get ranked by how much people swipe right on you and not only that but also how active you are on the app.
And I’ve heard that Atleast most dating apps/sites are like that.
So then I got some advice from this guy on YouTube who said that I should delete my account and recreate it once a month with different pics each time and that’s exactly what I’m going to do.
So then I decided to delete both my Tinder and Bumble accounts yesterday and will recreate them tomorrow with different pics.
So here is my question, is all of this information correct and should I do exactly what I have planned???
Heck, have any of you tried this out and has it worked for you???
Also something else I’ve heard too from a different person is that I’m going to have to use a different phone number or something if I decide to recreate my account, but that might just be for Tinder though.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ryt3u5/i_have_a_question_about_tinder_and_bumble/

She came in these cute pajamas and mentioned going to the hotel bar to drop in with some other coworkers. Someone on my team said I should go down to the bar and the crush said I could come if I want. 

Well I ended up not going down to the bar and the next morning someone pointed out to me that I blew a golden opportunity with her given that she was going to a bar in her pajamas just to drop in. I assume they mean I could of gotten laid had i gone down their with her. 

I’m not looking for sex, but I am kicking myself because it was an opportunity to talk to her outside of work and my mind makes me wonder while I wasn’t looking to sleep with her that night, we could of gone back to one of our rooms and spent time together chatting.

Bear with me because this will sound kind of shallow, I'm just talking generalities here and I'm not looking for practical advice just curious on how single people operate in their relationships nowadays.

So it's pretty common sense that women have a much easier time finding partners when they want it. Granted most are not going to be quality men, they do have more options on average.

Well as I've made more female friends I've really gotten a sense for just how bombarded they are by guys when they're single. Nearly all my single female friends have at least like 3+ dudes hitting them up at all times.

I'm just wondering how guys deal with this nowadays. I've got a girl who I'm FWB with, and even though we're not in a committed relationship I sometimes feel like I'm competing because she's constantly getting hit on by multiple dudes. It's not a huge concern but it's a weird dynamic.

 I'd also like to hear a female perspective on what it's like to be single and what makes you want to stick with a particular FWB when you have so many options.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ryumg6/how_do_you_cope_with_the_imbalance_of_malefemale/

We went on a 3 dates (activities like bowling) over the summer, we had one make out, and then she said she wanted to be friends. I handled it politely said no thanks on friendship and then stopped talking to her completely. A couple months went by and then we started talking again and we went out to lunch and went for a walk in the city and it felt like we were vibing better this time. I think she respected that I had been decisive in saying no to friendship and it just seemed like she appreciated her time with me more. Then, a month later (she works 6 days a week and I do as well so we always struggle to make plans), we went out to dinner, followed by a wine bar, and then a desert place. It ended up with a make-out at her front door. It was fun though and we spent like 8 hours together. However, in the past, when I drop off a girl after a date and she is interested, she usually invites me inside her apartment, but she did not. The next day she was texting me how much fun she had and it seemed like an increased level of interest. Next, the holidays came and I haven't seen her for like 5 weeks as we have both been with our families and she was working 7 days in the final weeks before the holidays. We text and stuff in between here and there but we don't really talk on the phone (I generally believe the phone should only be used to set-up dates in the early stages). Does not seeing each other for so long periods impact the spark? Am I handling this correctly?

The confusing thing is that we have now known each other for like 8 months and yet it all seems to be going very slow (not just physically but also frequency of seeing each other). We made plans for this weekend to go to a theme park but now I am wondering, is that the right type of date to go on? Or maybe should I have invited her over for dinner and wine or something more intimate at my place? Since we restarted talking, this is only the 3rd date and she seems to go slow so I'm not sure. We also went on several activity type dates in the first go-around. I could invite her over to my place after the theme park but we will get home late and, knowing her, I think she will likely be ready to go to sleep.

Like I don’t know how go do something as small as kiss, which is something most people understand by the time their 14. Like no lie I don’t get it. It looks like people just rubbing lips. 

I know that the vast majority of women around me have had sex with at least one person so it’s like I’m as experienced as a 12 year old and they’re actual adults with normal experiences and I know it’ll be unattractive.

Ever since I’ve [18M] started to get interested in girls, it always seemed apparent that I was interested in older girls. Started in middle school with girls who were about 2 years older than me, then the same thing went on through high school. Girls my age just didn’t seem interesting to me, mentally or sexually. And if I’m being really honest, this is still the case for 18-19 years old girls as of right now. I actually had one or two (very) short relationships with girls the same as me back when I was in high school and they were genuinely awkward, loveless, failed relationships that left unsettled. And I find in older (early to mid-twenties) women something I just can’t find in girls my own age. Another vision of life, a general knowledge… that is just more attractive and emotionally appealing.

With all that said, however: I am perfectly aware that most women, especially the ones in the age range I’m into, aren’t into younger guys at all. And for valid reasons. They want men that know what they want in life, that have more life experience, maybe they also want someone who’s financially stable, and that’s totally understandable! Also, what if I get manipulated by an older girlfriend? This would seem unlikely, as I wouldn’t consider myself as a particularly vulnerable person at all. But hey, who knows? There are some sick people out here. But I just cannot help it.

That’s why, I decided some time ago, to totally gave up on being in a relationship until I’m old enough to engage in a relationship where age don’t fucking matter anymore, and only focus on being friends on benefits with a few girls my age I meet on dating apps (which is already what is happening rn). Once again, I don’t know what their feelings exactly are, but I’ve quickly realized these are not girls I would like to be in a relationship with. There’s something deeply missing in them to make them fully appealing to me. While I wouldn’t consider a relationship, I still can be friends and find a sexual interest in them.

You’re maybe wondering : “Well, he’s too young to be in a relationship anyway!”. And yeah, maybe you’re right. I think I’m writing this post just because I feel really lonely though, and need to vent and identify my problems. Ever since I was 12, I always felt really lonely in life for some reason, actually. And now, almost all of the few friends I had, all the friends I could laugh with and who made me feel less isolated, have left the city two years go to pursue college in other cities, and I’m just here, wondering if I’m ever gonna be loved, felt appreciated again like this.

77,ryzna5,1641647798,Do girls really notice guys smells (semi) frequently?,"So one piece of advice I see quite often with guys wanting to improve their looks is that they should invest in a good cologne as a guys smell is one of the first things a girl notices about a guy.

For me personally I hardly/never notice any smells coming from guys I interact with (even my guy friends who I give bro hugs to) and with girls it's more frequent, but still rarely I notice a girls smell. An example being, I could smell the perfume off of one of my female colleagues the other day (which did smell nice) but before then it had been months since the last time I noticed if a girl was wearing a perfume.

So girls, how often do you notice guys wearing cologne? (In both a professional and a social environment)",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ryzna5/do_girls_really_notice_guys_smells_semi_frequently/

We initially bonded over being cat owners and so we talked a lot about or cats and sent pictures and videos of them being cute. I live in a big city, where it's hard to make new friends, especially in your mid-late 20s. It's always nice to have a new friend! The thing I hate about dating is that after the first date you either completely stop talking or decide to continue to be romantically involved... but why can't we keep in touch platonically?

80,rz0cwe,1641650086,Zombie Relationship Status,"Hi.  I (m33) started dating someone (f26) I met at a concert back in the summer. I had just moved back to London for a great new job and had a  rare night off work and a friend with a spare ticket to a favourite  Artists’ huge outdoor show. We met in the crowd and totally hit it off,  eventually started kissing, went back to mine and then went out again the next day and spent the whole day together, it was like weed known each other our entire lives, I didn’t ever want to not be around her. We then started seeing each other a few times a week and messaging every day and it looked like it was going good.

But there were a few things that happened that turned us off from each other.  First of all, neither of us were looking for a relationship and kept telling each other as such, even though we were clearly in one or heading that way. Secondly, we both got drunk a few times and kissed other people - but immediately told each other after. (She actually got so  drunk she kissed a random guy(m40+) in front of me once, but can’t remember and I once actually got so drunk with a friend(f31) who I knew  liked me I ended up going down on them) we’re both as bad as each other.  Or maybe I’m worse for that last one. But we kept telling each other what happened and kept forgiving each other, but resentment and paranoia were growing for both of us and I think we stopped respecting one another.

But we were still super close and got on so unbelievably well and spoke more and more often. We started telling each other we loved each other and agreed to refer to each other as girlfriend and boyfriend.

But after a few weeks and a few more dumb occurrences on her part (her getting drunk and being overly flirty with my friends to the point that made them uncomfortable - which I was paranoid about because of the time she kissed someone in front of me) we got to a point where I decided it was going nowhere, I had felt wronged a few too many times but didn’t have a leg to stand on morally, so I suggested breaking it off, which we both agreed might be for the best.

However,  since then she has been very keen on talking to me and arranging to meet up and to sleep together etc. I have reciprocated because I still love her and enjoy her company so much. We are so in sync, sometimes it’s spooky. And the mental health support we give exchange in our times of need was an invaluable part of our lives.

But  I know in the back of my mind I don’t want a relationship with her, after all, we’ve been through, and that I want to and need to start winding things down and cooling things off. But I just don’t know if that’s smart being as how well we match each other.

So here we are, in a zombie relationship. A relationship still working,  breathing and walking, but no autonomous plans or aspirations. Acting like we’re a couple to each other, but I no longer want to bring her into my life or my work or my friendship circles (I don’t even tell my housemates when I go to see her) and I think we both know there’s no future. But we carry on being each other’s support and best friends,  confidants and lovers. A zombie relationship, all of the important bits,  but none of the excitement and drive that fuels a normal relationship.

What do I do? Do all relationships eventually end up this close, yet lacklustre? Are we actually a bad match? Is it a Sid and Nancy thing? (We’re both off the drinking heavily now and are both taking  medication for our very obvious mental health problems furling sporadic  behaviours!) Have I taken the zombie metaphor too far? I’m so confused.

Any advice would be great. Or even a different perspective on the way I’ve told this story would be great.

Much love

84,rz11sh,1641652122,Indicators that you're a physically attractive guy when using dating apps (CoffeeMeetsBagel vs. Hinge)?,"Just curious if there are ways to tell if you're physically attractive based on how you're received on dating apps?

I  think I'm a physically attractive guy for my demographic (minority  ethnically, fit/taller than average for my race, very good career) based  on my interactions with girls throughout my life, because I had dated  and attracted some of the most physically attractive girls I've  encountered in-person in my life.

However,  when using one app (CoffeeMeetsBagel) for several weeks, I had very  limited matches, and it made me think I was actually not very attractive  at all. However, when I used a different app (Hinge), I was getting  many more matches (all of which were initiated by me). I was  consistently getting 5-10 matches per week and just had to stop  initiating matches because it was becoming too time-consuming to try to  have any sort of conversation with any of them.

Anyway,  my question is, how can you tell that you're a physically attractive  guy based on how you're received on dating apps? My experience between  these two apps (CMB vs. Hinge) was significantly different. If I only  used CMB, then I would've thought there was something seriously wrong  with me because I was getting so few matches. Using Hinge was the  complete opposite experience.

85,rz16eu,1641652497,"Guys, don't do things to purely impress other people. Do what you love and it will make you a happier person.","I used to model my life to be attracted to woman. It worked and  I found myself instead of being the fun lovable geek that everyone liked when I was younger, I became a bit of a self absorbed cold narcissist who never smiled and didn't care much about anything except my career and getting laid.

I got cancer a few years back and it gave me perspective.  Its funny how when your life is possibly at its end, the things you really appreciate aren't what you expected. I didn't care about the girls I had been with or the job that pays me extremely well. I enjoyed the days where I laughed and had fun with friends and family. That was what mattered.

So I recovered obviously. I knew it was time for a change. Its crazy how easy it was to become my old self. Like it was always there just below the surface. I reconnected with old friends and family. Had more fun at work with my coworkers and patients. Started playing video games that I used to love, watched all the Marvel movies (they're amazing), and just really started to enjoy myself again. 

I just wrote this because the laws of attraction and all that nonsense isn't something to latch onto for dear life. Its more of something you should stumble upon like a beautiful lake on a hike or a majestic view from a mountaintop. Not something created but found.

I am happier being myself and enjoying things that I like. I hope this isn't a complete waste of space and hope you all the best.

This time we were talking about traveling and so on, and I said something along the lines, if you go there, I can come too, to which he said, maybe we could have a romantic relationship (his English isn't the best). I wasn't really sure what to answer so I just said maybe and laughed. He then asked if I am already dating someone, to which I said no. 

So the question is this something that could have a meaning, or is it something he ""just said""? This is something I am asking just out of curiosity with no serious feelings attached.
