My boyfriend and I are long distance. We met a few months ago at his university and have been talking nonstop since. He came to visit me in November at my university and we connected emotionally and physically to such a strong degree and even told I love you to each other. However, we did not establish exclusivity, labels, or even have a discussion about only seeing each other.

Near the end of the month I got drunk at a post-game event. The guy I used to talk to right before meeting my boyfriend told me he still had feelings for me. I ended up making out with him on his bed (my boyfriend and I don't have a label or established exclusivity by this time). This happened only for a few minutes at about 5am before I push him off of me and told him I don't have feelings for him anymore and that I'm talking to someone else. We then just sleep on the same bed with just his arm underneath me, almost cuddling. I got up at 7am next day to go to work.

I have felt so guilty about this since. I have neither talked to him or any other guy at all since then, nor have I gotten very drunk or placed myself in any risky settings like the post-game. Making out at the post-game was the deciding factor for me to realize that I want to commit only to my boyfriend (then just the person I was talking to), regardless of whether we decided to enter into an official relationship. However, I feel incredibly guilty about this since when my bf and I called and I told him about what happened, I omitted the information that we made out. I don't believe I lied, I just withheld information. However, it did give him the impression that I have faithful to him only since him coming to visit me.

Ever since what happened I have been 100% honest about everything and have been extremely loyal and loving, even to a fault. I would never even dream of doing anything intimate with anyone else, even before we were were officially exclusive.

I stayed at his parents' house for 2 weeks for Christmas. We built so much trust in each other. One night we were drinking (just him and I) and I got buzzed and told him that I get very nice and social when I'm drunk. He interpreted that as me saying that I get flirty when I'm drunk and got upset. He apologized, and while we talked it out it was nagging at me profusely because he was right. I wouldn't say I get flirty, but I obviously do not make the best decisions when I'm drunk, which is why I ended up with the other guy the night of the post-game. My bf also revealed his trauma from being cheated on in a previous relationship. I wanted to throw up. My bf expected exclusivity even prior to an official relationship because I made it seem like I remained entirely faithful to him. His trauma also made it hard him to trust girls romantically. I know that his trauma is not my responsibility, but I unknowingly gave him the impression that I have remained loyal to him since him visiting me.

We decided 3 days ago to make our relationship official. That was the same day we told each other explicitly ""I want to be loyal to you and grow together with you"". I am very happy. I love him. But I feel so, so guilty. I don't want to lose him or the trust he has in me. I did not consider it cheating in the moment when it happened, but I feel that way about it now. I feel awful about myself.

TL/DR: As a drunk mistake I made out with a guy while seriously talking to another guy; and even though we did not establish exclusivity, I unknowingly gave him the impression that I have been entirely faithful to him.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1144665,public,self,Talking but Not Official,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ru0cgi/talking_but_not_official/,no_ads,0.0,,,

Instead of ghosting him, I let him know this is probably not going to work out because of xyz. He said that’s fine, do you want to be friends instead. I was looking to make more friends back then so I said yes and we exchanged numbers. 

We started talking about our day and other usual things. Eventually we made plans to hang out in person as friends. We had a lot of chemistry in person. Halfway through the meet up we realized this feels a lot more like a date and acknowledged that. I usually don’t kiss on the first date but we did. It was a great first date. 

We decided to meet again for a second date and this time he mentioned some things about his ex and how he still has some of her things that he hasn’t gotten rid of yet. He pulled out his phone to show me a photo of something, and while scrolling through his album he came across his ex’es photos which he then pulled up to show me. I don’t know why but I didn’t pick up on that as a red flag. He said he found it very easy to talk to me. I think I also explained it away by thinking that may be I was not a 100% over my ex either. Although I had long gotten rid of old photos and objects from that relationship. 

After we met for a third time, he brought up his ex again. I confronted him that he is not over his ex. After thinking about it, he said he agreed. He said he wants to take things slow and feels emotionally unavailable. He offered we can stop talking then, or take a break and reassess. Initially I chose to take a break. Eventually I realized I do terribly with taking breaks. The uncertainty is too much for me and I can’t go for prolonged periods of time without seeing or spending time with the person I like. I told him that we should stop talking/texting for good because of these reasons. And he said he’s ok with that. 

About a month later, he texted me to lmk he is sick and couldn’t go to a concert we had originally planned and then cancelled when we ended things. I was very confused because the message made it seem like he forgot about the conversation where we ended things, or was using the concert as an excuse to talk to me. 

Later He texted me again to wish me a happy new year. 

The issue is that I still like him even tho I truly only met him in person three times. I went on dates with other people and I found myself thinking of him. There are quite a few red flags here.

So I went to a singles New Year’s Eve private party at a popular night club which was actually a lot of and a lot of attractive guys around my age were there who were well dressed and seemed to have things going for them so I was excited while I started building the courage to talk them. Well I had met this random guy outside of the event and we had a nice chat but I could already tell he was not my type. So I told him if he could get a ticket to the event he should go since it was literally like a mixer bash. I told him though that the tickets were sold so we parted ways.

Well that didn’t stop him cause like 30 minutes later he managed to bribe the security guard and also due to their shared military experience let him in. I thought oh ok that’s maybe he’ll be chill and he’s not bad looking and a few others girls are trying to flirt with him. Honestly I could tell by the first hour there was no chemistry tbh and any self-aware person would have noticed hey we have nothing in common moving on. I literally said hey don’t buy me a drink let’s split them. He mainly just ogled me and would say loudly that I was the most attractive and best dressed girl there. Rude, thank you for socially isolating me away from hanging out with any other females there platonically. 

He acted normal around other guys and would make friends with them quickly at the event but gave almost every other female at the event the cold shoulder and was honestly really passive-aggressive towards them. Secondly he apparently has a traumatic brain injury which sorry to hear that but I know three relatives with those and honestly they are completely different people now and are absolutely bizarre and downright unhinged so I and other relatives have to keep interactions short after trying to support them for years. 

I couldn’t tell if he had a job even though I asked multiple times, plus he lives at home with his mom which is a major turn off tbh, plus he has a young kid which he dropped on me randomly and unprompted. I guess also getting divorced. I was very polite during the whole event and didn’t flirt with others out of respect and during the NY ball dropping at midnight I gave him a New Years hug which is the ultimate friend zoning move in my opinion. I even would frequently move around to other areas to chat with others and just kept following me like a lost puppy.

Every guy that I was interested in at the party were effectively warded away by this guy due to him acting like he was my boyfriend which is weird and a massive red flag for a non-date. Literally I had attendees asking me if he was my boyfriend because he wouldn’t back up out of my space, which is super annoying. 

I even had a cute guy ask for a dance andcome up to me and say hey is he bothering you seem super uncomfortable and annoyed. I wanted to be like yes free me cute guy but I just suffered in silence with this boring, unaware, socially-inept person that I technically invited as I didn’t want to ruin their New Years and be that person at the party not having fun. Plus the guy I was with was acting massively jealous towards any guy that came within a perimeter of me and didn’t want their to be a bar fight or something. It’s sad because I like to think before his injury he was probably a decent person who respected boundaries and wasn’t so idk awkward. But idk it’s hard to tell and I truly feel sorry that in his own words that he’s not all there anymore.

Anyways I’m slowly ghosting him now, just  am trying to figure how to tell him politely I’m not interested in hanging out in any way as the way he’s acting is like I’m the best thing since slice cheese which will obviously derail any potential friendship. I wanna just tell him hey you’re nice but you’re not my type I’m super ambitious and need someone similar to me and also prefer people who don’t have so much baggage at the moment as I’m ill equipped mentally and physically to handle them.

Today, he didn’t message me so I messaged him and asked how his NYE was. We had a conversation about the night then he told me he’s been watching football all day. 

I’m just kind of annoyed because yesterday, he said he was sorry that he’s been working so much and wishes he could talk to me more. Well last night and today he was off and didn’t initiate a conversation with me. I’m just getting annoyed and it’s making me want to stop talking to him because I feel like all of the sudden he’s not interested.

However, the logical and not-crazy side of me is saying that he was just enjoying his NYE with his friends and he’s just watching sports today because that’s what he enjoys doing. The crazy side of me is thinking that he’s all of the sudden not interested and he’s talking to other girls.

I'm a 27 year old touch-starved male.

I've been analyzing my mating strategy over the past few weeks and have come to a few conclusions about what my strategy SHOULDN'T be, but I'm still stuck on what it SHOULD be.

My hypothesis about what my reproductive strategy should not include:

1. Peacocking to attract females (I'm a short man who is not a model, I don't see this as a viable option)

2. Online dating (Too much time twiddling my thumbs, not getting any matches)

3. Cold approaching females in their natural habitat - i.e. coffee shops, shopping malls, or out in the wild. (I used to see this as a viable option, but the competition is so fierce that I just get friend zoned. Usually a larger, more dominant alpha male takes the role of the sex partner in her life)

I've decided that my reproductive strategy needs to be updated , but I currently have a blank slate as to my next move. 

Any help appreciated.

Here’s the best way to ask her out on a date. This will work if you just met or if you’ve known her for awhile. Online or in person.

You might be scared or fear rejection. I get it. Liking someone and them not liking you back can be tough.

But here’s a tip…

Just do it anyway. I promise it will be worth it.

Start with mentioning something specific about her. “I like the way your smile makes me feel.” Then you introduce yourself, and take your shot with her.

“I’d really like to get to know you. When are you free to get together?”

Then you wait for her to reply. She might accept you. She might reject you. That’s just the risk you take. Either way, you took a chance for what you wanted.

The best things in life are worth the risk. You won’t know what it’s like to be with her if you don’t ask. So take your shot.

Your future self will thank you.

**First Date Tips**

These 5 tips will help you succeed on that first date. They’ll also help you on the 4th or 5th or 6th date too.

1 - Arrive 10 minutes early
Or at least be on time.

2 - Don’t Talk About Your Ex
They’re in the past. And your focus should be on the present.

3 - What She Feels, She Thinks
You want her to think good thoughts about you. So make sure she has fun and feels comfortable.

4 - Take Her To At Least 2 Places
This gives her the emotional experience of going on more than one date with you.

5 - Let Her Touch You First
When she likes you, she’ll touch you. Then you’ll know.

These 5 tips will put you in the best position to be successful on your dates.

The most important of these is what she feels (emotionally) when she’s with you, is what she feels when she thinks about you when you’re not with her.

So make sure she has a great time when you’re together. She’ll be thinking about having another great time when she sees you again.

**Getting Physical**

Ok, so the date is over. You had a great time. And you you went for the kiss.
Now, you want more. This is what has worked for me.

You say this…
“I had wonderful time with you, and I don't want this night to end...”

If she’s interested, she might say something like, “It's late and I'm tired, do you want to go back to my place for a drink?”

or

“I had a great time too. What did you have in mind?”

Then you say, “I was thinking we could hang out at my/your place.”

She will either say “Yes” or she will invite you to her place.

I try to plan first dates either closer to her place or midway between where she lives and where I live.

Now, I do have quite a bit of experience in dating, so I can usually tell when she’s interested enough in me that she wants to go back to my place or she wants me to come to her place.

This has worked for me many times. But it’s not a 100% certainty. 

But it will only work if you try.

**The Relationship**

After a few dates, and you both like each other, you’ll move into a relationship.

The mistake that way too many people make, is their girlfriend becomes the focus of their life.

That’s the wrong mindset.

A healthy relationship should add to your life, not define it. “You complete me” is just a line from a movie, written by a screenwriter.

The best way (in my experience) to have a healthy relationship is each person has their own life, and they have a life together.

This means you still spend time with your friends and participating in your hobbies and activities you had before you met your girlfriend.

And you also make time to spend with her. If you both enjoy the same activities and hobbies, then go for it. Do it together.

But don’t stop doing the things that made you the happy confident guy she initially fell for. Because when you do, he feelings for you may slip a bit.

And there you are, doing all the stuff you thought would make her happy, yet slowly pushed her (emotionally away), because you are no longer the guy she fell for.

And if for some reason the relationship ends, it means one thing. They weren’t the right one for you.

It doesn’t mean there’s anything wrong with you. It doesn’t mean you’re not good enough. It simply means they were supposed to be in your life for a reason. 

For you to learn something about, and learn some things about yourself. And when your time with them is over, you apply what you learned to your next relationship.

Remember, there is no certainty in dating and relationships. All you can do is show up and be the best version of yourself. And go have some fun. Be her best option.

I’m hoping going through it and getting support could help. 

I had been dating this man for a few weeks; we had spent a good chunk of time together, had some relatively deeper-level discussions, and were communicating in a manner in which I thought was pretty open. Wasn’t the best at texting frequently / planning, but I brushed it off because the time spent together was typically a few hours at least and full of multi-level discussions. We had also moved into a physical aspect of the relationship as well, which unfortunately was relatively irresponsible as his preference was not exactly the safest. We had done a gift exchange so needless to say, I felt pretty confident we were moving in a positive direction. 

He went home for the holidays and I took him to the airport. I had drunkenly texted asking if he missed me and he said yes, and we had some conversations about seeing each other again both before he left and when we texted. 

So imagine my surprise when I was out to dinner with my friend and see him come out of the bathroom. He looked absolutely surprised and not in the “hey I’m so happy to see you” way. The place was right down the street from where I live versus being a nearly half hour drive from where he lives, so it was somewhat normal for me to be there and not so normal for him. He stumbled over his words and was like oh hey I’m back! I was pretty upset that he came back without saying anything and then when he walked away with a “I’ll text you later”  it was to the bar where a woman was waiting for him. It had MAJOR first date vibes from body language. 

I was absolutely devastated. I recognize we were not exclusive so I couldn’t be hurt he was out with someone else; but I felt entitled to be upset that he came back without telling me and prioritized seeing someone over seeing me. 

As I left I texted him that we were done and I wished him well, to which there has been no response, which I guess feels the most surprising. I’m trying not to tangle up my self worth in this, but I can’t help but wonder why not only was I not worth his time when he got back, but also not even worth acknowledgment or an apology for how I was treated in that experience.

I (26M) have never been in a long term relationship. I’ve been grinding in my late teens and in my 20s. I invested heavily into my academics during my high school and college days. Dating was sort of out of the picture as I was studying, working full-time, and serving part time in the military. I’m 26 and single, no kids, I have a masters, bought my first home, hold a pretty stable corporate job, and have life figured out on my end.

Out of the 10 or so odd dates I’ve went on in the past year (both online dating and meeting women naturally in person), they just never seemed to work out… I’m not the one to judge and I know everyone has a troubled past and have expectations for what they want in a relationship, but it’s not quite like the ones I’ve encountered on my dates (feel free to dm me if you’d like to know the specifics). I do feel ready to settle down, give my undivided attention to a potential partner, be in a long term relationship, get married, have kids, the whole spiel, but after one failed date to another, it’s back to square one. I feel really lost because I’m putting in so much time, money, and effort and it literally gets me nowhere.

We met on a dating app. We're both in our late 20s. Things are going good - overall we connect very well (physically, emotionally and intellectually)

One odd thing is that we still haven't talked about what we are or what we want from this. I want to talk to him but am a bit shy so was hoping he'd take the first step. But he also has a shy personality so this might be holding him back.

I'm planning to talk to him soon but wanted to get feedback on what his intentions might be (so that I can prepare myself). Obviously I know that I can only get a clear answer when I talk to him but just want to get your opinions beforehand on whether he wants a relationship or not.

*Some good things:*

* We regularly see each other (usually once a week but sometimes twice)
* We regularly text each other (usually everyday - sometimes shorter conversations like 2-3 msgs but sometimes longer conversations)
* When we see each other, we spend the night together and the most of next day too
* He introduced me to his friends - the suggestion came from him. I met almost all of his close friends now
* He met some of my friends (he wanted to and was very enthusiastic about it)
* He usually invites me to his friend's meet-ups &amp; parties (even though I don't know his friends that well)
* We do different activities together (sometimes stay in and laze around, go out to the movies, go to a bar etc)
* He got me gift for Christmas even though we never talked about it. It was a small but thoughtful gift.
* He invited me to his friend's NYE party (I didn't go because I already had plans)
* He hasn't updated his dating profile since we met (and there are some outdated information)


&amp;#x200B;

*Some (potentially) bad things:*

* He didn't bring up exclusivity. I didn't either (despite the fact that I stopped seeing other people a month into dating him)
* We didn't have the 'relationship' or 'gf/bf' talk yet despite seeing each other for 4 months (I want to date him officially but am shy so hopes he'd bring it up)
* He takes a long time to respond to my messages sometimes (between 4-10 hours) despite him messaging me first. This doesn't happen that often (maybe once a week)
* When he introduced me to some of his friends, he introduced me as ""my friend \_\_"". Not to all of his friends but to some people. But then he'd hold my hand throughout the night and kiss me in front of them.
* We only see each other once a week. There were times where we saw each other more than once but this is not the norm. Idk if this is normal after 4 months or if it's a bad sign he doesn't wanna see me more.
* He's not as affectionate as much as me. He holds my hand in public and kisses me at times. But he doesn't like to kiss that much or for a long time. On the other hand, he really loves to cuddle (even when were sleeping)

Based on this, what are your thoughts? Do you think he potentially wants something serious (like a relationship) or is he after something casual?

It was the summer of the of 2017 I remember I was 19 at the time I had this beautiful girlfriend, Deborah (19), I met her back when I was poor I rented this craphole duplex in one of the worst streets of my town her father was the owner of the duplex and from time to time her daughter passed by, Once she actually stopped and said hi to me obviously me being the naive fool I was said also hi already imagining the day she was gonna be my girlfriend, Anyways we talked for a while and she was so nice to me she even gave me a few dollars to get through the day but she had to go because of course her father was always around.

Suddenly one day she actually popped in my apartment wearing a dress and makeup of course I was on my pajamas because it was a Friday but nonetheless she invited me to go out to eat I quickly got dressed with the best clothes I had and went with her to a fancy restaurant she said she actually never had someone treat her that way even though I did nothing to help but anyway she opened up and told me that her parents were divorced and her dad was always abusive to her and that I actually was the only one that heard her problems and that I was always one of the nice guys that would be there for her I felt so good after hearing that I actually asked her out being the fool I was and she said of course yes.

But as always there is a catch in everything and she actually lied to me because after a few months of dating school started and I went to my classes but one day i saw her hanging around with the school jock I blew it off thinking they were friends but I was so wrong so wrong I got to my house and open snap chat and I saw that her location was with that prick I quickly messaged her but she didn’t answer, so me being the a dumb teen I drove to her location worried that, that son of a gun was doing something horrible to her I got there and my eyes couldn’t believe it she was giving a blowjob to 3 dudes from the school it was worse than I thought I was so amazed and being the sick teen I was I jerked off at my car because it was still pretty hot.

The next day I quickly broke up with her with some lame excuse she said I was always just a toy she liked to play with and that she was gonna tell her dad I was abusive, to my surprise her dad showed up to the duplex about 1 hour late I was so scared he was about to shoot me or something because he as a good Texan dad had a shotgun lying around his house, anyway he opens the door and I come to him begging him that he doesn’t kick me or shoot me, but instead he lifts me up and says he hates her daughter and that I was one of the most supportive people he ever met that after his wife passed away he was so lonely and that I could be his new boyfriend since he got mixed feeling when he lost her woman, I was surprised at this revelation but to be honest I also been kind of a femboy my entire life and I wouldn’t mind a big guy pushing me around being the little boy I was.

After a week we started going out and he was the nicest guy ever I mean he even invited me to live at his house which I happily agreed but under one condition I had to dress and act as a woman and I did not had a problem with that I could finally be myself and be the housewife I always wanted to be, now I know what you are thinking what happened to his daughter well he actually kicked her out of the house and told her to grow out of her parents’ house she was forced to live on that craphole duplex old of mine and I got to live on her house so it was a complete checkmate for me, but as the saying says all good things must come to an end and when the school year ended I sadly had to move out because I wanted to have a life of my own.

Eventually my friend was ready to go home but both me and Steve stayed and had another drink and talked for a while.

I am 22f and been dating for a while now, mainly getting to know new people after moving and seeing where things take us.

I got to know two people at the same time via online dating. Texted with both of them a bit, decided to meet up/ play games, get to know each other and such. And both of them are just great. Usually after a few dates I certainly know whether or not I see a future there romantically and I communicate that but in this case I really developed strong feelings for both of them before I noticed what was happening.
I spoke with both of them about the situation and both of them understand, want to give me time but definitely see themselves with me longterm.
Our connections are different as can be, with one of them it's more the emotional connection, we get each other, don't run out of things to do, makes me feel emotionally save and the physical part is okay enough, I do feel a bit icky about it sometimes, I hate that word but it is how it is. It's definitely something easy to look over.
With the other one it's more the very physical connection. Can't keep our hands off each other, best sex I have ever had and we get along very well too of course, but we do not get each other emotionally as much. He says he is sure he loves me and wants to spend the rest of his life making me happy, but with the fact that I can't speak to him about what's really on my mind as much, I fear this would not end up being a healthy relationship. Yet I have never felt so drawn to someone in my life before.

So my head is basicly saying, be smart and go with the guy you can talk to, it's healthier long-term.
My heart is split as I care a lot about both of them and don't wanna hurt either, but I know I gotta, otherwise I will just hurt everyone.
Physically I want to be with the guy I feel more drawn to. My head tells me it's just hormons, which it probably is, but damn that guy loves me a lot. It would be much less wise to go for him but I can't stand the thought of never seeing him again either. With him it's just a feeling, but it won't go away.

So yeah, I am exhausted as I have been thinking about this back and forth for 2+ weeks now and I think my head is gonna explode.

I know there's a thousand ways to go about it so hopefully I'll get some perspective. 

I have a fairly extreme PTSD, and I wanted to ask you guys some questions as to how you would go about online dating or dating in general with it. I'm not sure of how to convey the immensity of it and what it all means. I do believe context really matters for me here, but skip the next paragraph if you don't want to hear a bit of my story. 

I was kidnapped and kept in a small bedroom in almost complete isolation for 11 years by my mother until she got in a car accident, lost all memory of me, and at 14 me and my uncle won custody of her in court and I pulled life support. I managed to learn how to socialize and stuff, and I met a beautiful girl and we dated for 3 years. But she burned alive in a car accident... The night my mom got in her wreck I called her phone 10 times and someone answered, gave the phone to my mom's bf and this dude put me in the car and took me to the wreck, watched her get pulled out and all. With my gf's wreck, I didn't hear from her and told myself a thousand times don't be that dude that calls her over and over and over, and I convinced myself everything was fine and went to sleep. Woke up to missed calls, social media posts, all that, and she was gone.

I have been in therapy for a long time, but my questions aren't about how to deal with all of that, I have my methods. How would you want to be told that the person you're talking to has PTSD? If the person was otherwise normal seeming, how could you or I better bridge the gap between normalcy and the extra work involved when PTSD becomes a factor? With online dating, should a casual mention to PTSD be in my profile or does it not do any justice to just how casual it isn't and just end up harming my chances?  


Obviously the things I went through have really made it difficult. I want people to understand what it all means but I want to do it the best way so that people are the most receptive. If someone I care about is out drinking or something and I don't hear from them for a few hours I will go into a deep PTSD flashback to both my mom and my gf and it's not good at all. I was blessed to be smart enough to figure out my way out of all that fog but it's a really painful thing and I have to ask my partner to go above and beyond as far as reassurance and trust goes. Too many times it has come off as me being possessive or overbearing, and I have my end of that to really pay attention to of course, but it's all just a very painful ordeal trying to explain it in the moment. I want to make it a priority first and foremost but just need advice on how to go about doing it. So I guess the simple question is this:   


If you were dating someone and they had extreme PTSD, how would you want to learn about it?

It's been this pretty insane whirlwind, we clicked on an amazing level, we both make each other smile and feel good throughout the day with our texts, video calls etc. The past week it got very, very flirty and raunchy. No pictures being exchanged but some sexting. I find her incredibly attractive, and she says the same about me. 
 
I was really thinking, might she be the one? Obviously we haven't met yet, I need to keep my feelings in check but I'm finding it next to impossible to do so with her.

But I found out yesterday that all throughout, she had a FWB on the side, who happens to be a guy she dated very briefly and decided they weren't a good fit for each other. She hangs out with him, she's even at his house right now. She said, I quote ""it doesn't feel right because of you"" when I asked her about this arrangement she has. I asked her, and the last time thry had sex was 2 weeks ago. She says he tried last night and she turned him down because of me, but I am really not sure if I believe her.

I know, there has not been any exclusivity yet. We haven't even met yet. I have no right to tell her what she does with her social circle. And yet, I just cannot look at her in the same way anymore. I feel like the spark is gone. She is over there fucking this guy, while we have both been sending very romantic texts, calls, gestures etc. We call each other pet names, we frequently talk about how badly we want to just be with each other, we can't wait until next time to talk, listen to music together online etc.

I really feel like when things took this turn, she should have mentioned this to me. I feel like she has been hiding it from me. I told her last night, if she continues seeing this guy for sex, I cannot continue the romantic talk with her. Is that petty, jealous of me? Am I being manipulative? It's just how I feel about this.

We’re the kind of couple that when things are good they are AMAZING (to the point where we are sure we are the only ones for each other, his fam loves me, we are absolutely comfortable with each other and can talk about anything and everything, we also live tog and after so many relationship mishaps and tindering around, we both feel it’s difficult to come across something like this again) but when we fight and things are bad, they are explosive to the point where we end up breaking up every now and then and getting back tog right after. I know that this is somewhat of a toxic relationship but I’m just lost on how to go on from here regarding it. 

Most of the times we fight and break up, it’s because he messes up a lot. Recently his female coworker has been texting him a lot. Like 24/7 and she also sends him selfies and drunk videos of herself. When I asked him calmly that I am not comfortable with this and if he could limit this interaction, at that point he said he would. But a few days later I found he had in fact done nothing about it. When I asked him why he didn’t respect the boundaries we set, he got extremely defensive and started saying he’s not even allowed to talk to females anymore, and he is not capable of cutting anyone off and that I’m being insecure bc I think she’s more attractive than me (wtf lol, he literally has other female friends that I’m extremely chill with, it’s just this one bc the girl seems problematic). The girl also knows he’s in a relationship cuz we are very public on his insta but still DMs him everyday no matter how much he doesn’t initiate convos. Other times we’ve broken up, he called me the clingiest girl he’s dated in two of our fights (just bc I thought he wasn’t being affectionate enough). In all these instances, I was extremely hurt cuz he doesn’t respect me and discredits all the love I’ve given to him for so many months and he’s also made me cry numerous times because of his defensive and manipulative behaviour.
But everytime I try breaking up with him, he gets very upset and he says he won’t hurt me anymore, he didn’t mean the words he said and he was just angry (for calling me insecure and clingy) and not to give up on us. When he does accept the break up, whenever he tries to leave our place, I get very emotional about all our memories and thinking about the things we’ve been through and end up taking back the break up. A lot of times also when we are about to break up, he just asks for cuddles and we end up sleeping with each other and getting back together again. 

I feel like I’m so trapped and it’s just such a toxic and codependent relationship but at the same time when things are good, they are so f*ckinf good he feels like my soulmate. 

If you’ve made it this far, thanks for reading.

The start of 2022 has inspired me (M24) to start a new girlfriend hunt. I made a promise to myself I would have a gf by April, and damnit I intend to live up to that promise. That being said, I’m unsure as to how exactly I should court these women. I work alot so I don’t have much time to meet girls. I’ve tried talking to the girls I work with but they all have “boyfriends” lot aren’t looking for a relationship or “don’t see me in that-kind-of-way” or whatever. I’ve been banned from both tinder and bumble (two apps which, truthfully, don’t feature many good women (yet they’re still so fucking picky and demanding)). Additionally, whenever I try something new it ends I’m failure. 

A prime example would be my dating card which I’d hand to women I found attractive enough to potentially date. Furthermore, I’ve also tried to go to locations where I know women my age will congregate (such as Hollister or Wendy’s) and began talking into my phone about my job/career at a high enough volume where they could hear me, which would cause them to approach me and ask me what my job is because I know girls like young, intelligent working-professionals. This has, however, not worked thus far, with the only people conversing with me through this method being the management of these establishments (often old and not my type) telling me that I’m being too loud and to keep it down or take the call outside. 

At this point, I’m at a loss. What are some novel ways to initiate contact with a girl and get to know her so we could start dating? Any and all advice would be appreciated.

I understand that when looking for a partner it is essential to know what one is looking for. Furthermore, it is not enough for one to simply write these requirements down and visualise it. This is because a fair number of people need to go through several committed relationships to understand, see and experience what qualities constitute a solid partner.

I matched with this girl on Bumble about a month ago. I really liked her profile (she mentioned van life which is *rare* where I live) and we had a nice chat. Shared a few interests, good banter. I liked her so much I decided to invite her to a fancy culinary event (I know, I know...) so bought the tickets, got a new outfit (first fancy event I went to since I moved here) and waited for the day to come. She was very enthusiastic about it as well.

On the day of I get *really* sick. Like I could barely stand straight and talk kind of sick. It wasn't Covid so I decided to power through it with some aspirin. Keep in mind the tickets were $120 each (I know, I know...sigh) and non refundable.

So I get to the venue, she gets there too and I immediately tell her I was feeling super sick and I wasn't sure if it was just some allergy or something else. Sill we hit it off, we laugh, we go around these restaurants, eat some food, have drinks, talk about life, family, that we're both looking for a relationship etc. Between tastings she asks me to go to a pharmacy nearby because I was clearly not well. I get something for my sinuses and the evening goes on. At end of the event we decide to go to a bar nearby but the music is way too loud and at this point I'm beat. So I ask her if she'd like go to my place and she agrees.

We get to my place, have a drink, I get some rest while I let her play with my VR headset (another reason why I liked her, we're both nerds but you wouldn't tell) after which we kiss and end up fooling around. I go down on her, she comes, she goes down on me, I come (we tried having sex but I was feeling too bad) and we sleep.

Next morning I go down on her again, she comes, she goes down on me and with every ounce of strength I could gather I manage to put on a condom and we have sex for like 5 minutes. I tell her I'm sorry but I'm still too sick to do anything ""active"". So we get dressed and go for breakfast, we keep chatting and laughing and by lunch time she leaves.

She texts me an hour later thanking me, saying she had a really good time. I tell her we should go out again and she enthusiastically replies we should and suggests to go to a cyber cafe (we were talking about visiting one together earlier in the date).

In the following days I try arranging a date but she doesn't reply. At some point her contact shows up as ""disabled"" so I text her on another app asking if she had blocked me and she says no, she had just deleted that particular app (who does that??) and the proceeds telling me she didn't feel a connection but she'd be open to stay friends. I agree but change my mind a day after because, again, I really liked her and damn, I was sick! So I ask her to meet up again but she refuses.

My last message is a (admittedly) desperate attempt at getting some closures, asking her what exactly she didn't like about me. Because in my mind a person doesn't sleep with someone twice after an allegedly ""great"" date, have breakfast together, agrees on meeting again just to change their mind a couple of days later. Something must have happened, I just want to know what.

She met someone else? I'd like to know. She thinks I'm too small? I don't care, I'd like to know. She doesn't like my nose? Cool, just tell me. From her behavior it's clear something's going on in her life but it's still no excuse. It may seem stupid but this is what most men want: closure. Sure, some of them will keep spamming you and being creeps but they will do it regardless. Most of us just want to be able to have a rational explanation to feed our brains 😂

Anyway I obviously stopped texting her, deleted her number, unmatched and all but this still bugs me and I'm hoping some of you can give me perspective on this.

He repeatedly told me he’d love to continue seeing me and also introduced me to a bunch of his friends.

Yesterday while coming back from an overnight party , his friend suggested that I come over to their place for more drinks. But I knew he wasn’t keen about this because of their other housemate.

He flips when we leave the driveway saying how neither of us thanked him for the food and I go to hold his hand to thank him but he pushes it away saying he doesn’t need my thanks. At this point I’m taken aback and confused . We reach my place I say bye to his friend and give him a kiss goodbye . 
After reaching my apartment I realise he’s left his snack in my bag. I hadn’t seen my phone for about ten mins and then I see that he’s left me miscalls and a text saying I’ve got his snack. I apologise and he sees it but no response. I let him cool down and then send him a long text at night saying how I’m sorry and I wish he would just tell me why he’s so mad .

I feel really hurt and confused as to why he’s decided to not contact me. I want to reach out again but don’t know if it will help.

But I hope that some of the things I say here resonate with others who may be sharing a similar experience. Wall of text incoming.

For a bit of context, I've been a ""late bloomer"" in just about every facet of my life. I didn't get my license until I was 20. I didn't really start drinking and partying until I was in my mid 20s, and I didn't lose my virginity until about 6 months ago, which is what spurred this whole journey I've been on.

When I did lose my virginity, it was a total happenstance thing, and was a one night stand with someone who I never saw again. That fucked me up. That's not the way I wanted it to go. So it was then that I decided it was time to really start trying to put myself out there and try to find something meaningful.

I was overweight, so I started going for hour long walks every day. And I mean every day. No matter how rough work was, how late I got home from hanging with my friends. I made sure to get that walk in no matter what. I also completely changed my diet. I found low calorie things that were easy to make and that I enjoyed. I'll still indulge here and there, but it's way less frequently than it was previously. I've lost about 30lbs, and there's still more work to be done, but I feel a hell of a lot better, and I know I look better too. That was step one.  


From there, I started to make a more concerted effort to just talk to people. Talk with people at work who I normally wouldn't talk to. Especially the females. Not that I'm trying to date them, they're all either married or in committed relationships, so that's a no go. But I wanted to become more confident in talking, and not just talking, but being comfortable with who I am and not putting on some mask with the hopes of impressing anyone. I just started being myself, and started conversations about whatever seemed good to talk about at any given time.

That's when I started actually trying to date. I made a profile on just about every app on the planet, taking as good of photos as I could, and I started going out more. Instead of picking up groceries and having employees load them in my car, I started actually going into the store. If I wanna pick up a book, don't order online, actually go to the book store. Don't drink alone at home, if I wanna drink, go to the bar. Any opportunity I could find to just go out, I would do it. Keeping an eye out for anyone who I would wanna talk to and see what happens. Now I'm much better at just striking up a conversation, and I'm able to keep it flowing pretty naturally without much effort. I just say what comes to mind. The key here, I think, is not saying anything I don't think is true. Tell the truth, and be honest in everything I say. Don't make shit up to sound ""cool"", and don't agree with everything someone else says because I'm afraid the disagreement will start an argument. Instead, let the disagreement turn into a discussion, and try to find a middle ground where you can see each others point. Be as authentic as you can be.

Now, I've matched with two girls over this last week. One, I've been out with already and it went really well. No awkward silences, interesting conversation throughout, actually getting into some deep topics. It was just nice. We ended the date agreeing that we want to see each other again, and that was that. Now, even if I DON'T ever see this girl again, I'm ok with that. I know that I put the best version of myself out there, and I have zero regrets about what I said or did. So if it's not meant to be, then I know it's not because I did something ""wrong"", it's just because for whatever reason it just didn't work out. The other girl I'm supposed to meet with tomorrow, so we'll see how that goes.  


It's taken 6 months of work, real work, to get to this stage where I'm not overwhelmed by insecurities. They're still there, don't get me wrong, but I'm finally starting to feel like I can overcome them. I know for some, dating and whatnot comes really naturally, but for some of us it's not so easy. I think it's important to really analyze what's holding you back, and figure out what you need to do to tackle those issues. If you can do that, chances are you'll start to see some progress.

This was a long post, I know. But I felt compelled it get it out there.

TL;DR

I guess what I'm trying to say, is dating can be hard. Knowing what to do can be hard. But if you take the time to really look at yourself and confront your flaws, progress can be made.

Everytime I like a girl fantasize about living together and all have a lot of feeling for her I just have the negative side of relationships in my head and I would say to myself it's too early why do you wanna commit now while I'm not even ready nor the girl you like is. I mean why would I just go out with a girl when I know I'm still kot prepared I don't have enough money to rake her out I don't have enough time I don't have that much experience on how to take care of her ect.. and I'm pretty sure it's the same thing for her too no? I mean my friends (both females and males) tends to tell me they made mistakes the weren't ready and they were just reckless why not just work on yourself until time comes why push yourself into something that may just hurt you?

I try dating apps but no one matches , and when they do they basically ask me to pay. How does someone whos hedious get a girlfriend. No one shows any signs of interest in me.

Ive had a relationship but it was long distance from a girl off a game i played. She broke up with me because of her life burdens. She said i looked good but when i post online my responses are always the opposite.

Any advice?

He was an old hookup of mine and we reconnected recently. 

I went over to his place a few weeks ago, not intending to have sex but he was just so wonderful to me. We were cuddling and he was so kind and gentle and it just felt right so we went all the way.

Fast forward to today, I asked him this morning if he was free tonight and he said he will be free around 9 or 10pm cos he has a family dinner. Said he would keep me updated. So I'm waiting around, 830 comes and I haven't gotten any updates and I message him asking if it's still happening. He said: ""sorry hun provably not tonight, I've had a bad headache all day and going to dads definitely didn't help. I'm gonna get home and take some panadol, hope that's okay""

I told him it was a bit shit of him to let me know so last minute, abd that even if its a casual thing it's just a little disrespectful. He doesn't seem to understand at all why im upset. He said it really isn't disresptcgul since he said he would let me know, and that it's not a big deal. Now my last message has been left on delivered.

Do I even bother with this guy? I'm so upset right now and he doesn't seem to care. Is it possible that he's having a moment of selfishness and to give him a second chance? Cos right now all I wanna do is block him.
