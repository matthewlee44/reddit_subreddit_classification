Recently, my live-in boyfriend of 2.5 years and I broke up. This was not my first long term relationship, but definitely my healthiest and “most adult.” We are in our 30’s, began dating when I was 29, and we were both atleast at one point, talking about serious goals for the future—buying a home and where to settle, marriage, children, etc. After we broke up, as amicably as two people who really are sad that it is ending can be, I realized I learned a lot from this relationship—what worked and didn’t—that I hope to bring into my future relationships in order to rightfully assess whether it has long term capability or not, and if not, to end it before we become too emotionally invested or in financial, legal way intertwined. If you want a TL;DR it is BOUNDARIES, COMMUNICATION, HONESTY. And of course, SEX. And of course--healthy relationships require WORK, and it is better to be alone than to be in a bad one.

Before we begin, the assumption here is you are starting to see people and BOTH are looking for long term exclusivity, and that both partners WANT to be good partners to each other. My ex and I do not hate each other, it was not overtly toxic. In fact, HAD it been blatantly bad, I think we would have been able to move on sooner. But instead, we enjoyed each other’s company, were compatible in many ways, I just had a GUT FEELING things were off. I didn’t trust him as much as I felt I should be able to. Were there issues with trust early on in the relationship, yes. But did he give me reasons on a regular basis not to trust him, no. I think my biggest issue leading to the separation was that I did not believe our future goals were aligned, but he was too afraid of it ending to tell me. Here is what I know now, and wish I knew then.

- The reason couples’ therapy has a reputation for not working is because often people show up too late. It can be a place to foster trust, understanding, and support so that if and when a difficult time occurs, you already have the tools to communicate. Therapy only works if you want it to. If one person is already mentally “checked out” of the relationship, there is nothing the other partner or therapist can do to earnestly repair it. COUPLES OFTEN GO TO COUPLES’ THERAPY TOO LATE.

- Just because your partner is not abusing you doesn’t mean they are “the one.” It’s okay to leave without someone having to be wrong or feel wronged. You never need a reason beyond “this isn’t working out for me.”

- Trust your gut—if someone tells the truth, believe them.
“I only said that because you caught me off guard. It’s not how I really feel.” When someone tells you something and then claims it’s not true BASED ON YOUR REACTION, something is wrong. There is a difference between “we are incompatible on this issue, and we will talk about how to compromise” versus “I didn’t mean ‘I don’t think making out is cheating,’ when I said ‘I don’t think making out is cheating!’ You caught me off guard!” 

- If someone’s words and actions do not match, acknowledge it and talk about it. It could be a lack of awareness, it could be more.

- Never move in with a partner, get a pet together, or make a joint financial obligation w/out a breakup plan for who moves out, who takes the animal, what happens with the expensive object/ investment.

- Before moving in, or shortly after moving in, have a plan to discuss who will be responsible for what household duties. Many relationships end or are complicated by roommate issues. If your partner has other commitments (Work, School, kids, etc) and you also expect them to carry the brunt of the household chores—especially if the partner is a cis/ traditional woman—do not be surprised if she doesn’t want sex when you get in bed to sleep. Why do I say this? Because we as women are overly aware of societal stereotypes that cleaning is “expected” of the woman, its gonna hit a sensitive spot in us, especially if we expect you to carry your share and you're not. Having to mother my partner did not make me desire sex after cleaning up our joint living space, go figure. However, COMMUNICATE. BE WILLING TO COMPROMISE. If one partner cconstantly cleans because the other partner doesn’t, that doesn’t mean the cleaning partner is happy with this arrangement, it just means they see it as a task that needs to be accomplished. But you wont know how your partner feels if you don’t ask them. Housecleaning is a stupid hill to die on, and some people are anal clean freaks, others couldn’t care less. So if budget permits, hire a cleaner. If it doesn’t, talk out what each partner is willing to contribute.

MORE ON BOUNDARIES:

- Do not wait for someone else to enforce your boundaries. They won’t.

- People LIKE people with boundaries. People respect people with firm boundaries. And if they don’t, RED FLAG. People with good, clear boundaries are easier to get along with and live with as you know exactly where they stand, what they need or expect from you, and when to offer your support. You get to decide if you are comfortable with those boundaries they set, and they you. 

- You are not an asshole for having firm boundaries, but you can very quickly become an asshole if you have no boundaries or flimsy ones.

- In order to keep your boundaries strong, you need to enforce and COMMUNICATE THEM!!!

MORE ON COMMUNICATION:

- What you each want and need WILL CHANGE

- Communication in the beginning is pivotal for the relationship in how it occurs—is it face to face, over the phone, over text? If the majority of major conversations (good and bad) take place over a format like text, it will be difficult to keep those conversations going in person, and will no longer be useful once you are living together/ together all the time. Try not to rely on one method—especially text—it will make bonding and communicating harder later on.

- The level of communication you have at the beginning WILL taper off. Getting to know someone/ getting comfortable is normal, but we often tend to start assuming what our partner wants or needs instead of asking.

- You will NEED to make time and space for communication as the relationship progresses and life gets busy.

- It is easy to assume that you will communicate more out of proximity to one another when living together, but opposite is often the case.
         One trick is setting a phone alarm for a time of day/ night to come together and talk about your day, your worries, your accomplishments, etc and just check in. My Ex and I started doing this and our relationship became so much closer… we found we no longer really needed the alarm because we were checking in with each other about real stuff throughout the day. The reality is one of the reasons our relationship ended was because we got very good at communicating—to the point where we realized we were unable to meet each others’ needs. The needs were stated and examined, and in all fairness to each other, we admitted “I am not able or willing to meet that need, and if you need it met, someone else will have to meet it.” YES, THIS IS SAD, BUT SO IS STAYING IN AN INCOMPATIBLE SITUATION. 

- In your late twenties or early thirties, being upfront about what you want for your future shouldn't be an optional kindness. It is a necessity. Some people want kids and see the clock ticking, some want a tubal litigation just to be sure they don’t. These things NEED and DESERVE to be talked about. If you definitely do not want kids and your partner definitely does, cut them free. Allow them the opportunity to find a partner who has the same values. STAYING AND LYING IS NOT FAIR. Yes it is sad when it seems you are so compatible on so many other things, but be fair to the person your with, be HONEST about what you can and cannot give them. COMPROMISE IS POSSIBLE. Some people aren’t sure if they want kids, or maybe just want one, while their partner prefers the idea of big family—these points of incompatibility can be compromised on if both partners are willing. Or, both partners can make the decision to make no decision at all, keep dating, and re-visit the conversation in the future. That is totally fair because YOU ARE ON THE SAME PAGE.

- If the other person allows you to talk a lot but does not feel the need to chime in, that is all they are doing—being silent. DO NOT MISTAKE THIS FOR AGREEING WITH YOU.
	My ex-partner is “quiet bordering on shy” and when we first started dating, I actually found it very sweet. I was attracted to the fact that he was private in regards to others, but let me in. As time went on, I realized I had mistaken his quiet, laidback demeanor for agreeing with me on any number of topics. 

- Being “right” does not matter when communicating; both people feeling heard does. Our communication patterns are a clusterfuck of our upbringing, past relationships, social relationships, personal insight, and emotional regulation. Just because your family communicated by yelling, does not mean it is an appropriate way to communicate your needs to your partner.

- People do NOT respond well to anger, blame, criticism. They understandably become defensive, emotional, or shut down when feeling berated. In this state, people will not hear your needs, they will not want to help you, they will want you to stop yelling at them. You are allowed to say “this issue is really bugging me and I’m feeling emotionally charged” when you attempt to discuss it together and notice your getting worked up. But if you attack them, do not be surprised if they do not stick around to find out what they can do to help you.

More About Honesty During Communication

- What kinds of things do you tend to keep secret or lie about? It’s ok, we all on occasion have the impulse to be dishonest, but you wont be able to catch yourself before the lie unless you know why you do it. Do you lie to avoid taking responsibility/ getting in trouble? Do you lie out of guilt and shame? Do you lie for attention/ validation? Do you lie for personal gain? Do you lie to avoid conflict? These reasons matter in a relationship. Own it and admit to your partner you feel the urge to lie when faced with what it does or doesn’t bring up for you. Obviously try not to lie.

- Are you the brutally honest type? Well fucking stop. You aren’t helping them, you aren’t helping you, you are putting up walls between you and your partner. Sometimes bluntness is necessary, and for the greater good can be a useful tool. Being an asshole because you enjoy being right or cutting others down and then saying, “But it’s the truth.” Is such a dick move. It does not make others see you as a safe person to confide in when they think you will come at them with judgement. In a relationship your ""Brutal Honesty"" can be absolutely devastating to your partner. You can be gentle, and still be honest.

More About Honesty

If you need to lie about a major aspect of your relationship, you shouldn’t be in it for your own safety and health. It is normal to desire privacy in your relationship, and no, you don’t HAVE to tell your nosy Aunt that you and your partner met online, see boundaries above for more. However, if this person is married, is your boss, is significantly older than you—IF THEY ARE COMMITTED TO SOMEONE ELSE OR IN A POSITION OF POWER OVER YOU AND/OR THE RELATIONSHIP BEING DISCOVERED WOULD HAVE RAMIFICATIONS FOR THOSE INVOVLED—IT IS NOT STARTING IN A PLACE OF TRUST. Morelikely, in a place of ABUSED TRUST. While there are the odd success stories, a true sense of trust and equal partnership is incredibly difficult to develop under these circumstances.

If your current partner was willing to cheat on their partner to be with you, that does not necessarily mean they will cheat on you. BUT IT DOES INDICATE they have a history of not adequately communicating their needs in a relationship and instead checking out. If your partner is willing to live a double life to be with you, they are likely willing to lie to you about other things in the relationship—especially to avoid conflict.

If a partner is willing to risk their career in order to date you, it hints at a lack of stability in their life overall. Do they have a financial plan in place if they are fired? Experience in a different field? Upon losing everything, will they see you as the place to put the blame for their “bad luck?"" Will they become needy/ over-reliant on you?

If you are the partner who stands at risk of losing your marriage at fault or losing your career, why is chasing this emotional rush so addictive/ satisfying? What is it you are missing that you are trying to replace within you? Are you really in a place to try to lay down a foundation for a healthy relationship based on trust and mutual respect?

If there is a severe power imbalance and you have less power but are still tempted…ask yourself what this person really wants from a partner they innately have a level of control over. What do you stand to gain or lose? IS THIS SAFE FOR YOU?

More About Sex:

Sex is a form of bonding and communication.

Trust, boundaries, and honest communication are essential for both parties to feel truly satisfied in the sexual aspect of their relationship. Some partners do not see sex as a huge part of their overall bond with their partners, while others see it as essential. Communicate. If you don’t really care about being satisfied in bed, or are afraid to communicate, and choose instead to remain unsatisfied and fake orgasms, that’s a choice you’re making. And if your partner were to discover this, they may, rightfully so, feel betrayed and devastated. 

If you or your partner is unwilling or feels unable to have open communication about your sex life (how it happens, when it happens, will we use protection?) then THAT PERSON SHOULD NOT BE HAVING SEX. PLAIN AND SIMPLE. IF YOU HAVE SEXUAL HANG-UPS THAT PREVENT YOU FROM BEING ABLE TO TALK ABOUT SAFE SEX PRACTICES, YOU ARE PUTTING YOUR HEALTH AND WELLBEING AND YOUR PARTNER'S HEALTH AND WELL BEING AT RISK.

Sex is a lot more enjoyable when both parties are enthusiastic about it and communicate their desires.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1157974,public,self,Everything I wish I knew in the First Few Years of a Committed Long Term Relationship,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/snq6c7/everything_i_wish_i_knew_in_the_first_few_years/,no_ads,0.0,,,

In summation I have been talking so someone I met on Reddit for 2 and a half months. We connected through a thread talking about similar interests, carrying the conversation to chat and have literally chatted every day since (moving from reddit to Discord and Snapchat). While talking I started to notice I really liked he person he was presenting and we certainly flirted a lot and then we both confessed that we like each other. 

But……… in the initial days of talking I asked him some of his red flags and one of them was that he has commitment issues. 

When we started talking he was prepping for a deployment and left at the beginning of Jan. He still has kept in contact every day, takes time to say good morning and good night. We have sexted and agreed that when he gets back we would like to meet in person and that if we start a sexual relationship that we would exclusively only see each other……….But he words things weird. He told me he doesn’t want to sleep with anyone because he doesn’t plan on sleeping with anyone else, and doesn’t want an std (I called him out on this, and he apologized for the wording). The conversations aren’t just sexual he calls me pet names and says thing like he wants to hold me and cuddle, just today he told me I’m his choice. He asks about my day and acts like a bf through communication. 

My ex husband wants to get back together and in efforts to set a better boundary I told my ex I am talking to someone. I let Mr. Reddit know that FYI my ex hubby asked if I’m seeing someone and I told him my response. He responded with “that’s fine I get it :p”.  

I get the feeling I’m a placeholder gf or idk……. But then again 7 months seems like a lot of communication work to sleep with someone.

I decided to get on BLK app, it’s supposed to connect you with black singles in the area, or right outside the area. Now, before I joined the military I already had experience dating in the black community so I already knew what to expect, a lot of black women who date black guys that run the streets, which is always the majority, but I’m already familiar with that.

I always try to keep my career a secret at first cause, I’ve been targeted before by women who don’t have my best interest in mind, along with s healthy number of kids that aren’t mine as well. I finally got some pretty promising matches, ranging from real estate agents to flight attendants, to registered nurses. Things were looking good, until I saw that their locations were hundreds of miles away. The girls with bloodshot eyes blowing weed smoke in the camera saying they only f**k with real n****s, right down the street.

I said screw it, and paid the 20. I started going through my likes, and guess what, they’re so far away I’m not even gonna consider them as an option, and these were cute women with careers, but just way too far.

We've been seeing each other about 6 months and both feel pretty strongly about each other.

For Christmas I got her one of those big 10 by 10 blankets because she loves cuddling and is always cold. She loved the gift when i gave it to her. 


Now, she has a roommate in her house. Not because she needs the money, as the roommate doesn't pay rent or anything. The roomie is a recovering drug addict. But of course she has no money or anything so this girl took her in ""temporarily"".

Of course it's now been over a year with no end in sight as the roomie still has no money or prospects and I doubt this girl will put her out with nowhere to go. 

Anyways, the roomie has a dog. Sweet enough but chews things up all the time and such. 

Well the girl I'm dating put the blanket in her room to keep the dog from chewing it. She always keeps her door shut. 

The roomie though, of course, never shuts the door and doesn't have the sense to pay attention to such things despite the girl telling her repeatedly to keep the door shut to keep the dog out. 

Well, went over there Friday and the blanket was chewed up. I was so annoyed. Of course the girl was too, but I told her she had to know the roomie wouldn't keep the dog out and that the blanket would get chewed up there sooner or later.

I'm legitimately frustrated. It was expensive (not the main point, but still). And it was meant to be something she and I could use together for a long time to come. I know she didn't intend for this to happen and technically took a step to prevent it, but it was a step she knew would not be effective and she acknowledged as much when I asked her if she really thought the roomie would keep the dog out of her room. 

I don't know what kind of resolution I can hope for. What's done is done. But I guess I'd like to see her take a stand with the roomie? Stop letting her just have free reign and let her dog cause destruction? Stick up and set boundaries for our relationship? We're both in our 30s and financially great, we don't need this shit IMO.

The thing is since she has told me about herself, past relationships, guys hitting on her and i remember her mocking the question ""Are you ok? Why do you act so different?""

I didn't date through college, but after I had a job and lived by myself, I felt stable enough to look for a relationship. I am a high school history teacher, reasonably fit, I felt confident in myself and thought I wouldn't have too much trouble.

Well, the depressing reality of online dating began to manifest. I started picky at first, but after consistently receiving zero matches I broadened my likes quite a bit. Sometimes I would get a match, only to be either immediately unmatched or it would be a scam of some sort. On the extremely rare occasion I would get a woman who actually responded, she would be only interested in something casual. It was exhausting, and after a year and a half of constant rejection and hopelessness, my self-esteem started to plummet.

I began to feel unlovable. I saw myself in the mirror and began to call myself ugly, because it seemed like that's what the reality was. This even had an effect on my teaching. I started to become less animated and less passionate. My students picked up on it, and one of my favorites even came up to me and tried to cheer me up by saying I was his favorite teacher. I was getting worried, about myself, my students, everything.

Then I met her.

She was pretty, had a profile that I related too, and she seemed interested in ME. (!!!) I had never had that in my entire online dating career. I was always the chaser, not the chased. I had never felt desired before, but she made me feel attractive, made me feel wanted. Things started great, we were going on dates, she took my virginity, we decided to be exclusive, and I was over the moon. The abusive behavior started soon after.

At first it was subtle. She would start to demand gifts, or dates at expensive restaurants. Whenever we would have an argument, she would get really loud and, in my face, call me ugly or scrawny. One day she slapped me. She immediately apologized, and made promises, and cried so that I comforted HER. This cycle continued. She would be either emotionally or physically abusive, then would love bomb me and make me console her.

Every time I considered leaving her, I would think back to the period of being alone, and I convinced myself that this was the best I could get. That I deserved this treatment, because of how undesirable I was.

Finally, I had enough. She had made some disparaging comment about my students, which lead to an argument where she punched me hard in the nose. I walked out of her apartment and never returned.

&amp;#x200B;

Men, don't let your self-esteem lower from online dating. NO ONE deserves to be abused, everyone deserves kindness and respect. You may not be able to get matches, but that doesn't make you any less of a person. Reach out to friends, try and realize that happiness shouldn't be dependent on your relationship status. All easier said than done, but I feel a need to get this message out.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1157982,public,self,"Men, be careful of becoming so desperate from online dating that you accept abusive behavior",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/snsks9/men_be_careful_of_becoming_so_desperate_from/,no_ads,0.0,,,

I’ve had a girlfriend for almost my entire college career, but recently have become available again. I go out to bars often with friends and find it easy to flirt in those settings. However, I haven’t really tried to flirt with women in my classes or get their numbers in a long time. But I have this one class, probably my least formal class, in a room of 60 people. Probably 38 are women. There’s not much opportunity to talk to anyone, as it’s usually lecture heavy. We have discussion groups that we sit by every time, for biweekly discussions but also some in class exercises.

One of the women sits on my right every time and it’s safe to say we have unassigned-assigned seats by each other now, for the next 16 or so classes left in the semester. We are wearing masks, but I can tell she’s cute and she looks very fit, and I haven’t seen her snapchatting any boyfriends or anything in class, yet. Anyway, I would say I’m a decently attractive guy and I feel confident talking to most women. I’m just not sure how to really approach her in this setting in which we have masks on and can’t really talk. The only interaction we’ve had were two times leaving class; once a couple weeks ago when she left right after me and said ‘see you next week’, then today, when she again left after me and said thank you for holding the door. I was thinking, maybe in the time after class when we are leaving I could try talking to her? But that relies on us walking out at the same time every time, which is more than likely a coincidence and not her wanting me to hold the door for her.

As a guy, nothing is a bigger turn off then a woman's strong interest in how much money I make. Especially early on. I actually don't like to discuss it on purpose to see how much of a fuss they make about it. Eventually we discuss these things of course, but if it seemed of *major* concern to them before, then even if we're vibing, I'll never let the relationship go anywhere beyond casual. 

It's just insulting, the idea that how much money I make a year determines my romantic value. And I make a decent amount. I'm not rich, I'm not poor. I take care of myself and am not struggling. For me, as long as you know that, then that should be it.

I think we've been on 6 so far, maybe 7. She's the first girl I've even bothered to go on a date with in 6 years. She's nice, and the dates have all been good fun; but I'm not really letting myself get interested, excited, or invested for the reasons in the title of this post. I could get into the deeply seated psychological scars and the reasons why I feel that way, but that's not really the point of this post.

Essentially I feel like it's unfair of me to let it become serious or become a real relationship because I just don't see it as a genuine possibility that she'll love me (I don't even love me) and that just means it will end in breakup/heartbreak/pain/scars for both of us anyway, so why carry on? If that's the inevitability of it, why not just break it off now and save us both the hurt? But then the question becomes why date anyone ever? Why not just accept the truth I've already internalized: There's nothing here to love and I'm always going to be alone.

The tiny part of me that wants to carry on and keep trying feels like childish hope flying in the face of reality. I am profoundly, terribly alone. I want something different, I want care and attention, I want physical closeness, and I want to feel understood; but what person under the sun would want to provide those things? And if--despite all odds--somebody does want to share in those things with me, I don't think I'd even believe or trust that it was real. I guess the worst part of it is that I do think she likes me. Or more accurately, I think she *thinks* she likes me, and I can't/won't believe it.

So I guess my question is the most general one out there: **What should I do?**

Do I keep dating her, hoping that I change and start to believe I could be loved?

Do I break it off, and throw away maybe the one person out there who *does* care or could love me?

Do I step away from dating all together, again, and work out my problems?

A big part of me wants to sit down, open up, communicate, and explain this internal battle to her, and let her make an informed decision on if she wants to keep dating me or not. But it also feels unfair to ask her to make that decision. Additionally, I hate the possibility (or even the thought) of her deciding to keep on dating me to ""prove"" anything to me, or ""fix"" me.

I feel like she got feelings and ran and didn't even bother to say anything...I did kiss her and it was kinda awkward. I always ask to kiss and she was flattered that I did. And then us talking about the dynamic of that before kissing made the romance evaporate and she kinda cringed a bit, so I tapped her shoulder and said oh cmon... and grabbed her head lightly amd she kissed back. It was awkward but I didn't manhandle her or be forceful, more just trying to unawkward the mood and give her a kiss...she's kinda insecure and needed reassurance multiple times already so I figured it would make her feel better.

Because some of you just overuse tf outta them when it’s not even valid… 

Just an FYI, imma 25m &amp; my dating preferences for women are typically between the ages of 21-29.

Anyways, I’m writing this because recently I’ve been seeing numerous posts &amp; comments that unjustly label older individuals (usually men) who pursue younger partners as “predators.”  I mean one lady who was 29yrs old called a 41yr old man’s behavior “predatory” because he was interested in her, but she claims that because, &amp; I quote, “it feels predatory to me for much older men who probably have disproportionate resources and the advantage of age and experience to hit on women in their 20s.”  LMFAO.  I mean the absurdity is hilarious.  We’re not talking about harassment, stalking, or other callous actions that are unfortunately persistent in dating.  A young 40’s M &amp; an almost 30F is predatory because of the age difference.  

I seen another where it was a 31F &amp; a 22M &amp; I was searching far &amp; wide for the predator comments; 20+ responses &amp; couldn’t find a single one (maybe someone wrote something after I checked cuz it was still relatively fresh).  I can only imagine those first 20+ responses if the genders were flipped.

My point is, not every individual who enjoys younger partners is a predator.  There’s various variables such as: maturity, lifestyle, awareness, consent, etc. that goes into these things.  Am I necessarily a proponent of age gaps?  Not necessarily.  Would I enter a 10-15+ yr age gap relationship?  Very unlikely.  Is say a 49yr old trying to get w/ a 19yr old predatory?  Sure.  However, every gap isn’t &amp; imo, if you’re over 25 (which can really be younger tbh but the brain fully develops at 25) you’re not being “preyed upon.”

We continued to talk throughout the week, and he asked me to hangout again at 4 am on a Friday. At this point, I had a feeling he just wanted to hook up, but I was fine with things being casual. 

When I go over, he asks to watch a movie but falls asleep within ten minutes of the movie playing. We end up just sleeping next to each other, but when he wakes up, he’s on his phone and doesn’t really talk to me. I was really confused by his intentions and I asked him if he wanted to meet up again later to do homework (we’re both college students). He agreed and we met at a coffee shop a couple hours later. After the shop closed we headed back to his place, but he continued to ignore me. I tried making conversation but he snapped at me and said that I’m annoying him. I told him he was being really mean and he apologized, but then proceeded to tell me about all the girls he’s been with and even pulled out a notes page with their names. I felt like he was just trying to get a reaction out of me. I decided to leave and sent him a text that I got home but left it at that.

Two days later, he texts me apologizing for his behavior saying that he feels extremely bad. I told him it was ok, and we continued texting during the night. We agreed that we were super incompatible but we could be friends. He then told me he was watching a rom com and asked if I wanted to watch it with him. I declined at first but he kept asking if I was going to come over, so I caved in and went to his place to watch the movie. Despite establishing a platonic boundary, he would keep touching me, grabbing my hand, and try to cuddle.

I don’t see her quite as often anymore since it’s pretty cold out and I’m pretty busy this semester. I have maybe seen her twice in the last couple weeks. I was going to say “hey” but she looked like she was in a rush. I know she lives in the building next to me since that’s where we always would see each other. We follow each other on Instagram and we’re also in the same chat for our housing so I thought those could be viable options of initiating contact. On one hand, I know it would probably be more genuine if we just talked in person but I also want to send it and see how it goes. 
If I were to dm her through Instagram or GroupMe, what could be a possible approach to keep it light and not creepy but also let her know I’m interested? 
For background: I really like her style and she recently cut her hair which she was showing off on her story for a little while. She seems to be invested in art and hiking trails. 
Or should I just wait to see her in person again?

I am not the best at breaking up with people and I do not know if I am misreading this so some advice would be appreciated.

She has a lot of things that I do like about her, has a graduate degree, good job, dances great, we seem to get alone well culturally, like the same music/movies etc. 

But...

The first week she accused me of talking to my ex(I wasn't nor do I) and we got into a big argument over it. The reason that I don't talk to my ex is that I had a friend die over Covid, and my ex said, ""What does this have to do with me?"" If that is not the most narcissitic thing that I have ever heard then I don't know what is. I didn't want to tell her the story but she kept on and on and I couldn't take it and I started yelling about it. She is a nurse practitioner and I said, can I at least get some empathy? And she said No. Then because I raised my voice she kicked me out of her house. It was the second time, she also kicked me out the night before because I ""snored too loud"". 

I had no plans to talk to her anymore, but I forgot my charger there. She was originally going to bring it to me, but then told me that she had a busy day. So I went two days with no charger and finally she told me I could go to her home but I didn't feel comfortable there. Anyways, went over there, we worked it out. The thing that annoyed me is that her friends told me that she was ""not alone"" and I should never disrespect her mom's house(she has passed). I was annoyed by that because 1. My parents are both dead. And 2. who is going to defend me when she messes up? I also found out that she has assaulted 2 guys before in her past. One that has attacked her and one that just cheated and with that one, she just slapped him. Other than all of that,  everything was ok until Saturday.

On Saturday, she got super wasted and started crying about her ex. Not only was she ugly crying about it, it got so bad, that she asked me if I would call her ex to ask him why they weren't together anymore. I got pissed but since she was drunk, did not want to start a fight. She told me that I could stay the night, but I would have to leave at 7 am(it was already 3 am) . I elected to go home. 

On Monday, she goes over her cc receipts and gets mad because I only paid for 1 round of drinks. She got super wasted and every time I offered to pay, she would tell me to use her card. I offered to take her to dinner and she accepted, but did a raincheck because she had a family emergency and that is where we are at now. I am supposed to meet her tonight. 

She also describes herself a, ""dick and a asshole""

I only get turned up by nice women, and ive had problems getting it up with her(despite how hot she is) when I finally did, I could not finish.

I’m pretty light hearted on dates. I really don’t think I should be giving off an energy were people have to go out of their way to tell me they’re not looking for something serious. Ultimately yes I would like to be in a relationship. But I am not in a rush and open to other things too.

So I (m20) have been friends with this girl (f21) for probably a little over a year. We hang out pretty frequently with the rest of our friend group, and we all talk over discord pretty often. 

I only ever thought of her as a friend, but to make a long story short we hung out a couple times one and one and I caught feelings for her. This is all fine, except I really cant tell if we were going on dates or just hanging out as friends. Anytime we hang out we have really great conversations, and pretty recently she dropped what I thought was a hint, I just can’t really tell.

Normally I have no problem expressing my feelings, but its just different with her. I haven’t liked somebody this much in a long time. But Im also terrified that Im making assumptions, and she’s just being friendly. Also Im worried that the fact that Im younger than her would turn her away. As a man I just really don’t want to creep her out. I always mean to just grow up and ask if she feels the same, but I really don’t want to ruin our friendship if she doesn’t. And again I don’t want to make her uncomfortable. 

So far we’ve been on probably 5 of what I assume were dates but again, I don’t really know.

When we got to my place I let her use my iphone charger and we carried on talking. Since she was round my place I wanted to escalate to potentially have sex with her.

I asked her how many guys has she slept with. She got annoyed I think for some reason, and wanted to know why I asked. I said to her because Im a virgin and I might not be as experienced as she was, and i was also curious. She didnt say anything so I assumed she was a virgin too and said to her that if she's a virgin then we can take it together.

For some reason she then was upset a bit i think but she didn't look uncomfortable. I tried to show her my guitar skills but she wasnt really paying attention and was just on her phone. So i asked her if she wanted to watch a movie or something but then she said she wants to go home.

She left shortly after and I called her to see if she got home ok but she didn't answer, I then texted her and she didn't reply, and her whatsapp picture disappeared. I found her instagram and direct messaged her but she still didn't reply.

I then called her again the next day and she didn't answer but texted me saying that I made her uncomfortable and to leave her alone.
