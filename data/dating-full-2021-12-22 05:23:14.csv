Now I started talking to a guy who‚Äôs a year older than me but he‚Äôs white (which isn‚Äôt the issue at all) but he‚Äôs a far right republican and VERY open about his views. He also is VERY country. (He wears a cowboy hat,has a mullet and drives a pick up truck). He‚Äôs actually very sweet and super open minded but if I were to introduce him to my family they would freak out. One of my uncles called me a ‚Äúbed wrench‚Äù when he found out I was no longer on the left so if he saw me with a guy who looks like that and has very conservative values he‚Äôd probably have a heart attack. I really like him and was thinking about inviting him over for Christmas but after thinking about all the crazy remarks my family would make I decided not to.

I've had to explain to a guy why he can't say shit like ""Indian people are genetically predisposed to r\*pe women"" and expect people to be okay with it.  

Even after filtering for education, career, conversation ability, commitment-mindedness, I get some seriously problematic guys.

And to be honest I‚Äôve never really been in a serious relationship, I have had a couple girlfriends in school but they weren‚Äôt really real girlfriends though. So yeah I just graduated from High School last May and is now taking an adult program that is teaching me independent living skills and stuff like that, I mean as someone who has autism I am actually a pretty responsible guy and I think I can take care of myself but I think the biggest thing for me in that program that I will be learning soon is financial stuff but when it comes to cooking, cleaning, personal information, social skills, Job skills, I‚Äôm pretty goodüëçüèª.
So yeah with all of that aside, 2019 was the year when I started to become obsessive about finding a significant other and let‚Äôs just say I made tons of mistakes but I have definitely learned from them though and I think I now know what I need to do now. And that is to not be obsessive, take chances(what I mean by that is if I see a cute girl who is pretty much ready for anyone to talk to her, I will talk to her), go to places where I can easily find a cute girl(in my case go to a place where geeks go, because I want to find someone who shares a lot of the same interests. But I also won‚Äôt limit my options either).
So yeah as of for now I‚Äôm going to try not to worry so much about finding a girlfriend and put my focus on other things like working towards my dream job and what such.
Heck even when I somehow manage to have a conversation with a cute girl I will probably not even think much of it.
Also when it comes down to my type, I would honestly really like to be with someone who is a lot like me personality wise, geeky, loves stupid comedy including memes, likes super heroes, plays video games, is introverted. So yeah, I would also for some reason like to be with someone who would attempt to annoy me everyday and idk why lol.
Also when it comes down to my psychical type I honestly have a lot lol, I guess it doesn‚Äôt matter as long as she looks average or above.
But yeah I just need to figure out where to find my type but like I said I‚Äôm going to try to not limit my options so much but yeah.
If anyone has any suggestions about finding my type and trying to find the right time to start a conversation with her then please let me know.
Also just so that everyone knows, I absolutely loathe dating apps because they have just never worked out for me plus the girls on them do things that absolutely make no sense, but if anyone wants to give me suggestions for finding anyone online feel free to tell them to me but I‚Äôm probably not going to listen though.

Doesn‚Äôt help that my STBX has my kids for Christmas for the first time and I‚Äôll be staring at the four walls of my apartment with my HelloFresh, Library book, and Nintendo Switch that Santa bought for the kids (if you can‚Äôt tell, Im wildly enthused about this‚Ä¶)

I have to work with her and given the level were at neither of us will say anything to each other. it I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôve mucked things up such that my PTSD is in overdrive and I‚Äôll never have a real chance at even friendship with her (let alone what I‚Äôd like to have).

I don‚Äôt know what to do. My past has prevented me from having any true friendships in 7-8 years. I want her to be happy and I‚Äôd love to support that‚Ä¶and Im here for obvious reasons. She‚Äôs unique and special and I want to be a part of her life and have her a part of mine.

The guy and I occasionally spent some time alone and talked and he eventually started flirting with me. I liked him so I wanted to eventually date him but a few weeks ago, about three months after we became friends I realized that he was dating someone (although he was single when we first met). It‚Äôs best to go through my post history for more details but he basically flirted with me a lot, we had dinner together, he gave me looong rides home, hugs me affectionately and kinda broke the touch barrier, opened up to me with pretty personal details about his life, etc. and I was pretty hurt to realize that he was in another relationship while doing that. The other day we were spending time with our mutual friends and one of them asked him about the girl he‚Äôs dating or whatever and he said that they‚Äôve had dinner together a few times. So this is where I‚Äôm so confused now‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know if these two are exclusive yet and I have no idea how to deal with the situation. He never brings her up when he‚Äôs with me, he‚Äôs pretty close to me, heck even when we were with our mutual friends we were taking pics and he was the most interested one to take pics with me and yeah we have our inside jokes and everything and honestly I just feel so close to him. Also idk why our mutual friends act weird about me and him sometimes but the other day they kept saying wow you two have the cutest photos omg!!! And then before that once again we were taking pics and one of our friends pushed me to his side and was like no you stand there and I was like ??? Okay? And then another time the guy offered me a ride and I was like nooo that‚Äôs too hard for you and our mutual friend was like no he‚Äôs offering it so he‚Äôs obviously okay with it just accept it if you want it and that kinda made me feel weird in a way that she was pushing us to be together? So yeah that also confuses me. I am so unsure about the situation because I am not sure if I should just treat him like a good friend at this point or actually tell him about my feelings. I am pretty inexperienced and shy and he‚Äôs shy too so it doesn‚Äôt really help.

We have some pre-history together. I had an ex fianc√© for 4 years and they used to be classmates for same study program. They have never been friends with him, just acquaintances. We maybe had some short convos with her, never flirty or anything.

Some little time ago we broke up, I saw him on tinder and we matched. He messaged me after a month of match lol. We went out on 2 dates. He seemed to be very interested, we liked each other and he even invited me to a second day straight on the first one. He was very respectful, cute. I was more distant and he was trying to maybe be more romantic (not sexual). We discussed situation with my fianc√© and as long as they never were friends, we were both cool about it. Second date ended up with drinks and I‚Äôd say I was the one who not initiated but added some spice to our communication that it ended up as  sleeping together. Sex was good, but there was some awkwardness in it. Usually like it happens on the first time with people you know very well and it‚Äôs just a bit embarrassing to fully open up sexually. I stayed a night after, but in the morning was more distant. He offered to take me home by his car (I offered maybe I go by taxi and he offered to help me still). During this drive he was trying to be also romantic, to hold my hand and etc. We did goodbye kiss. And none of us ever texted from Sunday. 

 I feel pretty awkward and vulnerable so I was expecting him to reach out first and to go from there. During dates we both stated that we wanted relationships, not a hookup. 

But after him not reaching out I‚Äôm feeling some disgust, vulnerability and I truly feel like kinda abandoned. Like if he doesn‚Äôt reach out on Wednesday, I feel like I‚Äôll just erase this from my memory and pretend it never happened. Did he not like the sex, maybe he realized something else? Was he only after a hookup? I had a bit extra alcohol to drink but I truly liked him and felt connected, if I had knows it‚Äôs just a hookup, I‚Äôd never do it.

I met this guy on Bumble, he was almost 18 years older than me but I decided to give it a shot. I'm 28 and he is 46. I am strictly looking to find a ltr/marriage... and so when we matched, in our very first chats, he told me that he is looking for the same thing.

Right after our first date, he started to love-bomb me. He started to ask me out frequently (every other day), and would take me on dates around 3x a week. Good morning/good night texts, talking on phone everyday, texting many times a day, it seemed that I had found the ""one"" and someone who really valued me. I started falling for his love-bombing.... i come from a broken family and so have some sort of ""daddy issues"". We came too close in just a short time and I felt like I knew him since forever. We planned our kid's names and all that stuff. He introduced me to his entire family and i got quite well with them too. I have very low-self esteem and I'm quite emotionally vulnerable and never thought someone would love me this way, so I fell hard for him. With my dad leaving my mom when i was just 2 years old, i also have fear of abandonment and an anxious attachment style. So I get emotionally attached pretty quickly.

Almost 7 weeks in, i started noticing a change in his behavior. He stopped calling everyday(wouldn't even pick up the phone when i call him), texting became less frequent and it seemed to be that something was ""off"" you know that classic intuition. I started to tell him that i would love to talk to him everyday and communication is super important to me. But he would brush me off everytime saying that everything is fine and i am just overthinking it. Stuff like that. I started feeling that I am the one who is wrong and our relationship is ""perfect"". He started meeting me less frequently too (just saying he was too busy).

He would go to the gym everyday and i knew where his gym was. One evening, he called me and i couldn't pick up the phone. So i immediately called him back, however, he refused to answer my phone and said that ""he's at the gym"". My bad ( yes i am killing myself over this), since he was still on my dating app, i saw his location and it wasn't gym. Not even in the same city as his gym and he was far from there and actually in another city. I got extremely anxious and tried to frantically call him (6-7 times). And he didn't pick up the phone and instead blocked my number. I got hurt by this action and texted him the ""class break-up/hurt text"" i.e. I really wanted to make it work, thanks for the good time etc. But of course i didn't mean it... i was just hurt and angry and confused.

Early in the morning, he unmatched me on Bumble. and later on I saw that he had unblocked me and I received a text from him saying that he was just at the gym. i didn't respond. Later in the night he texted me again and started gaslighting me and saying that he was just at the gym and nothing else. And that i am unfaithful/disloyal because i dumped him over the text blah blah. I tried to talk to him about it and told him that i didn't mean to dump him and it was just out of plain anger and sadness... and I was hurt that he blocked me on WhatsApp and unmatched me on Bumble.

When I told him that his action of blocking me hurt my feelings, he immediately blocked me on WhatsApp again. I didn't do or say anything as I didn't want to bother him.

The day I sent him a text and apologized to him about the ""too many calls"" and ""dump text"" and told him that i am really sorry. He responded to that and told me that i should never call him when he says he's at the ""gym"". I told him I understand. Later in the night I tried to talk to him and he did talk a bit. Then in the morning he told me that his mother is sick and i should pray for her. I became extremely concerned and tried to be there for him. When she got better in a few days, i asked him that i would like to bring flowers for her (as i have already met her), but he told me that he has other plans (it was a Friday evening). I also tried to invite him over my place, but he told me ""he's too busy"". I got hurt and upset but didn't react.

Later on that day I sent him a long text about how I am only looking for something serious and that i was exclusively dating him, and if we are on the same page, we can talk and communicate to make it work. But if he is not looking for the same thing, then we should be clear about it and move on so that we both have a closure.

He didn't respond.

Later that night i texted him again on WhatsApp that i would like to talk to him for a few minutes whenever he has time. he saw the message, but again no response.

It's been three days now, I have been ghosted!

He always told me that all of his exes were ""evil women"" and ""crazy""... and that's why he never married any of them. I believe he will add me to that list now.

I am unable to understand what went wrong. What did I do wrong? How something that seemed to have so much potential can come to end abrupt end like this? This man claimed to wanting to marry me, made me dream about our future together introduced me to his family (that was the first time it happened to me ever), treated me better than everyone else has (i have been treated like shit and rejected many times), and suddenly ghosted me...... and doesn't even want to give closure.

I am confused, anxious and don't know how to react. I am blaming my self that i once again ruined my chances at love, i am the crazy, the psycho, the unlovable girl that's why it happened to me yet again.

Please don't be harsh in your comments. I know I wasn't supposed to frantically call him (i feel extremely guilty), and send him that breakup emotional text... I apologized to him few times too. I have decided to go for therapy before dating again. Please don't be harsh in your comments as i am already broken and unable to think clearly.

I met this guy on Bumble, he was almost 18 years older than me but I decided to give it a shot. I'm 28 and he is 46. I am strictly looking to find a ltr/marriage... and so when we matched, in our very first chats, he told me that he is looking for the same thing.

Right after our first date, he started to love-bomb me. He started to ask me out frequently (every other day), and would take me on dates around 3x a week. Good morning/good night texts, talking on phone everyday, texting many times a day, it seemed that I had found the ""one"" and someone who really valued me. I started falling for his love-bombing.... i come from a broken family and so have some sort of ""daddy issues"". We came too close in just a short time and I felt like I knew him since forever. We planned our kid's names and all that stuff. He introduced me to his entire family and i got quite well with them too. I have very low-self esteem and I'm quite emotionally vulnerable and never thought someone would love me this way, so I fell hard for him. With my dad leaving my mom when i was just 2 years old, i also have fear of abandonment and an anxious attachment style. So I get emotionally attached pretty quickly.

Almost 7 weeks in, i started noticing a change in his behavior. He stopped calling everyday(wouldn't even pick up the phone when i call him), texting became less frequent and it seemed to be that something was ""off"" you know that classic intuition. I started to tell him that i would love to talk to him everyday and communication is super important to me. But he would brush me off everytime saying that everything is fine and i am just overthinking it. Stuff like that. I started feeling that I am the one who is wrong and our relationship is ""perfect"". He started meeting me less frequently too (just saying he was too busy).

He would go to the gym everyday and i knew where his gym was. One evening, he called me and i couldn't pick up the phone. So i immediately called him back, however, he refused to answer my phone and said that ""he's at the gym"". My bad ( yes i am killing myself over this), since he was still on my dating app, i saw his location and it wasn't gym. Not even in the same city as his gym and he was far from there and actually in another city. I got extremely anxious and tried to frantically call him (6-7 times). And he didn't pick up the phone and instead blocked my number. I got hurt by this action and texted him the ""class break-up/hurt text"" i.e. I really wanted to make it work, thanks for the good time etc. But of course i didn't mean it... i was just hurt and angry and confused.

Early in the morning, he unmatched me on Bumble. and later on I saw that he had unblocked me and I received a text from him saying that he was just at the gym. i didn't respond. Later in the night he texted me again and started gaslighting me and saying that he was just at the gym and nothing else. And that i am unfaithful/disloyal because i dumped him over the text blah blah. I tried to talk to him about it and told him that i didn't mean to dump him and it was just out of plain anger and sadness... and I was hurt that he blocked me on WhatsApp and unmatched me on Bumble.

When I told him that his action of blocking me hurt my feelings, he immediately blocked me on WhatsApp again. I didn't do or say anything as I didn't want to bother him.

The day I sent him a text and apologized to him about the ""too many calls"" and ""dump text"" and told him that i am really sorry. He responded to that and told me that i should never call him when he says he's at the ""gym"". I told him I understand. Later in the night I tried to talk to him and he did talk a bit. Then in the morning he told me that his mother is sick and i should pray for her. I became extremely concerned and tried to be there for him. When she got better in a few days, i asked him that i would like to bring flowers for her (as i have already met her), but he told me that he has other plans (it was a Friday evening). I also tried to invite him over my place, but he told me ""he's too busy"". I got hurt and upset but didn't react.

Later on that day I sent him a long text about how I am only looking for something serious and that i was exclusively dating him, and if we are on the same page, we can talk and communicate to make it work. But if he is not looking for the same thing, then we should be clear about it and move on so that we both have a closure.

He didn't respond.

Later that night i texted him again on WhatsApp that i would like to talk to him for a few minutes whenever he has time. he saw the message, but again no response.

It's been three days now, I have been ghosted!

He always told me that all of his exes were ""evil women"" and ""crazy""... and that's why he never married any of them. I believe he will add me to that list now.

I am unable to understand what went wrong. What did I do wrong? How something that seemed to have so much potential can come to end abrupt end like this? This man claimed to wanting to marry me, made me dream about our future together introduced me to his family (that was the first time it happened to me ever), treated me better than everyone else has (i have been treated like shit and rejected many times), and suddenly ghosted me...... and doesn't even want to give closure.

I am confused, anxious and don't know how to react. I am blaming my self that i once again ruined my chances at love, i am the crazy, the psycho, the unlovable girl that's why it happened to me yet again.

Please don't be harsh in your comments. I know I wasn't supposed to frantically call him (i feel extremely guilty), and send him that breakup emotional text... I apologized to him few times too. I have decided to go for therapy before dating again. Please don't be harsh in your comments as i am already broken and unable to think clearly.

We were all standing around a table drinking, and I got really drunk. I sat down at a couch, and one of the guys (19M) sat down next to me. I never even had much of a conversation with him, just some basic information like name and age. I was falling in and out of sleep, and he put his hand around my waist and my head on his chest. I had to get carried back to my room, and I didn't hear this, but my friends told me later how he was saying how sexy I looked, and how he wanted to jump into bed with me.

After I was put to rest, he went on about how he wanted to hook up with me and how he wanted to make out with me on the bed. One of my other guy friends put a stop to it, because his language made it clear that he would've taken advantage of me, and the guy didn't hit on me anymore after.

We drove to the beach. He said he needed the bathroom but all public ones were closed due to Covid. He ended up coming to my house for it and we hooked up- I initiated it. He was really loving and intimate- focusing on my pleasure. We only did oral.

We showered together after this and fell asleep holding hands/cuddling. We also had some good conversations before falling asleep where I felt like we really clicked.

The next morning we had sex and he was super understanding about my vaginismus- trying to make it as painless as possible and apologising every time he thought I was in pain.

I made him breakfast and then drove him home because Uber would‚Äôve been really expensive. He kissed me goodbye and said he will see me in a bit since he‚Äôs going on a road trip.

He messaged me afterwards saying that I‚Äôm really good company and that he had a good time. I also came home to find out that this man had made my bed for me which thought was so sweet!

 We have been texting non stop since that day and he asked me on a second date.

I have been trying to get a date with this incredible girl I know.

A girl I know at work (I know, I know!) was flirting with me, looking over her shoulder at me, running into me over and over even though she has no business in my area. She would walk in front of my field of view while talking to some coworkers three times. Back-forth-back-forth.

I will turn one way, and \*bam\* there she is, walking within my line of sight. She is not working anywhere in this area, and the ladies room and cafeteria are nowhere near where I work.

Thinking she was interested, I gave her my phone number and she seemed beaming and said she appreciated it. Later, she came to me and declined in person. She said she was getting over a long-term relationship. I said if she changed her mind, I was open to getting to know her. She told me thank you and that she understood me.

After this, I stopped talking to her to avoid any awkwardness or make her feel creeped out.

She still says hello to me at every opportunity...just being nice, I guess? I greet her back with a smile.

She sure seems hell-bent on me paying attention to her.

She has synchronized her breaks and lunches with mine. I moved my lunches and breaks, and she followed my schedule again. She looks at me in my truck as she walks to her car.

As I leave the building, she times it to walk in just as I do. When I greet her, she acts like she is texting.

She says hello to me every time we are within the building. She always says ""thank you"" to me, no matter what I do. She says this very sweetly, with lots of eye contact. She laughs at my jokes, but I rarely see her even speak to anyone else but women at work.

I catch her watching, observing, studying me from a distance. Why would someone do this?

This is such a sweet person, and I really want to get to know her better, but she already declined...but her actions are showing interest. Why be interested in me if you don't want my phone number? I don't get it.

Her words would make sense if she didn't single (no pun intended!) me out against any other men here. She treats other men very cold from what I have seen.

I she shy? Indecisive? Just toying with me? I don't get it. 

I catch her watching me, and hiding close by, listening in on my conversations with my friends at work. Some of these conversations are about work itself, our tastes in women, etc. I see out of the corner of my eye, half her face peering over, like in some cartoon. It is kind of weird, but cute. Hell, she's cute.

She has her area to work, but she keeps finding excuses to take the long way, over and over, to walk by me and say ""Hello, Throwaway""...I tried an experiment: I let her walk by three times, pretending I did not see her, and on the third time, she spoke instead of just walking by. I returned the greeting and she turned around and gave me a warm smile.

When we speak, her eye contact is intense. I'm so confused.

The last time we spoke (yesterday) I told her ""...not to be a stranger"".

I honestly don't have wishful thinking anymore. I just want to understand why I am so interesting to her if she has no designs? She rejected me, so why is this woman spying on me? I just want to understand her possible motivations in these puzzling actions.

If she wanted to be ""friends"", she would offer to hang out outside work (which I would decline anyway). Again, I don't get it.

If she doesn't feel the same way about me, hey, no hard feelings...then why the long drawn-out nonsense? Can someone enlighten me? I have never had a woman act this way. Usually they are straightforward, which is what I prefer, honestly.

She is a cutie, no doubt about it, but I am lost as to where she is trying to go or what she is trying to do?

I did really like him but I feel this kind of quickness ruined the natural pace of things and I felt trapped pretty quickly. We continue seeing each other regularly and in October I agree to be exclusive, which is way too fast for me but he‚Äôd ask every day and I just thought why not if we were already acting like a couple. He also dropped the L bomb way too early on. It didn‚Äôt feel right for me as I‚Äôd only known him just over a month but I thought I‚Äôd see how things so. 
We spent practically every day together, and then when id go out or want some time alone he‚Äôd guilt trip me into coming over or spam me with messages. I realised this dynamic was super unhealthy and cut it off. It was a shame because we have lots of chemistry and get along well apart from when we aren‚Äôt together. 

I end it early November after me saying I need a night to myself and the usual pleading for me to come over happens. I really liked him at this point but I didn‚Äôt love him, which is so normal, but I thought I needed to end it because he said he was ‚Äòin love with me‚Äô. He doesn‚Äôt take the breakup well but he does start therapy, because he realised he might have attachment issues worth working on etc as he does want to be with me. 

At this point I have no intention of getting back with him and I let him know that, but he‚Äôs adamant that we will be together again. 

A month passes and he asks me to meet for a drink and tells me how well he‚Äôs doing in therapy etc. I do really miss him but at this point I still don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a good idea to get back together, as it seems like that‚Äôs where he‚Äôs angling. During the break up he said he tried to have sex with someone else but couldn‚Äôt becusse hes ‚Äòin love with me‚Äô, meanwhile I chat to a few people, download dating apps and have meaningless conversations but I have no desire to actually meet anyone etc. I actually do just spend this time alone and single, not answering to anyone after quite an intense one month fling, which was very nice tbh. 

He is really keen on ‚Äòseeing where things go‚Äô and asks me to meet again, I agree because I do miss him and he says things will be different. We go out for drinks, talk about being on dating apps etc, I say I still want to be single, I don‚Äôt want a relationship etc etc. And he says that‚Äôs ok, but just see where this goes. 
So we start seeing each-other more regularly on a non-exclusive basis. 

I stay at his for five days and it‚Äôs nice, better than before and I actually realise I do still have feelings for him, but I‚Äôm still not ready for a relationship hence the chat we had at the beginning of the week. 

The lines feel very blurred at this point, as we did have that conversation, but then everything went back to normal too quickly. 

The weekend after I stayed at his, I went out for a meal with someone I‚Äôd agreed to see when we broke up, and they popped up asking again randomly one day. I tried not to think anything of it as I am technically single, it was just going to be a meal and a catch up etc. But we had a few drinks and one thing led to another. I feel so so guilty about this and immediately cut off all communication with said person. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do about this, do I end things with the guy I‚Äôm ‚Äòseeing how things go‚Äô with? I know we aren‚Äôt exclusive but we have seen a lot of each other this past week, and if I told him I know he‚Äôd be angry. I‚Äôm so angry with myself as it‚Äôs so stupid and to be honest, had I done it a week earlier it would have made a lot more sense as that would have still been during the breakup. 

My friend says I should just bury it and move on if I want to continue seeing him, as we aren‚Äôt exclusive. I‚Äôm not sure, I feel so bad but I can‚Äôt tell him as I think that would hurt him so badly, so I‚Äôd just end it because he deserves better. I know we aren‚Äôt together but the lines feel blurred so I‚Äôm just not sure what to think. I‚Äôve never done this kind of thing before and I definitely won‚Äôt be doing it again. I would like to see where it goes with him, but I feel so bad. 

TL;DR I dated someone seriously for a month, it got too intense too quick so I broke up with them. Some time passes and we start seeing each other casually. A week in, I go on a date with someone else and sleep with them. Not sure whether to end it with the guy I‚Äôm seeing because of this or just forget it as we aren‚Äôt technically exclusive.

Put effort into your appearance. I know we all think that nerdy guys aren't interested in looking good and that it is superficial or something. It is the biggest load of hogwash ever. It isn't just hygiene (which I always maintained). Put in actual effort. Buy new clothes, visit a good barber instead of the $10 one, try out new hair styling products, put on cologne so you smell nice, exercise, don't wear hoodies after highschool, always shave properly (or grow a beard). Don't just put in effort when you have a date, also put in effort when meeting friends. You might of course already know this, but subconsciously many people still aren't putting in actual effort into their appearance. 

2. Confidence comes from 3 things: 1: Your appearance (it's really hard to be not confident when you look good) 2: A sense of accomplishment from your actions. This means having hobbies, exercising or putting effort into other things that yield a result. 3: Experience with dating. The first times are always scary, if you feel your primary fear is your lack of experience then dating IS self improvement, even if you get rejected. 

3. Dating apps suck but might still get you what you want. Let's face it, the ratio of men to women on dating app is abysmal. Keep this in mind and don't get frustrated. Tinder sucks, Bumble and Hinge are ok, paid sites also suck because a really selective audience uses them nowadays. Take good pictures, step one: put in effort into your appearance (again), step 2 get a decent camera, step 3 read up on fotography a bit, step 4 get a friend or a tripod and spend an afternoon making nice pictures. Put them on photofeeler and pick the ones that get the best response. Also take pictures when you are out with friends, this is one of the reasons why you should also put in effort into your appearance then. 

4. Dating is a lot easier when you are happy. Ok I don't really like the crowd that gives a vibe that you have to be perfect before you even think about dating, but it does really help. I would not have minded if dates said no, I actually become friends with a couple of rejected dates. Don't be desperate 

5. Adjust your attitude in certain ways. Don't think in absolutes or that things exclusive. Appearance or personallity? both. dating IRL or apps? both. date or improve yourself? both. Don't reject ways of improvement because you feel ""you don't need them"". You don't NEED to exercise to find someone, but it helps, so why wouldn't you.

At a party last week he made a move and admitted he had been waiting a while to do that and dropping hints, but to be fair he had been drinking.

We spoke last night since i wanted to know what was happening between us and i expressed how ive been confused on this whole talk and situation. He told me he just assumed it was a mutual drunk kiss and that i wasn‚Äôt into him since i never told him.

So i asked him if it meant anything to him or if it was out of the blue and he said there definitely is something between us, but the moment felt right and natural as well. Long story short, he said he wants to take things slow between us and keep talking/hanging out like we have been since he never takes things slow and because of that, they never last.

I had a lot of good experiences, met some people who became good friends of mine, had some short-term relationships, but lately I've mostly had negative experiences.  I got off the dating apps, determined to just focus on myself and my work for a while and perhaps meet someone organically.

I ended up meeting someone at a masquerade party recently.  We had an immediate connection and great vibe.  We've been texting and talking, and got together once and had a lot of fun!

Last night he didn't respond to my text around 7pm and I didn't hear from him first thing in the morning like I am already used to.  He texted me about an hour ago (still early) and explained that he had a super busy day yesterday getting ready for his holiday trip.

Of course, that's totally understandable and reasonable.  Unfortunately, it was my emotions that weren't reasonable.  My brain was abuzz last night and this morning with self-doubt and worry.  Was I being ghosted?  Was he actually seeing someone else last night and decided to go with them? Did he lose his phone?  Did he find me on social media and not like something?

This is nuts, really.  And I don't usually get like this.  I'm pretty level headed - honest!!

The uncertainty was killing me so one hang out I outright asked her if she liked me to which she said she takes a long time to warm up to people and was still thinking about it. On that same hang out she then asked me to stay the night which led to a 3 day stint of me staying at her apartment. I had to leave to visit family for the holidays but she's been phoning me for about 3 hours every day. 

What's bothering me is we haven't agreed to a relationship (and she doesn't seem ready for this convo) and no matter the number of positive signals she sends me, I am still just a bit nervous that the whole thing might fall apart given she did sorta reject me previously.
