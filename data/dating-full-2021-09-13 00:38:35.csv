He texted me around 12:30am to make sure it wasn’t too late. I said it wasn’t and he should head over. And then he left me on read. 

I figured he had gotten too drunk, blacked out, passed out whatever. But he hasn’t texted me at all today explaining wtf happened. 

He has always been so good with communicating (which is something that I really like about him). But the fact that he hasn’t texted me to let me know what happened is really fucking weird. And I know he’s alive (haha) because he’s been active on social media.

I have an anxious attachment style so I know I can sometimes react strongly. But I don’t think I’m feeling insecure right now I’m more just like what the fuck. Like why didn’t I get an explanation?

Hi. I just need an advice regarding this guy that I’ve been dating since June. We just casually went out on dates every weekend. Long story short, his ex who doesn’t live here wants him back and he told me about that the last time I saw him. However, I felt pushed away from him and wanted to give him and myself  some space so I wasn’t responding to his Instagram story. He got mad at me that week and asked me why I was ignoring him. After that, he just suddenly changed. I tried seeing him twice and rejected. I told him to call me when he can and he said “yea sure later” and he just never did. We haven’t talked in two weeks. And my question is, do I reach out or no! I don’t necessarily want him back. I just wanna be like “so you’re gonna disappear like this without saying anything?” I’m more like doing this for myself. I have been ghosted out before and months later I wished I reached out to the person. Just so I don’t wonder what could’ve been or what if. I have a feeling that months from today, I will regret not reaching out one last time. I feel like I will be okay if I don’t get a good response from him. I know I will not. It’s over.

Yesterday I met this girl and I’ve been really anxious and had felt like I lost a bit of my mojo once school started, but I met this girl and we danced and made out, slow danced a bit, i kissed her goodbye, snd we’re just chatting over messages but it feels a little bit pointless. I was so drunk I can’t really remember how exactly her face looks like, but I doubt it will go anywhere, I don’t like that’s she’s a year older (although who cares in the long term), and somehow it came up that she’s not really touchy snd she was only really touchy when we met bc she was drunk. 

I feel like there’s has to be so many check points, I have to like her, she has to like me, there’s a certain personality that I consider like relationship material (I really like goofy eccentric girls), she needs to want a relationship and that’s about it. I’m 21 so I know there’s time, but like I feel like the clock is clicking bc i haven’t been in one serious relationship. 

Again I hate that I think about that other girl sometimes, when she was just trying to have fun and I stopped meaning something to her, and now I don’t get excited unless I feel like those butterfly feelings in my stomach, I know they have them too, and I want that chemistry again with someone. I want to stare into someone’s eyes and just giggle, you kiss a little bit, and it felt like I was a little kid just fondling her face, and a connection was there too which made the intimacy that much more intense IMO.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1004225,public,self,Feel like I’m just so jaded now and searching for something I had before?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pn6paq/feel_like_im_just_so_jaded_now_and_searching_for/,all_ads,6,,,

I’m a pretty low-key guy who wears his emotions squarely on his sleeves. 

I often find myself attracted to women who are the life of the party and want to live a life full of going out and having a good time ( in most cases these girls are super into drinking and the night life scene) 

The problem is that what I described above is the exact opposite of me. I go on multiple dates with these women and as I get invested and want to take things to the next level I always feel the need to make my feelings known. This seems to without fail scare these women away and leave me a depressed mess who feels pretty hopeless.

I have been cheated on in various ways in every single relationship I’ve ever been in. I know this isn’t a coincidence, and I know my behavior plays a part somehow, but I also don’t think that’s an excuse for how people have treated me in the past.

But I thought I had finally figured out how to read the signs. I trusted my ex even though I always had my suspicions and that odd feeling in my gut, any time I confronted her ended up going nowhere. I didn’t realize how good she was at manipulating my short attention span, but she completely smokescreened me. 

I let her convince me that I was imagining things I had seen with my own eyes. And it is very troubling to me that I let someone—essentially a stranger—have unfettered access to my life and deepest secrets, even though it was pretty clear that she wasn’t a trustworthy person.

So at this point, I am having trouble trusting myself to differentiate between abusive/manipulative people and those who are acting genuinely. This has basically led to total reclusiveness, as I don’t really feel like humans in general are very honest.

There was this girl I really liked and I done a lot  of things for her. 

1. I always check on her mental health because she opened about her depression to me. 
2. Always use to walk her home at night 
3. When she was broke I bought her food and never asked for the money back 
4. She always comes to me and be like guy a said this about me you don’t think it’s true 
5. I always involve her when she get left out because she’s shy 
6. She always downplays her self because of lack of confidence and I always uplift her 

I was too slow as well I waited almost 6 months but I was actually going to ask her out on a date today I asked for a walk and at the end of the walk I was going to ask for a date. She said she was busy 

Got home and went on the phone with my friend and the stuff I heard really hurt me. She’s been seeing  this guy they aren’t officially dating but she travelled 4 times during the holiday to see and they had 4 dinners together which is basically 4 dates even though they not official. When I asked her to hangout in the half term she shut it down. Then this guy helps her move in by driving her self. Then they go cinema together today and that was the best I’ve ever seen her dress. 

I’m literally so hurt it took me ages to build up my confidence and I was ready to do it today. My friend even told me on the phone that she said I’m good guy but I  over  exaggerate a lot and that she could never date me. She always disses me behind my back after everything I done for her. 

I wanted a Genuine relationship with her I don’t care about having sex with her I was even in her room one time alone with her and nothing happen because I generally care about this person and wanted to build a long term relationship. 

I’m so hurt right now and I want to cry but I can’t cuz I don’t want to give this other guy any satisfaction and  I hate him with a passion. 

I know the comments are going to say there’s other girls and stuff but I’m just hurting so much right now she was definitely my favourite girl I meet so far I guess she don’t care about me since she always dissing me and cancelling plans and I never did anything to her. It’s so sad man 🥺. I’m obviously cut her off but I’m in so much pain I even still want to ask her out just for the closure and for getting my conscience up but there’s not even a point anymore 

One time a romantic song was playing and she whispered in my ear this could be us in the future why would she do and just leave me for the other guy and it’s not about being too slow she even told my friend she would never date me

She then proceeded to make a sexual joke involving me and that friend, in hindsight I'm concerned that she did this to scare me off because I was being to touchy with her. After she left I was left with her friend who told me ""I can't see you two lasting long"".

So I invited her for coffee and we agreed a few things, firstly that we wouldn't see her friend anymore, secondly that I would respect her more and not be too touchy in public. Honestly I was just nervous and being very irrational, but beyond this is where I essentially went on self destruct mode. We're now on day 6 of us dating,  we've been seeing eachother every day, i forgot to mention that she told me ""next time you have protection we can have sex"".... I didn't know what to do because I percieved the other night that I took a massive L by allowing him to flirt with her and then her making a sexual joke , my adhd impulsiveness kicked in, after telling me that she would come over to my hotel that i was working inI set out rose petals, candles ,music and champagne for our first time having sex.... yeah in hindsight WAYYY too much, I was overcompensating for what happened the night before, what's worse is that nowhere in my town sold candles so I had to ask the staff at the hotel for them, yeah involving my work colleagues in my sex life was a bad idea....Problem was it turns out she was out with her girlfriends drinking and she got too drunk and decided not to come by. I didn't want the room to go to waste so I sent a video of the room, she saw it expressed surprise and then immediately changed the subject.... then I got super insecure and realised how insane what I was doing was , I asked her why she changed the subject and what her feeling were now, I also essentially confessed that the confidence I displayed in asking her out wasn't real and I viewed her as out of my league, I saw the attraction drain from her face rapidly.... then the whole staff knew that I got rejected (because I involved them) and that information spread around.

The next day we went for coffee , I apologised for being so presumptuous and entitled , she accepted and verbalise that she wanted to carry on dating, but I could tell how awkward she felt, she said ""it seems like you're really into this whereas I'm just seeing how it goes"" and the initial energy we had at the start was gone, so I ended it. She's now blocked me.

Aside from my adhd I come across as fairly put  together on the most part.... but after this I genuinely think I am slightly insane, I find it hard to be rational when I'm stressed and the whole situation definitely made me stressed, but even so... this to me is next level stuff, seriously what was I thinking?!?! That I could win her over by acting like a serial killer?!?! And then involving my work colleagues in this?!?!? Wtf was I thinking.... really liked her and thought I would be better than this in my first relationship....  its not all my fault, in hindsight its weird that she wanted to call me ""her boyfriend "" after 4 days of dating, which made me think she was more up for stuff like this than I thought, but still I don't know how to deal with this as I'm in perpetual cringe mode right now.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1004326,public,self,"I am questioning my mental sanity right now, I feel like a crazy person",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pn7rax/i_am_questioning_my_mental_sanity_right_now_i/,all_ads,6,,,

Recently I’ve told him how I’m feeling, saying I’m a little insecure about my English and my “intelligence”. I don’t know how other girls would feel if they get those comments from guys and if they could laugh it off, but I don’t like it when it comes to “pretty” and “not smart” at the same time.

Anyway he said he didn’t mean anything serious with what he said, and if I couldn’t laugh at myself, I ain’t gonna like him in person.

Am I acting too serious about this?

We haven’t met yet, lockdown of course. But I’m usually be said as funny and friendly and chill by many people and I actually am. Not sure if I’m making this a big deal as I still want to meet him in person after lockdown.

Sure my English is not perfect, but getting the jokes-native jokes, I probably should get a very highhhhhh certificate I guess.

He had me blocked on IG/FB until early last month but hadn’t reached out until now. We are long distance of 3 hours. The breakup was completely random and he dumped me like garbage suddenly with no care for me or my emotions. He claimed at the time he was too stressed but refused to give me details, communicate like an adult and shut me out completely ice cold from his life. Well, after a summer of pain and hurt thinking about him every day he texted me apologizing and asking to speak to me. We talked and it was interesting… He ultimately said he ended it due to stress piling up mainly from a legal battle he was having with his ex wife regarding cyst of their son. He didn’t want me involved so he didn’t tell me any of it. At the time right before the breakup he had mentioned he was stressed due to work but refused to say anything else. In some ways I find this very hard to believe that it was only a custody battle and I think there’s more he’s not telling me. Plus how do I know he didn’t date some girl all summer, got bored with and lonely and reached back out. He claims he didn’t do anything with another girl but I don’t know if I believe that. He claims he’s missed me and thought about me all the time and still cares about me. Then why wait 3 months to contact me? I have more questions and need more explanations, I’m not making any decisions right now. He smashed my heart into a hundred pieces causing me enormous amounts of pain and now my walls are back up. If we continued again down a road of more I don’t know if I could fully trust him not to get stressed and dump me out of the blue again. I also have no idea what it would look like for him to regain my trust. This is an abnormal situation and things would not continue traditionally. He would need to go to therapy to improve how he deals with stress. Because I assume he’s made no effort to change or improve himself. Otherwise he would repeat the past. 

All of this is extremely confusing for me. It’s tugging on my heart strings. Half of me hoped he would come back and half of me thought I’d never ever hear from him again. I cannot deny I’ve missed him and seeing him on FaceTime again got me missing him. I’ve missed him all summer, I’ve thought about him everyday. Ironically the night before he reached out I was crying about him and had a dream about him. Various friends have given me different and good advice to think about. Ultimately this is now up to me. I feel stressed and unsure. But I need to talk more to him. This may take time and patience.

We are mutual friends and had met once before (8 months ago). It started off on some sexual footing without really getting to know each other. I had a problem with the sexual nature at the time and he apologised about it saying he’s not that type of guy.

Until maybe 2-3 months ago I had messaged him a couple times to hang out but he lives quite far away (hour away) and I didn’t view him in high enough regard to chase it up so no meet up was ever established. Every time he used to say he’ll definitely message me when he’s near my area but he genuinely never was. He’s quite principled so I don’t think he would purposely be deceiving or disrespectful. Nonetheless he would watch everything I did on social media and that’s the predominant way we stayed connected.

Then about a week ago I asked to catch up regarding something purely business related stating blatantly that I wasn’t asking him out this time. I genuinely had in mind to be only professional and nothing more. So we hung out for the first time properly one-to-one a couple nights ago over some wine and the conversation progressed from business talks to personal demons. 

Just upon talking about deeper topics very personal to us, us getting along extraordinarily smoothly (not a single dull or awkward moment and convo flowing great) and some attraction vibes (eye contact) I mentally assumed that it was a bit of a date. And at the end he wanted to pay “as the man” so that confirmed it as somewhat romantically meaningful. It definitely was the best “date” I’ve ever had in my life. And I know he was very impressed by me on both a personal and professional level (particularly personal - he was vocal about his positive view of me). There was no kiss/sex/physical intimacy, but I didn’t expect it to go that way (yet!) considering our little issue 8 months ago. 

At the end, He did say he wanted to catch up again and I responded with the same. He replied to something on my social media story the next morning, we spoke very briefly about the evening and he said he’s very curious about me. I reciprocated the sentiment. 

I understand I need to be patient. But...

She wasn't willing then, but we have remained on good terms. I wasn't able to talk to her last year, and I started to see her again the year. I told her I wanted to spend more time together, and she invited me to walk to her house with her after school, but due to our schedules I wasn't able to walk with her till a few days later, so within those few days I told her we should hang out some time for a few hours when she was free, and she told me she was free this weekend. We made plans to go to the movies, but then she got into a fight with her grandpa, so I asked if we could just hang out at her place, as to be more relaxing, and we planned to hang out that Saturday. I finally got to walk with her that Friday and she told me she appreciated me walking with her, and I told her I was glad to and enjoyed it a lot, and she said I was welcome to walk with her anytime. That Saturday she had work till 4pm, and I texted her after she got off work and she said that her best friend (who she hasn't been able to see in over a year) asked if she could come over and spend the night. She said that she would try to work something out so we could still hang out, but after a while I just told her that she should spend time with her friend (although I didn't tell her this and I don't know if she knows, but her friend hates me for some reason) and I didn't want to make it akward for her. I'm pretty confused overall, since I'm almost sure she knows I still like her, and I dont know that she would just be willing to hang out alone with someone she knows likes her unless she likes me back. It's had me really anxious all week, and I'm really hoping I don't come off as super bothersome about the whole ordeal, but I'm gonna keep trying to find some time for us to be together. My self esteem is pretty low and I've never had a girlfriend or even really thought of any girl other than her as long as I've known her, so I don't have a lot of confidence, and it's hard not to confess how I really feel for her when I tell her that I enjoyed hanging out or had a good time, and I don't feel like that's the right approach with her because before when I told her straight up how I felt she turned me down, saying that she just isn't ready for a boyfriend, (and to my knowledge she hasn't had a boyfriend or girlfriend since I've been talking to her,).
  Im hoping to talk to her in person tomorrow, because I can't communicate very well through text, and try to get some better understanding of the whole situation, but I'm gonna let her take her time with the whole situation. It just makes me so damn anxious thinking about how she feels about me, or how stupid I'm gonna act around her.

I was asleep. Next morning I text her “It was nice to meet you too, dinner sounds nice! What are you thinking?” 

*She didn’t respond 4 hrs later and it’s 1pm. Found out she unmatched me on bumble. * (hindsight, apparently this is not uncommon after meeting up)

Me: If you’re feeling indecisive about meeting up again, that’s totally fine! No pressure. (we were joking all night about how her indecision was her defining trait). It was a pleasure getting to know. Good luck with school and opening up your business! 

She responds saying “Ah sorry its been a busy morning! Oh…well thanks 😐”
Me: *called to clear things up.*
Her: *declines call*Sorry im with my sister and her kids rn!
Me: Oh I assumed since we unmatched on bumble.
Called to say I enjoyed my night with you. Would take you up on your dinner offer.
Her: For sure, I’ll look up some places and hopefully in a couple weeks we can schedule a day!!
Me: That works. Thanks for working with my busy schedule. Get in touch with me when you find a decent spot with free parking!
Her: Will do and of course!

Don’t really know what to make of this situation.
My current assessment: she likes me but also has doubts (maybe I came on too strong trying to kiss her). She unmatched me but kept her bumble so she’s keeping her options open. She’s a slow moving and indecisive person. 

Would love people’s view on this. What do you think is going on? Why “couple weeks” then schedule a day? Is she just being polite and hoping we never follow up? Is she just not sure yet and keeping her options open by having time to go on other dates between then?

So, I’m in a bit of a bad way and can’t stop panicking. I (male, 33 years old) have been in a relationship with this guy (42 years old) for almost 2 years now. This was his first relationship. He came out about 6 years ago, and his parents reacted quite badly (his dad started crying and they didn’t talk about it again, and his mom just told him not to tell anyone else in the family). His sister (44) has never been in a relationship, which I’ve always found strange. They both depend quite a lot on their parents, and until recently my boyfriend’s mom would do all his laundry/ironing and most of his cooking. She’d almost come to clean his flat, where we both live (I moved in a few months ago). 

Anyway, since I met him, he has had a tendency to see things negatively. He basically doesn’t enjoy anything – going out, his job (he’s a doctor), often I get the sense he doesn’t really enjoy our relationship. He kind of just seems neutral/negative about everything in life. He’s said a few times, jokingly, you’ve complicated my life; life was much easier when I was single (which is basically his entire life). He’s always complained that we don’t have enough sex (it’s true, some weeks when we’ve both been working lots, we’ve only had sex once a week), and when we do, it doesn’t meet his expectations (he’s by no means a very sexual person, as you can imagine of someone who doesn’t get a lot of enjoyment out of life in general). He has also been hassling me to go to the gym, and he says I need more muscles for him to be properly attracted to me. My friends say he’s seen too many movies and doesn’t have any experience, so has completely unrealistic expectations (he also compares himself to everyone going).

Anyway, I’m from UK (we live in Spain) and want to go back, as my job prospects are dismal in Spain (I’m self employed and the conditions are horrendous). We’ve talked about it, and he applied for a job at a hospital in England. He was offered the job and now just has to pass an English exam to get his license to practice, before starting. At the same time, he’s studying for a public exam to get a fixed-term position in Spain, as he says he doesn’t want to leave Spain without having a job to come back to (here, civil servants can leave and come back to a job with their name on it ha). Now he’s saying he can’t leave his family (btw, I can’t go their house when he goes because of his dad’s homophobia, so I feel like, I don’t have my family here, and can’t have a relationship with his either, which is shit). He literally is just thinking about his needs and I’m pretty sure that if he had to choose between carrying on working in Spain or our relationship (in the UK), he’d choose the former. I fact I’m almost positive, as not once has he said something like “let’s do this together”, “what do you need?”, and just goes on and on about how he can’t leave his family, his apartment, his current hospital, etc. The way I work in relationships just isn’t like that – I think a couple should be a team who embark upon projects together and are flexible in terms of the other’s needs. Maybe, I’m being unrealistic as well on that point, and that’s not how couples work.

Anyway, yesterday everything he looked at me, he’d kiss me and say “such a shame” or something along those lines and look sad. Then yesterday, he said, he’ll have to talk one day about where we’re going. So I’m now in a panic. I live with him in his flat, and I don’t know if he’s going to want to break up. Am I right in thinking it’s almost a given at this point that he will break up with me? Any other advice would be very greatly welcomed 😊.

I’ve been dating a girl for about 2 months now and I’ve never quite dated anyone like her before. 

Now, I’ve dated a lot of women, gone on a lot of dates and have enough experience with different cultures to have a good sense for dating new people.

She’s the most quiet person I’ve ever dated. Usually, I ask a lot of questions and am genuinely interested in the people I date and they talk a bunch. 

She answers my questions and is very pleasant and laughs at jokes, but almost goes silent after a question is answered. Without asking follow-ups of her own.

It’s not that she isn’t interested, from what I can tell. She is always engaged and excited to go on dates together. 

But she is shy on a level I haven’t experienced before. Someone stiff, might be a little awkward but I haven’t seen her outside of 1-on-1 dates.

We hardly text. And when we do, it’s to schedule our next date and hangout. I’m fine with not texting, since I’m more of a caller, but we don’t call either.

We’ve had sex, and make-out passionately together. I really enjoy our physical chemistry.

She recently invited me on an exotic trip outside the country. I’ll meet almost her entire immediate family. 

She told me she’s never been in a relationship, and never introduced a guy to her family before. 

Despite all of this, I still can’t read her at all or how she feels. I’ve never dated a girl that was this shy, or at least who didn’t open up more after a lot of dates.

I don’t know much about her on a deeper level, her insecurities, her flaws. She doesn’t know mine either, but she hasn’t asked.

I guess I say all this to ask, is she just very shy/awkward and doesn’t know how to communicate with dates? Anyone with experience like this before?

I’ve never seen her interact with friends or family so I’m excited for our trip to get to learn about her more.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1004596,public,self,Can someone help me better understand this girl I’m dating?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pnb0zn/can_someone_help_me_better_understand_this_girl/,all_ads,6,,,

I was stupid enough to give into his family's pressure. But in all honesty the chemistry/click was just not there.

Thankfully we parted ways before we got married - my therapist asked me to not settle and to not give into pressure. She also told me that chemistry is essential for a successful relationship.

A year after that through OLD I met Guy Y. He was nice and even handsome but a few things stopped me.

1. He made a comment about how American women sleep around and aren't cultured.
2. He told me that his friends are homophobic so he brings up topics around gay men in front of them to make them feel uncomfortable.

I felt he was old school and judgemental to think the above things and to have friends who are homophobic.

3. This is superficial I know - he had an Indian accent which I don't mind at all. But he would say a few words with such a thick accent that would turn me off. 

4. I had not dated much so I was not yet good at sex and in fact I was a bit scared of it. And I don't think I was ready for all of that yet.

After a few dates, I decided to not pursue him.

I'm still very much into her, and I think that potentially a big part of the date going poorly could be attributed to her being in a bad mood in general that day as she was tired.

I have completed my Army training, started a career, got my own place, and am financially independent. Online dating sucks, so what’s my current mission to go from bachelor to stable, long-term relationship?

Some possibly helpful information:
- I’m super Bi. I like dudes, I like girls, I like humans. I’ve got a pension for femboys and tattooed, goth/punk girls.
- I’m a teacher, so I have a pretty normal schedule (7am to 4pm)
- No drugs, and I’m sober (but I don’t care if my partner drinks). 
- I live in Northern Louisiana
- I’m Christian, but don’t expect that out of my partner.
