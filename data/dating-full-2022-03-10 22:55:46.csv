We instantly clicked, had similar interests, humor, views, field of work. He showed his interest in a respectful not-pushy manner, but I just sat there like mashed potatoes and kept my distance. 

The reason I kept my distance is cause at the time I was in the middle of pursuing a job that would have offered a three-year contract abroad starting March 1st, so I felt that showing interest for a few weeks, allowing feelings to evolve only to say ""we'll continue this later, specifically three years later"" would have been cruel and a complete mess for both sides. Fast forward to present day, and I did not take the job, chose to stay with my current job instead. 

Thing is, I still have this encounter stuck in my mind. It bothers me because I left things unfinished and it keeps popping in my head that maybe, just maybe, I should reach out and let my feelings out, particularly the reason I didn't budge at first. Even if that ship has sailed and nothing happens, I'd still like to give an explanation cause I'd hate to be the reason someone's confidence is broken. I've been at that end, it sucks big time, and I don't want to do it to someone else. 

The next thing is, towards people that I am attracted to, I'm usually shy as fuck and I have no idea how to start this conversation which probably sounds waaay better in my head than when I would actually do it.

I asked this girl out on Monday, she replied ""uh sure, it's gonna be hard with Anastasia but I'd be down"" a bit of back story, I'm a tech for theatre, and she is an actor, our production we are just barely starting is Anastasia. we didn't establish a date when I first asked her because she was really busy at that exact moment, But I wasn't gonna get another shot to ask her for a while so I just went for it. As stated she said yes. I've texted her twice, first I asked her if she wanted to go on Friday, she said she had rehearsals all day on Friday and it wouldn't work, I then asked about Saturday, she said she thinks it would be better if we waited to go out till after Anastasia, I reluctantly said yes and that was that,  


by the time our production is over, it's gonna be like a month and a half in the future or later. She doesn't seem overly into me to begin with, and I feel like in 2 months time, she's gonna completely forget and just strait up not go out with me. My issue is that she is one of the most amazing persons I've ever met, I've never met someone such an amazing personality, not to mention she is super cute. she's too special for me to just forget about it. And it pains me to think that I have wait 2 ish months to MAYBE get a date.

I just want to take her out on a date and tell her all the amazing things I think about her, but I'm afraid I'll never get the chance to do it on a date like I want to.

I'm 22 and I don't have a lot of sober time and aren't wanting to date anytime soon, but the consensus seems to be (for women specifically) that this is a dealbreaker. I have a lot of baggage anyway, serious domestic violence, passing of my mother at 16, out of my ten direct family members, 9 have been addicted and 6 have died, etc. and for a short life I have experienced a lot. I'm very hardened and resilient and am committed to not drinking or using and try to help others.

I never stole, I never seriously harmed others, I never manipulated people to get what I want. I'm atypical as an addict in that I did what I did by myself to myself and wasn't running around buying drugs, stealing, getting arrested etc. but this seems to be what people will think of me if I tell them. It seems like you typically only end up dating other people with baggage if you have baggage, and other people affected by addiction if you suffer from addiction. 

I feel like my drug addiction is just a blip in my life, but will follow me my whole life and scare people away. I mean, I'm reading the search query and this shit does not look good. Most women that date seem to not want to be with men in recovery, let alone young women. They just don't want it. In my opinion, if two years from now I start dating and a girl says ""I used to hit the booze hard when I was in college. I was a full blown alcoholic. I went to rehab at 22 and don't drink anymore. I value that period of my life for teaching me who I am"", I'd respect it. What I'm getting from seeing these discussions is that I'm untrustworthy and not worth the trouble. 

We feel isolated enough as it is, and are told to love ourselves, but aren't recognized as having any esteem. I'm pretty down about all this, it feels like I've marked myself forever and that once you go, you just never come back and you're forever just not a normal person. If you take a wrong turn, you just go that way forever, the people that haven't been through and recovered from such severe trauma and illness want to remain unstained and avoid all that. It's easier to poison the well than it is to purify the water, if that makes sense. 

Also, looking at discussions related to dating recovering alcoholics yields entirely different points of view than discussions about dating addicts. I'd argue that alcoholism is worse than certain drug addictions, but one is seen with a shade of understanding and the other comes with presumptions of speedballing naked under a bridge and shooting off guns like Yosemite Sam.

A bit of hyperbole there but it explains how I feel, like shit. Any words of advice would be appreciated, now that I am clean I feel like I fucked up my whole life and I've just tarnished my esteem as a human.

I was the one who initiated a cute date and asked what he thinks of us dating for 2 months. He can be shy sometimes, so he said it’s good. I nudged again asking how he’s feeling about us and how he would describe us. He said well we’re definitely dating, and he likes where it’s going. I asked if we’re exclusive, and we confirmed we’ve both been exclusive this whole time. He sensed that I wanted more to be said, and he asked “are you ready to be official already?” I said yes are you? He said he would’ve asked me to be his gf sometime during the next few weeks and that while I haven’t met his friends yet, he said it’s heading the direction of a relationship and said “did you want to be my gf?” I asked if that’s really what he wants, he said “sure” jokingly and then said “Yes” when I reacted to that. I prefer when the guy takes the lead but wanted some clear answers as it was on my mind for a while. Now I feel like I pushed him and we’ve entered into something that I’m not sure he’s ready for, and honestly I don’t know if I am either. But how do I bring this up without making it even more awkward or messing it up? Maybe I can suggest that I don’t want him to feel pressured/rushed into it if he’s not ready, but also I’m open to continuing now that we’ve become official? I’m worried about the emphasis he put on me meeting his friends; what if they don’t approve and he wants to break up? Do you all meet friends before/after becoming official? Any advice is appreciated, thank you!!

TLDR: I feel that I pressured the guy I’ve been dating for 2 months to being official with me, and he didn’t seem fully into it when he asked me to be his gf.

I’ve (30m) been single for about a year and a half. I left my girlfriend because we had been drifting apart for a while and it was apparent that neither of us were happy. After we split a girl in a long-term relationship expressed serious interest in me and I told her it wasn’t fair to me or her boyfriend and that if she really was interested she knew there was only one way we could end up together. Needless to say we never got together, but she had become so hostile to me to the point where I really kind of backed off from dating all together. There was one girl after her that I went on a couple dates with but pulled the plug because I wasn’t feeling it.
Fast forward to October. I start a new job, I meet this incredible girl (24f) I work with. She’s really pretty, totally stunning so there’s no way she’s not taken. We get along great, we have a great back and forth, overall good chemistry. Obviously start crushing. After a few weeks I find out that she is in fact in a relationship so I know she’s off-limits. No biggy, back to the disappointing struggle of online dating. Three weeks ago she was on vacation. Her bf cheated and she left him. I told her how sorry I felt and how unfair that was to her, and told her “if it’s any consolation when you think you’re ready I’d love the privilege to take you out.” She gave me a big smile and squeezed my arm and said “I’ll keep you in mind.” I texted her a little while later saying “you can hold me to that. Whenever you’re ready just name the time and the place.” She reacted with a ❤️ emoji. We continued as we had, a little flirty, nothing serious etc.
We’ve been talking for about a week and I’m trying not to blow up her phone because I don’t want to come at her so hard considering she just got out of a long-term relationship but she and I have been snap chatting and texting. I suggested earlier in the week that we hang out sometime soon and got a “yeah maybe soon“ Ok, not too enthusiastic, makes sense though she is newly single.
The other night she went to Home Depot to get new blinds because the ones in her room broke. Asked if she had measured them or at least brought the broken ones with her to match the size and she said she measured but she wasn’t sure if she got it right. Long story short, she got the wrong blinds. I joked to her
“should’ve called your handyman over” 

Her “for real, I can pay you in weed” 

Me “to be honest I would really rather just spend some time with you.”

Her “lol booo you’re no fun!” 

Me “no fun? You must not know me lol. I’m trying to see you so we can actually have fun, but you’re sending mixed signals. tbh I’m not trying to blow you up bc Ik you need time but I’d love to hang out I just don’t want to rush you”

She came at me with “yikes, I’m not trying to date I didn’t mean to send you mixed signals I thought you were just being friendly”

I was pretty surprised and said “I told you like a week ago that I’d love to take you out and there was no rush and you responded really positively. Not trying to pressure you, I really care about you so I’m not trying to be overbearing” 

She was appreciative and thanked me for respecting her. Obviously I was going to be, if I didn’t care about her I wouldn’t have any reason to respect her.

Needless to say I’m pretty beat down. I got led on hard by the last girl that was seemingly interested and she totally flipped on me and began to harass me. That was a little over a year ago and it left a bad taste in my mouth. This time around felt too good to be true but a handful of situations between she and I gave me enough reason to believe she was interested. I was so reluctant to put myself out there this time for fear of a repeat situation but told myself it was pointless not to shoot my shot. Idk I’m just really down and just feel like I’m never going to find someone. I could start dating someone tonight if I wanted, but I have no interest in any of the people that swipe me. I’m just so damn tired of never being what the person I’m interested in wants. Dating apps have damaged my self esteem, I don’t have any friends to go out with anymore, and I don’t know how I’m going to find anyone. I’m so tired of coming home to a quiet empty apartment.

Certainly COVID-lockdown being the most recent period.  But I have never considered myself to be an alcoholic.   

In any-case, I decided to try a soul searching cleanse and have been sober for the last 6 months— am feeling wonderful and that I’ve made major gains in my health and productivity just in that short time without it.

I am being tested now, but perhaps it’s not as much of a test as it looks? 

Onto the recent events..

Girl asks me out on tinder —similar interests, work in related fields And we are both seeking casual connections…also she’s new in town, sounds promising.

She suggested a bar, I explained I was on a bit of a break from drinking and she was cool with that and respected me for it. 

Date 1:  Casual, pizza joint— it’s nice, she’s cool, walk around afterward, talk all night, Not a ton of flirting.  I felt naturally pretty reserved, seems she did too.    I was unprepared for this— as I’ve always used alcohol as a means to help my flirting and “game” so-to speak.   So I felt pretty square and uncool in short.

Night ends with a hug.   Not the worst date, not the best date in my opinion.

Few days later— To my surprise really, she asks me out a 2nd time.

Date 2:  Movies and bar for drinks (ginger ale for me, glass of wine for her )

She was actually pretty cool about my no-boozing but I feel like she may have perhaps went tame herself on account of me. Makes sense. But I did feel bad as if I was holding back her/our fun.  

As far as flirting goes, we sat close, and generally had better, free flowing conversation this time around..we stay talking until the bar closes.

It’s late ofocurse and I’m calling an Uber home for myself, offer to take her back to her place too.

It’s freezing outside and I make the first bold move of the two dates and grab both her hands to warm up… once that happened, She kisses me, making out. And it’s amazing ya’ll. The kiss was the MOST RELAXED I had been with her.  After that moment, I felt totally like myself, comfortable. No more elephant in the room or something.

When the Uber pulls up, she asks to come home with me.  I was honestly shocked, but so down.

The foreplay and sex to follow was incredible, I don’t know what made it so special for me. But I cannot get her off my mind.    already asked her out again.. I think I’m crushing hard… seemingly out of nowhere. I wouldn’t have pictured this feeling from Date number 1.   

OH but back to the sobriety, I’m dying to drink suddenly. I found this all to be a major trigger…what’s triggering is this bullshit story I’m telling myself about her not wanting to continue dating eventually because I’m seen as someone who can’t let loose in the same way as her.  I dunno.

As date number 3 comes up, I wish to avoid sending me into a panic.

I'm scared to try online dating again, to be honest. Y'all can probably list the shortcomings of sites these days better than I can, but I've seen talk about paywalls, bots, lack of content, unsolicited NC-17 photos, unsuccessful algorithms, and generally having to be smarter than the app. And back when I did online dating, I had trouble finding anyone online.

I've seen comments saying ""I'd make it myself, but . . ."" Well, why not just do it? Why not give the people what they want?

Really, all we need are the right people with the right skills to put the site together, and a test group. Well, I wouldn't be surprised if there were a buttload of volunteers to try it right here on Reddit. As far as skills go, off the top of my head, there's the idea/vision team, marketing, research, web design, coding, and, last but not least, lawyers to help us not get sued by various dating site monopolies for trying to actually make people satisfied instead of lighter in pocket hundreds. I, admittedly, have none of these skills, but I'm certain there's people out there who would love to put their heads together on something like this. Oh, and a sugar daddy.

I'm in my mid 30s (M) and I find it's pretty challenging to date someone in my area due to how rural it is. In fact, I've expanded my area when it comes to dating and still have a hard time trying to match with people a couple of cities away. However, I never want to date people that are more than a few years younger than me. I prefer to date people in my own generation, or older. I know it's my own projection and I know I'm painting with broad brushes here, but I can't help but feel that most women do not want to date someone in their same age range unless they're incredibly more successful than they are.

Again, I know I'm generalizing and it doesn't apply to everyone.

I feel that men, typically date younger/ women date older for the reasons that we're use to seeing in society. IE: Men want someone younger because they want that hot young lady, and women want older men because they're more mature, distinguished, and stable (financially and emotionally) than they're peers.

I don't subscribe to this mentally. Again, I prefer to date people in my similar age range. I want to joke about Seinfeld and the golden era of The Simpsons, not SpongeBob.

However, I think I'm going to have to throw in the towel. There's no one in my age range in my area. All the desirable women are in they're mid 40's and I've been turned down by all of them for the age difference (Yes, they've said so).

However, as we’re discussing options for college, she’s really adamant about going abroad and establishing our lives there during college. This is just kind of stressing me out- I always saw myself as finishing the entirety of my education in the US prior to moving, but we both agree that her education and career takes priority over mine since she would be the “breadwinner” of our family. I am planning on establishing a small gallery, which can virtually be done anywhere, whereas she needs to be in certain places for her career. This is just kind of stressing me out. I’m worried if she goes international and I don’t, we won’t be able to see each other enough to sustain our relationship, but I’m also terrified I won’t be social enough if I go out of the country. I think I need a “safety net” so to speak, and to me, that’s being in the US where I know I can drive anywhere to my friends within a day or two.

For background: I live in a very shallow city where hookup culture is extremely prevalent. People do not date here. I have enough FWBs and I am ready to seriously date. Because of that, I have tried to express that to guys early on so I don’t waste my time. 

Anyways, I matched with this guy Rob on bumble and he invited me to this club. It was his birthday and he had a table. I told him I couldn’t go cause I had plans with my friends. He texted me later that night saying, “do u want to come to my place tonight then?” I said “uhhhh no, but you can take me on a date.” I SAID THIS FULLY EXPECTING HE WOULD NOT BE DOWN. 

But then the next morning he calls me and asked if he could take me to brunch. So I go. Normally when I go on dates, I don’t think much of them. But as soon as I met him, it was like everything clicked. He was attractive, working on his second masters (I am also working on my masters), values empathy and helping others. So I had an amazing time. I told him straight up, “I am looking to date. I don’t want another FWB so I thought I should be up front now.” He said, “idk how to respond to that. I know I like you but I also am working all the time and I am not sure how much I can commit to a relationship.” Then we agreed to just hang out and see how things go. 

He asked if I wanted to go to his birthday dinner that same day but I had other plans at that time. But he was also going to a club afterwards and said I could meet him at that. So I go to the club with my friends. When I go out, I love to dance. He likes to sit at the table with his friends. So I was dancing and some guy came up to me. Rob didn’t like this, stepped in and was like “why are you entertaining this guy?” I told him I wasn’t, he just came up to me. He pretty much made it clear that he was only interested in me, and wanted me to act the same. 

Following this, he asked if he could stay the night at my place. I told him he could but we would not be having sex. He said that was fine. I also had to drive my friends home and on the way- he bought them food, and me food which was nice. 

We go back to my place and this is what he said: “After you told me you wanted to date, I felt like I didn’t give you a clear answer on where I stand. I talked to my friends about it for a while and it was an emotional conversation. I already know I really like you but I am just nervous.” So we talked about our fears and I told him we could just take things slow and get to know each other. 

He texts me the next day to try and figure out plans for the week. This is the problem: My classes go until 7pm and 10pm some nights. He goes to bed at 7pm and wakes up at 4am for work. He was also going out of town for the weekend and wouldn’t be back until Sunday. He said, “well you can come over to my place after class and I can order you dinner and I’ll just go to bed later. We can also hang out Sunday when I am back.” I decided to get all my work done so I could meet him after class. 

I show up and THE VIBE IS OFF. He couldn’t understand my jokes, was acting very different and off. He then tells me that he is has “undiagnosed autism.” This made sense because he spoke with the same tone of voice (I perceived this as him being mad). He also got very upset when I touched his face (sensory issues). Aside from that, he said things that were offensive but he didn’t mean for them to be. Long story short, the night did not go good. I mentioned to him that things felt off and he said, “I’m sorry to disappoint you, I didn’t feel that way.” 

So when I left I felt very confused. Since we had an amazing first date, I held on to that. I thought- okay ill give this another shot, maybe once I understand how he communicates things will get better. 

So I text him and ask if we are still hanging out Sunday. He said “I have a lot of work so I would just do your own thing.” 

At this point I was confused bc he said he had nothing going on Sunday. So I call him and say, “I know last night was weird. Or at least I felt that way. But I figured I would give things another chance to see if we can communicate better. Maybe it was just an off day. But I get the sense that you aren’t interested and I would rather you tell me now”

He said, “well, I do have work to do. But also, idk what you are expecting. It seems like you are in a rush with things and idk if I can commit to anything.” I said, “I’m not in a rush. But if I am going to get to know you, I have to spend time with you. And our schedules don’t align so Sunday is really our only day to hang out.” 

He then lectured me about how I am “moving too fast” and that I need to “think more about what he said.” And then hung up. Obviously this guy is not for me.

I recently came into a discussion with someone about dating and wanted to ask a question and feedback about it.

Just a little info on myself, I’m a 25 year old white south Slav and really have only dated two people in my life. One was half Asian half white and the other Asian.

Whilst talking to a recent match (whom is Asian as well) he posed a question if I only had a preference for Asians (yellow fever he called it) which at first took me a bit back because I never really thought about it before as I have very limited dating record. I have never really not swiped for someone of a race (I swipe for people depending on personality that I read on profiles and some physical preferences) but I wanted to deep dive my mental to see if I was really making a preference to Asians. 

So as I began deep diving and looking at my swipe history I have noticed I swipe pretty consistently even amount for all races maybe more on the white side due to what’s demographically around me. But I get more matches with Asians than other races. I then dived into why I’m attracted to these individuals, was it a stereotype that I have in my subconscious or something else ? And by looking at my match history I have come to notice I have a preference for people who have dark hair and dark eyes and more defined facial features.

Which of course most Asians have dark hair and dark eyes. So no I’m sitting here wondering if this is because I have a preference for Asians ? Or is this just my other preferences coming to the for front ? 

A large factor of how I choose who I like has to do with personality, do they show respect ? Are they uncultured? These are all factors that go through my head when I match and talked with people. Nothing irks me more than someone who shows a lack of respect for one’s culture. 

So here I am on Reddit asking for day and input on this situation that I am dealing with. What do you guys think ? Am I subconsciously having a racial bias ?

im just curious as to what it could mean and if anyone else has any experience of something like this before.  as well as what i should do. 

thank you!

The first 4.5 we’re great. So I get kind of chatty with people that I like and just kind of dump my brain out (sorry if I do that now), and I often make bad jokes. She’s told me that she doesn’t mind when I talk a lot and she likes it, and she usually laughs at my jokes even if they’re really not good. So I sometimes end up doing some light teasing and it gets a positive reaction. 

Everything was great tonight but then I said I might have to go (which she usually tells me not to) and she said that I should probably go and that she had to feed her cat. When I leave her house she often gives me a kiss and says bye but tonight she just kind of said bye and didn’t even give me a hug. I’m not saying I really care about a goodbye kiss or hug all that much, but it stood out because of the already weird circumstance. She told me that she didn’t really like some of my jokes that made fun of her (trust me they weren’t THAT bad, but she’s kind of sensitive to the ones about her so I really shouldn’t have said them, I wasn’t thinking right) so I apologized and said I don’t mean them, I was saying an awful joke, and that I really like her and I don’t want to do anything to mess what we have up. She said it was really not a big deal and it was fine, and said that she’d see me soon but I can’t help but think that I said something that really hurt her feelings and I was being super annoying and I f-ed up. 

The last time I was at her house, she asked if I could stay the night, but tonight she seemed like she just wanted me gone. I think I went to far with my stupid shit and struck and nerve and she could be just fed up with my chatty bs. I feel really bad and want to text her to apologize again, but I don’t want to be super clingy and annoying. However, I know I’m gonna feel really bad for a while and overthink this until I convince myself that I completely ruined it with an amazing person. Should I give it a day or two and then text? I might bump into her tomorrow so should I apologize then or just don’t acknowledge it and try to be a better person?

I am 20, and I have this friend from college. A week ago, she had a masquerade party in her apartment. I was invited, to everyone's surprise, I did go. I dressed like an anime maid, my costume was cute, and I felt good about myself. It was the first time going out after years and of my own will actually, I trust her and she always treated me very kindly.

I got there late and expected to be so full, as she had told me there would be about 20 people, and I had anxiety about it. Not very good with people, but there were just three boys and another college friend we both made this year. One of the boys was her bf and the other two of his friends, she introduced us and um well nobody got what I was dressed as. Anime is not a very common thing here, but one of the boys did, and he liked it. He was sitting on the couch, and my feet were killing me from walking in heels but um I was nervous to sit next to him.

At first, I was kind of overwhelmed with how many people came and so many new faces. I was in my corner. But dear old alcohol helped warm up and be a little looser. Some girls came up to me and we had a conversation but honestly, my mind kinda was drifting to that boy from earlier and I was looking around for him sneakily. I was interested in talking to him but when they played beer pong I was on the couch and when he was on the couch I was playing. I gave up and just sat down on a chair, one of the girls I met earlier was sitting there and we had a lovely conversation about the society we live in and its toxic expectations. 

I remember at some point, later on, I just sat on a chair and I was holding like water bottles in my arms cause someone took my seat, so I was awkwardly there and then I notice that he is next to me and he just glances at me holding those bottles in my arms and I am so embarrassed and so close I just stood up minutes after he like turn to the group conversation he was in. I when to the other side of the room. 

Later into the night, I am again continuing that conversation with that girl, and another join us but things got awkward and there was tension and the girl I was talking with got quiet and left and I was just didn't get why, after the party, I got why, the one that came after is not such a good friend. Anyways, this has a point. So I am now having a conversation with her and that boy comes out of nowhere and asks if a wine stain can come off. She didn't know what to say so I spoke cause I knew. Told him with cold water and dish shop it will be mostly gone and when he goes home he can throw it in the washer and it was never there. 

He asks me if he should let it dry or go now, and I told him you are already gone. He left for the bathroom and that girl start talking again but I was looking at him struggling to get the stain off his shirt, small apartment and he didn't close the door to the bathroom. I was thinking if I should go help but I was worried he will think I am creepy and also be rude to the left that girl mid conversation. I didn't do anything. 

It was getting late and everyone was kinda getting tired, so we sat all together and he offered to play a game, we played never have I ever but he sat on the ground next to me and I couldn't concentrate at all. Still, I don't remember the questions. They played more games after that but I stepped out cause I was so tired and confused. 

The night ended at five in the morning, I walked home in the cold air to cool off but when I got home and finally touched my phone there was a notification of him following me. I freaked out but I couldn't do anything. Of all the people I talked to that night non-one followed me even days later, he was the only one and we didn't even speak at all. I am not saying it means something cause he followed other people too, that he just met but it was just me and another girl from college he could flirt with. 

The party was Saturday and till Monday I was losing my mind worried about the way I felt. I... it's weird still. But I decided to ask my friend about him you know, I barely knew a single thing about him, maybe he had a girlfriend and all that. So I gather all my courage and I when over every possible scenario cause I was worried about how my friend will react. I was stressing too much. 

Throughout the class, I was practicing what to say and ask but when the class ended she stood up approached that other girl, and asked, did he text you? I felt like I was ripping apart at that moment, I knew it. I had thought of it. I cursed myself for overthinking it so much but I felt lucky I didn't talk to my friend first, so nobody knew my secret. 

After we usually go to eat or drink something, at first when I heard say that I wanted to just get home and cry myself to sleep but I was like no you will go out, nothing happened. So we ate and we gossiped about the party but something I didn't expect happened my friend turns to me and asks me who I liked from the party. Every existing shade of red passed through my face that night. I said no I am not telling you and she had that smirk on her face like she was onto me. Anyways that stopped there and we took a walk and that girl he was texting was with us and she said that sorry, I was confused when you asked me if he texts me cause I am talking to someone else with the same name. She seemed very uninterested in him but honestly, I don't know and I don't want to believe that cause they are talking maybe even now. We left her to a club cause she was going out and we walked home and it was just me and my friend and as we are out of her house I said, I liked him and she asked me sexually I didn't respond and then her eyes when big and she was like aw romantically and she got all happy. It was unexpected. I explained to her that I was worried she will be mad at me and she was like no way would I be mad? And I said cause I don't know, I am been weird and she said no. And asked me if I followed him and I said no he did and she winked at me, then I said well we didn't get to talk much at the party, I wanted but her response was on my next party. Then I followed up with I am confused and she said don't worry you will find it. 

That happened a few days ago and tomorrow I have a class again with her and I feel embarrassed, I hope she doesn't remember it but at the same time, I wanna talk to her about it. I feel crazy, but at the same time, I am all weird and excited cause I met him so organically and he is so nice and just the way he speaks and he thinks, I didn't have a conversation with him but I saw him and heard him have many. His vibe is just so nice. 

I wanna text him but I don't even know what to say. Sorry, this took longer to explain, maybe it's nothing and all in my head. I don't understand how it works or what I should do.

Mind you I noticed this girl when i first saw her and are interaction totally conicidental. I've been more daring as of late and have been approaching beautiful women in a number of different public places, and try to build confidence even if rejected(which is inevitable).

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, So i came into work did some of the harder labor portion of my work and had to cool off - took off my hat and face mask. she walked by (different department) she eyed me while fixing her hair. I took this as an opportunity, though i stewed for a bit and thought i might shoot my shot later in my shift. She walked by, i dropped what i was doing - caught up to her and asked her to be honest - I admitted i wanted to get to know her better. she emphasized she was 18, to which I replied ""well, were both adults"" i continued to talk to her where eventually I said ""would it be okay if i got your number"" she hesitated i replied she didn't have to(as i'm used to rejection at this point) she replied ""sure!"" enthusiastically got my phone and put her number. I let her know I had a decent pad, where once we got to know each other we could chill. She let me know she is bisexual and said some people thinks its weird though i assured her I didn't care. I said, I'd definitely text her - that is pretty much it

I'm nervous how to approach this - whether or not i should explore what she is looking for (maybe a hookup) or getting to know me. which I'd like either way!

I am a huge geek and have done it all. I play video games, used to love anime,  I write fanfiction, binge watch YouTube documentaries on niche pieces of entertainment media etc.

I've had a eb and flow of a dating life over for the years and my preference has always been men into geeky subjects. I always used to want the boyfriend I could sit up with and watch anime or play the game with for hours, talk about nerdy references and cute stuff like that. Theres a meme on the interwebs that shows a woman denying a nerd for a guy whose cool in HS and I was always the opposite of that meme including in adulthood but with the same end result as the meme, the relationships ending badly.

Everytime ive ever dated a super nerdy guy the relationship at best had me dealing with emotional abuse and at worse more than that. I always kind of felt like I was being used as an ego boost to show them theyve got the juice to get a girl more than actually being liked for me. To make it even weirder sometimes these dudes would beg to be with me (sometimes sex, sometimes dating even when just sex was on the table) and when I said sure yeah lets date immediately treat me like dog water after. When it was over sooner or later they'd call me back as if I could just be some on demand girlfriend they could talk to when they're jealous of people in their hood who have girlfriends.

Ive had dudes who fit the more classic idea of dating potential and on top of that acted like I was a person but like an idiot young me used to turn them down over fickle shit like they didnt watch anime or something and Ive paid the price year after year about it. When it comes to discussions on things we disagree on ive given non nerdy dudes some of my time and we can usually come to a disagreement like on what counts as a womens rights issue or something fairly peacefully while I talk to a dude whose into the same stuff I am into and he launches into he-man woman-hater club territory. Rinse and repeat on race, classism, etc. with them cold shouldering me or calling me everything but a child of God after. 

To be fair part of the problem could be the kind of nerds I was dating. I never really went out with the dudes who applied themselves in college or through a tech job they stuck with. It was always the guys who would get high and watch My Hero Academia or play Huniepop, it wasn't like a PhD student or anything but I never wanted that to matter because I didn't watch to be judgmental especially when I am just getting back into school this past year now myself and let some of my own high end tech dreams fall to the wayside many times. 

Part of me feels this is rash but I have had a whole decade of dating experience with mega nerdy men who treated me inhumanly and when you notice a shared common trait in those men its hard not to want to end the pattern. Most of my dating life that has actually have been an ion of healthy has been with the least nerdy of the bunch and I'm just ready to actually give dudes who never watched DBZ or played a hentai game a chance because they seem to be the guys who actually treat me like a human being. 

Me asking reddit for advice on this matter is kind of like going to the belly of the beast on exactly the kind of guy im talking about but I really want to know what I should do. Should I just cope with a healthier but more boring dating life of some guy who at least treats me fair but will probably act like im weird because I binge played a particularly good game for eight hours or should I keep trying to make it work with those I have so many hobbies in common with even though every end situation with those I share hobbies with ends with me wanting to unalive myself?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1163276,public,self,I love nerdy men but they've never loved me,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/tbigco/i_love_nerdy_men_but_theyve_never_loved_me/,no_ads,0.0,,,,

He’s my absolute best friend and he’s always been supportive of whatever I do. From the beginning we have always had sexual chemistry, especially me… I’ve always been a sexual person. but at one point in our relationship he began smoking weed excessively again to the point where it started to become a problem in our relationship— he was prioritizing weed over our relationship basically. One problem led to another and we eventually took a break (his decision). we eventually worked things out, but during our break I went to therapy and worked on myself, and I was finishing to a semester of college. I moved up with him to a different city where he was relocated for work after my semester. During that time, he was feeling Ill so I encouraged him to go to the doctors to get checked (because cancer runs in his family) so he scheduled an appointment and from one day to the next we found out he had stage 4 colon cancer. I’ve been there for him every step of the way— going to all his doctors appointments, double masked everywhere I go, encouraged him to exercise again, getting in the habit of eating healthy, and have been been emotionally supportive. When he first began chemo, I understood we weren’t going to have a sex like for a while because of the side effects and smoking was helping him cope. He was doing chemo for about 8 weeks and just recently switched from chemo to immunotherapy and has been feeling almost himself (which the doctor told him he’s the healthiest cancer patient he had ever seen based on his blood work and that he’s gaining weight back) but now he just smokes because he got used to it again and basically smokes weed all day— he works from home so he’s more relaxed. But it’s been maybe three weeks since we have been intimate and everytime I try to initiate it and just be playful he says he’s not in the mood and even then it’s like we only have sex once a month. I feel like such an asshole and selfish to even think of it, but I miss being intimate with him. I’m a woman and I also have my needs. Ive tried to take care of myself during this time but it’s been difficult because I’m constantly making sure he’s taken care of first. I’ve tried gently expressing how I feel but he makes me feel guilty when I try to bring it up. And as sad as it is, I basically have to turn to porn to fulfill my need but I just don’t want to do that.

I'll be honest, I wasn't immediately romantically attracted to her at first, but as we got closer, I definitely started to develop feelings for her, and I definitely wanted/want to date her/be in a relationship with her or something.

Before uni restarted we were hanging out almost every other day, texting every day, and about 2 weeks ago she came over, we got drunk, and had a pretty intense make out session, and then went to bed cuddling (no sex).

Unfortunately a few nights later I caught covid, and we had to put our plans on hold, which only came harder with Uni starting up again, and in person.

What's weird to me is that for the first few weeks of our friendship she seemed really receptive to our plans to hang out, and she would respond to texts almost instantly, but now she's getting really flakey. She's bailing on plans, and she's taking hours to respond to messages, even when I know she's not doing anything. Even when we do hang out in person, usually in group settings, she comes off as really cold. I saw her for the first time in 2 weeks last night at a party, and I tried to go in for a hug, but all she gave me was a little wave, and I don't think we spoke for more than a minute that night, which kind of really upset me.

While I was in iso, she arranged to come over *tonight*, but now she's bailed. We're also supposed to go and see a movie in a few days, which I guess would be our first ""official"" date, but I'm worried she's going to bail on that too...

So I guess my question is, do I like her more than she likes me, and it's time to move on/just stay friends. Or do y'all just think uni is distracting her, and I'm overthinking this. Or godforbid she regrets making out with me, and doesn't know how to tell me...

I saw that one of the profiles that had requested about 6-8 times followed my boyfriends and some of his friends. All of the pages from the FMCGs brands followed him.

Hey folks of reddit.

I and my friend(F,21) have known each other for 3 years, and we largely communicate over whatsapp, met rarely but speak everyday.

Similar music and movies taste. We recommend each other movies/music oftentimes.

I've ghosted her for a month because I've liked her for the white but I'm not sure if I should ask her out or should I wait. I've had a traumatic past and I'm afraid of attachment. 

She has tried to reach out twice, saying that she thinks about this a damn lot and she needs to clear what's happening before her exams.

It's a thing where it's like I've noticed that if I'm interested in someone and they show the slightest interest in me I become quite clingy like physically clingy which is really bad, I never touch people but this is the only time when I would genuinely want to be super close to them... 
I lack attention and affection from people and I'm so damn touch craved so I think my brain saw this as an opportunity to get this from someone which is too early. 

Everything I did was just so dumb, if I were him then I wouldn't talk to me either. I don't need to be reminded that my actions were just so silly and cringey, I've already been thinking about that and feeling stupid about it ever since I had to go home..

I guess I could convince myself I’d be a “catch” to someone, until I was poking around this guy’s social media and found his ex-girlfriend. I imagine she is exactly what he meant when he wrote that in his bio. She has a very successful career, so much so I don’t even know how I can describe it to you. Not to mention she’s beautiful.
