Looking for what you would make of this weird situation.

I have a guy friend (he's 32M, I'm 32F) who is one of my very closest friends.  We've gone backpacking together, on road trips, even flown to visit our hometown together.  Early on in our friendship, he made it known that he was interested (asked where I would have kissed him if given the chance), and I friend-zoned him because at that point in my life I had just gotten out of a long relationship and was just trying to be single and vibe.  Well, years go by and we get closer and I start to like him as more than a friend.  I know that he had dated women because he talked about one woman he was hooking up with and also he would have me navigating us on his phone and Bumble messages would pop up.  Around this past October, I felt the urge to tell him how I felt; my feelings had been getting stronger and it just felt like the right thing to do.  So, I send him a long text message telling him how I liked him as more than a friend, how my feelings for him were confusing but kept getting deeper, and how I never acted on it because I was afraid to ruin our friendship.  DAYS LATER he texted me about something else but never really responded to my ""declaration of feelings"" text.  A few weeks after my text, he came over my place to cat/house-sit because I was leaving town for a week for a trip.  It was after midnight because I had been working, and I had a 3am flight to catch, so I was trying to get a little bit of sleep.  He walks into my place and immediately says: ""Sooo we need to talk.""  I basically say ""Do we have to?  I really want to get some sleep.""  He looks super relieved and says ""Yeah, I didn't really want to have that conversation tonight anyways.""  Cool cool.  So, I go on my trip and come back and we have lunch and I tell him all about it.  We have hung out many times since then, we text almost every day about dumb daily shit, but have still never had that ""conversation"".  He recently invited me to come with him to his friends' wedding in Alaska, and we're planning the trip and I am super excited (Alaska!), but he has said stuff like ""Yeah, I don't want you to feel weird because it's a wedding, just thought you'd like to see Alaska"".

Sooo basically, my question is, what should I do?  Is he into me?  Or did I blow it?  Is the ball in my court or his?  Essentially, my main priority is keeping our friendship intact, but my heart wants more and I'm not sure how to go about it delicately.

(Not so) brief background: around two years ago I got out of a 3-year relationship that lasted until I graduated college. After recovering from that breakup and casually dating a bit, I developed a great understanding of what I did and didn't want in a girl and set very high standards. I also got my self confidence to a place where rejection didn't impact my self confidence whatsoever even if it was still disappointing.

I wasn't looking for a serious relationship, but I met a girl (24yo f) on hinge around 6 months ago that I completely hit it off with and had the best first and second dates of my life with. We both wanted something casual, me because I wanted the freedom to date around and her because she was planning on moving to a new state the next summer. We continued seeing each other and it went way better than I think either of us expected, and we became exclusive and eventually became bf/gf. After around 4 months of dating we hadn't had a single fight or argument, we matched up personality and values-wise in nearly every way, and I realized she was the first girl I had met who literally had every single quality I look for in a girl.

But with her moving in a few months, she felt her feelings were not strong enough yet to commit to long-distance and she didn't know if they would get there and didn't want to have led me on if they didn't, so she ended it. To me it seemed obvious that of course feelings didn't develop as quickly/strongly because we both had approached it as something temporary/casual.

But anyways, now we are broken up and even after getting past the initial grief and sadness, I'm finding myself really uninterested in dating anyone new. I've dated people for similar amounts of time in the past and it only took me maybe a week or two to fully get past it and see the obvious flaws in the relationship. But with this one, even thinking clearly about it now, I can't think of any issues with her or our relationship. I'm sure there would be some, but the fact that after 4 months none had popped up is so promising. On top of that, it logically seems like the odds of finding another person who has all the qualities I look for AND matches up with me so well are low to none.

I'm not the type to believe in ""the one"" or to act like there's no one else for me out there. But gosh it sucks to lose something that seemed to have so much potential...like 10x the potential of any other relationship I've had. Its hard to imagine that I'd be able to find someone I click that well with even if I do put in the effort.

Anyone else been there? How did you manage that? Did those feelings change with time? Do you wish you had done anything differently?

Hello all. So two years ago I met this cute guy off tinder who actually wanted to get to know me and establish a relationship. However at the time, I was into someone else so I failed to pursue it with him. As a result, I had given my friend (now ex-friend) his number and she went out on a date with him so he would leave me alone. While on the date, she talked bad about me and how I’m not a good person to date (all lies) so that he would look down upon me. After things did not work out with the other guy who I was seeing, I decided to meet him and we hooked up once (no sex). My (ex-friend) found out about this and immediately told me that he does not want anything to do with me and how I should block him and move on. As you can see here, things got very confusing and weird between me and him. In fact, he even found out I once dated his family friend and both of them talked about me.

......

Ok so I blocked him out of fear that he hates me and moved on with my life. During this duration of 2 years he had always been in the back of my head as I truly and genuinely liked him and still do. Recently, I saw him on Bumble and his profile stated how he is “looking for a relationship” so I immediately swiped right out of pure curiosity to see if he remembers me. Surprisingly, we matched and hit it off again right off the bat. He told me how he had missed me and was looking for me all along. We agreed that there was lots of confusion and miscommunication 2 years ago, however he barely remembers what even happened. Fortunately, we started talking again via. iMessage text and Snapchat and he told me how if “I started talking to other guys” he would be “pretty f-ing pissed.” Ultimately, his possessive nature combined with consistent text message communication really made me fall for him hard.

......

On the bottom side, he told me how he got out of a relationship with this girl who cheated on him “the worst way possible” but refused to go into depth. After matching on bumble again, he always makes plans to hangout but ends up cancelling the last minute. At the same time, I’m still very confused about what he wants because he sometimes ghosts me out of the blue, even told me how he’s “sorry” and won’t be able to throughly hang out and see me until he gets completely settled into his new apartment.
.......

On a surprise note, while I was coming back from the city last night he offered me to wait at his apartment rather than at the train station (for safety reasons) until my friend comes to pick me up. I accepted his offer and he picked me up and brought me back to his place where we hung out for an hour. While at his place, things appeared to be very confusing and weird. He told me how I could get comfortable and take my jacket off and lie down with him on his bed, which I did. During this encounter, we started cuddling and he gave me a slight peck on my lips which was very romantic. However, after this “little kiss” he refrained from giving me another one and told me how “he needs to control himself” and that “I’m the first woman in his bed who he kissed” ever since breaking up with his ex a year ago. After that, he said “let’s take things slow and be friends first.” While he held me in his arms, I noticed how his heart kept racing and he was shaking a little. During our cuddling session, he even told me how beautiful I was and called me cute. Also, he randomly asked me when “my last relationship was” and how he’s still trying to get over his last relationship since she cheated on him and “so much more happened.” He told me that it’s very hard for him to move on, so I told him “he has to let go of the past and move forward” to which he replied “you’re right.” Afterwards, when it was time for me to go home since my friend came, he hugged me one last time and told me “he couldn’t kiss me” when I left. 


Now here’s the most critical part:
.......
I low key still feel a little heartbroken since he didn’t even want to “kiss me” before I left to go home. He literally said “we can’t kiss now” maybe another time. Do you think he likes me? Is he mentally ok? It just feels weird that a guy who is clearly into me won’t be as affectionate as I am towards him.

First date was supposed to be yesterday- we were supposed to meet for lunch. About an hour of driving for each of us and it was raining. Not heavy rain but steady rain that you would get pretty wet.

He texted me the day before to tell me the place that he chose and said the weather forecast wasn’t looking great but we can see. We said this weekend would also be an alternative. 

2 hours before the date he texts to say it’s raining where he is and we should reschedule. I respond back something along the lines of lol it’s not raining that hard but it’s fine. Not sure if I said something wrong here...

No response back from him since. It’s been a little less than 24 hrs.

Do I wait for him to text me confirming for this weekend or proposing another day? Or should I text him to ask when he’s free?

I was planning on saying something playful like teasing him about being scared of rain and then asking if the weekend was still good. But I don’t think I should have to be the one who reschedules.

First date in an indoor place with steady rain despite being an hours worth drive for both people shouldn’t have been a reason to cancel imo. There were no T storm warnings or anything..

Tldr; first date canceled by guy bc of rain. Do I reach out or wait?

Went on a date earlier this week (met him online) - I thought it went great, we got along, he kept pushing it longer and longer than it had to be (I would have been fine going home at 10:00 or even midnight) until we had hung out from like 8pm to 2am...on a weeknight. He kissed me, and gave me his number. I texted him that same night to let him know I had a great time and wanted to see him again. Then, throughout the next few days, it has been him initiating, even after the conversation dies, and he asked me if I wanted to go camping with him. Dangerous situations (that come with camping with someone you hardly know) aside, I have been pretty excited since then. I even made plans to board my dog, sorted out my weekend to accommodate the camping (I work and go to law school so this can be a big commitment for me at this time). Then, earlier today, I asked him about how much wood we would need since that was something I was supposed to take care of. And the following exchange ensued.

Him: I don't think I can go tomorrow. I got some complications.

Me: Okay. Hope everything is okay

Him: My brain is struggling to understand some things and I don't think it would be fair to put you in that position in the middle of a camping trip.

Me: I totally understand - if you ever wanna talk about it I'm happy to listen but also I know we are basically strangers. But just for clarification - does that mean you're not interested in pursuing this any longer?

That all happened within minutes, and now it has been hours with no response. Giving him benefit of the doubt - I'm sure he's busy too - I'm just left like ""what the fuck?"" 

On one hand it seems responsible and kind of him to let me know, but on the other, I wish he had informed me of these reservations before I made plans and sorted things out, etc.

I guess he's not interested? He isn't communicating what is going on. I mean, we went on one date, so I am not expecting any insight into it, but at least to me it felt like there was a connection I haven't felt in a long time, so I am a bit bummed but it is low stakes. 

A part of me thinks I am overthinking this too - things happen and people lose interest in dating overall and it's got nothing to do with whoever they dated. And I don't need a reason, I just need him to tell me he doesn't want to date me so that I can stop looking forward to any sort of contact from him.

But I am a little offended too, and really burnt out from this type of stuff happening on dates - either I feel no connection and struggle to let them know or I guess they feel the same way...despite showing interest that I didn't ask for or expect (?)

He lives about 3 hours away and I occasionally visit his city for work.

We had about the BEST conversations I've ever had. We have a similar humour and both love to think out of the box and around the corner which made our conversations extremely entertaining. We texted a lot, then spoke over the phone, sometimes for hours.

After a while I visited his hometown again and we met and hooked up. It was amazing, we had a great time and he was very affectionate. We told each other how much we liked the other afterwards and that we wanted to meet again. As I was travelling for 3 weeks directly after that this would be the time that we won't be seeing each other at least.

Important side note: As he's an artist he struggles with Covid a lot, because he couldn't work for over a year now. He has developed quite some mental issues which we have talked about. He's seeing a therapist also. From his description it sounds lot like depression but I'm really not in a position to diagnose that. 

In the beginning of me being away we talked over the phone almost every night. After a while, it got more scarcely. I could understand - distance is distance after all and we didn't specify anything about our relationship with each other. 

The first thing I've noticed is that he updated his tinder bio. Fair - he can do what he wants, but it surely brought my somewhat exuberanting emotions to a sudden halt. Odd: he's deleted himself from tinder by now (or deleted our match, but there was not really a reason to do that).

But the fact that really bugs me is that he doesn't really react to me anymore. He replies, he texts back, but he tends to shift the conversation towards himself a lot. He doesn't ask me any details. Also, sex (sexual innuendos and the like) is a topic much more than it was before.

But he stays in touch. He texts first. He checks in. From what I can tell is that he is self-aware to his behavior some extent, but not enough to change it.

My assumption is that I was able to make him feel really really good after a long time of him feeling down. I ask good questions, I cater to the people I care about and I can be super affectionate... 

In some hopeful moments, I think he doesn't know how to talk to me either, is insecure cause I may have hooked up a lot with other guys during my travels or wanted to be left alone while I'm abroad...

Since I'm only returning today, it will show if his communication changes as soon as he thinks I'm more available. 

But actually, as I type this out, I don't think it's really a question anymore, it's pretty clear that he's lost interest.

I try to make my life easier for the opposite gender when looking at my profile. If you want to have your dating experience be less toxic and shallow, please (both men and women, I just happen to date women so I don't see men's profiles)-just be honest.

As a man, I'd rather go out with a bigger woman (who is upfront about being bigger) than a woman who has all of these different issues I've mentioned (I've gotten messages from married women I wouldn't know who were married because they TAKE THEIR WEDDING RING OFF!!) and all of these other crazy kinds of ways you can lead someone on.

We matched on just about any aspect (food, drinks, hobbies, favorite places of travel, tv shows, type of humour, children/marriage preferences to name a few of the hundreds)

We wrote mails to each other everyday, each of them having the size of a small novel. We were obviously head over heels for each other.

At times, it was like she was an identical copy of me. That is how much we matched on every single thing. It was so eerie that I jokingly said: this is either one hell of a match made in heaven, or just an elaborate case of catfishing.

After a month, we decided to meet up. This was at the beginning of this week at around 4 PM. We met at a public park. We walked for an hour, then sat at a bench for an hour. All the while, the conversation had been flowing like crazy. No pauses at all, and lots of laughing.

Then from 6 PM till 10 PM we were at her apartment. Again: not a single pause in the conversation, we talked about hundreds of different subjects. When talking about one, there'd always be a way it would flow into another. It was magical. Lots of laughing, sometimes to the point where we were wheezing and had pains in the stomach.

At around 9 PM, I mentioned that we've had a ton of fun already and that we vibe together really well and that I really liked the evening so far. She wholeheartedly agreed on all of that; she said she had a blast as well.

Then I went home at 10 PM (it was a weekday and we both had to work the next day). She is kinda careful about physical contact and had set boundaries before when talking online. We agreed that she would take the lead if she wanted to escalate anything. She did not initiate a goodbye kiss or hug, so she obviously was not ready for that yet. I made no point of that and left.

The next morning, I jokingly asked if the stomach pains from the laughing were gone. And I told her it was an absolutely beautiful night that I would be happy to repeat sometime in the future.

She answered and said: ""It was extremely awesome. And you were too. You are fantastic, fun, so smart and knowledgeable about a ton of stuff (I had taught her about many things she did not yet know about), and you're cute. You have everything I could ever wish for in a man. But I just did not feel it. I do not know why this is, and I really wished I did feel it. But I don't, and I absolutely hate the fact that I don't.""

Okay, so wait what...... she had a blast, she said I had everything she wished for in a man, then says she doesn't feel it, and then cannot even give an explanation as to why that is, stating that she simply doesn't know and then goes on to say that she wished she felt something but she doesn't.

I am utterly confused and completely puzzled. I told her that, and she said she can not explain it any further and that she does not have anything more to add to it.

Holy what...... so, I turn to you reddit, can someone on here explain what all of this is about?

Was it an extremely elaborate catfish after all just like I shortly considered during the mails? Just her being some kind of chameleon mirroring all of what I say to make it look like we match 1000000%, then drop me like a sack of bricks and then laugh at the extreme pain she has inflicted by doing that? It messed me up so much I vomited all day that day, called in sick for the rest of the week, and have since been lying in bed without hunger or thirst or a will to get up. In fact, I typed this all from my bed.

Our dates always last many hours (5-10hrs typically), so I guess we talk about things... But here's the thing, ever since we moved from just going on dates to also hanging out in between, conversation has become so dry. It's mostly just based on whatever is currently going on around us. For the first few dates, conversation went well. We had lots to talk about because we didn't know each other before, so we talked a lot about family and passions and such. Still, I was using a lot of conversation prompts that I had looked up beforehand. On our fourth date we played the conversation game, We're Not Really Strangers, because I wasn't sure what to talk about otherwise. Everyone told me before how great he was at conversation (and he is good once he has something to talk about), but he never really brings anything up, and I feel weird just asking question after question.

Is this normal to struggle with conversation? I feel like I forgot what normal, casual flowing conversation feels like lol. Should our conversation topics be this prompted? We're going on another date tonight and I can't help but worry about what we'll talk about. I can't think of any other big things to talk about.

As he is already a pretty influential figure in the area of dating and relationships that shapes the perception of the people following him to his own accord, I feel like voicing the issues I have with his state of mind.

When I first discovered his channel, I though to myself, interesting. A straightforward guy who gets to the point quickly and kicks your butt to get your life in line.

But the more you watch his content, the more evident it becomes, what shallow and toxic of a person he truly is. That was especially true in the latest of his videos I saw. A woman of 29 years told him, how she found out that her husband is cheating on her with his manager, leaving him in the process. Samuels' response was clear: It was a bad decision to leave this guy, as she is now single and alone - she just should've accepted the fact that her husband cheats, because cheating is what (high value) men always do, as they have the opportunities presented, and a woman should simply not be surprised that the man she finds attractive, is being found attractive by other women as well. He even tells her, that it's actually a sign of love, that he did not tell her on his own that he cheated. 

But what are ""high value"" men according to Samuels? It is he who has a lot of money, the style and the looks and is recognized as such by other ""high value"" men. He who is dominant, confident and a leader, he who can lead his wife too. He, who other women want to cheat with. That's it. While it's a woman's job to be pretty, submissive and ""inspirational"". In one podcast he called himself a ""feminist"", though his definition of what feminism is, doesn't seem to align at all with the actual idea and philosophy. 

Although he gives some good advice on how to raise your impression in the ""dating marked"" (basically: looking good and having money), the implications of what a healthy relationship looks like, is pretty shallow and toxic. 

You never hear him talk about what it takes to be a decent human being. That a relationship should be based on mutual respect, loyalty and honesty. Instead, he is possessed by the idea that you need to be a ""high value alpha male with a lot of money and a suit in the wardrobe"", since that's what a woman desires and needs. And if a woman voices trust issues because of these same men that cheated on her, his response literally is ""deal with it or die alone"".",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,692414,public,self,The toxic mindset of Kevin Samuels (self-proclaimed Lifestyle Coach and dating expert),0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mi6dyr/the_toxic_mindset_of_kevin_samuels_selfproclaimed/,all_ads,6,,True,,

For those who don't know, the passport feature allows users to swipe as if they are in a different location. For example, a scammer in the phillipines can decide they want to show up in the queue of people trying to date in nyc, people in brazil can pick somewhere in the us to practice english and any person looking for instagram followers can turn their profile into an ad that they move around to popular cities to pick up followers.

However so far my success has been so-so. I only seem to get around 2 likes a day which is pretty pathetic. Anyway, I don't actually like a lot of girls which makes it kind of hard since I never actually match with girls I like first. I don't know if the ones I like actually get to see my profile at all. Out of the 4 girls that liked me so far in the first 2 days. none would normally be on my radar, However I like to give things a chance.  So I matched with one of them.

&amp;#x200B;

Now this is where it starts, this girl responded to my message pretty quickly which is nice. At least so far girls have always responded to me if I texted them close to us matching. The thing is that our conversation is so dreadfully boring. She looks kind of cute but only has two pictures on her profile and no further information.  

&amp;#x200B;

I've been told I'm a decently good conversationalist IRL, but this is just difficult. I don't know how to make the conversation interesting. I'm asking her questions since I want to find something we can talk about but so far we've exchanged like 10 messages and I still haven't found anything. IRL I just start talking about myself if i have no common ground with someone and just want to get through a social situation where nobody knows what to say, Usually that makes others more keen to also talk about themselves especially if i show emotion/excitement. Anyway, in talking online i have no clue what to do when i haven't found common ground with someone to start going into the fun part of conversations. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have a good sense of humor but it I'm not someone who can force a joke out of any situation. I feel like I can only really use my humor once we actually start talking about something instead of this boring generic information exchange.

So how do I actually save this conversation? I'm already bored since this feels more like an interrogation? Or an interview. In her last message she answered, but didn't ask anything back so the cue I'm getting from that is that she's also kind of bored already.  

Of course it's stupid to grieve over losing a 'boring' match, however I feel like it would be a shame to break contact before we actually got a real conversation going. How am I supposed to make this conversation engaging when I don't even know what she's interested in?

I understand that even average girls get several matches a day. So if a conversation isn't immediately engaging it's kind of *doomed*. Which makes me wonder if I actually took the wrong approach to this.

Should I just have tried flirting with her from the get go?  I've tried that before but it never feels genuine to me. I know effective flirting can get (and keep) girls interested. I know this approach is effective but I don't like the idea of showing extreme interest in a girl before I actually know some things about them. I am able to do it but it just feels like I'm lying to myself.

TLDR: If you dont wanna read the literal book im about to write, basically just a question. Why do i always end up finding interest in toxic females.

So I'll start this off at the beginning, my first ""relationship"" but I'd rather calling it dating since it was barely 3 months. Atleast in my eyes, everything seemed ok for the most part. It was sophomore year of high school, and i was comfortable enough around her to lose my virginity within the first month of actual dating. So weeks go by, and im kinda doing the opposite of how my parents treated each other, so i bought her random things that she likes, taking her for a valentines date with the allowance money i had at the time, and really trying to show her as much affection as a 15 y/o boy can give. Towards the 3 month mark, around spring break, everything kinda sunk into reality and it seemed like feelings have changed. Last day of spring break comes by and i get dumped. A bit after, i find out during that time, she ended up talking to another dude behind my back while we were dating. So thats the first relationship. 

The next two relationships lasted around 6 months each one. Second one ended because i was being mentally abused and tortured. One minute would be perfect and the next would be screaming in my ear for me talking with the wrong tone.(not a real example but point made. Small shit.) So that relationship ended up destroying my self esteem and i ended up not having enough self confidence to get back into a relationship for the next two years. So the years pass, and at this point, i kinda start drowning myself out in alcohol. So two years go by, and i end up starting to become really close to someone that i already had knew for a while. We ended up getting together after a month or two of talking, and everything felt great again. That was probably my most ""healthy"" relationship. At one point, around the 2-3 month mark, i could feel that the way she saw me was different, but I couldn't pinpoint it. I ignored that feeling in my gut and went through the next 2-3 months or so and didnt worry too much. During the last month, my family and I flew over to china to visit relatives. For the most part, any chance i could, i wanted to bring her back a souvenir. I ended up buying a nice necklace that reminded me of her because it was her favorite color. So fast forward to when i come back. Shes become distant. Something feels off. The gut feeling i had a while back was the random thought of ""maybe she still has feelings and is attached to her ex"". I find out that my suspicion was true and thats exactly what was going on. I dropped off the necklace at her place, i said my goodbyes, and i went back home and drank myself to sleep.

Fast forward another few months, i start dabbling in drugs. Because i constantly tried to find out what was wrong with me but never could. I started off light. Getting crossfaded with weed and alcohol. Within 3 month, that turns into a slurpee of coke, ecstasy, shrooms, acid, dmt, molly, etc. I had a bad trip doing five drops of acid and dmt back to back around the end of the year. And when i say that, THAT was my breaking point of drowning in my own misery. I saw myself from a different perspective, i saw my issues, and i went out of my comfort zone to fix those issues. Half a year turns around and i stop looking for committed relationships. I start having the ol casual fun n stuff, meeting up with random chicks, hot and ugly, and just not really having a care in the world.

Around the 6-8 month mark of me doing that, someone adds me on facebook and seems extremely interested in me, but not for sex. I opened up my mind to committing again, and as how this story goes, i went straight back into the loop. We dated for about 1-2 months, and at that point, i was so focused on fixing specific parts of me and failed to see a few other issues. Like tunnel vision. What used to be ignored suspicions became full blown jealousy. I thought she could do a lot better than me, so anytime she would talk about any guy, i would start to get jealous. I went straight back to step 1. I was miserable again. And things escalated from there. She knew what ticked me off and what annoyed me, and purposely had said and done those things to cause drama. During this period of time was around the time where i almost flew into a highway barrier going 80mph. I forget to bring medication when i spend the night, and im driving home and i immediately blacked out for a half a second right as i tried turning into the exit lane. I was taking the maximum dosage of lexapro and zoloft and the withdrawals immediately hit me. So back to the story(i get sidetracked very often when im talking and i dont feel like deleting all of that). So around the end of us, i got to the point where i couldnt manage my anger anymore. Broke up and left it at that. Also afterwards, i ended up finding out that she was a felon. Most i know is that either she was close to killing someone or she did kill someone.

So after that, i go back into the fuckboi phase. I started drinking more too. New chick off of a dating app every month. I returned to not giving a shit about committing to anyone except this time, i didnt care for drugs. I would take shrooms to recenter myself and relax, but that was it. This was 2020. The pandemic didnt stop me from fuckin around and enjoying it. This part is the least memorable because of how much anti anxiety and anti depressants i was taking on top of drinking under the influence of those meds. So fast forward to november of 2020. I changed my train of thought once again and i asked my psychiatrist to take me off the meds, and ever since, i havent touched em. 

Recently, i met a girl through a dating app and this time, i was back in the game to be committed. She seemed like the other half of me. We enjoyed the same things, talked the same way, listened to the same music, etc. Things go great for about a month. After a little miscommunication of what she thought i said vs what i actually said, the atmosphere completely changed. She distanced herself from me and was being aggressive about it. Long story short for this one, i ended getting along with her best friend and i asked her a few questions. I end up finding out that this girl was only ever sticking to me because i gave her attention and she didnt have a car but i did. Her best friend has shown me screenshots of what she said and this completely destroyed me. So i did what was the only option for me, and i confronted her about it, and we stopped talking from there. 

I apologize for the 84 hour long read but i wanted to put everything in context. I feel like im always back to step one. I get my hoped up and have them shatter immediately. 

If your going to criticize me, then go ahead. Whether its harsh or subtle advice, ill take any advice that'll maybe change my perspective on my relationship life. I really dont have the strength at this point to put effort into something that'll feel like a waste of time.
