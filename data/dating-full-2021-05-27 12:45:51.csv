Im a University student(19Y/M) and me and this girl have been hanging out alot recently. I’ve never had a girl as a good friend before so I can’t tell the difference between what is flirting and what is not lol. All my life, my friends have been mainly dudes. For example, me and this girl had food together and she fed me some of the food from her fork and then I fed her back some of mine. (is this flirting or do guy and girl friends do this?) 
I could never imagine doing this with my guy friends lmao. We have been hanging out for about 1 month now and Im planning to ask her out on a date in a few days since I think she might like me aswell. Do I be upfront and say “Hey can I ask you something, do you wanna go on a date with me sometime?”, how do I go about asking her on a date?

I'm positive that many women do, just not the women I'm attracted to. I also don't want to make it seem like I'm expecting anything from anyone; no woman owes me shit and vis versa. That said:

I constantly feel like I'm making some mistake that I just can't figure out and which drives women away from me. I can't figure it out anymore. Ever since my ex-fiance and I ended things four years ago, I've been working on myself and I've been comfortable and secure with who I am for at least two years, but haven't gotten a single positive response from anyone I've asked out lately. I'm not horribly unattractive, a little fat but tall, incredibly strong, and talented. I play guitar and sing pretty well. I make amazing food. I have a good job. I make furniture as a hobby. I'm incredibly kind and compassionate; the first to help anyone I see who needs it. I'm occasionally funny and witty. I'm well-read, have a great taste in music, and live a generally interesting life. I'm not timid or shy. I'm not absurdly confidant, but I have pretty good self-confidence. 

I just don't get why literally none of the women I'm attracted to ever say yes to me asking them out. I'm not trying to whine or complain, but I feel like maybe I'm not saying something right, or doing something I should be? I don't stink and take care of myself. If it were just like a few people saying no, I'd be ok with that. But it's not. It's like the last 20 women.

This past year a guy I knew in high school looked me up on facebook, said that he sees me walking past his place every day and said he would love to connect sometime. We have since texted pretty frequently, and gone on several walks. He always seems very interested and flirtatious, and we always have a nice time.

The thing is, he has a tendency of being flaky. He will make plans with me face to face, and then just not text. Several times this week we've made plans and then I do not hear from him until a few days later.

Here are the reasons I am tentatively reserving judgment: he has been diagnosed with ptsd this past year because of an incident, he is very busy (I've seen what he has going on, and he legitimately is), he has recently gotten out of a relationship, and... he has said that he hates social media and texting (hmm. ok)...

What I am wondering is... should I call him out on it and ask 'are you actually interested? cause there are other guys I could invest my time in right now.' (just in a friendlier tone)... or should I just bow out without saying anything?

I just know that if I leave it as is I will keep yoyo-ing back when he shows up.

So I said this whole story because part of my reasoning for wanting to get in shape was that I wanted to be more attractive to women, and I guess I am but the only girls that I ever get likes from or match with on dating apps are fat girls. I’m not particularly attracted to them, but it seems like that’s all their is.

Should I try to fix this, I will do anything to make it right. I will be responding to all comments. Ask away. 

So my (f16) boyfriend (m17) and I fight a good bit. He’s pretty mean to me and I try my best to stay nice but i struggle. He hurts my feelings A LOT. I totally understand that both of us can be in the wrong, i don’t disagree with that at all. I am not claiming to be in the right. 

My boyfriend and I won’t hang out for a week straight and it hurts my feelings. He won’t even budge to make plans. I mention it and he will say that it’s my fault because I didn’t ask. It wouldn’t be a problem if we facetimed, but he hates to facetime, because I won’t show my face completely. But he always calls his friends everyday over an xbox party and there are no faces shown. So why can I not show my face. He is totally okay with going a WEEK without speaking at all. Just text. That’s it. I have a feeling he just doesn’t care to see me. He can go days without leaving the house and having no human interaction. I like to see people. Both of our love languages are physical touch, so I don’t get why he doesn’t want to see me. I stopped texting all lovey dovey because I would rather do it in person. Then he gets angry with me if I “text dry” It’s like he only wants to be in the relationship to text eachother. But i want more. He doesn’t want to see me often because apparently we fight more, we still fight even if it’s just texting, we actually fight more if we don’t hang out. He also doesn’t want to hang out often because I “text differently” right after we hang out. Like more dry ig? He gets mad if I text any way he doesn’t want me to, so why can’t we just hang out? 

So between the time we hang out, there is no speaking whatsoever. 1 week without speaking to the love of your life seems crazy to me? One week with no interaction besides texting. No words, no hugs, no eye sight. 

I told him how I was afraid when we both started to get busy in the summer (work and sports) we would only be able to hang out for 2 hours every 3 days. He said “so what, it’s better than nothing. it’s not like we need to hang out everyday.” He then sent me a tiktok saying that hanging out every day is something to not do in a relationship. It hurts my feelings. I wasn’t asking to hang out everyday. I was nervous that we wouldn’t hang out at all. He doesn’t even care. He’s thinks it’s okay that he doesn’t want to hang out with me, but that means that I would have to text him every 3 minutes. It’s insane. I don’t think we should have to text all the time. We are not in a long distance relationship. I need physical interaction with him.

Despite learning a lot in school, I barely passed High-School. Psychiatrists told my parents, they diagnosed a low intelligence in me. I will likely to be underperforming academically respectively in the job market. After I finished high school, I started working first to save up money to start college. 

I began college but failed after two years. I needed to go back to my old work place, to pay off some dept and save up enough money again to start over, which I did. Unfortunately I failed again. In the end, I dont why exactly I failed. Like in high school I needed to learn a lot to pass exams. The longer I stayed in college there more complex the topics became. I just couldn't understand them though I used all my free time to learn about it. Today (31) I am still paying off my student debt to be more flexible again. Nothing fency. Fast food Industry. But I try to be happy with what I have. 

With 25/26 I started actively seeking romantic encounters because until then I never tried and no women ever showed interest in me. As soon as I told a woman my educational background they rejected me. I tried everything. I asked women out directly, I registered on online-Dating plattforms and vivsited Single-Events. But nothing worked. 

Last year I got a little bit frustrated, since I am living now for so long in (romantically) isolation. I tried an experiment. I changed my job description on all these sites to something like Lawyer or CEO. I Immediately got a lot of matches. 

I didnt know what to think. I never thought I would be negatively judged over something I have no control over (my intelligence/my academically success) or where I have tried my best. I no constantly think negatively and I have this had in my voice that I am that man no women wants. Then off course I tell myself, this is no true. But on the other hand this experiment spoke for itself. And off course my experience outside the online Dating world, where women would lost interest in me whenever  I told them about my educational past. 

Since I am so confused now, I thought I would ask Women directly. So is this really true? Do women judge minimum-wage man differently? Is imperfection, failure and thing like not passing an exam unattractive? Am I such a bad catch?!

Nonetheless I liked her and I felt very hurt, sad and kind of used. I took some time off work just to spend some time with myself to mediate, rest and get re-centered. I went for a walk, did some exercises at home and lit some incense. Last night going to bed I finally felt like my emotional malaise was beginning to lift just a bit. 

Then this morning on my way to work I got a DM notification on Instagram. It was from a very attractive woman that I met a couple years ago who asked if I wanted to have dinner and catch up. We had chemistry but timing wasn't in our favor a few years back. Must've been some weird form of kismet because there's no way from social media that she heard I was single again. I said yes and she was so excited and appreciative that it completely caught me off guard. My ex was kind, but she never really showed a lot of excitement when I'd come over or ask to see her. It often felt like more of a chore for her. I'm not assuming anything will happen with this other woman but it was just nice to have some confirmation again that I'm something to be excited about.

she even gave a few heads up she'd be willing to go out, a few weeks ago I did ask her, something came up, she started texting less and taking longer to reply. the 2nd time I asked her she said yes come the time she started flaking and making excuses, basically she was playing games.

I then came to the conclusion that's it I'm done not gna text her, chase her ask her again, give her no attention, move on purely work relationship.


since then. 2 weeks she's been texting me morning, night, days, at work she was very flirty I barely reciprocated, I barely respond and when I do it's short and to the point 

anyways, this past week I was at work when my buddy called me saying hes in the area for lunch, do I wna hang out as he has 2 hours free between meetings, I said sure why not leme ask my boss. I asked my boss, she, the other colleagues over heard, and despite me denying it over and over she and they kept saying its a date, hes got a girlfriend. After denying it for an hour I gave up. started accepting it and asked the boss for ""nice lunch places to take someone in the area""  


I went to a diff part of building where my friend but also the girls close friend works, she says I hear uv got a hot date, who u tryna make jealous wink wink.  I explain truthfully its not, she said maybe you should go along with it, see who it exposes, I said alright I'm gna do it 

the girl I like comes in, she's like hes got a date, I wna know her name, I said no. she looks at the other girl and says jts me, were going on a date. I ignore it and go back to my place.

come back from lunch, she's now all in my zone, asking where I went what did I eat, what did the girl eat to figure her out. once that finished, she kept talking about anything and everything, hit my arm, n then come her shift end she left without saying goodbye for the first time ever.

I went down to restock, her mates there, saying I take it its going well then, maybe this will make someone reply quickly..(how does she know!?).

I go home,  I get a text from the girl,  girlfriend update please,  I leave her hanging. Next day her mate texts me saying she's convinced of your date, said it sounded like you had a really good time, and she wants to know all the basic details of the girl, how she looks, personality traits, star sign etc, she also says maybe you should have another fake date or too then break it off.

I reply to the girl saying what do u wna know , she said name, height, hair colour, how we met, where we met, I responded with a similar hair colour to hers, Gemini(that's what she is lmao) and personality pretty much similar to hers but not exact, won't give name cuz she's gna stalk her

she instantly responds saying she won't,  maybe she will hehe and Gemini is good cu thats what she is and she's great.


I dont respond, I feel bad, since then she's been on whatsap a fair bit, she's usually once a day person. I'm guessing she's checking my response or not.

so ANYWAYS. what do you think is going on here? is she jealous? whats her deal? what's her friend's deal? is she playing cupid? 

do I leave her hanging for a couple more days cuz scarcity will mess with her mind, how do I play this.

Reorganizing my economy, discussing how to see my kids etc. You know the works.

I was kinda scared of being single and lonly. But right of the bat I picked up a girl at a party. She is my age, so naturally she has two kids ofc. And I just can't belive my luck! So this is a home run right? 

So I think  what determines if this succeeds or not is going to be my relationship with her kids right. I get to know them, and surprise surprise they love fotball just like me. Just like all boys do, talking fotball and playing fotball. Easy squeaky Japanese, u got this in the bag m8.

Picking her up, picking up the kids, its like im having a new family. Because im getting so along with her kids, im her man. She curves up to me in the sheets, and says; god I cant imagen losing you. 

She has a vacation booked, that was made before I meet her. In Italy, I drive her to the airport etc. She says she doesn't want to go, she wasn't to be with me bla bla bla. 

Thats the last time I saw her. Next day I call her, straight to voice mail. I send a txt, I love you I need you etc. No answer, thats a bit strange? Did the plane crash? 

Two weeks later, shes supposed to be back home now, I drive to her house. Just to make sure she is safe, nobody's home. I walk in the back yard and look into the living room. The remote controle is exactly where I placed it the day I drove her to the airport.

I'm picking up my phone to call the police, and my brains says stop. You dont really know her do you? 

8 months later im going thru my routines stopping by the gas station for work etc. Behind the counter look who it is! Its her, I just couldn't belive my eyes! 

I walk up to her and ask ""Where have you been?"" She starts talking alot of nonsense about losing her phone. And finding a new man. Im like what?

Being told (in my case) that you’re sooo special and amazing and he wants you forever, princess, here is a bunch of expensive shit you never asked for. Hearts all over the fucking whatsapp conversation. When you meet in real life he says “I hope you never left me, i am so scar-red to lose you!” 


You’re overwhelmed and exhausted cause dating sucks, and you learn to accept the compliments and special treatment which still never feels entirely earned or comfortable...


And then he fucking drops you. The interest dwindles fast and the plunge is fucking painful. Why? Who knows! Maybe he got bored. Back together with an ex. Found a better object of obsession? But he suddenly stops texting you. Whereas before, he sent you pictures of everything he did from waking up to being on the job, riddled with hearts of course, he now sends you a dry ass text at 3 pm. “Goodmorning.”

At that point you are trying to answer the affection and meet his intensity, in a way, and you reply with hearts and questions in a way that would normally seem juvenile and stupid to you. You feel butterflies now, because how could you not, when he basically sends entire flocks of them into your face all day long.


But you hear nothing from him! All day. There you sit with your stupid hearts and “I miss you,” and you feel duped. It gets worse. He quickly makes it obvious that he’s no longer interested in you. This is ‘t done in an active, straightforward way. Nope, you get **faded.**


And then you wonder what the fuck you did wrong. Why did he stop liking you? Why did he like you in the first place? You realize suddenly that he never even asked you about your life, your opinion on things, your family or even your hobbies. And then you feel really fucking stupid. Because you were just an object of obsession, and all of those stupid little promises he made are nothing more than fairy dust. And then you’re left with nothing. 


Please think carefully before you shower someone with affection. Don’t make promises that you can’t keep.

The first half of it was mainly through text and phone calls cause she was about to graduate from Uni a couple hours away (we're both from the same area/city basically). She came home for a weekend at the beginning of us talking and we went on a great date and really vibed. From there, things just continued to escalate and I could tell she was falling harder and faster than I was. Nonetheless though I was still catching some feelings and enjoying where things were going. We spent most of last weekend together, Saturday - Sunday; went on a great date, she spent the night and we just had a great time overall.

On Monday, she ended up joining the gym I regularly workout at on a month membership so that she could workout with me and we could spend more time together (I was open to working out together but felt like if we were working out all the time with each other we'd spend too much time together too quickly). Had a great time that night tho.

On Tuesday, things started to feel off for some reason. We had memorial day weekend plans that ended up falling through (lake house that a friend owns and they had to cancel the plans) and she was clearly bummed about it. She also has a job interview this week (today) as a FA (flight attendant) in a different city (she'd be commuting from our home town so it technically wouldn't make things difficult if we ended up in a relationship) and has been extremely stressed about it. This stress and her down mood became extremely noticeable throughout the day; not as enthusiastic texting, panicking over the job, stressed that she might fail a drug test, etc etc. I reassured her all night that everything would be okay, amongst other things and her flirty self came back out per usual.

Yesterday, things once again felt off. The conversations were light or boring at times and she just seemed in a down mood once again. Same with today (the day of the interview). She's still flirty at times and was upset yesterday that she wouldn't get to see me until Friday (she gets back late tonight). I can't help but feel like things are off, I'm sure the stress of the interview and potentially failing the drug test is playing a huge role in her mood but part of me also feels like were growing some distance from it. Am I overthinking this? I've been trying to go with the flow but I've also been dealing with some big job related stress and tend to really overthink when I'm stressed myself.

This afternoon we talked a bit about some work stresses that I've been dealing with (after her interview) and told her that I kinda hid my stresses from her at times and that it probably made me seem distant.  She said the same thing and how she wanted to work on improving her communication with me.  Conversation got a little flirty/sexual after all of this and kinda seemed back to normal but I know she'll continue to be stressed until she founds out the answer from her job....and we've certainly had some high period in the past few days but they've been short lived so I'm hoping this isn't just another one of those.  

How should I take things from here? Should I give her space and text less until this job interview period is over? Should I pull back and just let her invest the time? Thoughts?

tl;dr: Met a girl, hit it off instantly, things have been going great for the past month.

- has a job willing to work
- doesn't smoke at all or drink excessively preferably not at all but every once in a while I may drink so that it why I say just not constantly drinking alcohol 24/7
- not clingy
- takes care of his appearance (doesn't wear dirty wife beaters 24/7) 
- has their own car (it feels so unattractive when I have to be the one picking a guy up for a date) 

I don't think any of that is too much to ask. And yeah I have a type I prefer (kind of the geeky smart sweet guys)

Mish mash of questions but you will get the point.

I'm not good with conversations but so are girls, atleast from my Tinder and Messenger experience.

What girls like to talk about? What's a good way to approach girl and maintain conversation.

I'm like a ghost I scare people. I just suddenly appear out of nowhere or look like a creep.

So when I'm in a club how could I make female friends or make out if I don't talk much?

What girls should I approach? Group of them or some girl alone? Don't I bother them? Most just went out to have fun not for hook-ups probably.

If all of it goes well and she's comfortable around me what about touching or keeping her closer to my body to tell others she's mine.

Then how to ask if she wants sex? Shoud I just ask if she wants to come home with me? 

I don't give a f but telling her just Wanna fuck with me? won't get me anywhere 9/10 cases.

If she doesn't want sex that doesn't mean she doesn't want to be freid but rest of the night could be bit awkward or does girls get asked a lot and are used to it? What's better? Hints or straight to the point?

Kinda weird imo but asking her if she wants to cuddle and sleep at my place or while watching Netflix without long previous conversation.

My biggest problem is probably talking. Sometimes I have panic attack and don't want to talk or my emotions are turned off. What should I tell her? I don't like talking much or I don't feel well

Probably best convo line for me would be: I like you you look cute. I don't talk much and I'm bad dancer if you're bored or thirsty I'll be at the bar.

The way my gym works is that most things are downstairs and the ab machines and treadmills are upstairs. So I went upstairs and the ab section was pretty empty except for 3 cute girls who were all together working out. The my first workout was at a machine 4 feet from them and I couldn’t use it. I couldn’t bring myself to go anywhere near them.

I went the my second workout instead and it was across from them and if I looked up I could make eye contact with them. I’m terrified of them thinking I was looking at them, or thinking I thought one of them was attractive, or them noticing me in any way. So I just stared at the floor the entire time.

My third exercise was away from them, but they came and started using the two machines I was in between. It was just too much. I finished my set, got up, and left 15 after I showed up.

What’s crazy is this isn’t the first time I’ve done something like this. I’ve done it at the gym before, I’ve done it at restaurants, hanging out with friends even. There’s this one girl that’s a friend of a friend, and I can’t hang out with my friend if I know she’s inviting her. I’ve never said a sentence to the girl, I don’t she knows me past my name but I just can’t allow myself to be around her. Like the only way I feel like I can talk to women is over tinder and I don’t even get any matches so that’s a crap shoot.

I don’t know why I’m like this. The best guess is that it comes from some bad experiences I’ve had consistently with pretty girls wherein they bully me, make me feel like I’m not worthy to breath the same air as them or some other thing that’s fucked me up.

I don’t know how to fix it. I’m not in a position where I can afford therapy and I’m not sure about my university’s mental health services. I’ve heard from one friend that they are awful. I don’t know how to fix myself. I feel like such a loser.
