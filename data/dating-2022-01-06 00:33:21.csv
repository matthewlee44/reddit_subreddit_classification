1,rx85dt,1641452042,"I'm confused, did you want me to pay or not?","This might be a cultural issue, and I'm an American who is not afraid to date someone from another country. This specifically has to do with going out to eat with people from Asia, either as a friend date or a romantic one.

It's a little difficult to say because there are some people who expect you to pay Dutch while there are others who wholeheartedly believe the man should pay for the date.

This is where I'm confused.

I've been on dates where the man is angry that I tried to pay at all, and it soured the whole mood.

I've been on dates where the person practically throws their card at the waiter as soon as the check arrives before I can even look at it or pull out a wallet, but they are somehow angry that I didn't split the check...

I'm not going to fight you to pay the bill. Especially if you didn't even give me a chance to pull out a wallet.

I'm not going to shove you out the way and throw your card away and slam mine down to pay instead. That's ridiculous.

I'm not sure if it was a cultural problem and people are expected to fight and offer to pay a hundred times until someone eventually acquiesces to letting the entire bill be covered by someone else, or insisting that it be split.

I'm also not against splitting a bill, if it's requested that we split the bill. But since I've been burned by even suggesting that I split the bill, I just don't know what to think anymore.

I'm not sure if allowing someone to pay the bill in it's entirety shows that you're more serious about the date. I just don't know anymore.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rx85dt/im_confused_did_you_want_me_to_pay_or_not/
2,rx88f2,1641452382,moving on from something that probably won’t work out,"long story short, i started seeing someone close to a year ago and i have never felt so comfortable or safe with anyone. i’ve had a hard time in past relationships feeling that sense of security but i have felt it with him from the start. we have the same sense of humor, similar views and values and just get along so easily. he’s so kind and empathetic and truly cares about my well being and mental health. sadly for me he moved far across the country for job about 6 months ago.

we still talk every single day but we are not necessarily exclusive and never really got to that point because he found out he was moving pretty early into when we started seeing each other. so far we have flown to visit each other once each and we have a plan in the works for another visit next month but it isn’t a cheap or easy time getting there. 

my feelings are still so strong but i also have this constant fear in the back of my mind that he’s going to move on and meet someone new. i try to just enjoy it for what it is but i am so caught up that i can’t even get myself to think about anyone else romantically. 

there isn’t really any chance of us being close together again any time soon. he is loving his job and is getting established and i don’t really see myself ever moving out where he is because it is the opposite coast from my family and i really love where i am now. 

so basically i just know it is going to end eventually and i am questioning if i should just move on and stop investing in something that will probably end in heartbreak

i also have this deep fear that ill never meet anyone who i get along with so well and who accepts me as i am the way he does. i know its dramatic sounding probably but im scared ill never find anyone who could possibly love me again

should i keep this going and just enjoy it or should i try to move on?

5,rx8giu,1641453208,Are people bad at rejecting/agree to date others without knowing what they want due to bad mental health/emotional unavailability? Or is there something else as to why not rejecting me directly?,"So as background-I basically talked for couple months and briefly dated a guy casually (like not exclusive as I am not looking for too serious but open to it playing out) in a low pressure way to get to know each other.  Back then he was always good about initiating daily texting and continuing convos, would compliment all my Snapchat stories, and was chatty during our dates (and even admitted to having nerves after them).  We both mutually took a break (which is its own story) and it was his idea to reconsider trying in the future which I said I’m open for. 

Anyways a month ago I reached out and checked on him, which was 3.5 months since our break/NC.  He’d answer and never ignore but overall got a sense his energy changed.  He was friendly/conversational maybe just first few days.  But like he wasn’t initiating the way he used to, and whether or not he’d ask me questions depended on the day.  When I asked, he said along the lines of he’s definitely down, his extended family moving from out of the country which will be hectic but he’s up for it (his tone in that particular message sounded genuinely down).  But again our convos, unlike our past, only seemed to exist if I kept them going, and he would also reply very dry some days (like messages as surface level and dry as “lmao idk,” “GM,” “oh nice,” or “sup”).

I decided to tell him I’ve been feeling our vibe is off/not strong compared to our past in spite of him saying he’s down, and asked what’s changed and how he really feels.  All he said was “oh I’ve just been sick and my family just moved here.”  I know there’s truth to that, but it still felt vague and dodgy towards confronting what he feels.  I told him I hope he feels better and to be honest about how he really feels abt us and rekindling and he claimed he’s still down for it.  I basically put the ball in his court to reach out to initiate hanging.

And I backed off 3 days from messaging him, and only messaged him when I got tipsy one night.  Two days conversing after that night, he apologized (probably for skipping some of my messages) and revealed he’s spiraling as life is hitting him.  When I asked if he’d like to talk about it he said it’s existential crisis.  I basically told him  he’ll push through and wished him well, which he appreciated.  And I retreated back to refraining from messaging him.  It’s been 3 weeks since that interaction, and the only interaction we had was me wishing him happy birthday (and him thanking me) on what happened to coincidentally also be Christmas Eve. 

At this point I accepted that it mostly likely isn’t meant to be and not worth pressing.  I’d like to gain insight into his confusing behavior of agreeing but showing dryness/an overall change in energy and investment.    And why he couldn’t straightforward reject me.  Mostly as closure.  I know a couple people did say he sounds like he’s not in the right headspace to know what he wants in life in general.  So could it be his emotional unavailability is not making him in tune with his emotions to fully understand what he’s doing when he agreed?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rx8giu/are_people_bad_at_rejectingagree_to_date_others/

I developed feelings for her, and I thought she felt the same way about me coz of how much chemistry we had. I confessed to her after 4 months. She then said ‘I thought we’re just friends’ and then I said ‘I thought you liked me’ (coz she was giving a lot of signs imho), and then she replied saying ‘I’m seeing someone, but it doesn’t mean anything.’

9,rx91et,1641455514,Girlfriend is finding me annoying and has now changed how she talks to me,"We [M21,F22] have been together for 1 year now. Although we are technically still in the honeymoon phase, we have had our fair share of disagreements and arguments. 

For a few weeks now things have been filled with tension and it eventually got to a point where she told me that she needs time to think about our relationship going forward. We continued to see each other and go out with friends, however, I have noticed that small things have started to irritate her, and the quirky things I used to do, are now somewhat of an annoyance. 

She says that I make a lot of ""dumb"" decisions, when majority of the time, it's just innocent mistakes. She straight up told me that I am annoying her recently

Yesterday we were hiking with some friends and she put her hand over my shoulder and I did the same with her. I slipped on a rock and ended up knocking her on the head by accident, in the past she would just brush it off as a minor mistake, but instead, she was quite upset about it even after I apologised. She did not want to hold my hand for the remainder of the hike even after apologizing.

Not too long ago, she stonewalled me after I stood in this long line for tickets at an arcade when unbeknown to me, I could've just have jumped the queue...these are the things that have frustrated her recently

Now, she has sent one-word text replies, which is in no way the norm for her. We usually text good morning and goodnight with other endearing messages and nicknames, but there has been none of that. Everything has been stone cold responses. Last time she was scrolling on Instagram to show me something and she slightly turned her phone so that I couldn't see what was on the screen. I have no idea why, but she probably feels like she cannot trust me with things

It's so evident to see that something is wrong and she is not telling me, despite me asking. Maybe she just needs space and time, I told her that I feel that something is up and that we need to talk about it. What else do you think cam be done and what appears to be wrong ?

TL;DR: Girlfriend has been acting different lately and has vented her frustrations on to me. She is no longer communicating the way she usually would",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rx91et/girlfriend_is_finding_me_annoying_and_has_now/
10,rx96hu,1641456049,Out of the game,"I went on a coffee date last week with a guy I met off an app. Unsurprisingly I felt really nervous because I just got out of a long distance relationship awhile back, and before that I paused dating for a good 5 years to work on myself, so I’m not too used to doing this. The date ended up lasting far longer than I expected because we got to talking about similar interests, and by the end he was putting out feelers for a second date. We’ve planned it for this weekend but I’m a little worried. Texting oscillates between being awkward to sometimes being really fun, and I guess I was wondering if that’s the normal growing pains of getting to know someone?

Of course I responded back with a ""Because you wanted to see me."" and her response really wasn't much of a good omen though it wasn't bad by any means. Frankly that annoyed me as I felt like that was just playing games with me and I'm frankly just rolling my eyes over such bipolar responses. I had talks with my friends who both know her and know about the situation saying that when I return to my hometown, she needs to be the one to reach out about the coffee date and see if she really actually is interested and they feel like its the best approach.

26,rxayiz,1641463138,Why are men like this🥲🤣,"I only had two boyfriends. First one lasted for four years and the second one was two years and was actually a failed engagement.

I have been single for two years after that. Still putting myself out there, and boy, the dating world ain’t that fun these days. After countless dates with guys who only wants a fuck buddy or a relationship without commitment, I finally met this guy. Let’s call him Justin (not his real name).

Justin and I started out really great. Good chemistry, matching sense of humor, open communication. You name it. We even had similarities with our past relationships which gave us a strong foundation on starting our relationship, since we talked about what we learned to do and not to do.

Fast forward, he went on a week trip with his guy friends (friends that I met and hang out with multiple times). Then on his IG story I heard a girl’s voice and asked him about it. He then said its a friend who joined last minute. So I was like, okay, have fun.

Then a month later, he has been dealing with family problems and was really depressed. My dumb ass decided to give him flowers thinking it’ll make him feel better. It did, he even thought it was cute. (Keep this in mind).

Now here comes intuition, right? Everything was going so well. Met his friends, met his family. He spends most of his time at my place, I kid you not we were almost like living together at this point but my intuition was just not getting it.

So when I went to his place, and he got sick for three days, I stayed there and took care of him. As I was cleaning his place, I saw a ticket to an amusement park. I checked the date and backread on our conversation. He said he was at a goodbye party for his friend. I kept the ticket and didn’t say anything. 

We got to talking and asked him about it a week later and he confessed that he actually went to the amusement park with friends and the girl that was on the trip I mentioned awhile ago. He said, he didnt want to tell me because he didnt want me to get mad. So I was like, why lie then?

And I am familiar with patterns, he lied about this girl twice now so I was like, I am not having it. Let’s break up.

Homeboy freaked out and came to my apartment apologizing. I am not the type of girlfriend who would check my boyfriend’s phone, but I asked him if he can show me his conversation with the girl. When he did it was deleted. So I already knew he’s lying.

The next day, I messaged the girl to ask if she really is just a friend of Justin and guess what? She’s actually his girlfriend. I kid you not I got so confused with what the past few months really was. I met with the girl, let’s call her Rose. Rose is a cool person (we ended up being good friends after this). Turns out they’ve been dating before even Justin and I met. Turns out whenever Justin and I meet in the morning, he meets with Rose in the evening. Vice versa. Or after he spends the night with me, he goes to Rose the next day. Full time fuck boy and this guy is 30 years old, with a job that is actually important, so I cannot comprehend how amazing he was with juggling everything. The funny part from all of this for me was when I gave him that flower, he gave it to Rose the next day, apologizing to her for always being late. (Late because he was with me earlier on the day) Rose also told me she met his friends and family as well so BRO WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK?

I have met good and bad guys but this is just on another level.

I am so broken since after two years of being single and a failed engagement, I chose the wrong person to trust and it was a shitshow all of that is just the tip of the iceberg.

So, this guy off of Hinge gave me a rose. I was flattered because I thought he was cute and the conversation to start was nice. At the time this occured it was the holidays and when I'm with fam I try not use to my phone as much. Also, it just so happened that our family dog got very ill. I literally sat by him everyday of the last two weeks of his life feeding him through a syringe. He died on Christmas day. I was also applying to grad school and had to submit my apps that week. 

Anyway, I was distracted for good reason and I made sure to tell him that I wasn't ignoring his texts but just had a lot going on at the time. I said that I'd love to meet up but may need to respond to his texts in person. He would send 5 paragraphs of text per day no matter if I responded or not so I found it a bit overwhelming. 

Fast forward to the date, the first thing he said was, ""Hey, wasn't sure if you'd show up because you're such a bad texter."" I apologized for my poor texting habits but explained that the last two weeks were a bit hectic. He continued to keep making jabs throughout the date.

I tried to be in good spirits, but I told him that I was still quite sad about our family dog dying. He said that he hated dogs and it was just a dog, not a human, so it was no excuse. 

Then he proceeded to say he hated cats too. Which surprised me because my profile definitely gives off crazy cat lady vibes since all of my photos contained my cat. I was kinda thinking, ""why the hell did you match with me"". I've previously dated someone who wanted me to choose between my cat or him if we moved in together. I obviously chose my cat.

44,rxdex1,1641471969,Get Happy,"Hey r/dating

I'm just a regular fella, i'm married, middle aged and pretty unremarkable, but I see a whole lot of questions on this sub and r/relationship_advice and it's prompted me to make a ""pearl of wisdom"" post, mainly because when i'm replying to such, I often regurgitate a lot of the same crap.

Now i'm not gonna sit here and claim that anything I say is brand new, however it could well be the thing someone needs to read at this given moment, and in that respect, it's enough. So here we go.

Firstly, if you're the kind of person who is asking:

\- Do guys like X girls?

\- Do girls like Y guys?

\- What about X bod?

Stop. Stop doing that. People are individuals. You might as well ask whether some people have blue as their favourite colour. The answer would be about as helpful. The answer is always going to be ""some will, some won't"". That shouldn't be the question you're asking, the question you should be asking is ""am I into guys/girls who are into X girls/guys?"".

And the reason why is because you're implying you're gonna become that thing, right? So it makes sense, do you want a partner who values that thing or not? Because if you don't, why on earth would you become that thing? This leads us to the most important question:

**""Will becoming the thing make me happy?""**

This is the big question. So you want a gym bod. You want a new haircut. Is this going to make you happy? You may have decided that yes, I like guys/girls that are into X bod/haircut, I can stomach that. However will YOU be happy with the version of yourself that change requires? If not, do you \*really\* think the potential happiness that may enter your life through another person is worth that toll on your self-happiness?

TIP: The answer is NO.

Because people are **naturally attracted to happiness**. The best relationships are always those where the people are in a jovial state and make each other more positive. People enter into relationships to \*add\* stuff to their life, and happiness is something people very rarely can have too much of, so a happy person is always more inviting to add into one's life than someone who appears to have some degree of self-loathing of self-doubt, always. 

So the important thing, at risk of sounding very token is to **get happy**. By this I don't mean talking yourself up or engaging in talking to the mirror, or writing lists of things about yourself you think are cool. I mean you need to actually self reflect and determine which version of yourself is the one that makes you feel at ease, at peace, content and confident. That's what I mean by getting happy. If you're not there yet, what's in the way? You should try and do that to try and get there, because it is this happiness that is the real magnet to other people more so than anything else.

It's not easy, and it's not something you can just click your fingers and do. It takes time, it may take therapy. It can take painful reflection. It can require you to abandon prior values and ""take some hits"" for a bit of a painful period. It might require to take what you think (at the given moment) are losses. It isn't comfortable always. Often what is comfortable isn't what is good for us, but if we strive for the good, eventually we end up in a place where happiness and comfort aren't in conflict, but are bedfellows. All too often lack of success in the dating game is because people aren't there yet, they're at a stage where one of these things infringes upon the other and in doing so and making a choice, they aren't really happy or they aren't comfortable. This equals bad relationship.

I can claim no real expertise on this other than my own experience. As said i'm a regular guy, married. I wasn't always married, but I was pretty successful with women when I was younger from my mid-teens up to just before I met my wife - and believe me the happiness is largely all I had. I'm not tall, i'm not built broad, I went bald at 18 and I have the natural rhythm of a beached fish. Initially when I did go bald I lost huge confidence, but shortly after I accepted it and it's at that point I think I found ""the happiness"" because suddenly I became very self-assured and ""fuck it, this is what I am and i'm cool with that, and if others aren't, that's fine too."" and off I went. My dating success at this age eclipsed that of my more conventionally attractive, taller and fitter mates and at that point both they and I were unsure why, but looking back i'm pretty sure it's because I was always very happy and self-assured. Not in an obnoxious ""sunshine and rainbows"" way, but I never brought negativity into the lives of people I met as fair as I (and they) recall. It was always good stuff.

So having typed enough, that's the advice really. Yes it is very token and generic, you know ""just love yourself"" but it is actually true. Ask yourself if you'd want to date someone who moans all the time. WHo complains about how they look. Constantly seeks validation for their appearence and seems hung up on it. WHo constantly asks you to compare them to people they think are more attractive than they are. You'd probably be like ""nope"". So if you do any of these things, why would anyone want to date you?

You need to find a version of yourself that is natural for you to be and natural for you to love. If you place your confidence and happiness on a version of yourself that isn't natural to you and not ""how you roll, and how you really do want to roll"", that confidence and happiness will only ever be borrowed, never whole. It needs to be whole. 

But let me be clear, this isn't me saying ""don't improve, don't get fit, don't do X"" because that's not what I am saying. I'm saying DO IT FOR YOU because it's something you want to do to make yourself feel good about you, and you feel like it's a version of you you want to explore and love. Don't do it to command the behaviours of other people. The biggest command of other people's behaviour is a simple question of them asking themselves ""does this person feel like they'd make my life better and more interesting?"" and you can almost always get an answer of ""YES"" to that question from a good chunk of people if you are actually content and happy with yourself in a genuine manner.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rxdex1/get_happy/
45,rxdgw8,1641472161,What activity (sexual or non-sexual) did your partner talk you into trying that you think was a terrible idea and caused the relationship to deteriorate or end?,"Khm, I'll start.

1. Hiking.
Several previous dates/boyfriends wanted to go hiking with me. I always objected at first, pointing out that I have asthma. ""Oh that's ok, we'll go slowly"", they promised. Once we were there, I started lagging behind after like 10-20 mins and they would be like, ""Is it really this bad, can't you hurry up? Is it because you are overweight? Isn't your inhaler supposed to make it go away?"" etc. etc. By the end, usually one of us was shouting and the other one was crying. The only guy I was able to hike with was a dude whose mom had asthma, so he had been trained from a young age to keep pace with her.

This might sound like an example very specific to me because of my asthma, but anecdotally I have heard of quite a few couples (where this is not an issue) having conflict or breaking up over jogging or hiking together where the dude is putting pressure on his girlfriend to go at his pace.

2. A sexual example would be sexting. I generally consider it a bit of a yuck activity for losers, but occasionally I have given in for the sake of someone else. 
Again, like hiking, this is an activity where men tend to want to go at their own pace. And because the partner is not physically present, there is no constant nonverbal feedback that tells them clearer than any words that they need to slow down. Let's say I'm just starting to warm up and think that it might be nice to cuddle him, when I get a text saying that he wants to, say, suck my clit. On a psychological level, this feels like being sexually assaulted and it definitely puts me off any IRL sex with that dude.

56,rxebts,1641474810,Honestly; online pictures of a person affect how attractive I see them IRL,"I (F26) just recently realized how strong affect this phenomenon has on me. 

So, to me, seeing pictures of a person online already creates a sort of ‘first impression’. If your pictures are good and I find you attractive there, I will most certainly find you attractive IRL too when we first meet, even tho I’d normally not find you attractive if I had seen you first IRL.

But it’s not only the first impression that the pictures can change of how attractive I perceive a person. Example; I had a guy approaching me IRL at work, we had talked a bit and I didn’t really think he was my type so I just kept the talking as professionally cold as possible. After several months he then randomly added my Instagram, and later at home I went through his. He had some really good pictures that showed the best features of his face with strong jaw (which I had not noted before or simply is not visible IRL) etc. and immediately I saw him attractive and at work when he walked in I’d feel this extreme attraction to him. Nothing in him had changed, I just saw the pictures and boom. 

Even when I have been in longer relationships a sudden good picture of my partner can totally change or boost how damn hot I see them. 

Right now, I’m dating a guy who has really, really poor pictures online, and I just realized how much this affects me. Since I have been part of digital and social media era for so many years, I think that my brain has started to create this unnecessarily strong link between online and IRL reality. Because, when I compare him to my previous dates/partners, he is much better looking IRL, and has all personality qualities I find attractive. Yet, I find myself thinking something is just off, I’m not sure about this, why am I still thinking wether I’m really that attracted to him? Then I just went to Tinder to seek answers to this and it hit me on my face that really, those pictures just affect so much. Then I went to his Facebook and found one really good picture and all of the sudden this feeling of doubt just disappeared. 

Mind you, attractive pictures doesn’t just necessarily mean that someone looks “perfect”. It can be millions of things; like an angle, facial expression, quality of pic, some specific action happening in a pic, etc. 

For reference; I’m extremely visual and aesthetic person (I paint, love art, makeup, colors, etc.). I react very strongly to aesthetically pleasing experiences (like crying in sunset). I have been in social media for atleast 10 years, and using dating apps on-off for almost the same amount. 

Has anyone else experienced something similar? How would you describe it? Why do you think this happens?

I (M20) met this girl (M18) at work in October (we’re coworkers) and I asked her out in December on a date and she accepted.

We had a really good first date, we talked at Starbucks for over 3 hours and said personal things about our lives to each other even though we’re both introverts. She told me that she doesn’t know how she feels about me but says she is interested in me.

She also said that she sees potential in us and that we could have a really good relationship.

She told me she wants to take things slow because she’s been heartbroken before and she wants to do this right with me and I told her that I am fine with going slow and for to take the time she needs. She also said she wants to see where my priorities lie because she is now part of my life

We used to text every single day and call almost every day but yesterday she says she doesn’t want us to talk for a few days so we can have more to say to each other when we do text. I was confused because I thought it would be normal to talk or even text to the person your interested in everyday just so you can chat with them. 

I’m just confused because the day before she asked me on a second date so why now today she wants for us not to talk for a few days? The next time I see her at work is Saturday so I’m just not gonna text her and see what happens on Saturday. 

Now today she texts me again and after we talked for a little bit she says that she needs her space and to contact Every other day even though she texted me first.

I’m also concerned how long she wants to take it slow because she might be getting accepted to her dream college in the fall which would be 25 mins away from me so I don’t know what her intentions are and what she sees this potential relationship going I guess. She wouldn’t be taking it slow if she saw it as a fling or something to distract in the meantime but idk.

Again I’m fine with taking things slow; I’m in no rush I’m just confused 

Does anyone have an opinion on this and why she doesn’t want to talk everyday now?

TL;DR! is the girl I’m talking to want to actually take things slow or is just playing games with me",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rxepwi/does_the_girl_im_talking_to_actually_want_to_take/
61,rxfe1a,1641478022,Should I move on?,"So, for a quick back story, I (23M) and my ex (22M) went through a rough patch last spring where he said he's had thoughts of wanting to be with other guys and thought about breaking up with e. We worked things out, and that didn't happen. 2 months later, I break up with him for reasons unrelated to that patch. After we broke up, we agreed to just be sexually exclusive and FWBs. No feelings, just being there for each other when we needed someone.

6 months have passed since, and he texted me this week saying ""I don't think I can be just exclusive with you anymore."" Which was a fine statement I was okay with, until he followed it with ""I like you and you're perfect and I have feelings for you and you're what I want in a man. But I don't know if I'm going to be getting on Tinder/Grindr/Etc to be hooking up with guys because its such a process i hate. I just need to have time for no commitment to see what i want"" It just seemed very conflicting, and didn't make sense. He also made it clear when we broke up last year that he didn't want to date anyone else, and I'd be the only man he'd want to date.

I don't know, maybe I'm overthinking the entire situation. On one hand, I kinda still have feelings and want to date him again. But he's clearly not ready for commitment and he doesn't sound like he knows what he wants. On the other hand, I just want to text him back saying ""OK, go do what you want to do. But good luck finding someone who loved you as much as I did.""

Reddit, sound off.

Edit: forgot to add, when we first met, he was in a ""wild"" phase, and said when he met me, everything felt natural and right and didn't feel the need to be ""wild"" anymore, but now he says he doesn't think he got the energy out.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rxfe1a/should_i_move_on/

64,rxfkev,1641478522,I see no point in dating,"It's been 9 years (30M) since my last girlfriend, and I've done a lot of thinking about this internal conflict (to no avail), so I'm going to be as lucid and succinct as possible.

I am in kind of a no-(wo)man's-land, stuck between a rock and a hard place, because after what happened with that ex, I made a snap decision (unconsciously, I did not think about it) that I did not want to repeat or ever be in that kind of situation again, and then generalized that the likelihood that I would be, was very high, if not certain.

When I meet a new woman, I automatically get too serious too quickly. It's just what I do automatically. Too emotionally invested right off the bat, I start thinking of our life together, I make her the most important thing, and so forth - actually I realize this happens before we even meet, i.e. as soon as I see a new woman I'm attracted to (and thus even walking on the street is my own personal hell, a roller coaster of emotion that has me right now keeping my head down, sometimes crossing the road, just to avoid women).

So in other words, I automatically go into commitment mode with new women (or put them in ""that role""), and I'm deathly afraid of the kind of out of control position *I put myself into*.

The whole process becomes a kind of hell: she's always on my mind, if she's onboard we go really fast really quick (if not it's a hard crash that's hard to get over), and it takes over my life.

This is an almost certainty to me, and it's really scary.

Not only because I'm so far out of control, but because I am ripe for being taken advantage of if she is that kind of woman.

And unfortunately, I've generalized the situation of my last ex from 2013 to all if not most women: which was a highly turbulent relationship I felt trapped in (despite not being, that's just the ""emotionality"", and a huge part of this problem), in which **she was actively and openly trying to get pregnant** (she literally was taking pregnancy tests, as just one key example, and I was too naive to put 2 and 2 together), so my feeling of being trapped was quite literally leading me towards a situation where I would have been (financially, at least).

Then on the other hand, I have no interest in one night stands.

So I have this kind of black and white, don't-want-it-either-way kind of view of dating, which makes me at first really avoidant of women (not just on the street, I have for example stopped attending interest groups when it became clear a woman there was interested in me), and then, in the rare cases where a woman happens to ""slip through the cracks"" (not sure of what, my defenses I guess), I literally freeze up when we start to get intimate, to the point that even if we're heavy petting, I just refuse to kiss them.

I can't tell you exactly why, but the sense under it as far as I can tell is going back to that feeling of being helplessly trapped.

I asked a female friend of mine (also a rare occurrence, but sometimes if I'm not romantically interested or if the pressure is off because she's got a boyfriend/husband/fiance I know, and thus morally I wouldn't let anything happen, I can get along with women), and she suggested I just take things one day at a time, but it's like I don't have that mode. 

I'm either 0 or 100, and since I neither want one night stands, nor being trapped in commitment, I try very hard to keep myself at 0, which frankly would not even be so much of a problem, if I wasn't being constantly bombarded with heavily investing in the opinions and outcomes of women I find attractive even if I haven't met them yet.

Then when I do go to 100, I'm so totally out of control that a relationship takes over my life, it's usually more burdensome than fun, and if that doesn't suck the life out of it enough for her, it does for me, to the point where I break it off because I can't stand the rest of my life coming to a standstill.

So it seems I'm afraid of my own default behavior: that the thing I am afraid of happening, is the very direction I unconsciously direct the relationship towards - and the potential consequences of that are huge, right from the get-go.

I have ambition, projects, some semblance of a life I'm building, and it all comes to a screeching halt as I prioritize women. I don't want that (allegedly) and yet that's precisely what I seem to automatically, unconsciously, be directing literally \*every\* relationship towards, even if the only way we're ""related"" is if we made eye contact (and god forbid she smiles at me - I'm gone down a rabbit hole for at least the day).

A friend of mine told me that I don't actually \*want\* women, but I feel I \*need\* them. Upon reflection, this seems spot on. I don't actually have the ""wanting"" type of desire or interest (i.e. proactive, or trying to enjoy things), but I do have this kind of ""needing"" (i.e. reactive, or trying to fill a void). I saw this because recently for whatever reason I have had glimpses of actually wanting women I see around (overriding the general fear and anxiety), as well as actual attraction. But these are few and far between.

I know there's likely some deep psychology involved here, especially obvious since (a) there was a definite time when I lost interest in consummating relationships, and (b) that relationship itself was ""patterned"" after the dynamics of my parents' marriage, which was cold, unloving, and full of screaming as they very obviously felt trapped together because of me (I don't shout, but the cold and trapped parts, crucially, were there, and we were tell on our way towards creating a ""because of"").

But I do wonder whether anybody who has (and thank you for having) taken the time to read this, can offer some insight into hopefully at least having women have less of a negative impact on me, if not being able to actually have a healthy relationship that is light-hearted and fun (though in the direction of being enduring, i.e. not aiming towards one night stands) - though I get the sense that these two are related.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rxfkev/i_see_no_point_in_dating/

I have met someone I really like via online dating, it's been over 2-3 months of talking daily and seeing each other regularly to go on dates or even just hang out, with staying at each others and whatnot - we even did a weekend away.

We have both said some things whilst drunk about liking each other and it's affectionate when we hang out but over text message I get crippling anxiety that the person is not into me. It makes me feel uneasy and anxious and I feel like I'm always checking for a text or replying ""too soon"" so I sometimes have to force myself to relax and not reply instantly. I even get funny about sending the first text and want to wait for her to see if she would reach out to contact me but end up sending one anyway when I've got some downtime at work.

I openly deleted my dating apps but didn't want to prompt or force her to do the same and I'm unsure if she has. We had a small chat and she said she still considers herself single, but we agreed not to have sex with anyone else without letting the other person know but we didn't discuss if we would still socially date other people, which I am not.

She's very confident and strong headed, which I really like and would never change but also makes her incredibly difficult to read because she's very sarcastic and not overly complimentary, whereas I quite enjoy words of affirmation. I'm already not great at reading signs so I'm sure I miss a lot of signals or I'm being blind to them because I'm worried about if she likes me or not.

I don't want to pressure her in any form, she has her own life and I have mine but I feel so uneasy at the moment living in the fear that I might end up being rejected, ghosted or even replaced by someone if she were to go on a date and meet someone better than me.

I (24m) recently went on a 4 day trip with a girl (28f) I have been dating for about a month. She invited me at the very last minute as she had to go to her secondary residence in another city for a doctor's appointment and was going to be alone for NYE. I drove us out and back and we stayed at her apartment.

I put on my boyfriend A game for this first trip together: made a romantic multi course meal for NYE, put together a spa night for her one night, drove her to her doctors appointment and waited in the car 2 hours during the appointment, took her to the art gallery (she loves art), took her to a scenic lookout she hadn't seen before, and even helped with some upkeep/cleaning around her apartment.

Despite politely thanking me for these gestures and saying they were sweet, I really didn't feel like there was much ""buy in"". For a trip she wanted me to come on, she seemed very occupied with other things she needed to get done (extra work in the evening, various phone calls).There was limited intimacy on the trip (she says she has a low drive for even the most basic forms of intimacy and many previous partners have complained about this). She also just felt tired and low energy for a good portion of the trip.

Last day of the trip, her and I had a chat about the mismatched desire for intimacy and agreed it was something we needed to work on (she indicated she felt a little smothered and I indicated I felt a little neglected). She said she had fun and kissed me goodbye when I dropped her off at the end of the trip. I tried phoning her the next day and she said that she was too busy. So I texted her what I was going to say which was an offer of some space given her and I just spent an intense few days together. She very easily agreed to this and said she would phone me on the weekend.

I just don't know how to feel. I definitely am not of the mind that she owes me anything for all of these nice gestures I did (that's just my style). But I do feel the right thing for her to do if she's actually interested is to seem engaged and want to talk to me (like how someone might normally express interest in someone else!). With anyone else I would say this is a clear cue it is over but any instance I raise something like this/that she's not into me, she insists she is and says that she just doesn't feel up to providing constant validation (I think this is a little unfair because right now it seems like there is almost no validation occurring).

I was wondering if anyone could tell me of some steps one might take to learn how to date people/understand your own feelings? How did you do it when you started out?

Hey folks, I was having mild anxiety attacks and it was affecting me mentally as I was overthinking about my health as I was worried and i was exhausted and stressful with work as well, and for this once he couldn’t be there for me. So I would like to seek an insight and advice on what should I do? 

1) I understand that he’s stressful and overwhelmed with school stuff and school has been crazily given them lots of assignments and workload and it only been 1st day of school after the holidays

2) I have been there for him every single day giving him encouragement and I once made a study kit for him as well to distress

3) he told me he couldn’t be there for me mentally as he couldn’t even be there for himself that’s when I told him then let me be there for you. Aren’t relationship supposed to pick each other up? And he agreed. Earlier he told me was to distract myself so that at least it can make me feel better but I told him that what I needed was not this but rather point 4.

4) I felt that he doesn’t concern about my mental wellbeing as I don’t expect much from him and what I need was words of encouragement or comforting words and it’s just simple gestures like “virtual hug” (for e.g)

5) but I do appreciate for the fact that even tho he’s busy with his assignments, he tries to reply me as he saw my message.

Here’s some context. Every time I message him, he either gives a short, curt response, or doesn’t respond at all. For example if I tell him I love him, he doesn’t respond until he wants to tell me something. He also always pushes my boundaries, I feel like. For example, one time I kept saying no, or pushing his hand away. He still did it, and I was too scared to say no. Admittedly, it felt nice, but also very uncomfortable. I’m also a virgin, and he takes this to his advantage. He always says how he wants me to be his, and when I say I am his, he says not 100%. He always insinuates something sexual when I speak/text him. He always makes me chase him. I always have to go to him. He never comes to me. When I don’t go see him, he thinks I don’t love him anymore. He invalidates my opinion, and occasionally, out of nowhere, degrades my siblings. He calls me almost daily, and I get happy, but struggle to answer the call. The reason being, is that every time he calls me, I feel like I have to carry the conversation. Our phone calls go for hours, the majority of the time being silence. Another thing he does, is frequently talks about the future. He always has me in his future, however it seems like he’s having second thoughts. He doesn’t seem to want to move in with me, even though he asked me that first, and said he would come with me the first time we spoke about it. He says I’ll be his “trophy wife” while he stays at home. He said this when I said I’m going to college. He also thinks that I’m always ignoring him. What really hurt me, was when I saw another woman’s name on his phone. Granted, that could have been his friend, however, I don’t think so.

80,rxiag4,1641485781,"How would you interpret it if women used to hit on you and even take initiative in asking you out, but now it’s just radio silence?","I am 30M, for reference.

Used to be that in high school and college I would have at least one woman per year who went out of her way to speak to me, express interest, even confess feelings for me. 

But for the past 6 or 7 years, I’ve just been a ghost. Women cross the street when they see me approaching. Online interactions usually fizzle out before we’ve had 10 minutes’ worth of conversation, and that’s in the narrow 5% of the time that they respond at all. And no, my attempts at initiation are never just “hey” or “what’s up”, I usually type out something relevant, something we have in common, and turn the conversation into a question so they have something to bat back at me. IRL they seem ok with being friendly but balk at any flirting.

I don’t know. My hairline isn’t quite as good as it used to be but it’s not a disaster, and I otherwise am told by virtually everyone that I look young. I have gained weight but am only 160 pounds. In high school I was 130.

I suspect it is my attitude and personality. I try really hard to mask my depression, and nobody treats me differently to my face, but I can’t help feeling like they must pick up on it. I’ve been told I’m funny and know that I can still make people laugh because people often laugh at the things I say, but maybe they can tell my heart’s not in it. If this is the problem, I have tried for over a decade to fix the problem with therapy and meds, but it only gets worse, so in that case I may be screwed.

I also would like to add that I am not asking a question, or asking for advise or anything like that, I just felt like sharing my story and seeing what people think. And yes, I know I'm the asshole in the following situations. 

So for some background, I am a male and will soon be turning 30. I am fat, ugly, have little to no self esteem, hate my self image, I have pretty severe social anxiety, I am depressed and honestly I'm leaning more and more to being considered antisocial. In short I am a complete mess 😅. I have had two serious relationships in my life, one which lasted for about 5 years and another which is hard to quantify and is the focus of this post, both of which I, through a series of fuck ups and stupid/selfish decisions, have basically ruined for myself and the women involved. 

On to the story. I was born and raised in South Africa and since kindergarten was bullied mercilessly until my family moved to the USA when I was eleven. One of my mom's friends had three kids, all around my age. Two sons and a daughter, who I will refer to as L, who was only a few months older than me. We would play together a lot and there was always a connection between L and me to the point where I've always had very strong feelings for her. She was my first kiss and I was hers. When we were 9, both of our families were trying to leave South Africa to start a better life. After a few let downs and some extenuating circumstances my mom was finally able to be recruited by a company in the US and we were set to move to Arizona in 2003. That same year, L's mom was recruited by the same company, but they were moving to Florida about a month before we were moving. We were both sad to not be able to see each other anymore, but we were excited at a new start since both of us had some bad experiences with bullying to that point. 

Fast forward a few years down the line and when we were about 13 or 14, we reestablished contact with each other after my mom, my grandparents and I passed through Florida on vacation and visited them. After a few more years of our families visiting back and forth, we started messaging each other a lot and at 16 started long distance ""dating."" When I was 18, I went to visit her and her family for a week in the summer and while there we fooled around a bit, but nothing too seriously. She then came to visit me and my family for a week that winter over the Christmas and New Years holiday. She would sneak into my bed every night to cuddle, and my stupid, oversexed, 18 year old brain, thought that we would just continue from where we left off and continue to fool around, but she really wasn't into it so after a few attempts I let it go. On New Year's day, we all went on a road trip to Sedona, and while we were there she broke up with me over text while sitting next to me in the car. Originally she had told me that she didn't feel like I wanted a relationship with her and that I was acting more like a friend than a boyfriend. The next day she was leaving again and I drove her to the airport. That week I was told that she had, immediately on returning to Florida, went to Disney World with her brothers, a cousin and some guy, and that she and the guy were potentially sharing a room or bed. This sent me into a depression and rage filled spiral in which I posted some very horrible things about her on her Facebook page, basically unfairly calling her out for cheating. 

Over the next 4 or 5 years I struggled to get over her and my depression (not all caused by the breakup) wore me down to the point where I dropped out of university after not leaving my room for an entire month. While I was at university I had met a woman who was a few months younger than me, who I will call K, and I was very attracted to her, but she was in a relationship. About a year and a half after dropping out and starting culinary school, K reached out to me and we started talking and met up a few times. Shortly thereafter, we started dating. There were a few hiccups here and there, but for the most part it was good and she moved in with me at my parents' house. We moved out together into an apartment and things were going pretty well, however deep down I knew that something wasn't right and that we weren't meant to be, but instead of talking about it or working on it, I just ignored it and kept leading K on. Then the pandemic hit and things were starting to fray more and more and I started to realize that I didn't feel that strong of feelings towards K as I did with L. After thinking about it for a few months I decided to reach out to L again, and apologized for my actions. After talking things out with her for a few months and having talked to my mother for a while about how I was feeling about K, I realized that I was just going to end up hurting K in the end by continuing to lead her on, because I could not see a future with her. We first took a break, but after a while I realized that I didn't love her in the romantic sense, and ended it completely. However, we had just signed a lease on a one bedroom apartment a few months prior and neither of us could afford to break the contract and she couldn't afford a place on her own. And to be honest, I could barely afford the place by myself. After a while we got a separate bed so one of us slept in the living room and the other in the bedroom. 

While this was going on I had been talking to L and I had found out what really happened regarding our breakup and what happened after. Regarding the breakup, she told me that she was a very late bloomer when it came to sexuality and since I was a very, very early bloomer, she felt very uncomfortable with my advances but still loved me so she never said anything about it to me. And she didn't think that the long distance would work, which is fair. As for what happened after, her cousin was working at Disney at the time and got free tickets for them to go, so she was going to go with her two brothers and mother, but since her mother couldn't go, she invited a friend who had never been to Disney. Everything about sharing a hotel room or bed was untrue and nothing happened between them. As for her, she lost a lot of so called friends because of my Facebook post and the rumor mill at her school spread horrible stories about her so much so that she became an outcast and only the worst types of guys would be interested in dating her. She ended up dating a guy for 8 years, who became extremely abusive both physically and mentally and left her feeling worthless until she finally broke up with him after many conversations with her family. I still never got the full story from her, but the little I did get, enraged me and also absolutely destroyed me because I knew I was to blame. 

After some time, I made plans to go on vacation to Florida to get away from the mess I created, and also so I could see L again. Once we were together again, I fell head over heels for her again. Everything we did and talked about just made me love her more and more and we ended up having an amazing time together. I immediately felt like this was meant to be and I could see a future with this woman that I couldn't see with K before. Everything just seemed to fall in place and I felt like we fit together perfectly. After that week I had to return home to the mess I made, but I continued to talk to L every day and even had hours long phone calls with her every single day. It was difficult being apart again, and she was very concerned about me still living with my ex but she also understood that there wasn't anything I could do about it at the time. I then went to visit her again over a long weekend two months later, and it was explosive. Every feeling of love and joy just felt like it was bursting out of me. At the end of the year, my ex moved out, but we had made peace and were friends, the only one I had to be honest. L was not happy about me spending time with K, even though we were just friends, but instead of me acknowledging her concerns and making adjustments as I was too concerned about losing a friend, I just kept arguing about it and shrugging L off, thinking that she was overreacting and I wasn't doing anything wrong like cheating on her or anything. Regardless of me being an annoying asshat to her, she visited me for Valentine's Day, and again since we were together, nothing else mattered and we had a wonderful time. After she went went back home, work started to get busier for me so I couldn't talk as much as before and when I get stressed I tend to get quiet and not talk much. L thought that I was mad at her or upset about something because up until that point we were both very talkative. There were a few minor arguments about it, and the stress of work just broke me down more and more. Since K was my only friend at the time, I would talk to her about my problems and she kept saying that she didn't think that L was being fair and that we should probably end things. My mom was also concerned about our relationship, but more because my mom was convinced that L's mom might be against our relationship, which I don't believe was ever the case. L and I made plans to go to Orlando for a few days, and that we should have a serious talk while there. I felt that she was starting to feel uncomfortable again, so I had decided that I would not initiate sex with her, unless she gave me a very clear signal first. We went to Universal Studios and had fun the first two days, but on the third day she was very distant and would barely talk to me and every time I would hold her or kiss her, she would then take a step away from me. And on the fourth day, while sitting in a packed restaurant, she sent me a text asking if we were over. And to this day, I feel like I made the biggest mistake of my entire life, because after talking back and forth about it I ended our relationship. I was frustrated by the long distance and work getting in the way and I felt like she deserved better. After returning home, I was ok for about two months, then everything hit me at once and I cried so hard that I gave myself a migraine the next day. I've apologized multiple times, written her a letter, and tried to show her that I still care, but it's over. Now, everyday that goes by she is constantly on my mind, everything reminds me of her or of how much of an idiot I am for breaking up with her. It's been almost a year and still I can't let her go. I know that I will always love her and that my love for her won't fade, and at this point I can't love anyone else. My heart fell too deep for her and even if I wanted to, I couldn't take it back.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rxihdo/cant_move_on_dont_really_want_to/

My partner very much likes to live in the moment. He loves planning for things we'll do together in the next month or next few months, but I feel like we never discuss any longer term plans for our future unless I am the one to raise it, and I feel like when I do he becomes very anxious, stressed and I feel like I am putting pressure on him somehow. 

At the start I dismissed this as feeling that it was fine and I was young so the future didn't matter to me as much so I could look past it, but the longer we're together the more anxious it makes me and the more I want to feel able to talk about these things and not feel like I am creating tension. 

Firstly, is it normal that one partner is very in the moment and the other is the only one to think long term? 

Secondly, any advise for how I can navigate these long term discussions without feeling that I am creating tension?

89,rxjqgh,1641489604,"This is weird, right?","For the last 3 months, I've been dating this great guy my age and we've been hitting it off. I enjoy his company. He's kind, sweet, and very similar to how I am in the sense that he does his best to ensure the comfort and happiness of others, something I really admire.  


On New Years, he told me he loved me while we were having a get together with friends. I responded awkwardly at the time, but it was a sweet sentiment. I did mention it seemed early, but I'm not about telling other people what to feel and he assured me it was fine if I didn't say it back.  
But in the short time I've known him, this kind of raised a red flag with me.  


I really do like this guy. I'm just unsure of how to proceed and I know it will involve a very honest conversation. It just feels like he's trying to speed up intimacy/the relationship and as someone who is Ace/ADHD and who generally likes their own company, this is becoming a lot of pressure.  


\- Not long after telling me ""I love you"", we had a conversation about his tendency to not believe me when I say things are okay/fine. I know some people out there have strong feelings about women who say that, but I'm generally an honest person and I try to be vocal when things are not okay/fine. We talked about it and he told me that he doesn't trust anyone. This apparently includes me (When I say he doesn't trust anyone, its not that he expects me to go off and cheat. He just seems to believe that people aren't telling him the truth when they talk.)  


\- As I mentioned, he is someone who tries to ensure the comfort and happiness of others, which is something that I absolutely cherish. But he doesn't seem to know how to turn this off. He insisted that he can stock things at his place for me when I come over, or he brings food to my place even when I make it clear I've got things covered (He brought a whole pizza/croissants/etc to my house when I made him dinner). I know this stems from wanting to be a providor, but I've been living on my own for nearly 6 years and I've always been very independant. He doesn't seem to hear me when I tell him I'm fine with what I have.

\- As mentioned, I'm asexual. I'm no sex-averse, but I'm not very into it. He's fine with this and we've been doing great with just touching/cuddles. But he likes to kiss me (which I'm fine with) and yet laments that I don't have a 'reaction' (I lean into it, but wtf else am I supposed to do?)  
He also mentioned that intimacy is important, which I agree with completely. But when I asked him to bring it up if he would like me to touch him, he seemed to be very put off by the idea.  
 I want to stress that I'm not a cold piece of stone. I like to cuddle. I usually give small touches when he's around. I'm just, in general, not a very touchy-feely person and it's not always at the forefront of my mind (Nothing is at the forefront of my mind except a tuba band, a list of chores, and old cat videos, hello ADHD). I try to make sure I show affection in the ways I know how.  


In general, I'm getting the feeling like he wants more than I can provide at this point in time, and that it's also just...too soon. And I'm not sure how to best bring it up. We are both in our 30's so I know he's interested in investing his time into someone he can marry, which I'm fine with, but it feels like he is more focused on the 'rush' as opposed to the relationship.  


Anyways, advice would be great. I know I'm not the best communicator, and I'm not sure how to best broach this.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rxjqgh/this_is_weird_right/

With all that said, let me get to the point, so I am learning in a language class now and studying something called sycometry (to prepare for the exam that by its rate I can study what I want in college) by myself at home so the only time I am around people is in class, and there's that girl that I kind of like, but as I mentioned I am not the talky type and she and every other girl in my class just never interact with guys unless the guy is the one who starts it off.

Now my friend (who's also in the same class as me) unlike me is someone who is very social and he jokes around a lot with the group of this girl and I see that she likes him but he doesnt, he just jokes around so now I know i dont have any chance with her. 

The thing is this situation happened to me twice now and even though I dont really care and forget about it after awhile I am here to know how can I get in a relationship when I am quiet, like I can say I am an interesting guy, I take care of my body by running every other day and I go to the gym, I read books, and I choose my words precisly,  and all, but the only aspect any girl notices about me is quiet.
