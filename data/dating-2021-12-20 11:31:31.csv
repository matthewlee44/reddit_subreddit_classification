0,rksiwm,1640021538,Faked Cancer to Build Connection,"Coworkers boyfriend of 2 months faked cancer to build a connection with her. 

Still in disbelief of this one. My coworker is herself a cancer survivor. As you can imagine the entire experience was a life defining event for her. This individual fabricated a story of his own battle with the  disease to draw her in. 

There were some red flags. He just seemed to come on a little too quick ""love bombing"". It bothered me some, but they had really connected over their shared trial with cancer. 

Ultimately she dumped him because he was too needy. Maybe something just didn't quite feel right. There was some guilt, after all he was going through ""chemo"". 

She finds out a week after he lied about the whole thing. This after her sharing those imamate, near death, vulnerable details. What a betrayal. 

This guy was a well kept high school teacher. No glaring red flags. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Is there a lesson here?* 

On one hand we have to subject ourselves to vulnerability. Without it, how can we ever build a connection? On the other hand, we have to vet our dates. We must be guarded until we have some estimate of their character. 

*This gets to the root of the problem of modern dating.* 

When we meet online, or in the big city we have no background on these people. We have only to rely on what they say, and our intuition. 

*Lets be real, your intuition is probably no better than my coworkers.* 

Vet your dates in the ways that you can. If there is a red flag investigate it.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rksiwm/faked_cancer_to_build_connection/
1,rksnfr,1640021873,Normal or not- dating many people but for only a short time?,"Do you consider people who have had many short relationships to be a red flag?

In my case I’ve dated 13 people but most relationships ending after about a month. They most all ended due to lack of interest in the other person or they had to move. 

While *I* don’t consider myself to be a raging red flag, especially with how the relationships ended/went, my friend thought otherwise and said it was basically a spotlight on poor character (which makes it ironic that she’s my friend by her logic, then?). I even looked it up and google said the “average” was like 1.5-2 years per HS-aged relationship (I’m 21), which totally shocked me.

After I left Thursday morning the texts got more and more short and less invitational. She had me completely hooked though and appeared like she felt the same way. I had no indication I said or did something off putting. I’m not blowing her phone up, the last thing I said was this morning asking if I can drop her sweatshirt off and pick up the dishes I left at her place from cooking dinner. No response and we both leave for vacation tomorrow. 

I feel like I get way more down in the dumps than other guys when a girl is no longer interested. Especially when nothing is official. I’ve just been going to the gym twice a day but as soon as I’m by myself in my apartment it’s all I can think about. 

My best guesses are she’s stressed about her big vacation and is truly just busy with other friends, met another guy, or lost attraction (she is in better shape than me). 

Have you been in a situation like this? Is it worth inquiring about what went wrong at some point? How do you stop thinking about someone you really like?

9,rkt22k,1640023003,Matched with someone on Bumble. Idea of dating is terrifying.,"I’m 24F and I’ve never dated. I’ve never been sexual with anyone, gone on a date or barely had more than 3 days worth of sporadic conversation with anyone online. 

Here’s the sitch: 
I matched on Bumble with a guy from high school. We didn’t talk then, basically just aware of each other’s existence. 

The main reason I might really like him is I think we would genuinely get on well. He’s intelligent, goofy, actually not aloof or non-emotional, actually adventurous (like travel the world and go to places like the Jordan adventurous, not spontaneously go to the beach adventurous like people who put “like adventure” on their profile)  like, a generally great and impressive person. He also has a philosophy joke in his bio and I’m a massive philosophy nerd. 

But I’m ridiculously anxious about a few things and I don’t want to make decisions that I don’t actually want to choose just because I’m anxious about a lot of things including: 

1. He’s gotten really attractive since high school. Like, he’s hot in a way that’s most women would agree. Not just me. 

And I have probably gone in the opposite direction. Gained weight, lots of scars on my skin. 

This is probably the number one biggest thing. Because we knew each other in high school, it’s basically impossible not to compare or even worse, have a certain expectation only to find out I’m below that.

Not that I don’t have photos that look like me but one photo can look slightly different to different people, especially depending on whether they have or haven’t met you before and especially if all the photos are a moment. Not like, a straight on that also kind of shows my body. 

This is important in the context of the next thing which is. 

2. I’ve never had sex, or dated, or anything. This is particularly difficult because he’s in a non-monogamous relationship and his profile says looking for something casual which is pretty vague. 

But somehow it’s more terrifying telling someone who I knew in high school in a virgin. Also like, cause he’s just wanting something casual, I’m not worth the effort of teaching, or nerves, or bad sex. 

That’s not to say I’m nota sexual person. I totally am. I’ve just had a life where until recently, I had a lot of other priorities. 

————— 

I know these are things that are a normal part of dating. But they’re pretty intense and have been at least s small contributor to why I haven’t dated before. 

And also yes, I’m in therapy and have been for a while. But I just need some real peoples perspectives and support.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rkt22k/matched_with_someone_on_bumble_idea_of_dating_is/

You know when somebody just smells good? Like they just took a shower? Ya. He’s never smelled like that. He either stinks like musty B.O or smells slightly of a moldy attic. I tried breaking things off with him, but he insisted we stayed friends. But he really likes me. I can tell. He puts in way more effort to text me, than I do for him. He’s the one that initiates the plans. and when we do link, he tries to kiss me and get close to me— even though he stinks.  I always make sure to take a shower and smell amazing, before I leave the house. So it irritates me that he doesn’t even bother to shower or brush his teeth before we hang out. Especially if you’re going to try and make a move. It’s just disgusting.  He’s never dressed up either. He’s always in sweats and a tank top and busted a** shoes. He never takes his durag off because he doesn’t get his hair cut. And it not like he doesn’t have money! This is by choice. I told my friend  and mom and they said I should tell him.. my thing is .. is he’s a grown man, 25.

I (Mid 30s) and she is 28. I have a career and stable life style, she is just starting after recently graduating. We meet over 8 years ago at a bar, hung out a few times and eventually hooked up and have had a on and off again somethingship (not sure what to call it) over all those years. We never really dated even though I wanted to (was told not looking for something serious as she just got out of a relationship) and we have gone 6-12 months without talking a few times and then reconnect and hang out like we never stopped hanging out and hook up again.

Sometimes I've had a GF and sometimes she's had a BF, so timing was off a few times and we hooked up in-between our single phases etc.

Fast Forward to Feb of this year, she stop making time for me and started to hang out with another guy. We didnt talk until Sept (when it was over) and now shes back and messaging me to hang out and get drinks or go to a lounge but never to go on like real dates like a nice restaurant, or a trip to lets say another state.

Since we started to hang out again, there hasn't been any sex or making out. But when she gets tipsy, she gets extremely flirty and suggestive sexually. When I try to initiate something when she isnt tipsy, im not declined outright but it just seems to not happen. We hang out and talk like crazy, 2-3 times a week sometimes and other times its once ever 2 weeks. She tells me she wants to go away or wants to go to a nice restaurant and seem genuinely interested but again it doesnt happen.

**UPDATE: Hung out with her again and she was extremely flirtatious, and sexually suggestive again. Convo was fun, fully of laughter and on sex most of the night, and she kept talking about her thong and showed me it a few times (we were in public but she was discreet).  Tried to hang out more/go to my place or hers and was told she has to get up early. Tried to go in for a kiss but she gave me a hug, told me I smell good and then had to pee so ran out of the car.** 

**ME:** I am not good with women and not good with understanding the games or logic and what my next step is. I feel like we would be a good couple but honestly I'm too attracted to her to not want something more (sex or relationship) so im always going to try.

27,rkuq2y,1640027615,I (21m) am a little confused on what to do with this woman (41f),"So I met this woman at a museum we volunteer at. We got on the subject of dancing, and she said she wanted to learn so I told her of the classes I take. We meet up at one of the dance socials and we danced for 4 hours. I taught her how to dance and we had a good time, talking and everything. We sat really close to eachother despite lots of room to space out. We took a walk outside and I started getting the idea she likes me. Granted, at this time I didn't know how old she was, I assumed late 20's.

We text often; she clearly likes talking to me as she will keep it going after it dies lol. She mentioned she wanted to practice dancing more than just the once a week class we have, and I told her about where we do advanced dance moves at a church on Sundays, her and I can just practice in the corner and she eagerly accepted. I joked about something and kinda offended her, so I told her we'll go to lunch afterwards and I'll buy.

While dancing, I kept making her laugh her ass off! We had a really good time. She told me her age and I was really surprised. We leave to go to lunch, and she had an umbrella as it was raining just a little. She insisted I walk under it with her and made me hold it. I just wrapped my hand around hers holding it and just walked to our cars.

At lunch, I told her it kinda sucks how most of the woman I dance with are all married and what not, and she told me ""I'm available, but I'm also twice your age so take that as you will"" to which I regrettably responded ""Old enough to be my mother..."" and she facepalmed, laughed, and said ""You just HAD to point that out!"" Clearly not something I should have said lol, it slipped. Once we parted, her hug was a lot less passionate, and more of a pat on the back. I feel like I probably either unintentionally turned her down, made her confused, or offended her.

My ex was in some university program and there was a big group of people that would hang out with each other. Some of these people were his (my exes) friends, some just acquaintances. After I broke up, It turned out that one guy from this group liked me, we coincidentally matched on tinder and went out. Then we got into passion mode and slept with each other (2nd date). He definitely didn’t plan it; it was even more of my initiative. (It wasn’t blunt but I kind of provoked him)

This past summer I went on vacation to PV and I met a wonderful man that we hit it off. The downfall we were doing long distance but I was able to see him a handful of times throughout the 6 months. He made me feel things my ex never did. He made me realize that I was accepting way less then what I deserve. Unfortunately, we had to call it quits because of the distance and we kinda just knew it wasn’t going to work anymore. A part of me was heartbroken but at the same time I’m okay. It’s such a weird feeling that maybe because I went through something so drastic with my ex fiancé that nothing can “break me”. It’s weird because I didn’t even cry yes I felt sad but I just learned that sometime people aren’t meant to stay in your life forever.

37,rkvjmg,1640029913,Mature rejection is pretty great honestly,"So idk just venting this out because there's a lot of feelings atm.

3 weeks ago i told a good friend how i feel about her and she told me she's had the same feelings, but we had to wait a couple weeks because of a singleness commitment she had.  
So saturday, i gave her this really personal nice gift, with a letter with all my feelings and that now that commitment is coming to an end i would really like to be in a relationship with her.

So i just had a phone call with her about everything, earlier today, and she basically laid down a couple things why she didnt think it was a good idea to get in a relationship, for her personally mostly but also some more complex things. I honestly kind of saw this coming for a couple of reasons, and though it was dissapointing, acknowledged it, and we just talked for a long while. Talked about the feelings for each other, talked about how we both struggled with being in love with each other at the wrong times, talked about life and relationships in general. 

There were a couple tears of dissapointment afterwards and i'd rather have seen it unfold in a different way, though i know thats the feelings in me speaking and rationally i agree with her reasoning. But honestly, i feel really good now. Its really exciting, and somewhat moving honestly, to be able to just be so transparent with each other, respect each others feelings, and just talk through it all without judgements or shame or damage to the friendship. Also, and this is probably a stupid ego thing, but its a good confidence booster to know that someone so inspiring and beautiful was or is truly in love with me. 

It probably should always be like this but that has not been my experience, but reflecting on my past experiences i kinda see it was always my own shame and insecurity standing in the way of it because i've rarely been treated poorly over things like this. Still, its nice to see that development in myself and be able to truly embrace and enjoy a situation like this even though there's feelings telling me otherwise. 

Typing this out, i realise a pretty funny insight that the insecurity of pursueing someone i'm in love with is far, FAR more painful then rejection.

40,rkvmyx,1640030164,Don't expect to get anything just for being nice.,"I recently replied in another thread and had a thought about guys in my friend circles and also guys on Reddit generally commenting about how girls hate nice guys or that nice guys finish last.

I feel this is a huge misconception and really misses what is actually happening behind the scenes of the ""niceness."" From my perspective as a woman in her late 20s who frequently gets approached and pursued by a wide variety of men running the gamut of guys younger than me to guys older than my father, there are ""nice guys"" and ""guys who are nice to flirt.""

The former are just polite, courteous people who are nice to everyone. The kind of people who go out of their way to hold the door for a homeless person as well as the pretty blonde. 

The latter use - and almost exclusively use - niceness as their primary means of attracting the opposite sex.  

There are so many issues with using niceness as your dating playbook.  The biggest issue is that when you are nice to a person, woman or man, that person tends to reciprocate because most people aren't garbage human beings.  But because you internalize your niceness as a romantic advance, when she reciprocates and is nice back to you, you create a self-delusion that this person can only be doing this because they are reciprocating your advances, not your kindness.  This is very much similar to men who think that waitresses are flirting with them.

When these kind of men fail, and often, later observe me or another woman with a guy who ""isn't as nice as they were,"" this gets internalized as: girls don't like nice guys, I need to act like a dick towards women, I need to ignore girls or play games, and so on.

Take my old college housemate, for example.  He helped me move furniture, cooked for me, helped me clean - all at his insistence, and not at my request.  I turned down all his overt advances because I was not attracted to him, but eventually I felt really guilty, and made him an appreciation dinner.  He took this to mean that I was responding to his ""flirting"" and immediately started touching me in a sexual manner afterwards.  When I explained I wasn't interested, he didn't take it well, and then he really flew off the handle when he heard me have a fight and subsequently have sex (thin walls) with my bf at the time.  This turned into a campaign of harassment, and unfortunately this guy ended up becoming one of those men who shun women movement guys.

It's really a shame that this is the case, but I'm finding that more and more men fall back on just being nice to women and hoping that this is enough to generate attraction when there is none.  Women are either going to find you attractive or not.  I've found guys who were nice to me attractive.  I also dated an abusive boyfriend who I was deeply in love with.  Being nice helps, but it can't be the only thing you have going for you.

And if you find yourself in a situation where you're pursuing a woman who doesn't seem interested in you by just being nice to her... You are setting yourself up for disappointment.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rkvmyx/dont_expect_to_get_anything_just_for_being_nice/

One night, he randomly texted me kinda late, ""tell me something about yourself."" He'd kinda talk in a way that seemed textbook flirty, but like he was holding back. We hung out a few times (first to study, then just to hang out and eat food together). He'd say I was funny, playfully push my arm or poke me, and say my nickname was cute. Towards the end, we were texting every day. At one point, he asked me some personal questions about my sex life (when I lost my virginity, and if I was the more dominant one in past relationships). I figured he liked me, was playing the field, maybe DTF, but wasn't sure about me.

He's going on vacation for like a whole ass month, said ""we'll hang out when I'm back ;)"" and then he kinda just stopped talking. He shared a meme on IG, that's it.

43,rkvx2b,1640030919,"Stopped talking to him because he's in a relationship, but can't stop thinking about him","I recently broke up with my boyfriend of almost 5 years about a month ago. It was a mutual breakup because we both felt like we needed to work on different things in life, and I felt like I had checked out of the relationship months ago. I felt kind of guilty moving on really fast, but there was a guy who had requested to add me on Facebook last year that I didn't accept to respect my relationship because I didn't know him. I ended up adding him because we had a friend in common, and started talking. We talked every day. He made it clear from the beginning he didn't want anything serious and I agreed. From his conversation it looked like he wanted someone to hook up with, and having just gotten out of a long-term relationship I was okay with no commitment. However, the more we talked the more we talked about more serious topics and got to know each other really well. I felt more comfortable and open than I did with my ex of over 4 years. We even met in person and talked for almost 5 hours. I thought everything was going well and he would say it made him happy to talk to me.

A couple days after meeting in person and talking, we decided to meet again and were making plans. We were still messaging each other every day. Then he lets me know he has a girlfriend of over 4 years. We had discussed our thoughts on cheating before and I made it very clear that I was against it (it's something I wouldn't want to go through, and I wouldn't want anyone to go through), and he had told me he had cheated in previous relationships. He told me because he knew how I felt he knew I probably wouldn't talk to him again, but that he respected me and really liked me so he knew he should tell me. I told him that yes, I wouldn't be speaking to him anymore, and he asked that I keep in contact with me because he really liked me. He also had said his girlfriend had had something with one of her coworkers and they had broken up for a bit, but then got back together. I ended up deleting him, but since then I've had a feeling I can't describe. I miss talking to him, and am even rethinking what I told him. I can't explain how I feel, and even though we only were in contact for a couple weeks I feel like I opened up to him more than I've had to anyone else and he made me feel really comfortable.

45,rkw71s,1640031680,Confused,"There is this guy I was talking too for about 2 months. A mutual friend had introduced us and we really clicked. He mentioned to her a couple of times that he was getting ready to ask me on a date but things kept getting in the way. One of those things being the fact that my mom has been in the hospital for the past month on a ventilator. This definitely put a bit of a damper on things just because there for awhile it was hard for me to think about anything other than this. Nonetheless, he seemed supportive of this. Fast forward a little, he starts acting funny. As in his responses become a bit delayed, isn’t as flirty, and still has not mentioned this date. So I straight up just ask him. I ask if he is still interested and I expressed that I didn’t want him to feel stuck in case he would feel like a dick for not being interested anymore while in this situation I am in with my mom. I gave him several opportunities to be straight up with me, expressed to him how exes in past had a hard time being upfront with me and that’s literally all I could ask for from someone. It was probably annoying yes but I couldn’t tell if it was my anxiety getting control of me or if there was something really wrong. Anyways, a video on TikTok popped up on my FYP of this girl. Who happened to be a friend of his. It was a risqué video and he put like shocked emojis. I kinda brushed it off but it did upset me so I checked her page frequently after this. Well one day, I checked and he made a comment that said something along the lines that he was simping for her. To be honest, this straight up pissed me off. I was at the hospital and was already emotional and this really struck a nerve. I impulsively sent him a message along the lines of that I wish he would’ve just told me he wasn’t interested and blocked him on every thing. About 2 days go by and I started feeling guilty. I was upset and that’s just that, but I do agree I did not act as I should’ve. So I sent a message explaining things a little. Just that I should’ve let him respond and shouldn’t have acted so impulsively. He didn’t reply so I sent a message a day later explaining that I didn’t want to try and rekindle things, I simply just wanted to be civil and maybe still be friends since he had been a good friend to me in all I’ve went through this past month. We just got along really well I thought. Well, he didn’t read either message. This was on messenger and I thought it might be going to message requests and he wasn’t seeing it but it was confirmed that wasn’t true when I tried adding him back on Snapchat and he ignored it. Basically, my point is…I know I shouldn’t have reacted like that and there’s no excuse but I thought he might understand my emotions have been more extreme. He won’t even read what I have to say and I just wanted to say I was sorry for reacting that way and I hoped we could be civil. I never imagined he would be the kinda guy to ignore me, as he mentioned he wasn’t that kinda of guy, and never completely wrote people off if things didn’t work out (this was in explanation to how he was still good friends with his ex wife). I’m just very confused and honestly very hurt that I lost a friend more than anything. It does suck because I think there was a lot of potential there, but like mentioned, I don’t want to rekindle things cause I don’t want to be a second, third, fourth, option. Opinions?

50,rkwu93,1640033465,How do I approach a girl at a regular coffee shop?,"24M

Some background, I ended a 2yr relationship a while back and that's the only relationship I've had. I have difficulty in approaching women, especially when they're with friends.

I'm very regular at this coffee shop and so is she. She's almost always with her friend(girl) and it's near to impossible to approach her. The times she's alone, the coffee shop is crowded. We've made eye contact once or twice. I'm a kind of nerd and don't have the confidence (lost it to premature baldness) or the experience. Like, even if I did, what would I say? I've tried the reinforced method to exchange smiles. But that didn't working. If anything, it's getting a bit creepy. Last time I asked out a girl, I had so much adrenaline rush and my pulserate was dam so high. I asked stupid things like, I like your GitHub repo(🤕) and nerdy stuff. Didn't go well. I had a panic attack!

I thought about approaching directly and speak out as is. But a lot of my friends told that will be creepy and never know how she'd react. Once I kinda followed her after exiting the coffee shop, but again was told it was wrong. At this point it's become very awkward for me and her. She's now trying to evade from me. I'm so confused. I've thought about dropping the idea entirely and forget her presence. But everytime she's there, I feel like I shouldn't quit without taking a shot.

I've got one shot at this, the next time she's there. Want to conclude on it. Good or bad. So, please drop in your suggestion. Much appreciated 😄",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rkwu93/how_do_i_approach_a_girl_at_a_regular_coffee_shop/

To be fair, I think I like him too - he seems like a nice and smart person, we share common interests and he isn’t the cutest, but I caught myself thinking ""huh, he looks cuter in person than his picture"". So I’m not exactly opposed to getting to know him better.
The thing is, for the last couple of days he’s been messaging me every day, twice or more times a day, so much so, that I don’t really have the space to show initiative without increasing the tempo of the relationship. And I would kind of prefer to, you know, take it slow, since I don’t really know the guy. Just maybe hang out a bit some time, talk, allow things to develop (or not) naturally.
The thing is, my judgement maaay be a bit clouded. I used to be very codependent and uncomfortable with people expressing their affection towards me (like I owed them some nice points or sth), and I used to be in a very unequal relationship.

57,rkxidv,1640035303,Rejection based on race,"So I recently found out that a friend of mine asked the guy I'm into ""how about OP?"" and he replied that he's only into women of his own race (i.e. not mine lol).

I totally get it that you're attracted to who you're attracted to. Obviously any rejection is horrible, but yeah I didn't know how this would feel...it kinda sucks because it's something I have no control over! I have friends that have had similar experiences but I didn't get it til now. It's a shame because we've got on well and he's a great guy.

I've been thinking, if I had other qualities he liked enough, then maybe he would see past race and like me for me, so maybe it really is just as simple as he doesn't see me like that in general and the race thing is just one part of the lack of attraction, or even a way to let me down gently, but definitely.

Anyone else had this experience? Shout out to you guys...

Also anyone got any stories of a change of heart, either in yourself or someone you're now with/know? I guess I'm still holding out hope!

Any general thoughts on this subject?

58,rkxiwy,1640035342,What are the odds?,"So I did some analysis of my dating numbers over the past years and this is what came out:

Amount of girls dated (1 or more dates): 33
Timeframe: 3 years

Number of times a girl was interested in me: 8
Number of times I was interested in a girl: 1 (and by this I mean felt a genuine spark, physically attractive, and a great personality)

Multiply the two: (8/33)*(1/33)=8/1089, say roughly 1/100 of feeling chemistry with each other

So that means about 100 dates to find a relationship on average, meaning twice the amount of time I spent dating already, so 2*3=6 moee years.

If you're only interested in casual sex, that's fine, *when you're honest about it*. Why not just say upfront that a serious relationship is not something you want? Why flat out lie to someone who you know wants something serious, and deliberately make them think you want something more? Then leave them deeply hurt and angry?

Wouldn't it be more beneficial to just find someone who wants the same things you do? Then at least things would be built on honesty and nobody would get hurt.

66,rkybpx,1640037581,"If you Netflix Party togther, are you just friends?","I (19F) have been talking to a guy (21M) from one of my lectures for a bit. For context, I'm still not familiar with hook-up culture and dating culture in uni.

We met in class. At the beggining of the semester, I would catch him glancing at me (he usually sits near my row) but we never spoke. Eventually, one day he complimented me on my notes and my outfits. By mid-October we had still never had a full-on conversation or exchanged contacts. Mid-November, I bump into him at the library he compliments my hair, we study and exchange contact info. He texts the following weekend asking if i was down to hang out. I told him I had something to work on at the lib but would be free later. He met up with me infront of the lib (which is one block away from my apartment). He says, *""where should we go? you said you live on xx Street, yeah?""*. And honestly, that kind of took me aback. I was expecting us to hang out at a cafe or something. I immediately told him i wasn't comfortable with us going home. He seemed fine with it. We decided to go on a walk and get dessert insead. He insisted on paying the bill but I told him *""we should split if its a first date""*. He said he would pay *""next time""*. The rest of the night went great. He was flirty but not in an uncomfortable way. His behavior was very kind and gentleman-y. He walked me home and simply hugged me goodbye. He said he was down to *""do this again some time""*.

Honestly, after that hang out/date i wasn't sure what to do. The fact that he mentioned going to my house when we barely knew each other had kind of rubbed me the wrong way. But I also found him cute and really appreciated how we had bonded over stuff in common. We didn't really exchange much after that first meeting (to be fair, it was exactly during midterm season). Thanksgiving, he replies to my stories and flirts a little through text. He mentions that we should meet up once he came back from home.

The first week of december, I decided to text him and ask him to go watch a movie i've been dying to watch (highly recommend Titane, it was amazing). He answered immediately with *""definetely""*. Mind you, I hadn't even told him what the movie was or what it was about. We met up to watch the movie and it was really fun. We had late night dinner (lebanese food) which he payed for. At the end of the night, he walked me home and again only hugged me goodbye. (his hugs are very flirty tho, his arms kind of linger on my back type of flirty).

A week after the movie, we agreed to watch Peaky Blinders together (we're both really big fans of Peaky Blinders and decided we should watch a couple of seasons to prepare for season 6 coming out in feb 2022!!!). We watched a couple of episodes individually and just texted each other to talk about our thoughts. One weekend, I asked if he wanted to join me at the library. After hours of work, we lost motivation and he offered to *""watch peaky blinders at your place""*. I didn't know what to expect and didn't want anything to go too fast. He came over and watched the episode with me. We were in my room and (to my surprise) nothing happened. Just occasional flirty arm touching here and there, intense eye contact and that was it. On his way out, he said *""I'll see you on monday for the final, lets watch the next episodes on netflix party over the break""*, hugged me twice on his way to the door and kissed me on the cheek. I was flattered.

Monday rolls around, and we had agreeded to meet up to enter the exam room together. We ended up being in different waiting lines and didn't talk. He just came by my desk to say *""hey! don't stress, just breathe""*. Very nice of him, I thought. One hour into the exam, I see him walk out past me. After I finished my exam, I got out and texted him. Asked how his exam went because i was surprised to see him leave so fast. His answers seemed a little dry but said the exam went great. I offered if he wanted to meet up because he was leaving the next day to go see his family for christmas. He left me on read. I went out grocery shopping (the super market is not too far from his place) so i casually said I was around and could just stop by to say bye. He answered hours later saying *""sorry im in bed already""* and that he was bummed out that he *""couldn't say bye to a bunch of ppl""*. I left him on read because I wasn't sure what to answer. He followed an hour later with *""sleep well! It was really nice meeting you this semester, hope to keep in touch over the winter break""*. Again I wasn't too sure how to interpret his text. I replied with *""of course, was nice meeting you too!""*.

I texted him the next day. Very casual conversation. Then, I decided to wait a couple of days to see if he would text me. He didn't. I figured he was enjoying time with his family and focused on my last finals.

Yesterday, I couldn't resist the urge to watch the next peaky blinders episode and asked him if he was down to the watch where we'd last left off. 10 mins later he anserwed *""im in a meeting rn but yes""*. It was my first time netflix party-ing with anyone. The episode was amazing. Once it finished he texted *""great episode. i need to get food. i'm starving""* then left the chat. I texted him *""it was rlly fun watching it wit u, enjoy your dinner:)""*. He never replied. We won't be seeing each other on campus until January.

I guess my question is, am i in the friendzone? what sould i do? part of me wants to belive he is wholesome and actually likes me, the other part can't help but feel like he's either putting me in the friendzone or playing with me.

I’ve dated casually for the last year and a half, with my last serious relationship ending about two years ago, but no real luck since. It usually doesn’t bother me that much since I love spending time alone. 

Recently though, I can feel myself getting bitter that all my friends are dating someone and while I’m really happy for them, I’m also secretly really jealous. The last few dates I’ve been on have been really bad and left a bad taste in my mouth, coupled with some sexual trauma that I feel makes it hard for me to open up to new people often. I feel like my bad experiences have been adding to the bitterness and I don’t like being this way but I’m not sure how to turn this around.

And we wonder why relationships and society norms about gender are so off lol this has got to be a correlation. Also, with how privileged men are don't women realize being sexual w men just contributes to them being spoiled and entitled??and perpetuates weird sex obsessed views? Men think about sex with every woman, and it's bc so many women give bjs like nothing. It's kind of sad actually, like such an empty life to just mainly only ever think about sex. Like yes it's nice, but really the amount men want it and to feel important/special through it is so odd to me and seems so selfish.

I have been texting with a guy for two months now, and the communication has been great. We found each other through reddit and because of that we're in long distance commication.

We have been very open with each other and transperant about what we're looking for. We both like each other, but we want to take it slow and get to know each other first.

We aren't dating, but I think it is healthy stating what your boundries are while pursuing a romantic relationship. I am okay with him having female friends, communicating and seeing them, but I am not okay for him spending the night at their place, just the two of them.

We hit things off immediately and both acknowledged we wanted to pursue a relationship within a few days. We started going on dates, staying up all night together, talking and texting constantly, you know... the normal stuff. Things were going great until I had to go out of town for a week due to work. Around the end of the week she let me know that she thought she wasn't ready for a relationship and that we should be friends. This was fine with me, we hadn't gone past kissing and being her friend was my priority. 

After a couple long nights and talks with people I care about I decided to move on. Once I got back we had a talk and she told me that she truly wanted to be friends and that she was serious when she said she wasn't ready. Of course this made me more confused and I realized I still had feelings but I decided (with the help of my friends) that I shouldn't tell her and instead just be her friend since thats what she wants.

Well we have been great friends since then, every weekend we spend most of it together and anytime we are free during the week we hang out/cook dinner for each other. I was getting close to finally getting over things again until this last weekend. I drove her and a few of her friends to a party at one of my friends houses and things got slightly out of control. We were playing drinking games and as drinking games go there are a bunch of personal questions. She was drunk, very drunk which I understand however; she kept saying things like, ""The only one I would kiss here is you."" and she kept putting her arm around me, touching me, and taking pictures. She even sent a picture of me to one of her friends and they said, ""he looks like he is in love with you"" to which she responded, ""we shall see."" Now I fully understand what you say while drunk isn't what you mean which is why I didn't partake in any of the games after the first few incidents and why I decided to talk to her about things the next day.

The next day I picked her up from the house (she didn't want me to take her home that night, and instead text me the next morning for a ride) and took her home. I told her there was some stuff I wanted to mention and make sure she was aware of. We talked about the party and she apologized for ""leading me on"" and whatnot, assuring me that she didn't really mean what she was saying or doing. Then the kicker happened. I decided to ask her if she still had feelings for me because I was hoping for a no so that I could move on fully. She said, ""yes, I can't just get over feelings like that. You know I can't do a relationship right now.""

Now this made me more confused which I told her and she said she didn't mean to do that. I need some help, based on all this do you think she is genuine when she says she can't do a relationship right now and wants me to wait until she is ready, or do you think she is saying she wants to get over her feelings because she doesn't want a relationship. I guess this is something I should ask her but I figured I'd get another opinion before I bother her with this sort of question. If she truly wants nothing to do with dating me then she probably doesn't want feeling questions from me.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; Girl says she still has feelings but doesn't want a relationship right now. I don't know if that means wait or if that means move on. I need advice on what to do next, either ask more for more details or just be a friend.

Also worth mentioning I am not ofcourse holding it against her or shame or in any way have my actions reflect on that. 

When we talk abot the past, some of the talking points is nothing out of ordinary, perhaps some are, for example we have argued over she wants to know my ""body count"". I dont really mind that she knows mine, but that could possibly mean I should know hers too. So I told her I'm not telling her and dont want to know hers either (she has respected and hasnt told me). After our little fight, she apologized and said I was in my right and that she was crossing my boundaries. I dont know if im in the right or wrong, but I have ""learned"" other things which bothers me to a point, I get really restless and feel like sh*te. She isnt usually pushy, this was just a one time thing. She is very sweet and Im in love with her. 

The way I am coping with it right now, is that Im suppressing thoughts and feelings about every bothering thing she shared, doing things and thinking about other things. Its hard to maintain it, but thats how I get through it and done it for 5 months.

A little about me, I am an average looking male, I enjoy working out and maintaining meaningful hobbies and passions throughout medical school. Additionally, I came from a a prior career; so financially- I am not struggling too much. Furthermore, I have been told that I have a desirable personality and am humorous in appropriate situations. I am aware that I am no Henry Cavill, but I am genuinely confused. I am actually willing to ""go back to the drawing board"" and further ""self-improve"" if this is indicated.

It seems like ever since I moved for medical school, I have completely struck out in the romance department. Like entirely. We're talking 1 match a month on hinge, and 2 likes total on Bumble. Sure, I have significantly reduced my ""meeting people at coffee shops/bars"" ratio a significant amount, but still? I'm not even talking about sorting through people I have been on dates with... I mean I can't even get a date anymore lol.

Prior to medical school, I had found relative success with both in person and online dating. I was usually able to meet at least 2 new people a month to go on dates with.

Upon returning to my hometown for the holidays, I asked all of my male and female friends if they noticed any significant changes in personality, demeanor, or physical attractiveness; they said that they did not. Even some old flames said they would date me again if I was back in town.

**I guess my question is:** Is the culture of dating changed for medical students, or am I just striking out? How are you supposed to meet new people as a medical student? Is this change in dating related to the current pandemic, or is it just a me problem? Any other advice?

PS: I know there are tons of post on dating in medical school; but I was wondering if anyone has any input as the means of meeting new people has changed over the years.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rkzuho/datingor_lack_of_as_a_medical_student/

Anyone else noticed themselves having ridiculously higher standards than before using dating apps? I no longer find attractive the girls I used to find attractive, and I think it's because dating apps have given me the illusion that I can date girls out of my league.

I'm scoring dates with charming women on dating apps, probably because I put effort into the online game, but nothing has been consequential. The dating goes excellently, but 3-4 dates later, they find another guy and start ghosting.

How do I lower my standards? Is it possible?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rkzv02/dating_apps_ruining_my_standards/

Before asking any questions tho, i gotta make two thing clear.

1. I am a virgin

2. I am only interested in dating other virgins.

No, i won't change my mind on the ""only dating other virgins"" thing so if you wanna argue, just don't.

With that out of the way, i wanna know:

1. Where do i meet girls?

2. What is the best method of approaching?

3. Should i become friends with her first?

4. Should i focus on a few girls or shoot shots everywhere?

5.How can i go about asking/discovering about the sexual experience stuff?

Any advice is appreciated.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rkzvbn/need_advice_on_meeting_girls/
84,rkzvkz,1640041981,"Great first dates that lead to ""Sorry didnt feel a connection"" texts (28m)","I've been a at least a dozen first dates and a few 2nd dates this year. All the 2nd half of the year.   


Thursday I had a date that felt good. I am just slightly socially awkward at first when meeting people, but once I warm up I do fine. Date went 2 hours she left, gave me a hug and said talk later. Well next morning I sent a text saying I had a good time. It took her 48 hours to respond and said she didnt feel a connection.  I gathered after the first 24hrs that was the case, but its still confused me.   


But I had a date Sunday. A lunch date. It went for 3 hours. I didnt even know we had talked that long. We hugged and I slipped out asking if she wanted to meet again. I really didnt mean to, I usually would ask next day and ask when can I see you again or something. She wasnt caught off guard at all and gave me details on availability after christmas week. So I for sure was thinking that a 2nd date was happening. Well 24 hrs later and I havent heard back.   


I know her schedule is a bit crazy so I may hear from her still, but cant help but start to get nervous.   


Seriously two of the best dates I had this year are turning out to be the most confusing dates and its seriously confusing me.   


Im not mad at all of course. Glad to have meet some really nice women, but when you see certain signs of interest I cant help but get a bit excited and think things are going well. Then to find out they didnt feel a connection and im back at ground zero so confused.   


I dont like every women I go on a date with, these instances where different. Maybe 25% of the dates I go on I feel enough of a connection to go on a 2nd date.  


Just confused. Im ending this year not feeling super great about my dating attempt and like to think I've learned things, but have I? i dont know.

87,rl01tc,1640042462,Was it a one night stand?,"I’m a very sex positive person and generally separate sex from romantic feelings.

Here’s the story:
I was at a birthday party of a friend right after exam period. I joined after going to a concert. When I arrive I see two girls that interest me at the party.
At first I felt her being kinda indifferent so I thought ok we can talk but nothings going to come from this. As the night progresses we talk more and more and start vibing quite a bit.
Anyways my goal definitely wasn’t to get laid when I started talking to her.
Now I start closing the gap a bit and she doesn’t mind. I thought hey I might grab her Instagram later and maybe I’ll arrange a date.
As time progresses she becomes more and more physical and compliments my hair. Culminating in her giving me hickeys and french kissing me while we’re there.
Honestly I was surprised but I reciprocated pretty much everything until then and I thought about getting frisky too.
I suggested going home to my place to which she asked if it was far. When I said I’m taking an Uber she agreed. We kept going for a bit then called the Uber.
When we got to my place she had just one thing on her mind. 😏
She stayed the night over and after cuddling for about 1~1.5hours she left citing a project she was way behind that she needed to finish. Before that we talked about various things including that she usually only goes out after exams and about her busy schedule. Funnily she commented about my gigantic tv multiple times ( I thought it was a passing comment since she was supposedly in a hurry )
Before leaving she emphasised that she originally planned on sleeping at her friends place while also talking about how there would have been nowhere to sleep there anyway, which wasn’t quite true since there were two couches but whatever 🤷‍♂️

Now I asked her friend what kind of girl she is and she says she told her a month prior that she wasn’t looking for anything serious. 
Now I am confused 🤔 
Added confusion factor :
When I kissed her the next morning she reciprocated with a french kiss but didn’t seem to want anything else.

PS: she started quickly exploring my apartment right before she left and complimented a painting I had.

Most of my One Night Stands were way faster to leave and outside of sex I didn’t really talk much with them so I’m kinda confused

M22 F19 she is in her first med year
PS PS: 
I have a pretty neat apartment because I have rich parents and the tv is my dads old tv 😅

PS PS PS:
Normally I’d just suggest going out for a drink again as a follow up to find out but she got her period in the morning after so I’m unclear on how to proceed..",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rl01tc/was_it_a_one_night_stand/
88,rl06zf,1640042875,“Just Haven’t met the right guy yet”,"30F and perpetually single.  I feel have always had a strong understanding of what I need in a relationship.  What I need for compatibility.  And that includes someone who is kind, self-aware, and wants to make me happy…. Someone who I can banter with and share a world view, a true partner.  

I honestly… have never met someone who could fill those shoes or were sincere enough about me to make me a priority. And I was okay with waiting for the right guy but now I am 30 and it has gotten real awkward.  I look at other girls who met their person, and sure most of my friends boyfriends dont meet my standards for me or in my opinion, for them.  But then I look at Zendaya and Tom Holland and they are so sweet and he is such a nice person.  And she found him at 23, so lucky…

I started dating a guy recently with hope that he would be a person who could make me happy but he wasn’t able to contribute to the relationship emotionally, physically, or spiritually.  He was a flop. And I cant just accept that for my life.

89,rl0771,1640042894,is there something wrong with me? i feel like ill never find a bf,"hi! im sorry if this is gonna be all over the place but heres a little background: im a 22 year old female who has 0 experience with guys. im not religious or anything but for some reason, getting physical with a guy (like kissing, etc) is a very big deal to me. i don’t know why but i just wanna do that stuff with someone i really trust and that i know he truly cares about me. 

i had my first kiss freshman year of college (lol) and basically it went bad because the guy just wanted to hookup. im already super reserved around guys but i think that incident made me put my walls up even more because i don’t wanna go through that hurt again. i haven’t done anything with a guy since but the older ive gotten the more i think there’s something wrong with me. i wish i wasn’t so reserved with guys but it’s really just the way i am. i don’t think ill ever find a guy who will be patient enough for me to get comfortable. i think im just scared of getting close to guys because i don’t wanna get hurt. im someone who loves deeply and i just know a breakup would completely ruin me. 

i understand and well aware that a lot of not being able to find a bf is my fault. im always too shy to start the conversation or anything like that. im honestly trying to get better at it but at this point i don’t even have anyone interested in me. im also not a fan of dating apps and hope to meet someone organically like through mutual friends.

I've been with my boyfriend for 6 months and we're pretty close. We are together twice every week and we talk on the phone pretty much all day every other day. (Atleast 3 phone calls of an hour or more.) He really feels like a best friend to me along with so much more and he's expressed the same feelings toward me. Since pretty much the beginning he's told me that he ""really likes"" me and I feel that way about him too. Basically I don't question my feelings for him at all or the fact that he has genuine feelings for me.

A couple of times in the beginning of our relationship he's kind of caught himself about to say ""I love you"" to me and I usually brushed it off. Because I know that in the infatuation phase it can be really easy to do that. For awhile he didn't do it anymore but today we were talking on my lunch break like we do pretty much everyday and he caught himself almost saying it again. And I'm wondering what the reason could be for him to just not say it?

Maybe I should add that before I have expressed to him that I've had commitment issues in the past. He's the first person I've dated past like the two month mark and definitely the first person I would consider a ""real relationship"" with. So it crossed my mind that he could be worried about me getting freaked out by it but I'm not sure because I've expressed to him a lot that I'm happy with how we're going and I'm extremely comfortable being serious with him.
