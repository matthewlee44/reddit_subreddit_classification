She messages 3 of the 4 but says she messaged them all. I asked her 6 times if she messaged Zach (the dude I knew she didn't message, whom she never slept with but has hung out with (she was on her period so no sex, although she would've.

I was down bad, we were on a car ride and it's obvious how distraught I was and she eventually started breaking down full on sobbing because she knows she fucked up and doesn't know why she did it. She regrets it so much and I still care for her. She wishes she never did it, etc.

My answer to that, what do you expect when the dating game directly pressuring men sacrificing their self esteem and emotions to ask out a girl

I know a lot of women who can't accept rejection, who make threats and stuff like this.

But guess what women don't need to ask out men, most women don't approach. Vast majority of men

He was the new assistant manager at my store and from the moment i saw him he caught my attention even tho he was not ‚Äúmy type‚Äù i developed a huge crush on him over time but I never acted on my feelings because I knew he had a gf at the time and they were pretty serious.
Fast forward we worked together for about 8 months and we saw each other almost everyday, we would often close the store together, listen to music, talk about deep stuff, joke, laugh, even tickle each other etc....I considered him ‚Äúa friend‚Äù at that point until one day I found out all the guys from work were hanging out after work and inviting other women from other locations to hang out with them after work. I felt humiliated because they never once invited me over or included me to hang out with them. I felt betrayed and my attitude towards them specially him changed. 
During that month I had personal problems and I was an emotional rollercoaster (my dad had died, my ex had reconnected with me and ghosted me after we had sex, I was broke etc) so I left my job and didn‚Äôt even put my 2 weeks. I just never came back...
Fast forward in 2017 this guy added me on fb because we had mutual friends from work and I accepted him, the only reason he added me was because he was single, 
He started messaging me constantly and ‚Äútrying to talk‚Äù but I pretty much blew him off. So he deleted me one day, which I didn‚Äôt care tbh. At this point I didn‚Äôt consider him a friend anymore. Just someone I used to work with.... 

After a month he got a new gf. They broke like after 6 months and he sent me another request and I added him again. He got back together with her and deleted me again. Fast forward 3 years later and they broke up for good and tada he sent me friend request again. What is this guys deal? Should I just block him at this point?

My best male friend who I trusted so well and believe in,that people who doesn‚Äôt even know us so well do refer to us as brothers cause we look alike though,and always hang around together.
But he really stabbed me on my chest!.. That the girl am dating after graduating and also hope to marry her,happens to know him long time that I noticed that the first day I introduced her to him before She told me. But I felt like it doesn‚Äôt matter because we are now talking about marriage and besides my friend has a girl friend too. 
So I try keeping everything real with him not knowing that his heart seems not to be pure with me. So I dated this girl for six months without knowing the color of her pant. All she keeps saying is that I should put a ring on her finger first,though we kiss,romance etc.. but always deny me sex. It do pain me at times but still stay calm because I believe I have a future with her. But not being aware that my best friend is playing my role and always also advise me to emphasize patient till we get marry then I can enjoy the whole thing. But with time things keep getting more suspicious cause I keep thinking about that everyday and now decided to keep an eye on her and reports starting coming that they mostly see my fianc√©e and my best friend together mostly on same particular hour every time. 
So to cut the story short is that I finally caught both together red handed in my friends room when I just went to pair him a visit. And up till now I still don‚Äôt believe what I saw because I have given her my all to the extent that I typically talk to girls since she came into my life.

I personally have never been in a long term relationship on the other hand, he had been with his ex for 10 years. He said that after they'd broke up he had took 2 years to learn more about himself and cope with everything since they had two kids together. 

While on the app we discussed many things which were mutual in terms of hobbies, books, intentions etc. (I haven't had the slightest connection since or prior to.) Furthermore, we exchanged numbers and began talking on the phone and texting. He was very consistent and seemed extremely mature and overall intelligent.

We set up what seemed to be a secure foundation where we were able to be completely open, honest, transparent and understanding. Three days in, he had mentioned he wanted to see me although he had his kids. Initially, we planned to go out on a date two days afterwards however, the more we connected over the phone I too wanted to meet him IRL. 

Now, at first I was hesitant because I know how I can be and I wanted to be straightforward as possible. I told him that I am very affectionate and when attracted to someone I can become highly sexual. I told him I didn't want it to become some hookup he inferred that ""we are beyond that because of the foundation we'd set"". I took what he said into consideration and told him I'd think about it. 

A few hours passed and he calls me and tells me that his children fell asleep and asked me about coming over because he wanted to be in my presence. I told him I still was unsure (I am very indecisive) but, I eventually made up my mind and decided to come the more we talked.

Now once I arrived it was barely any talking because we were all over each other.

After everything is said and done, I'm left to believe that maybe if I had went with my gut instinct I wouldn't be feeling so salty. At the same time I can't say that if I decided to wait he wouldn't still have ghosted me but, it's been over a week and still nothing. 

Lastly, I am left with confusion since I thought that we were better than that.

Her reasons are basically..safety..which I get..for her (I normally tell guys to Fuck off, and if they dont like it, too bad)

But it's a reason I can understand when done in person, but online/text is a whole different platform.

The logic itself doesnt stand: ""I'm afraid of upsetting this guy texting me, so I'll just ghost/stand him up instead!"" 

Most importantly, it paints women as liars, with their words meaning nothing, maybe means no and yes means no.

Just say No, They will either appreciate your honesty, or they'll get upset, if they do, Fuck them...block that noise..

&gt;don't be mad at her. Be mad at the assholes whose behaviour means this is the safest option.

No thank you! I'm an adult... I'm accountable for my own actions...I will not use others' shitty behavior to excuse my own..two wrongs dont make a right.

We spent that night together and before falling sleep he wished me a good night and said ""I love you"". I was shocked because some hours before he asked me ""do you think we are going too fast?"" I replied I think we do not as he hasn't taken me to meet his family and neither do I even thought we've talked about meeting each other's parents but both agree we should wait more time. He introduced me to his cousins and siblings ect. So going back to him saying ""I love you"" I was so shocked that the only thing I had in my to say was ""i hope you get some rest baby"". The next day everything was normal as usual. I personally think he didn't really mean to say what he said as Based on what he had previously asked me if I thought we were going too fast but why would he say that?

33,muenv1,1618878835,Didn't ghost and couldn't be happier about it,"Went on 6 dates over 5 weeks with an amazing girl.   While I can't say a bad thing about her or our time together, I was having some uncertainties about whether she was really the one and worth pursuing.  I suppressed these feelings for a day or two because on paper we should be totally compatible and as I said, I really enjoyed my time with her.  However, even though I couldn't put a finger on what was off or why I wasn't feeling stronger, I knew that for her sake it was best to end things now rather than continue to drag it on.

We didn't text much between dates and I initiated the contact 90% of the time so it would have been really easy for me to ghost her.  I feel really, really guilty and bad delivering any sort of negative news so the easiest thing for me would have been to just never text her and avoid that conversation altogether.  Eventually, I decided to sack up and do what was best for her and that was to be honest and direct.  I went to her place after work, sat her down, and explained exactly how I was feeling.  She was certainly sad and upset but she thanked me 3 separate times for handling things the way I did.  She thanked me for being honest, doing it face to face, and being direct.  In fact, she even texted me after our conversation to thank me for handling it the way I did.

The reason for this post is simple...don't ghost.  I get why people do it but the right thing for both parties is to be honest, direct and communicate and allows both individuals to move on and have closure.  The easy thing for me would have been to do nothing but the right thing for her was to tell her to her face and be honest.  She couldn't have been more appreciative and I may have kept a friend in the process.

35,muere1,1618879173,What are expectations for logistics if I‚Äôm unsure what I‚Äôm getting into?,"25M, back on the market open to dating again after a 2 year immature relationship that ended in flames and led to a subsequent 1.5 year long period of depression and inner struggles over it.

Been hitting it up a lot with a girl I met through work. I actually went to school with her so we always knew of each other but never knew each other personally. We‚Äôve become friends at work and talk outside of work now too.

Our vibe is really good, but the tricky thing is this: I believe now that guys and girls can be just friends. I didn‚Äôt always believe that, and some people can‚Äôt, but I do see it happen where guys and girls can be good platonic friends and it works well and I value that. 

I consider her a friend right now, but if I‚Äôm being honest she is really the type of girl I can see myself being intimate with and she‚Äôs really good to me. The thing is: I‚Äôm just chilling right now, no interest in forcing anything. I wouldn‚Äôt want to mess up the friendship by being overly flirtatious or trying to force more. I just want to see how our vibe develops more and see what happens. 

My question is about the logistics of doing things together while trying to maintain this ‚Äújust chill and see how our vibe grows‚Äù thing. Sometimes we‚Äôll buy each other food at work. We just went and got food the other night after work, but I only paid for myself and I didn‚Äôt offer to pay for her because I was kinda just viewing it like two friends going to grab food real quick after work.

She agreed to hang out with me again this week doing something outdoors.

I don‚Äôt know if or when I should be offering to pay for everything, go pick her up instead of her meeting me places, etc. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs appropriate or expected of me at different stages.

Basically I just feel ignorant about logistics because of how long I was off the market dealing with deep mental and personal challenges. I don‚Äôt want to mess up the friendship but I also don‚Äôt want her to be disappointed in me not taking things to a next level faster if that‚Äôs what she‚Äôs hoping for.

And ones I've been friendly with that I met through my female friends, majority of them gave me nasty or uninterested looks. Probs cus I'm not entirely attractive however friendliness would have been nice from them. And even in clubs, all my friends got hit on except me. Again probably because of my looks, but I feel that people know that I'm not one of those girls that fit in. 

I feel like I can't start a conversation with men of fear they think I'm into them and get disgusted And feel like dating wouldn't get anywhere because i don't fit in with what's considered the norm. 

I still feel very immature even though I do all the things im supposed to do at my age. Even my personality I guess is weird. I'm just quiet and awkward, and not loud and funny like most women and my friends. I wouldn't even be able to keep a guy interested in me for a long period or keep a convo going. 

I dont really have any hobbies either. And I'm not really interested in having any, I have my friends. However, it's seen as a bad thing. I'm just a shy, friendly, quiet girl and feel I will never meet someone who'd be able to put up with the person that I am. And fear I'll never be able to act myself around another man. 

I honestly don't know where I'm going with this, sorry. I'm not trying to pity myself or anything. Im comfortable with the person that I am.

42,mufgpe,1618881590,Dating while unemployed,"So I just got out of my first relationship in a long while where I started out employed and ended up unemployed due to covid.  One of the things she said part way through was that she never imagined she'd be in a relationship with an unemployed person but I was an exception.  I was understanding to that since she had a kid and her ex (childs dad) couldn't provide much but was involved and not a bad guy.  That being relevant is understandable.  She also knew my finances pretty well so that probably helped but she learned it significantly into the relationship not say the beginning.

One of the things I want to do more in this period is date more.  I worked a lot at my job as well as my mental health in the past so I haven't dated as much as I should/could have.

I read something that 75% of women wouldn't date someone unemployed.  Now I'm kind of wondering how to approach this since it's one of the first things that usually gets brought up is taking about your job.  Financially I'm really well off.  I don't need a job and I don't really want one right now but I don't want to tell a date that because I've also had negative experiences when people learn that. I also don't want to be immediately written off because they think I'm a deadbeat or won't be able to contribute in that aspect.  I've joked with people that I'm retired but being 30 that seems to be more confusing even though I could be if I really wanted.

43,mufhtm,1618881695,Honestly I don‚Äôt know what to do.,"Context:
‚ÄîOkay so I‚Äôve been feeling like my girl needed some space. After she had canceled plans two weekends in a row, the third week I ignored her thinking that‚Äôs what she wanted. I call her after 7 days and we had a great talk just catching up then she abruptly hangs up because her aunt needed her right before I was going to ask about plans. 

So I send her a text seeing if she was available this weekend and she says she‚Äôs mad at me. So I ask why and she just says she‚Äôs mad again. I then asked if she would like to talk about it over dinner at my house this weekend and again evades that. I then sent a minute long voice memo the next day just saying that I apologize for upsetting her and I‚Äôd like to see her this weekend. She then told me she would yell at me about it next weekend in which I liked the message. ‚Äî

Then randomly two days later she sends me a text saying ‚ÄúHey I was thinking before we get too serious or anything that I need to just focus on myself for right now because my mental health is getting really bad. I‚Äôm truly sorry but I just think my mental health is spiraling and I just need to find myself at the moment.‚Äù

So I sent a message stating that I understood and that I am here for her if she needed anything and that I would drop off her brothers stuff and her books at some point in which I can let her know when that will be if she wants to know. 

So I guess I am asking if I should let her be for a while or should I go ahead surprise her with something in a week?

I was born with Autism
My biological father left, my single mother had a couple abusive boyfriends, 
I blame myself for pushing her into those situations, 
I then ran into an abusive relationship where I was assaulted with a knife before I was out of middle school,
After which I completely shut down and became secluded and suicidal (my great grandparents, brother, and mother are who got me through it)
After nearly becoming a hermit, my mother and father married and I had some semblance of normal introduced into my life.

Now I'm 25, on anxiety meds, have a slightly crooked nose, and messed up teeth from when I had fallen in my youth and living with my parents. I own all that is mine, have a 2018 Camry, a factory job, furniture, and pay (reduced price) rent, as well as help out with upkeep and appliance purchases. I'm very socially awkward and can't have trouble talking to, let alone dating women. I have made several attempts to ask women out and get rejected constantly or just ghosted after a date. After 2020, I'm finding it even more impossible to connect with someone. I'm afraid dying alone is inevitable. I'm overthinking this but I'm learning by trail and error...

57,mugxft,1618886660,"Welp, I guess it's not happening","I \[35M\] had only seen this woman \[27F\] a couple times before Covid, but we've been talking a ton since then. We've been in different states during Covid so haven't got to spend time together in person. I felt like we would have been ""officially"" in a relationship months ago, except we wanted to spend more in-person time together before doing that. 

We've had tentative plans for her to come visit me for several months now. She already pushed those plans back a month, but then we finally settled on dates. 

Then today she texts me (my thoughts in brackets):

&gt;I'm looking at my schedule to see if our trip will work. I'm wondering what you've got in mind for the trip. Will I be staying with you, or should I get a hotel? Are we just going to get dinner together and then split up, or do you want to spend a lot of time together?

Maybe it doesn't seem like much, but this is pretty ridiculous. We set these dates 2 weeks ago, and *now* she's looking at her schedule and wondering if it will work? Plus she doesn't have a job right now and for the last 6 months has barely left her apartment; exactly how hard can it be to fit something into her schedule? Also, the questions about where she'll be staying and how much time we'll be spending together are just insane. We've been talking about her coming to see me for months, she's going to fly to another state to see me... and she thinks her getting a hotel, just grabbing dinner and then saying goodbye is what I had in mind? 

Seems pretty clear she's not into the trip and is being cagey about it rather than just coming out and saying it like an adult. Which is really, really disappointing...

61,muh6bw,1618887555,Is it possible to have genuine feelings for someone that you've never met in person?,"Simple question really: Is it possible to have feelings for someone that you've never physically met?

I have a pen-pal. We've been emailing one another now probably two and a half years. We've grown pretty close and know a lot about one another. We frequently exchange gifts, teach each other things about out languages/cultures. The whole thing is honestly just... really nice. Sometimes we have deep conversations, or talk about the future or our aspirations and sometimes we just share little things that happened to us during the day.

I find myself thinking about them quite a lot.

I honestly think that I have feelings for them, but... I find myself questioning if it's even possible for me to have genuine romantic feelings for someone I've never physically met.

Of course, I'm not about to declare my undying love for them, or being unrealistic about this. They are, ultimately, someone I've never met in person and as it currently stands we live around 6000 miles away from one another. However, it is looking increasingly likely that I might be working in their country/city in the relatively near future, so it's not as though it's an impossibility that it might lead to something either.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/muh6bw/is_it_possible_to_have_genuine_feelings_for/
62,muhn13,1618889191,Grateful,"Lately I‚Äôve been feeling grateful and haven‚Äôt had the chance to get it off of my chest, so here it is. 

I grew up with divorced parents and a narcissistic father. It affected my ability to be in healthy relationships for a long time and constantly found myself in really toxic relationships unable to stand up for myself. I also had some toxic traits in myself. 

After my last relationship, I was in a dark place. I took some time to focus on myself and focus on the very things that were preventing me from having a good relationship.

It‚Äôs been a long journey and a struggle at times. 

While it‚Äôs still early in the game, I met this guy who is absolutely amazing. It makes me realize that people weren‚Äôt lying when they would say things like ‚Äúyou will never have to question anything if the guy is ready and wants to pursue you‚Äù and advice along those lines. 

I knew he was worth holding on to when I felt myself thinking ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not taking up too much space here and I never was taking up too much space‚Äù while we were just walking together. 

The wrong guys will make you think you‚Äôre taking up too much space. The right guys do the exact opposite.

64,muhpfy,1618889441,I want to stop trying to find someone for an indefinite period of time as a 18M,"Ok, this will probably be a very long rant since I need to vent, but I would also appreciate any advice in my situation. TLDR at the bottom. 

Having gone through chatting with some girls and trying to find someone, I just feel exhausted and sad. More on that below, but I had different situations. I talked to girls who I wanted to take things further with. Some just ignored me. One girl was interested in me but I wasn't interested in her at all. All of this failed, and now I just don't want to attempt anything for an indefinite period. I will delete all my dating profiles and stop trying to find someone for now. Maybe eventually I will do that again or everything will be better off after the pandemic ends and we go back to normal when it is easier to meet people, but I don't feel like even trying that now. And it is just sad because my age is when it is exactly the right time to explore romantic relationships. 

To give you some context about myself, I am a 18 year old male, and I live in the U.S. as an immigrant from an Eastern European country. I didn't really have any interest in dating and romantic relationships and never tried to find someone until April-May of the last year. I guess it just started out of the boredom I had when the pandemic hit, but later on I started thinking more deeply about the question of dating and relationships. Then, I realized that there really is something missing in my life, and that is love. Don't get me wrong - I have some amazing friends (although they are back in my home country and I don't have many friends in the U.S., but that's not a big issue for me) as well as my mom who has helped me tremendously with advice and other assistance. I certainly don't mean that there are no people in my life who love and support me. Romantic love, on the other hand, is something that I have never had experience with previously, never being in a serious relationship or dating anyone. What I wanted (and still want, I guess) is to feel what it is like when you love someone and someone loves you back in this way. I don't know if I believe in the existence of soulmates, but I feel that a very special bond between people who love each other exists - and I just want to experience that. Additionally, I have been looking not only for love, but a long-term romantic relationship rather than anything in the short term. Honestly, I am afraid that I will lose these sparks and thoughts on love I have as the time goes by, and I hope that I will find someone sooner rather than later before my fire goes out. 

But enough with what I have been looking for (love and a long-term relationship) and sorrowful thoughts. Here is what actually happened with me. As I mentioned above, I started trying to have conversations with girls a year ago. Here, it is important to say that I mostly used a dating chat bot on social media that people in my home country and its neighbors use. There were some people from the U.S. (you can set any city there and swipe on people), although it was mostly just populated with trolls who didn't really live in the U.S. Later, I also tried using Bumble and Tinder, and I had zero luck with it, finding that the majority of girls there look solely either for casual sex and hookups or followers on Insta. I found myself swiping left almost constantly, which is not what guys usually do, but I genuinely felt that I could never feel love in the way I described above with the vast majority of women on these apps, deleting them soon. I had way more luck with the chat bot I described above, and below I will write about situations I had with girls of my or similar ethnicity I found there (or other sometimes using something else). I counted, and I can say that I had some kind of a chance with 7-8 girls, but in the end, I can say that I couldn't love any of them. Oh, and I had no meetings that you consider real dates. So here is the experience I had.

\- Overall, I had some interesting conversations about different topics with some girls, but they really went nowhere after I or them stopped chatting due to losing interest. 

\- Some girls ignored me outright when I messaged them after connecting on the bot, and I didn't send dumb messages like just ""hi"" or ""baby what's up"". Why would you even do that if you registered in a dating chat app?

\- I went out with one girl two times last summer. We never really mentioned that these were dates. I had some cringe moments with her (check out my very first post for more) but she was eventually interested and then lost this interest, I guess. Fast forward to March now - I went to the city she lived in and asked her on a date. Actually, so far this was the first and only time when I explicitly said that to a girl. She refused, telling me she has a boyfriend. I was able to confirm this, so she didn't say that to come up with a reason for refusing. However, I knew she didn't have a boyfriend back when we met in summer previously. 

\- One girl was genuinely interested in me, and I could tell from the clues in chatting. She sent me a heart emoji on the first day we met and then sent some more suggestive stickers and images. The problem is that, to put it mildly, she wasn't really my type. I don't want to date or love a 16 year old girl who drinks and smokes. This is not the only issue I had with her, but it is the biggest one. I don't feel bad for ghosting her, no thanks. 

\- Another girl lived close to me, and after we had a good chat, I thought I could just ask her for a walk and see where it goes. Until I found her profile on another social media that people in my country use (we chatted in a different app). She had a status (you can use these and they are standardized) with heart emoji and text that said ""I love at a distance"". I then found a profile of a guy from her home country to whom she sent a gift with a joke that said ""I wish I were your bed because it's under you every day"". How funny. I didn't want to get into any awkward situations, and, needless to say, I didn't suggest her to go for a walk and our communication stopped. 

\- This girl asked me about politics and she told me that she was moderate in her beliefs but then told me that she supported the Republican side on the issue of coronavirus. I proceeded to find out more, and she said that she doesn't believe in restrictions, is against the vaccines, and thinks that some conspiracy theories about its origins might be true. Well, I tried to dissuade her but failed and stopped communication. Some of you might say this is controversial and solely the matter of opinion, and I will not argue otherwise. I will just say that my thinking on the issue was completely different and it was a deal breaker, so please respect my opinion as well. 

I had more stories, but I will not post them all here since you get the point. I wasn't able to find someone and now want to give up on it for idk how long due to my experience trying. All of this is just a little depressing, and I start to doubt whether I will be able to date anyone later. But maybe everything is still ahead for me, I just don't know. I am aware that my failure so far is not the end of the world and that many people are in far worse situations than me. Finally, sorry for being so long-winded, and thanks for reading my rant. 

TLDR: After trying to find someone and looking for love/serious romantic relationship, I feel exhausted  and discouraged due to no positive experience dating. Sometimes I missed my shots, sometimes I wasn't interested, sometimes things just went wrong. Now, I don't know what to do next and want to just give up searching, even though I feel the fire and my age is considered golden for finding love.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/muhpfy/i_want_to_stop_trying_to_find_someone_for_an/

69,muhxrw,1618890318,Walk away if they don‚Äôt see your worth. I really just needed to vent about my experience.,"I am a 23F and one of my close guy friends introduced me to a 27M. We instantly had no issue talking about whatever and eventually that first night hooked up. It was one of the most passionate nights I‚Äôve ever had but I chalked it up to be a one night stand and didn‚Äôt think much of it. I actually left the next day without saying anything because 1 I had to go to work and 2 I didn‚Äôt want to get caught up with the feelings I was having after just meeting him the night before.
Fast forward a week or two we‚Äôve continued to spend time together hooked up a few times and it has only been getting better and better. I can feel my self falling for him but like all men in my life lately they don‚Äôt want anything serious and want to just have fun. 

I confided in him telling him that I was feeling this connection and wanted reassurance that I wasn‚Äôt crazy about what I was feeling. He agreed and told me that he felt something as well but isn‚Äôt ready for something long term or even a commitment. He told me that he is afraid that he is going to cheat and doesn‚Äôt want to hurt me. 

How do I take that? I finally found someone who I had an instant connection with, passionate sex, a lot in common with and he makes me forget about all the things that stress me out in that moment. We danced in the living together just having a good time, he‚Äôll sing his favorite song to me.
But on the opposite of the scale he makes me feel like I‚Äôm not good enough not to cheat on. 
He makes me feel insignificant not a priority. 
It‚Äôs hard to even contemplate waiting around for him to realize the type of person I am because I know my worth, I want to fight to show him who I am but I‚Äôve spent so much energy on trying in the past that going forward why waste time to prove myself when I don‚Äôt have to. 

Having this vent session has not only made me feel better but solidified to myself and I hope to whoever took the time to read this that I‚Äôd rather be the one who got away then sit at his feet begging him to love me looking stupid. 

I hope that if he ever comes across this, he reads this and see that I was hurting and wanted him more than anything. I was willing to love and accept him for all of his flaws and wanted to praise him for them. 

I‚Äôll miss your green eyes and the way we danced. I‚Äôll miss your confidence and the smile you have.

73,muivdt,1618893947,Non-U.S. Redditors: Do you feel the common dating tropes thrown around on Reddit don't seem to apply to where you live?,"So I'm a 24 year old male from Australia and I hear all the time about threads with dating tropes like ""If you're not sure if she's interested, read this...."" ""If she's not making an effort...."", and I've never found that my experiences relate to these at all. Women my age here where I live seem to be very reserved, don't really engage in conversation all that much, let alone flirt.

I also hear the tropes about ""work on yourself and women will come"" but in my experience this doesn't align at all as I've found the better I get, the more standoffish women my age here are to me. For example, I used to have women my age be friendlier to me and even approach me every so often at times but now I'm in shape and dress better, have a leaner face, women have become a lot more standoffish.

I've talked to women here about this and they say that it's normal for them to be friendlier towards less attractive guys and that they'll be more standoffish towards more attractive guys.

This doesn't align with the common reddit threads I see about signs of interest etc and it got me thinking that maybe these common dating tropes/advice/etc are mainly specific to America and was wondering if there were any other Redditors not from America who felt similarly about this.

So for those not from America, do you feel your experiences align with the common dating type threads here on Reddit?

I can't tell if he's interested and just also won't make a move and we're just at this impasse or if he's just kind to me. He's held my hand randomly, he always stands next to me or sits next to me when we we're all out. He gave me a ride home one night when I insisted he didn't need to. He always wants to share his food with me and even takes food off my plate without asking. And I know, I know all this sounds a little silly I know I'm probably reading into things but he does just enough to give me hope that he might be interested. Like they're little slivers of nothing that I work into being something.

He's out of my league and I think that's what's holding me back more than anything from even attempting to put myself out there a little more with him. 

I don't know how to get over this. I need to shit or get off the pot, I know. I'm trying to go on dating websites and everyone I come across just isn't him.

84,mukj6q,1618901005,Not interested in flirting on first date,"26M started dating again. I'm noticing passive signals for escalation, but have zero interest in acting on them. Instead, I'm much more interested in getting to know my dates as people, and trying to build some kind of deeper connection from that. This feels like a problem, since my first dates aren't really getting romantic in any way. This makes no one involved really care about following up to let things grow.

How do I get myself to be into flirting and getting more touchy out the gate, with effectively strangers? Was in a loving but romantically dead ""relationship"" for a long time, so have some patterns to unlearn.

Before, my limited amount of casual experience always came to me on its own via the dancefloor. That's not really an option these days though, and isn't the type of connection I'm looking for anyway (though I guess we could always do the talking after).",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mukj6q/not_interested_in_flirting_on_first_date/
85,mul3ct,1618903537,I Need from Men!!! Is my ex-bf is stringing me along?,"Hello,

28(F) here. My boyfriend (28M) of a little more than a year broke up with me 2 weeks ago because he thinks we are non-compatible and think I am ""immature"" compared to him. I was very hurt.  I loved him despite his flaws and anger issues. After 2 days of the breakup, we reconnected and start sleeping with each other. We have been intimate for more than 2 weeks and while I am with him, he would tell me he loves me and want to work it out in the future. He would treat me as if we are still together. He would invite me to sleep over and still does nice gestures like buying me food and taking me out. 

However; on the days he doesn't see me. He would rarely text me and would take hours to reply back and I'm always the one who has to follow through with the plans. He ignores my calls when I need to ask him an important question. He doesn't let me know his schedule until the last minute and I felt he would only hang out with me if he has no plans with his friends. He would ignore my text messages but I know he's on his phone because he would post IG stories. He is the one who advises my best friend (back when we together and my BFF was seeking advice from us) if a guy barely texts you, it means he doesn't care much about you. And I conclude from that remark he doesn't care about me right now. 

He would text me at night randomly that he loves me and misses me. Yet he tells me that I am just his friend. Funny thing is that he is currently still sleeping with me but he was the one who told me he never had casual sex before. And I know he doesn't. I asked him why he is still sleeping with me and he said he is not making me as a placeholder but he is considering working it out in the future. Then he would call me his soulmate. He also got very angry and jealous that I am going to the gym with my friend (female) and she invited her friend who is a trainer (male). He got jealous my friend's trainer friend is going to be there despite I do not have any history with that guy and I don't even know him. My ex also got mad at me for improving myself by going to the gym and starting a side hustle right after we broke up. He thought it was disrespectful that I begin taking his advice after the breakup. Even though I used the breakup to reflect and took immediate actions to fix my mistakes.  So many mixed signals and I honestly don't know what to feel anymore because I am very hurt. 

So guys, any idea what is going on? And brutal honesty is welcomed.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mul3ct/i_need_from_men_is_my_exbf_is_stringing_me_along/
86,mul42m,1618903637,Conversation and Text back,"Other day at the train station I met this girl, and we talked for a while. Seemed like a good conversation; she was laughing and seemed ready to contribute to it. We both are leaving the state soon at the end of the month, so I figured I‚Äôd see if she would be interested in meeting up again before we left. 

However, I asked if she wanted to meet for dinner (not really that serious to me but apparently that is more serious dating), and the conversation went awkward because she wasn‚Äôt sure about dating so close to leaving. At this point I just said ‚Äúhow about no pressure, you give me your number, and I‚Äôll text you‚Äù. Texted her on Sunday afternoon after I got back, and haven‚Äôt heard back yet.

Before I was a shy socially awkward weirdo who struggled to make eye contact and meet new people. But due to certain events that have transpired I am now just a socially awkward weirdo and have become comfortable with talking to strangers and meeting new people.


Because of this, I've started chatting up more girls (granted not many but even a handful in a period of a year is infinitly better than one every few years) and have received quite a few positive responses in the sense of them seeming to be genuinely interested in me and even agreeing to me taking them out on a date (mainly been asking if they want to get coffee first).


Here's the frustrating part... I usually leave with their insta handle or number and hit them up the next day and the responses end up becoming minimal to the point of them either not responding or ghosting me. 


So while I'm kinda proud of myself for actually going out there and actually taking shots I just wish one would actually just land since while I have taken more shots this year than any other time, it's still not frequent enough to make it any less depressing",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mulwdr/i_just_cant_seem_to_catch_a_break/
98,mum01y,1618908145,"Ending a Pattern of Behaviour, Or Sticking to What I Know. (Rant)","*This is actually my first Reddit post and perhaps more of a wanting to get it out of my system, but I would appreciate words of wisdom.*

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm a 17-year-old guy who is not experienced with relationships, not that should be but that's just the fact. I have hooked up with girls before but never maintained a romantic relationship seriously. I go to an all guys college and so my pool of girls is almost exclusively through friends. Admittedly I have succumbed to the expectation that you should be in a relationship, and I understand I don't have to be, but it would be fun right? maybe the grass is greener on the other side. Anyways to the point.

I was set up by a friend, let's call her Sophia. Sophia is the year level below me and lives pretty close. (none of us can drive yet so that's important to me, we live near train stations on the same line and are a bus line apart). She goes to a school where a lot of my friends do and people have been very excited by our match up. Speaking candidly, she is very attractive, she is also very articulate and intelligent. She has a love of poetry, I have a love of songwriting and we both enjoy reading. Now to the complicated part.

I have a pattern of giving up easily when it gets hard. Our first date went well, I bought her flowers and we had brunch, talking for hours. The second date didn't carry the momentum, I thought things were moving faster and had higher hopes but ultimately it was just another talking date, and that's fine. She spoke about how she was only a couple of months out of a serious relationship where the guy cheated on her and so she isn't ready for anything serious as of now. She has said she wants to keep it casual and see where it goes.

Now we haven't seen each other in a week, and won't for another seeing as she is busy every day of this week and can't commit to plans. I don't mind this because I understand people are busy but her texting is very dry. Even a conversation takes 10s of minutes between responses from her. I get she may not be glued to her phone, but I thought maybe she would want to speak to me. Another big difference that strikes me is drugs and alcohol. Now I have never done any of the formerly mentioned, I have never had the desire, I don't need them to have fun and I know that most people regret doing so in their teen years. Sophia is open about her use and it just doesn't sit right with me. Obviously, she can do what she wants but I just know there are gonna come times where I am stopping her from doing what she wants or I'm going to be pressured into something, either way, the difference is gonna rear its head one way or another, I feel.

Now obviously very few hit it off straight away and many have to work at relationships and work out the wrinkles. Do I wait for someone more suited for me? or keep pursuing this girl even if I have to wait for her to be ready. I don't want to let another perfectly fine, pretty girl getaway because of a minor flaw or because it was tough. I'd love feedback and I'm happy to answer questions you may have.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mum01y/ending_a_pattern_of_behaviour_or_sticking_to_what/
99,mum035,1618908149,Handling hot and cold treatment,"So I've been dating this girl, and I really like her. She liked me too, and we usually spent a lot of time talking. When I told her I like her, she started ignoring me and said that she needed space. 

I being me, failed to provide that. We still went out, and she told me that she has abandonment issues.  Her first boyfriend had cheated on her, and the second one ignored her repeatedly. 

Then she started to really ignore me. She talks to me on her own in the office. I don't even have to approach her. But as soon as we're out, she starts ignoring. Like, she'll reply to one or two messages, and then disappear. 

She asked me if my feeling are simply infatuation, and she holds that doubt in her mind. We still talk but very little. 

I like her and want her in my life. But handling hot and cold treatment is taking a serious toll on my mental health. I feel very depressed and anxious.

What should I do?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mum035/handling_hot_and_cold_treatment/
