I'd been dating mine for 7 months at that point and was feeling optimistic before the holidays.

Well, last night he broke up with me. I'm ""lovely"" but he had too much going on and his life was too stressful and he needs to take a breather from me and a break from dating to figure things out. 

At this point we've been together for 8 months. In fact, tomorrow, is 8 months to the day. He broke up over text. I asked him if we could please talk on the phone but instead, he just texted. I'm devastated. I had bought him this very thoughtful gift. We had plans to go see Christmas lights last weekend and he canceled so we were supposed to go tomorrow night. We went on an overnight trip in November and we had so much fun and laughed and it was romantic and sweet and he kept saying ""We need to come back here in the Spring or Summer"" 

I loved him. I can't figure out what went wrong. I honestly don't know what happened. I'm confused and I'm hurt. And I can't believe this is happening right before Christmas. 

I had been looking so forward to having someone to spend New Year's Eve with and Valentine's Day and my birthday in February. It was so nice having someone to hug and hold hands with and sleep with. I thought I'd found my person. Not that I was like ""We're going to get married!"" because we both are divorced and don't want to get married again but I thought I found a good guy to be with. After the terrible loneliness of 2020 it was just so nice to have someone to talk to and spend time with. 

I know these things happen but I'm just so surprised and confused and hurt. It sounds silly to say but my chest physically hurts. I'm at work and it's taking all of my effort to not just shut the door to my office and cry. 

I don't really want advice or anything. I'm just hurt. I don't understand how we can be in our 40s and people still can't have conversations right when something comes up. How people can ghost and hide behind texting and not be willing to work through little hiccups. I don't even know if there was a little hiccup! He won't talk to me.

But when I saw him yesterday, he showed me messages he’d exchanged with a couple. He’d gone on a free website where you can advertise anything for sale etc, similar to Craigslist, and started messaging a couple.

He had sent them a full face photo of us both, without my consent. Even just to choose a couple and start messaging with no discussion kinda turned my stomach, but adding a photo was really bad. I work in a public position, I really don’t need my face publicly out there in that manner.

I tried to explain why it was wrong, he just kept apologising without really adding anything other then saying he thought I’d like it.

During the same visit, I also told him how I feel frustrate whenever I start to tell some story from life, he always interjects with his own story, but never follows up to ask me to finish my own.

To me, these are all signs he likes the idea of me, more then who I actually am. He is an old school kind of guy, very polite etc. I do trust he’d never purposely hurt me, but he just doesn’t seem to understand me, or even comprehend that that is an issue.

&amp;nbsp;

Here's an example from my own adventures...

I haven't dated anyone in awhile. I usually meet women IRL, I don't use OLD. The last one seemed really cool but she was different than women I've dated previously in that she was not athletic so to speak. She liked hiking and backpacking she said, which checks my ""must be active or outdoorsy"" box. We texted for awhile then decided to talk and I was so caught off guard by the convo...

The first thing that got my attention was swearing and lots of it! I'm not even close to a saint, but it was a bit much!

I was still trying to stay open to going out with someone different than my usual type, so I asked her if she wanted to meet up at a large city park, she could walk her dog if she wanted, we could chat, get a coffee/lunch. This was early pandemic. She was up for it, but had a strong negative reaction to me mentioning I'd bring a frisbee. I have never met someone who was so opposed to the idea of tossing a frisbee around. I mean, it was sunny, nice weather, and everything was locked down, I didn't think it would elicit a ""oh hell #$@$ing no!"" response, lol. Not from someone who doesn't mind doing outdoorsy stuff and getting dirty anyway.

I decided to postpone meeting up with her. We had another convo or two and I started to understand that backpacking for her meant a short hike to camp, get drunk, and party. I never learned why frisbee was so bad,. I did learn that she had dated a guy in his early 20s recently (~20 years younger) and that she was open to poly relationships. I noped out of there at that point. She kept initiating contact, so I leaned heavily into doing ""Dad stuff"" and she eventually took the hint.

I guess this is both a pro and con of not using OLD. One one hand, it shows that a person's idea of their own interests can be different than how anyone else relates to those interests. It also shows the limitations of texting/chat. So when you see what they are into on their profile, you don't *really* know. On the other hand, at least with OLD you can get an idea of what a person is into without having to take time to talk with them. Like the poly stuff, assuming that would have been on her profile, I would have immediately passed.

Anyway, I just thought it was interesting that after texting a bunch, I never got the impression that she was into partying, hooking up with young guys, and having an epic potty-mouth.

The situation: I’ve known my colleague for 3 years I think and we get along really well. We share the same interests, humour and all that. But besides that the past year we started making some intimate comments here and there to eachother. Started as jokes but sometimes it doesn’t feels like it anymore. She says things like; “if I was your age we would definitely be a perfect fit”. 

And the worse part is, she has a man. He is a truck driver who is away 5 days a week and only home in the weekends. So I thought; ‘okay OP, this is never going to work and it will be just joking and fouling around as friends’. Until last month when we had a drink with the whole team. After a few drinks we all were joking around and calling out on eachothers good looks. I went to her and sad that she looked really good  but I stated that her husband probably wouldn’t like that I sad this. She turned to me and whispered; “oooh he doesn’t have to know everything“ and she winked afterwards. 

I can’t think straight since that moment. I want to have a drink 1-on-1 since that moment but it feels so wrong. And I’m afraid to ask it because it can ruin everything between us.

We share a profession and a hobby, and it has been great to have someone to talk to. I have not dated in a few years and have given up now: I do not often feel attraction to strangers, but I also do not hit on my friends, so staying single is the most likely prospect - it's not like a woman of my dreams will just land in my living room.

Except, last week I realized this friend and I are now spending much of our free time together, and somehow, over the last couple of months, we have developed a habit of holding hands when crossing a street and sometimes afterwards too, and then cuddling started and... this is clearly no longer just a friendship. I don't know why I did not see it evolving, or how she has been so patient with me for this long. But now I am catching feels and it's nice, even though I am embarrassed about my lack of self-awareness, especially for a guy over 40.

I don't know how things will work out, but I feel like we might as well give it a shot, since we've become emotionally entangled already and I don't see how we could walk it back to a regular friendship. It feels strange to be starting a romantic relationship with a good friend: we already have our communication routines, so there is no anxiety that I associate with dating a new person. And for the first time ever, I don't feel afraid of losing the romantic connection unless I keep wowing her: it seems being myself and treating her well is good enough.

I've been dating a guy for 2 months. We have an amazing time together, are very affectionate, go one dates several times a week, have great chemistry, there's mutual effort, and our high sex drives are super compatible. The one area that is a bit different than other guys I've dated is that we don't text a whole lot. We will communicate if we are making plans, and sometimes we will chat in the evening or have some sexy talk, but we definitely don't text back and forth all day. I felt secure enough in the dynamic to not need constant reassurance via text so that's been awesome.  The way he acts in person tells me everything I need to know.

However, I've noticed that in the past week there's been a significant slowdown in communication. He's been telling me that work is super busy, which I definitely believe, but he always made time for me in the past when he was busy, so this is a little different. He has told me in the past that sometimes when he's stressed he just shuts his brain off and doesn't really communicate and just works and sleeps. I get that, been there. He works 7 days a week usually, 13 hours a day.  It's a lot! But I've also asked him to just keep me in the loop so I don't feel like I'm bothering him or whatever. I can definitely give him space when he needs it, but if he doesn't let me know what's going on, I feel very lost and it does trigger some anxiety. He said he totally understood and things got much better after that. But now it seems to be happening again. It's been about 5 days of super limited communication, mostly initiated by me.  We texted like two sentences to each other a couple days ago but nothing since, and no plans have been made for the week even though we both mentioned doing something.

So I'm not really sure if this is a pre-holiday thing with being busy, or if this is him just backing off for good. It seems very strange because although we didn't feel the need to define the relationship yet, I feel very confident that we are heading in the right direction and not seeing other people, etc.  Of course, it only takes someone a few seconds to text, but I have definitely been in that mindset before where I don't feel like talking to anyone. 

And I get it - I've read a million posts on here about the whole texting dilemma and the anxiety that comes from it. I've been working super hard on my attachment and have improved so much, but old habits die hard. I'm a strong independent person and I know what I deserve, but every once in a while the anxiety creeps in and it's hard to push it away.  I'm just worried that the momentum we've been building is going to suffer, and it bums me out.  

This definitely isn't a ,""Girl, he's not that into you!"" situation. I'm not worried about that - I know he is lol. At this point it just seems like it's just a waiting game.  He will either re-engage or he won't.

I'd like to put forth an alternate analogy- people 40+ are not cars, but rather we are houses, and for every house, no matter in the condition or location, there is someone out there who finds its attractive features outweigh its problems. 

Cars have have red flag issues. Maybe the brake pads are worn thin, the tires are going bald, the oil hasn't been changed in years and it's wearing down the engine. These are problems. If you get on the road with your ""issues"" you put yourself at risk, or worse put others at risk. That's bad. 

Houses don't endanger anyone. You can live in pretty much any house, whether they have foundation or electrical issues, and even in a bad location. You will very rarely die. No 40+ house is ever ""fixed""- there is always something that needs to be replaced or upgraded. It's all about what a buyer is willing to live with and work on. There is a whole range of buyers out there, and who cares if 99.9% pass it by- a house only needs to find one willing person who loves it.

A personal example- are you are woman with kids going through a divorce? Feel like a hot mess and not ready to get out there? You may be a perfect match for me.

I recently have been embodying the standard of ""match their effort and interest"" instead of offering more than I'm receiving (in this case, in terms of communication, initiating conversation, and date planning). 

Someone asked to meet me again (we had met first a couple years ago), but in the time between first contact and the potential date I noticed that I was offering up interesting details about myself (when they aren't asking questions that demonstrate interest), and doing the prompting to make the date plan while he was keeping it very vague and using words like ""meet up"". The last straw was his lack of communication the day before our tentative, continued vague date plans, (due to work constraints which is understandable but also another example in a series of ways he demonstrated being pretty unavailable), and then he STILL hadn't firmed up plans the day of the date, and then he asks me to choose something to do because he ""doesn't know the town very well"".  So I canceled. 

I have spent a lot of my dating life being willing to pursue men I'm interested in, putting in more effort than them. I'm just over that and so relieved! I do my best to share enough of myself to peak interest and show that I'm available and friendly, but if he isn't taking the bait and matching me in that way, I'm gonna walk. Yes, I want to be pursued. It isn't about playing games or making it complicated, it's about the person demonstrating mutual interest and effort. My personal work on my self-esteem helps me to have healthier boundaries when people aren't meeting me where I am at. I think I'm pretty cool and I want someone to agree! 

Maybe this post will generate some conversation around asking someone out and then expecting them to plan it? The mental load of getting to know someone and planning events? About your level of interest and how that relates to how much effort you demonstrate? About how your improved self-esteem has improved your dating standards?

Good luck out there, everyone!

And if so, do you consider it settling?

I've always dated men to whom I felt incredibly attracted. And yes, it never works out, eventually.

Looking back, I always felt so 'lucky' to be with these particular men. But did they ever feel lucky to be with me? Was I ever as quietly charismatic to them, as they were to me?

As I peruse my options on OLD, I find I am talking myself into plainer types of men, or, trying to overlook this feature or that in an effort to not be so shallow.

Partly because it makes me think  that maybe they would feel lucky to be with me, for a change, and what would that be like?

Have any of you ever had this thought process? Have you acted on it? What was your experience with it?
