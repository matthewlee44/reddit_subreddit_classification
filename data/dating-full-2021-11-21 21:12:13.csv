I was set up with a guy by our mutual acquaintance. We texted for a little bit and then had our first date yesterday. He was really sweet-took me out to lunch,paid for everything even though I insisted I would,and we stayed and talked for over an hour and a half. He was cuter in person as well,and we had a lot in common and got into some pretty deep discussions about our goals,passions etc. 

But it was super awkward when we first saw each other. I was so nervous that I was trembling and could barely eat. I sensed that he was super nervous as well when we first met. Once we got started on a topic we could chat easily,and the convo flowed really well. But we had some awkward silences during transitions. I made sure to tell him I was super shy and nervous,but it still worries me.

We were meeting at 6pm on a place that was closing at 8, but I expected that we would go for some drinks after that.
I had a great time, we have similar type of humor and I thought he was enjoying himself too; although he avoided eye contact most of the date.
When the closing time arrived i checked on my phone and told him we should leave the place because they were going to close.
We left and he immediately said he was going to meet some friends (so he basically cut the date short).
We hugged goodbye but there was no mention of seeing each other again.
This made me think he wasn‚Äôt interested in seeing me again, but then after a while- during the same day, he texted me saying that he hoped i arrived home safe and that ‚ÄúI‚Äôm hot‚Äù.
I replied next day asking if he would like to see me again and he just answered that he would and suggested a time and place next week.
I answered that I agree on meeting that day, and asked where the place is, but I haven‚Äôt heard back from him after that even though I know he read  my message (and it‚Äôs been more than a day).

A little bit about me:

I have a physical disability (Charcot-Marie-Tooth - if anyone is curious) that affects the muscles in my hands and feet. I have trouble with fine motor movements and do things a bit differently. I have weak balance and so when I'm out in public I use a walker to help me walk. I'm very independent - can clean, cook and even lived by myself for a bit. I am not looking for a caregiver but obviously want someone who is comfortable with disability.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm at a place in my life where I feel I'm ready for marriage and so a few months back I decided to start seriously looking. I was on the apps (Salams, Muzmatch) and received a surprising number of matches but nothing serious has come of it so far. The issue I have is that I don't know how to disclose my disability in a way that is upfront (I'm not ashamed and don't want to lead anyone on) but at the same time isn't a lengthy post about my ability (or lack thereof... lol). 

And so I present the issue to you guys; how should I go about doing this? 

&amp;#x200B;

These are the three options I've come up with so far and I would appreciate you guys letting me know what you think. Feel free to add more if you think some other way may be better! Also, I have a significant number of photos of just me without my walker because sometimes it can ruin my outfit photos and obviously everyone in my life knows about my walker so I don't feel the need to include it in every Instagram picture. This is relevant because not all of my photos are with my walker and people have told me that they assumed it was a temporary thing.

1. Don't add it on my profile at all. I know this may seem wrong but I figured this may give others a chance to get to know me as an individual first. I would obviously disclose my disability afterwards (a few conversations in) but would let others see me for me. Especially on a platform like these apps where first impressions make all the difference, I would hate to be overlooked just based on my walker alone. 
2. Include a photo of me and my walker BUT don't indicate that I have a disability on my profile. I figured this would be a quick way to weed out those who are not interested in disability at all. I know a lot of people just quickly skim through profiles (or don't read them at all) so it would give them a visual idea of who I am and if they are still interested then we can have an open and honest discussion about it. 
3. Include a photo of me with my walker AND indicate that I have a disability on my profile. This is the most honest and upfront option. I present myself wholly and be open to anyone who is still interested.

I'm having trouble working through this situation and looking to get some outside opinions/ also need to vent. (sorry for the long post) 

I (27F) was introduced to someone (33M) by a mutual friend about 5 months ago. I knew he had been divorced for a year and a half and got the impression that he was hesitant to meet me, but we connected online anyways. Before we met in person we talked about his divorce once - he said that he learned from it and now has a second chance to be with someone and not settle for what he doesn't like. We met in person after talking for a few weeks and instantly hit it off - for the first 2 months we would see each other every weekend. The weird thing was that we didn't spend much time together alone. Aside from coffee the first time we met up and driving to/from where we were going, we always met up with his friends. He was always inviting me out wherever he was going. Never making plans just to spend time with me, but bringing me around with him. The other weird thing is there was no physical intimacy - no kissing, touching etc. We had a lot of fun together always, but I could never figure out what we were doing. 

After about 2 months we had ""the talk"". He explained that he loved hanging out with me, but didn't want to do anything to lead me on. He wasn't sure if he was ready for a relationship again yet but wanted to keep hanging out. So we did. As we got into months 3-4 we started seeing each other more often, sometimes 2-3 times a week. And then we started doing things just the two of us - going for nice dinners, to the mall, for long drives, watching movies at his house. Still without any intimacy. At this point I had very strong feelings for him. 

Month 5 now - he kisses me for the first time, and it was great. He makes a comment about how since we are so comfortable with each other, might as well have some fun. I couldn't understand what changed after 5 months of him not wanting to lead me on. Things progress very quickly over the next few weeks and we were having a lot of fun, but of course I was left very confused. I knew it wasn't just hooking up for him - I could see it in the way he looked at me (or at least that's I convinced myself). Inevitably we needed to have another conversation. It was getting too confusing for me. We were going out for dinners, texting almost every day, now being intimate. It felt like a relationship to me. He said he hadn't hooked up with anyone else in a few months, but I also saw Tinder on his phone leaving me even more confused. As expected, he hadn't changed his mind - still didn't know what he wanted, didn't know if he was ready for a relationship, said that I'm younger and want to get married but he's already been down that road and doesn't know if he wants to again. So I did the very hard thing and said I couldn't keep seeing him anymore, my feelings were getting too strong. We agreed we were on completely different pages.

How can I blame him when he told me straight up that he wasn't ready for a relationship? At the same time, I feel like his actions did lead me on.

The fact that it's been a week and he hasn't reached out makes me think I'm hurting from this a lot more than he is. I know this is for the best, but I'm just so sad/ confused/ angry with myself.

Hello everyone !

I (22F) have been with my boyfriend (25M) for a very short time. A few months maybe. Everything is amazing and I finally feel like for the first time I‚Äôve found a very cool &amp; awesome guy that I can see myself with for a long time. (Nice guys truly do exist! Wow) I can confidently say he‚Äôs the best thing that‚Äôs happened to me in a long time, and since we‚Äôve been together, so much good fortune, &amp; amazing opportunities have come my way, he motivates me to be better and I‚Äôve been completing goals that I‚Äôve put off for years (part of that can also be credited to my recent ADHD diagnosis &amp; treatment) and it‚Äôs completely overwhelming at times. I‚Äôve never been so content, in other words. 

My reason for this post is this:

So, last night we spent all evening together, and it was great, but these past few days I‚Äôve felt, I suppose less obsessed with him than usual. It has nothing to do with him, nothing has changed, but is this normal? Before, thoughts of him played like a record over and over all day long, but now I find myself thinking of other things rather than him. Part of me gets worried and definitely overthinks these thought patterns. My mind gets filled with my mothers words ‚Äúthe honeymoon phase is never supposed to end, and if it does, it‚Äôs not meant to be‚Äù. I‚Äôm not sure if these feelings are the honeymoon phase ending or anything like that, my obsessive feelings are just lessening, I suppose? He‚Äôs not my first and only thought every waking moment, I still do think about him a lot, but he‚Äôs not the only thing as he was previously. I think it‚Äôs possible that these obsessed infatuated feelings will return again, maybe they‚Äôll be better saved for certain moments where they‚Äôre more necessary, or a time when I‚Äôm feeling less hormonal? I dunno guys.

This feels like a very normal thing to have happen, but with my compulsive overthinking, I wanted to turn to Reddit for the approval of strangers. I‚Äôve never been in a relationship like this, and I‚Äôve never felt this way about anyone before. You could definitely say I‚Äôm very nervous to mess anything up here.

It might also be worth noting that he works a lot, and a very physically demanding job at that (I know what his work days are like very well, I used to work with him before I recently got my new job). He works out of town a lot and it bums me out that I can only see him once a week some days. I understand how it is, and have a lot of empathy for how hard his job can be, but it doesn‚Äôt make me miss him any less when he‚Äôs away.

He broke up with me out of nowhere because he said he doesn't know why he's not in love yet. I don't understand why he put so much pressure to be in love in a couple months but I think getting the title freaked him out and he put his guard up. It took me 9 months in my last LTR to say I love you and honestly, I don't think I really even meant it. I certainly don't know if I love him in only three months. 

Since he ended it, I've gone full NC and haven't heard from him. It's only been five days. Why did he want the title and then freak out? He was driving this train. He was telling me he wants me to meet his family, he wants to go away together, he wants my dog to come with me to sleepovers at his place, days before breaking up with me. It's like he wanted all of this and then scared himself. Any advice? I wasn't in love yet but I'd have liked to have more time to find out.

We had a few mutuals and new of each other, she perused me romantically after a few weeks of talking. We had similar interests in terms of music and reading at least. Met up with her 4-5 times and had become intimate several times at this point. The next meeting was when it got weird, she invited me out as usual. When I get to meet her she‚Äôs with a large group of her friends, I had no issue with this it just caught me off of guard as it wasn‚Äôt discussed. We had a nice night and then head back to her house for the night ( usually her parents aren‚Äôt home when she invites me back but she told me this time she intended for me to meet them). Again caught off guard by meeting them as well I think I have made a fool of myself, she tells me I haven‚Äôt and we have go to bed. The next morning is fine but the next time we meet was off. For context I had not rly talked to her for a few days ( told her I was going to be unable to talk ) because of looking after my dad who was ill after an operation. We then meet up again once, where she is completely off with me and doesn‚Äôt really initiate conversation or engage in PDA. I‚Äôm not really a touchy feely person so this didn‚Äôt concern me but it was odd because she usually was quite affectionate. She doesn‚Äôt ghost me after this meeting but is strange in the manner she communicates. In fact she is more clingy over things like FaceTime and message. Whilst this is happening she adds me to an insta close friends story where she rants about her talking stage ( Which was me I presume) wasn‚Äôt going well and it was frustrating her because she wanted something serious. So I was getting conflicting vibes which confused me. I get annoyed and just tell her I‚Äôm not playing any games and she either wants to talk to me or doesn‚Äôt. Things fizzle out but it confuses me as to why she‚Äôd introduce me to her close friends and family for then to suddenly change her demeanour completely. I‚Äôve heard from mutual friends that she even referred to me as her boyfriend on numerous occasions .",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1128553,public,self,M18 confused about situation with F18 a few months ago,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qz8k3t/m18_confused_about_situation_with_f18_a_few/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,

Like I honestly realy do like her but if it doesn't go well its probably going to be awkward soo yeah. Im also bad at reading signs, and I have no idea if she saw it the same way I did but ill get into it later

Background: So I first met B (14f) early July for the first time at the boardwalk of a beach. I Was instantly attracted to her, although I was kinda shy and didn't talk to her. I didn't really talk to her in any compasity until around august. My brother (17m) gave her my snap, we ended up talking for a bit and I thought we vibed pretty well.

We saw each other here and there but nothing much happened until in early october, at my brothers homecoming, when she asked my brother if I could come to the pre-hocoming event , witch I did. (Our homecoming wasn‚Äôt until a few weeks out). We ended up being the only 2 people left behind when they went to take pictures for like a hour. It was a house that had a pool, so we played games around pool and had a good time.

Then there was a period of nothing much happening until 2 weeks ago where we ended up going to the girlfriends house (16f) for the weekend sense my parents went away, and we all went to Hershey park. We had some 1-1 time waiting in lines when we split away to go on some other rides then the other 2. We do get along good, and the more time i spent with her the more conferrable I get, and the more I talk sense I'm regularly shy and introverted.

And then last week I Was invited the night before with her to go to the same beach and boardwalk we first met, along with my bro and his girl, plus another couple. The 6 of us did some shopping and then some lunch before we split up and the 2 of us went to play minigolf, and went around the shop. I really did have a good time with her, and it lasted for like 2 and a half hours before went back to the others. Then we split up again from the others to go to different shops before we went home. Like I said I really did have a good time, and I think she did too.

I'm just not sure how to go forward from here. I don't know if my brother knows I like her, though some events make believe that it‚Äôs a possibility. i do eventually want to talk to them about and and see what they think about it cuz there opinions really do matter to me and I do trust them. I also want to know if there okay with it in the first place.

One thing though is that we don't really talk in the periods where we dont see eachother irl. I atleast know some of the time she wants to see me so isnt forced interactions. I still do have her snap and we snap facepics sometimes, but no texting but besides that we don‚Äôt really talk outside of it. It‚Äôs been a week so far. And she does snap a lot of other people too, she has like a 285k snapscore and it usually goes up like 500-1k a day and Ik she snaps a lot of guys. (She posted a ss with her best friends list showing it as all guys with the caption ‚Äúthis gotta go‚Äù a few months ago)

Another thing is if I do decide to do it, is to try to get the motivation to do it. When I think about it it really does scare the crap outta me. I always think it‚Äôs a gamble but I really don‚Äôt want to make things awkward Incase she doesn‚Äôt see me in that way. Like I said I‚Äôm not the best at picking up signs, but idk if she tried to give any anyways.

So yeah thats where im at. Any advice?

Also, he seemed more interested in talking in person and kept putting a pin in other conversations, saying that we would talk about it more later or in person. We planned to meet up at a caf√©, and I ended up rescheduling because something came up, and today we finally got to meet in person, and we sat down and had coffee. Even though it only filled about half an hour, we ended up sitting there and talking for almost 2 hours, and it wasn‚Äôt even awkward; it was pleasant. 

My concern now is I‚Äôm wondering if it was a date because, with the bit of exposure I have with dating, I‚Äôve never felt so calm and comfortable. The one odd part was when you were leaving, he tried to give me a fist bump, and I ended up giving him a Handshake; instead, he said it was for Covid safety, but now I‚Äôm overthinking and wondering if he‚Äôs looking for me to be a buddy rather than a potential relationship. I went back and looked at his tinder profile, and in the description, he just said that he‚Äôs looking for people to explore the city and hang out with. 

After the coffee, I sent him a message thanking him for the drink and the company, and he responded. He said he enjoyed his time. He didn‚Äôt realize so much time had passed, and he would love to hang out again and let him know, but then he just closed the conversation by saying, ‚Äú have a great rest of your day.‚Äù  

The advice I received is to give it a day and then text back or wait until he replies, but I don‚Äôt want to do that. Still, I don‚Äôt want to come off as clingy, especially if I ended up misreading his intentions. I wouldn‚Äôt mind having him as a friend; I actually would love to have him as a friend because I loved our conversation, and it flowed so effortlessly. 

I don‚Äôt want to go into it with the mindset of only getting a friend when he wants a relationship or vice versa going into it with the attitude of getting a relationship when he would prefer to be friends. Do I just flat out ask him, or do I wait a bit and read more and better understand his outlook?

Thread is here for anyone interested: [https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qyb8ho/just\_admitted\_to\_my\_fwb\_that\_i\_want\_more\_and\_she/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qyb8ho/just_admitted_to_my_fwb_that_i_want_more_and_she/)

We've both told each other how much we enjoy spending with each other, and how we both feel. We communicated several boundaries, and one of hers was she wanted exclusivity. Which I found pretty obvious, when I used to date several women, I didn't really consider it dating, because while I enjoyed their company; I never really thought of anything past casually dating/hooking up. Maybe, it's because I've been cheated on in the past several times, so I haven't 'officially,' been committing myself to anyone. 

But with her? I'm willing to do that. 

I'm scared to honestly be vulnerable again.

Obviously, no cheating, lying, manipulation, playing games, no hiding your feelings should be basic rules to follow. We both expressed communication, being honest, exclusivity, and just straight up letting each other know if there's a problem are key.

So basically this is gonna sound crazy. I need to tell the whole story though to make sense. I wake up very late and I wake up multiple times and go back to sleep in the morning. I had a dream of myself walking into a classroom trying to find a seat next to this girl. The first two dreams are me trying to sit next to her. Then finally I get to my third dream and I sit next to her and we talk casually. Later in the day I‚Äôm sitting at my computer listening to old throwback kid cudi. I‚Äôm thinking to myself about how I think of music and how I listen to it. Then I have a thought/vision I wana say more of a vision because I could visualize it more than a thought. But it was me and the girl at a restaurant talking and I‚Äôm explaining to her what I was just thinking irl to myself about music. And in while I‚Äôm telling her this stuff this woman turns around and tells us, that kid is going to be a genius or he‚Äôs going to be a smart (something like that) it‚Äôs hard for me to remember because as soon as the lady said that my vision stopped. It was more of a fantasy in my mind I know. But right after that ‚Äúvision‚Äù I had kid cudi immortal came on. And the first line of the song goes ‚ÄúI‚Äôm the smartest man alive‚Äù. No joke it tripped me out. And the vision was before I listened to that song. But anyway I was tripped out and it stuck with me. (Also girl in the dream and ‚Äúvision‚Äù idk who it was just a blonde girl, usually in my dreams I don‚Äôt see faces or remember them)

** my question or me asking for advice**

I‚Äôm on tinder the next day and I see this girl that looks exactly like my high school crush. Like almost exact same person. I thought it was someone making a fake tinder profile of her so I look her up on instagram. And the girl was actually a real person. So I obviously was attracted to her. And better yet she‚Äôs into photography like me. 

It‚Äôs been a couple days since I saw her on tinder so I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre going to match 

So basically is it creepy to ask a girl out on instagram? I followed her main and her photography insta. I just don‚Äôt know what to say to a girl I‚Äôve never met. There‚Äôs a few mutual friends but not like friends I talk to. 

And I know you just have to shoot your shot and there‚Äôs nothing to lose. But I just want to get the best shot that I can. Plus she‚Äôs 18 and I‚Äôm 21, so in my head it feels kinda weird but people say that age gap isn‚Äôt bad. 

So is something like asking her to do a photography shoot out of like street photography or she mostly shoots coffe and cars and I‚Äôve never been to a coffee and cars. I just don‚Äôt know what to say??

We met off a dating site two years ago, and immediately hit it off. Unfortunately we lived almost an hour away from each other and neither of us had cars, so we decided not to date. We stayed friends (except for the occasional sexy slip-up) and both have had romantic feelings for each other a good portion of the time.

Unfortunately, they struggle with depression and what I'm thinking might be bipolar. Because of this they often make impulsive decisions such as starting jobs they quit after a month, going back and fourth on a career, getting engaged (before we met) and jumping into things with girls that they think are ""the one"" only to be dumped a month later.

Recently they started talking vaguely about 2 girls, who they couldn't decide which he liked more, before deciding on ""Sarah"" who turned out to be me! We tried to date for a month, but they put no effort into it. They just started a new, more tiring job due to being $2000 in debt, and felt bad that they couldn't pay for things in our relationship. Because of this they were more distant, even when I tried to communicate the best I could. ""It hurts me when you only want to go one one or two dates a month, ect.""

After some talking, they told me that I made them feel different than every other girl they knew, and it was hard for them not to think I'd be the perfect girlfriend (along with wondering why they couldn't be a better partner too)and they couldn't figure out if that was true love or just some really awesome friendship. Not sure if it matters but we also have similar... bedroom interests that can

be hard to find in other people.

Another issue we're having is me planning to move out.  

When I gain the financial stability and graduate community college this spring, I'd like to move into an apartment away from my abusive family. They always wanted to join me, but financially it's not seeming possible, especially when the car they bought a few months ago (a super cheap racecar) is breaking down beyond repair.

Its hard for me because I could never imagine my life without them. I want to be in a relationship with them, but I know they have a lot to work on mentally and physically before we ever could. Honestly, it feels like our ages are reversed most of the time too. I really like them a lot, but with them not knowing about me and always going back and fourth throughout our entire friendship, what could they feel about me?
