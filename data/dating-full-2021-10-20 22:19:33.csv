Things are still great, likely the honeymoon phase still going on.

It's her first relationship, whereas I've been in love and relationships before. It started out with us in the same office, her admitting she has a crush on me, and then us hanging out, kissing,and so forth.

Right after our first kiss, she said she loves me. I wasn't scared or wanting to run away, but I realized thr feelings maybe came from the spur of emotions since it was her first kiss. I made her understand that we don't know each other well, specially not the bad or not so fun sides, to even know the other person well.

I take time to fall in love, and eventually I did get attached and fell in love. However, I've noticed that the more emotional vulnerability I show (missing her, wanting to meet, expressing what she means to me), the more she pulls away.

She does enjoy spending time with me, our sexual chemistry is great, and we spend hours together without getting tired when we meet (twice a week).

However, the more emotions I started showing, she seems to be pulling away. I might be invariably emotionally available at start because I genuinely didn't know her well, and she used to swoon on me. 

On maybe a related/unrelated context, she somewhat has been drawn to bad boys. She doesn't smoke, but loves watching me smoke. Since it gives her a badass vibe. So maybe one of the traits of a ""bad boy"" is not showing emotional vulnerability.

I can't force myself to be a ""bad guy"". I beleive in healthy communication and expressing my feelings if I love someone. I do love her and am doubting whether we're fundamentally incompatible or its something which can be worked upon.

I (23F) just moved alone to a new country a month ago and 3 days after I moved I met a guy (27M) in a park,we hanging out with mutual friends. Everything was good, a lot of them went back to our dorm and we had a plan with one friend to make dinner together, but we stayed more, went for a beer, went back to the door with a lime scooter etc. 

We really liked each other and some people noticed that when we went back to our dorm and after that we made an agreement to make dinner in 2 days with one couple from here. Since that dinner I started hanging out with that guy (the first time that we hooked up was a day after that dinner) all the time, we’re going out to clubs, going for walks during the day and night, seeing each other almost every day, we’re watching movies, he’s planning dates like walk around the castle, walk around the park, going on a light festival, he’s also opening up about his family etc and also went on a date with him to one of his restaurants where he always went with his dad or grandma. He’s always hugging me (even hugging me all the time while were sitting in the metro lol),kissing me and smiling when he’s around me( he’s doing all of this everywhere, doesn’t matter if we’re alone or not). 


Also for example, yesterday we had a deal to go for a breakfast, but instead i went to his apartment (he moved out from our dorm and lives with one of his best friends), he made breakfast, we just hung out for a bit and then went to IKEA. He was hugging me ther as well, it was really nice and after a couple of hours we had to split because he already postponed a business meeting because of me and ikea lol (he has a small staryup with his friends) in the evening he came to my place after he was done with soccer and everything was nice. 


However, the problem is that 2 days after the first kiss, we were drunk and he told me something like I really like it that everything is so relaxed with you and idk why but I was like yeah,  it’s to early for a relationship, we can do whatever we want, if we want to hold each others hands we can do that but its early for a relationship and he was like yeah I’m fine with that. But after that we went on those dates, he’s opening up more and more, hanging out with me all the time etc. But he is also traveling back home tomorrow and he’s coming back in 6 days. 


What should I do? Does he like me? I really like him and I didn’t feel like this for years and I would love to be in a realtionship with him but not sure if he wants it and what should I do/say? Please help, I literally can’t sleep.

Let me tell you a bit about my dating history. 

I didn’t have my first date until I was 22 and I only went on four more dates until I met a guy named “Mark” last year. That was first real relationship and it only lasted for five months.  

A few days after I broke up with Mark, I met a recovering alcoholic on Hinge named “Luke” and we became fast friends. I fell so head over heels for Luke that if he had asked me to get him a diamond ring, I would have scoured the ends earth to find one for him!!! I would have done anything for this guy as long as it was legal and safe (and a part of me still would!). But he fell in love with someone else and I nearly had a breakdown over it. And despite everything…..I still keep in touch with him because he is still an amazing friend and an absolute angel.

In August, I formed a bit of an acquitanceship with a coworker named Steve. I took a bit of a shine to him and I recently gave him a note that pretty much said: “Hey, you seem like a cool guy and I would like to get know you better so I was wondering if you would like to go on a date.” I even included my phone number in the note in case he wanted to reach out that way. I still haven’t heard from him. So, I guess it’s safe to assume that he’s not interested. 

I talked to Luke crying about it and asked what it is that I am lacking. He told that he doesn’t think I am lacking anything but i don’t buy it. After all, if that was the case then why did he chose someone else over me?

And you want to know the icing on the cake? That conversation made me realize that I am still in love with Luke and I will probably love him for the rest of my life. You remember that Ariana Grande song, “Off the table” when she said she wasn’t sure if she would love anyone more than Mac Miller. That pretty much sum up my feelings for Luke. 

I am just at my wits end. I miss the physical and emotional intimacy Mark and I shared at the beginning of our relationship and I want so badly to experience that again. I just want to find someone to make me wanted, needed, and like I’m worth a damn. Someone who can make me feel desirable. Someone who loves me as much as Aladdin loves Jasmine.

so the date went great, but like i said after that convo kinda ceased. then i asked her if she wanted to do it again sometime, and she said yes, and i responded with something open-ended and did not receive a response. im trying to respect boundaries here, and learn more about the way different people date, but my past relationships were nothing like this- not that i consider this a relationship- but in the past, even in the ""friend"" phase, my exes and i were texting like every single day. 

so, im wondering, is it normal now to not really talk in between dates? i dont want to force a conversation, its just that i was taught to maintain a conversation, so i dont want her to think that im not interested, but i also dont want to force a conversation if she's not really a person to text, or text in between dates. is this something i should expect now, dating in 2021, that not everyone likes to text every day?

Not one day in my life. I am posting this because of the person I am and a needs be of a hidden identity. My past is kind of dark and my viewpoint of life is incredibly esoteric and maybe even almost a kind of depth and darkness I think only a very special woman could handle. But at the same time, a kind of light. 

Imagine a man who is beautiful to behold almost like that of an angel. He is beautiful and mysterious, think a man like the Cheshire Cat. I can speak poetry with my lips and I can speak quickly and deeply like the devil himself. I have a kind of charm about me that to say the least is almost, spiritual. If you can think of the Phantom of the Opera, It is me in some regards. I sing also. I am a man who is totally in love with life, to a very specific channeling of worshipping the universe in a way that is mystic. I am a loner and a zeitgeist. A hidden king and a hidden prince. I am unlike any person you will meet. I am realizing that my love and sex and lust are not capable of being expressed with any simple woman. My depth of personality, my nature, my darkness needs to be with someone who is as of the same mystique. I am like a man who is of the same sort as both the devil and Christ in some regards. But I don't want to be. It was who I was created as. Who I am becoming. I have studied Christianity, the occult, and psychology deeply. I love Carl Jung and I love the aspects of spirituality that are real. Meaning and saying, I have the same experiences in the mind as mystics from generations past. I am actually speaking rationally, and have done a great deal of research on these topics and what kind of people experience it. I am a writer like Walt Whitman, and he himself was mystical in his understanding of the world.

We are the same and not. I want to meet a woman who can handle me. In the darkness of the whole of my inner self and demon, but also the goodness of myself and the goodness that I am. Someone I can be totally naked with. I want to meet a woman who is not only driven, but incredibly toxic perhaps. Someone who has ambition, someone who is wicked. But someone who is for me. 

I don't know if the right word is wicked. But I guess we'll see. 

I don't know if you're out there. If anyone exists that is as I am. I am darkness and light. I am both mystical and handsome. Masculine and feminine. I want to understand this side of me wholly. 

I don't know if any woman is really capable of knowing me truly. Or know this side of me actually and being able to handle it. Someone who can take me to a different place. Someone I can disappear into hell with. Someone I can be alone with. Someone who can be with me through both hell and heaven. 

Darkness and light. I am the hidden man. The hidden creature in the day and the night. 

I am something else. I just want her to manifest in my life. Someone like I am.

I haven't really been in a relatinoship since I was 22, when I got dumped after a 5 year relationship. I've dated many women since then and haven't had any feelings for them. Until recently.

We hang out or talk a lot, and the chemistry in person is amazing. I haven't had feelings for someone like this since my ex. But she doesn't want to be exclusive yet to take things slow. She's told me she isn't seeing anyone else though because she has such strong feelings for me. I'm not sure why but I feel just a lot of anxiety towards this situation.

I have tried updating/reinstalling/new phone, but same.

I have even put my name in my profile, and I have even tried tracking down ppl on Facebook and Instagram and sometimes to save myself wasting more time/alienation, I'll express that I don't want to be rude/bother but would be nice if could see if u got my like, and it's AlwayS just as if I'm simply not there, like the message/friend request doesn't get through!

It makes things worse cuz I never been on a date or had a gf, I moved some years back, so I don't have Any friends or social life, work doesn't have ppl I can make friends with, family isn't as close/affectionate as me or would like to be and some are not right and very rude , so I get disconnected and lonely and feel in my head all the time.

I've been seeing this man for about two months (first date was mid August). Immediate connection, we really enjoyed each others' company and as time has gone on all my minimum needs were met (honesty, respect, effort, and communication) and he's shown he has above and beyond qualities as well for me to take him seriously (shared goals/values, chemistry, and I enjoy being around him more than being alone). He initiated the conversation of exclusivity with me several weeks in, that he wanted to only see me - that he wanted to keep me around and wasn't dating anyone else, and he asked if I wanted to keep my options open. I told him no, I only wanted to see him as well.

The communication has been easy, open, direct, and honest. I have never wondered how he felt about me. He's been quite clear. The problem is that we're both fairly busy. We both work out, both have full time jobs, my schedule is often opposite of his as I typically work 4P-12AM and he's typically 9A-4PM, and he also teaches classes/attends meetings after he gets off work. Additionally he goes to see his family an hour and a half away most weekends. We have been going to work out at the same classes on weekdays to at least see each other for a few minutes most days but spending extended time together has been very limited. He usually tries to see me once a week and for a while he would stay up late to have me stay over when I worked late shifts. This tapered off because we were both so exhausted the next day so now when my schedule is 8A-4PM (rare and inconsistent) or on one of my off days (which are typically a weekday) he'll try to see me for dinner in the evening whatever day or days those are. But planning ahead more than a week is hard for us due to the nature of our work schedules. 

The fact that he's trying to work around our schedules to see me at all and that he's taking me into consideration speaks volumes. He's got a lot of people who he loves and who love him in his life, and he's extremely involved in community affairs. He mentioned the last evening we were only able to spend a few hours together that we need to do it more often, and I pointed out in order for us to make that happen, we'd need to adapt something as all of these circumstances are creating barriers. His response was ""well, that's life"". 

So how frequently do you think is reasonable in these early stages to see someone? I want to see him more often, it seems he feels the same way, but I'm just not sure what to do about it. I am absolutely not ready to meet or involve him/myself with family or close friends yet so trying to integrate our time in with other close people when we haven't even done that with each other more completely seems too much right now. I don't feel we know each other well enough, and while I really like him and enjoy our time together/respect/admire him we are just not there yet.

I met a guy a while back during the pandemic who lives in a different country and we started talking. We both didn’t think much of it first but we ended up becoming super into each other. I’ve sent him a lot of things, he’s sent me things. He booked a flight and got a place for a short while (and then moving in with me) and going to stay here for a couple of months. 

I really like him. A lot, hell I could say even love. The problem lies here: I am so insecure with my weight. I got injured and was bed ridden for awhile and gained a lot of weight. Currently suffering with the post effects of it. I’d say I gained a good 40 pounds. I told him I gained weight, and that I am trying to fix it. I also have sent explicit pics so he has seen my body. But he’s seen the angles I’ve wanted him to see. He told me he will help me stay on a routine and stuff when he’s here. He isn’t skinny per say, he is on the heavier end ish. He said he needs to lose weight as well. He knows I’ve gained weight, I’ve told him I have. But I’m so scared I’ll meet him in person and he will be so Unattracted to me. Or he will think I catfish him or something? He told me his ex was ‘big’ one time we were talking, so idk if that is any reassurance. I’m scared. And Im scared to the point where I really wanna fucking flake.

Now, I was pretty close friends w her and I did like her personality and she looked decent, so I would have been open to dating her. She’s today graduated and we talk occasionally. However, if she had been nervous, as demonstrated by this, “H-hey do-do y-you li-like me?”, then that’s a good sign. You know how when you see a girl who makes your jaw drop, you’re nervous as fuck and can’t find the words to say to her. Well, girls are the exact same way. So basically, if the girl is nervously asking you, touching her hair, asking you close up, that means she does like you. Now, if you actually like this girl, then say yes.

I said ok and left it. I called once more.. no response. I sent him a nasty text after this and said “if you don’t want to talk anymore, just say it- ignoring is so immature.

He and I got along really well, and we spent multiple days for several hours at a time just talking to each other. Within a couple of days, I caught feelings for him, and I could sort of tell that he liked me too.

The night before he was going to leave, we met other people our age at a bar. While we were all at the bar together, I was drinking a bit. I had to go sit down on a couch, and one of the guys we just met was flirting with me whilst I was drunk. I left early because I had too much to drink. The guy that was flirting with me was talking about how he wanted to get with me. The guy I had been talking to got mad about how the other guy wanted to sleep with me, and he told them that he liked me. I know now that he just said that because he liked me and didn't want me hooking up with anyone else.

The next morning, everyone told me what he said. I was so happy and excited. I already had the feeling that he liked me, but that just confirmed it. Before he left, I asked him if he liked me, and he told me that he had a girlfriend. Later on, he got mad at the people who told me (I didn't tell him they told me, but he must've figured out that they did) because he didn't want me to know. I spoke to everyone about him having a girlfriend, and they were shocked. He never bought her up around them, either.

I was disappointed that he had a girlfriend, but I figured we could still be friends at least. I requested to follow him on social media, and he left the request pending for about two weeks before rejecting it. I got upset and I blocked him for a couple of days. I wanted to express my anger to him, and since I couldn't even talk it out with him, blocking him was the only thing I thought of.

It's been several months now, and we're still not in contact. I found out that he broke up with his girlfriend two months after he and I met. I still talk to the other people from time to time, and they told me that he said that when he was with his girlfriend, all he could think about was me. Whenever I post an Instagram story or TikTok (both public accounts), he'll rewatch them multiple times, and he's always the first to watch them, so I know he looks at my accounts regularly.

Tl;dr - guy I met on vacation got angry with another guy flirting with me and told everyone that he liked me. Turns out, he had a girlfriend the whole time.

Not heart broken but I’m just very curious.. any theories behind it? 

I’m a 28 M and she 22 F.

To summarize.. My best friend’s girlfriend’s friend and I met at a party. We talked for a couple hours, hit it off. I had her laughing a lot. It was smooth and she was giving me signals. So I asked her out. She shot me down. A week later, she reached out to me on Instagram. With a very different tune. It was strange, but I said why not — She asked me out, I said yes. She ended up rescheduling, no big deal, I’m laid-back. I didn’t push it.. I said whenever we’re both free.. let’s grab a drink. We got together that weekend.. went out for a drink. We went back to my place and had sex for a while. Then grabbed another drink. Came back to my place where I tried to convince her not to drive home drunk at 5am. She eventually sobered up and left. 

We had a great time, we were laughing and enjoying each other‘s company. Spent about 12 hours together that day/night. She went home.. and the next day she came back over and we hung out for a while I was working from home. She had to take a cosmetology exam, and she thought it was the next day, turns out it was that very day so she rushed out to take it. 

The next day she hit me up and we were voice text messaging back-and-forth and then out of nowhere she stopped and ghosted me. I cannot think of a reason as to why she ghosted me. 

I didn’t over pursue. She would send me like five text messages for every one text message I sent. In the four or five days that we were talking, she was calling me constantly. 

I’m just a bit weirded out. Like, I’ve never seen a woman go from hot to cold so quickly. There were a lot of red flags from her. Too much to type lol. 

The day that she ghosted me she hit me up apologizing for falling asleep on me, in a very casual, light hearted way. I eventually responded to one of her messages asking how her test went. Then out of nowhere she unfollowed me on Instagram and never texted back. 

I texted her something like, “I was busy today, couldn’t text, good night.” Thought maybe the voice message wasn’t viewed. Sometimes I don’t view them and they’re erased. It was silly thinking, I know. I thought maybe it was a shit test.. so I waited like six hours. I never double text, and that’s the first time I’ve done that in years. That was two weeks ago, and I haven’t called, texted, nor reached out in anyway. I cut off all contact because I’m not going to chase. I unfollowed her on Instagram, as well. 

Admittedly, I do tend to over think things, and I went over the situation in my head a lot of times, and can’t think of one thing I did to ruin a potential relationship or fling. I know I probably won’t ever get a true answer on what specifically happened, but I figured I’d put it out there and see what people thought of the situation. I’ve moved on, started dating again. But I’m still curious lol.. she was a cool chick.

She also lives in the same dorm as I do. So sometimes I see her in the elevator with her friends. But this is when the strangest thing happens. 

She never makes eye contact with me and goes super silent and mainly looks in her friends directions and or the floor.

Most other girls I went for have at-least acknowledged me with a hey, eye contact and a smile. 

But she doesn’t even acknowledge me. I might as well have not ever been in the elevator. 

The first time this happened I thought nothing of it and I started talking to her. When she starts talking she doesn’t even  give me the best eye contact. But she is giving me long responses with her own personal input. And when the elevator reaches the floor she bolts out with  friends. This has happened twice now. I’m simply at a loss. 

I have 2 hypotheses. 
1. She is super shy and insecure 
2. She in fact did not find my jokes funny and or our first few interactions as fun and is trying her best to avoid me.

At the end of July I (23F) had been planning to move across the country to live with my dad. Also at the time I had recently had a falling out with my two best friends not to my fault. It was a terrible situation.

Cut to me joining Bumble to meet new people and meeting (M23) we’ll call him Joe. I wasn’t expecting anything long-term with me expectantly moving. For the next two weeks me and Joe would hang out very frequently going on dates and the like. My previous relationship ended in February of the same year, we had been dating on and off since high school.

I really enjoy spending time with Joe, more than I expected, and he is a complete gentleman paying for dates without me asking and being very affectionate and overall a kind person. We didn’t kiss until the second or third date I can’t remember. What I do remember is his respect for me and being a seemingly overall great guy.

Unfortunately a death in the family happened as well as the move falling through with my semi-toxic father, for the better. Suffice to say i had a lot going on as well as needing to find new housing. I had a let him know my new situation and after a while there is a period of silence and no contact. 

However since then we’ve been seeing each other very on and off. He would go quiet awhile without texting me and then we’d hang out and everything would being fine. We both work very different schedules, him often working the graveyard shift so I am trying to keep that in mind. We get along great and the chemistry is definitely there, I don’t think I’m making up in my head.

The times when we have hung out it’s always fun. Good conversation and great sexual chemistry. I really like being around him. But the lack of communication is getting to me… 

The last time we hooked up he didn’t text me for more than a few days so I sent him a message detailing how I value communication and if he’s not into to me anymore it’s totally fine, just to lmk and I hope he’s doing well. I only sent this message because previously had been so bad at communication I wanted to make my stance clear that it is something I value more now.

That was probably a week and half ago and I woke up this morning to a text from him…

“I’m sorry, I was going to respond the same day, but I ended up forgetting. I’ve been meaning to text you but every time I see and notice how long it’s been I feel guilty and embarrassed for even not responding. I’m doing alright. I started working out a little at planet fitnesses. I hope you’ve been doing well, I’m going to try to see you Asap.
Hope you’ve been safe too (:”

I feel so lost on what to think about this because it seems like we were getting close and we have hung out quite a few times now, I really do like him I thought he liked me too. 

What I’m most scared of is just being a back up that he only calls when he wants a quickie. But I consider myself a good judge of character and he has been very kind and not love bombing in anyway and not being super distant. I ponder he may just be bad communication. When we’ve hung out it’s never been straight to sex, there’s definitely foreplay (mental/physical) and I really just enjoy spending time together.

So this texting continued for months. I always liked him and hinted at meeting up, but didn’t blatantly ask him out on a date because I already had asked him out twice and it never really went past the first date. Obviously this was seven years ago before we went our separate ways. This time, I thought that if he was interested, he would ask me out. 

Anyway, I hinted at meeting up and flirted with him multiple times. He also hinted at meeting up and seemed quite interested. Our conversations are long and deep and we get quite intimate, although nothing sexual. So months into this back and forth texting, he asks me if I wanted to go to California with him. I was surprised but we had been talking about how we both had been planning to travel to California and how covid had thwarted our plans, so it wasn’t too out of the blue. I tentatively agreed and said maybe we could plan our trip at the same time and meet up with each other there. However, here is where the major problem starts. He basically starts saying that he’s scared of Covid and doesn’t feel comfortable travelling on a plane, or even going outside. He wanted to get a private plane across the border (we live in Canada) and then rent a whole bus to drive us all the way to California. He also says that he won’t leave the hotel and just step out for only a bit once we get to California. He’s not even comfortable going out to eat. 

So obviously this is all so weird to me and I kinda back off in a nice way. He leaves it and we just continue talking like before. But he keeps asking and wanting to make a plan. I keep telling him I’d be okay going with him if we travel by plane. I even suggested he could travel the way he wanted and I could just meet him at the destination. But he wants to make sure we are both socially distanced the whole way and wouldn’t meet me if I have been inside a plane. Every time I try to meet him half way and try to figure out how we could possibly on this vacation, he keeps complicating things. If he’s just messing with me, it doesn’t make sense because he keeps wanting to chat and talk to me.

Very weird. Now I don’t get this guy. What is he trying to do? For details, he’s a bit socially awkward and nerdy and works in IT.

I don’t get this guy. Is he playing me? Is he scared to meet up with me and thinks he needs to use this trip as a hook to keep me interested? Is it a test?

Now he's suddenly gone cold and quite abruptly told me the next two weeks are too busy with work for him to contact me. I feel really confused and can't tell if I'm overthinking things or if I'm reading things correctly by thinking he's not interested and starting to ghost me... I understand that people get busy , and I'd be happy to give him some space, I just feel confused that he didn't indicate anything about when he would next reach out, or that he's looking forward to seeing me again... instead he just said ""yeah, I'm really busy the next two weeks so won't be on my phone"". 

I'd normally text and just ask if he's keen or not so I can move on, but now I feel awkward about that because he's flagged that he's just ""so busy"", so I feel almost like I'm bothering him and maybe I should just wait the two weeks to see what happens...

1. She always says hi when I see her in the hall
2. Comments on my cologne (good), but then again, multiple people do.
3. She laughs at my jokes even when not funny, but so do some other people on bus.
4. 2 days ago in an inter grade class I walked in and she said you can sit next to me if you want Jason, it was also in a funny jokingly kind of way, but it wasn’t fully a joke I could tell.

There’s more, but that’s it, and I can’t really tell.

This is based on being assaulted by someone 20+ years my elder. However idk what to think, I’d never pursue anything on my end. I’m just looking to be told that the age gap is too much and i need to grow tf up. 

I would never traditionally date someone so much younger. Just based on what I know about mental maturity before the age of 25. But we vibe so well, and I’m struggling with this crush.

I don’t want anything at the time with my coworker, but for the most part I just feel sick to my stomach. What is wrong with me? The person, the man who assaulted me, was over 20 years my senior, I was 20 years old at the time.

I carry a lot of guilt and shame about the assault. And the thought of dating someone younger just reminds me of it. Whether or not they are mature and interested in me.
