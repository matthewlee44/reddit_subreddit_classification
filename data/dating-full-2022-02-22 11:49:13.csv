I'm 21M, Australian university student with a great job and interesting hobbies/ social life. 

I've been in pursuit of a relationship since mid last year, 
I just can't seem to get any girls/guys on an honest date or even a hook-up

I'd be fine with that but genuinely everytime I go out/clubbing, different people express their surprise I'm not going home with someone. 

Moreso, I've had compliments on my attractiveness come up for the first time in my life, I don't think I'm approached in that kind of way yet but it's not something I've ever experienced. 

Even more confusing (and a little off topic), I've recently introduced my ex-partners to some new close friends. My friends almost always say I'm way out of their league and stuff like that but I genuinely don't believe that either

The flattery is nice and all but i can't translate any of this into results? I'm a confident guy so I'm not afraid to shot my shot where appropriate; women I meet around town/ mutual friends I'm interested in and other interests/ opportunities. 
Unfortunately, everytime I've been turned down! (10+ times)

Generally people are nice about it and express their unavailability/ situation but I can easily detect if and when they simply aren't interested in that way. 

I'm not sure what to think sometimes, I'm diagnosed ADHD and have been exposed to childhood trauma which I understand makes my self-image and hence my impression a little different but I'm not convinced I could be doing so much wrong! 

It's very emotionally exhausting re-assuring yourself with this all on mind. I think a couple more months and I'll be dropping the pursuit to recharge!

I'm just wondering if anyone has some interesting thoughts or even personal experiences to share?

We decided to just be friends. We were discussing hooking up, but that fizzled out after a while as well due to reasons.

We kind of went our seperate ways after a bit, but hit back up about a month ago. We videocalled a few times, and she started getting overly sexual during those calls which I engaged with. She has said multiple times that she is attracted to me and that I'm totally her type.
I asked if she wanted to hook up and between the lines she said she would like to for valentinesday. I tried setting something up, but everytime she came with an excuse why she may not be available. After which she kinda just didn't respond to me for a week, so I was wondering if I messed up.

Another annoying point about her is that she doesn't respond quickly, and once she responds she immidiately goes offline so I can never have any proper text conversations with her. And the rare text conversations we have just end with her randomly not replying anymore.

She also likes to talk about her own things a lot, but rarely asks me about anything I'm doing. I also see her doing this with other people, so this is not exclusive to me.

These problems are only present in our text 'conversations' as we vibe quite well during discord calls. But setting up such a discord call is a hassle in itself, and it's always me chasing her if she wants to talk or not.

Yesterday we were 'talking' via text and she proudly announced that she was meeting someone from a discord server and it kinda hurt me. Obviously she may meet whoever she wants, we're just friends, so I don't really care. But seeing her being enthousiastic about meeting him kinda makes me wonder why she was never that enthousiastic about me. 
I also get weird creepy vibes from that dude, and I'm honestly kinda worried about her seeing him as they just met online less than a week ago, but that's none of my business to decide of course.

Idk if they're meeting as friends or sexually, but it hurts either way as she was never that eager to meet with me. So to just be blatantly enthousiastic to me about that just kinda angers me. 

I'll probably just end the 'friendship' here, as having to chase everytime is not good for my mental health. 

Wondering if I should just leave it there and 'ghost' her. Or if I should give her an explanation of all the ways she has hurt me over the past months. 
As I'm not even sure she herself is aware that she deeply hurt me with the way she handled talking to me and basically stringing me along for months.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1160650,public,self,Feel like I've kinda been used by this girl,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/symdzq/feel_like_ive_kinda_been_used_by_this_girl/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,

We met on tinder beginning of January, went on our first date 17th January and didn’t hookup until the 26th. Slept together a few times after that. Last time we did it was on the 5th February.

After the second date on the 6th he didn’t invite me back to his but dropped me off at mine and went home saying he’s tired. But then said how he’s pleasing himself with his hand. His reason for this is because he’s working 7am -10pm everyday for a bit.

Wanted to go his to hookup before I left to go to my home town for the valentines weekend-which lasted 12 days due to my depression and didn’t want to leave the empty house I was at. 

Originally he was up for it but was tired and cancelled 3 nights in a row. I went to my home town. He was suppose to come for a night on the weekend but said he’s in - 20£ so can’t come anymore. The bus to see me would have costed him 16£ and rest would be on me as the house I was at was in a small village and I have a car and my own money and said you get to me and rest is my treat.

He did send me a Vday gift which I’m happy by/flattered. 

The weekend just gone, I’m still away in the empty house. He went away for a weekend with his friend where he spent a good amount. 

I was speaking to my girlfriends 26f both about him because I was excited that I met this guy I’m getting on with but when I mentioned the above, they were hearing red flags. 

My older 40m friend spoke to me how the red flags are not really red flags because of his job it is understandable and he’s not making much money and because I’ve been clingy, annoying and full on I potentially have scared him off a bit and why he didn’t want to visit me when I was away but likes me and why he got me the vday gift. 

Now me and him spoke how he wants to be serious with me so I’m not talking to anyone else anymore and we are both focusing on each other. But that also means I’m not having casual sex anymore. (Last time I did was before we even met anyway). 

It’s nearly 3 weeks since we have been intimate. In a small way, I’m having less sex now that I’m dating him than when i was casual.

We saw each other last night and I’m on my period but I’m still horny and sex can help with the pain. He’s ok with period sex as we’ve done it last month but he went to the gym earlier that day yesterday and said he’s just too tired. 

Things were getting steamy this morning but none of us had a condom. 

I explained to him that I’m struggling here as I don’t want to be in a sexless situationship/relationship. He also said relationships are not all about sex, which I know but I explained to him that with all that being true I also love sex and want to enjoy it with him/the person I’m with and 3 weeks is just too long at this point for me. 

Last week we also said we will have a meet up on Thursday (this week) but this morning when I mentioned it to double check he said he forgot and is going with his housemates to the pub. Said I can come by after. 

I don’t know. We both like each other and both see we have things to work on but I don’t know if maybe he’s just not as horny as me.

I asked him this morning how often do you like to have sex and he said when he feels like it but didn’t said the amount that would be good for him in a week. Where I said everyday 5x a day would be perfect (a bit extra but everyday to 4-6x a week is good for me) I also can’t get it out of my head if we are starting off how are we not doing it more?

First off I'm not a dr.  And I don't know exactly how these things work, but I think you need a blood test for diagnosis ing that.  He called me and I reassured him that he was not that but I would get a STI test.

We  met online last summer, and dated until mid October. Long story short,  she was only a few weeks out of a relationship, and got to a point where  she couldn't resist mentioning her ex bf's every hour. I was a few  months out of a relationship and was dealing with issues of my own. We  agreed to call it quits. She kept in touch every now and then texting  me. In January one of her texts turned in to a week long discussion.  Then in early February, she asked me if I would try dating again. (im 32  shes 30)

I  told her I was apprehensive about the idea, and said we could try  talking more frequently and see how it goes. It's gone well, no ex talk,  and she is coming to my place this Saturday.

During  the ""talking"" phase I feel like she was constantly blowing up my phone  while I sort of wasn't. She kept apologizing for blowing up my phone,  and I said it was fine. About a week ago she asked why it was taking so  long for me to respond, and if that meant I didn't want to see her. I  reassured her that I was just busy, and have really enjoyed talking to  her, and want to see her again. But the past couple days, idk. Maybe  she's just busy but now it feels like I'm doing all the heavy lifting.  She was hot/cold the first time and idk if that's happening again. Like,  she only wants me when she can't have me. But when I'm there she  doesn't want it anymore. Our most recent text conversation was like,

Her: So what are you up to this week?

Me: Plans to meet up with friends, maybe going to the casino, and seeing you. Do you have a break from work yet? hbu?

Her: No I work until Friday. I have friend plans and backup friend plans.

Me: Oof, sucks to be the backup friend 😄. And damn you work a lot. You need a nice fun weekend

Her: Haha yea, it's more of a backup plan than backup friend. and ha thanks

Since I've known her, about 8 months, she's had a roommate. Not because she needs the money, she does quite well, but because she has a big heart. The roommate is around our age and a recovering drug addict. She's sober and working but far from financially stable.

As I understand it, she originally paid rent but has since stopped and now contributes nothing to the household. 

On top of that, in my opinion she's rude, disrespectful, and frankly I don't like her lol. 

There's an endless list of annoyances that have been shared with me, such as drinking all of my gf's expensive liquor on her own (she does drink, doesn't use drugs), using and breaking decorative glasses she was told aren't for every day use, drinking wine that she was told was a collectors edition and not for drinking or at least certainly not by her. 

Her dog chews up a lot of stuff, it destroyed the Christmas gift I had given my gf. She doesn't do any household chores she's asked to do, and repeatedly does things she's been asked not to do. 

To top it off, this morning at 5am (she works early) she came into my gf's bedroom where we were both asleep naked to use the bathroom and shower. There's another one she's supposed to use. Literally immediately before she came in without knocking I had been up and in the bathroom naked with the light off, then walking of course back to bed.

I hate to be this way, but it just feels like something I don't want to deal with anymore. The lack of boundaries is grating and I feel kind of over it. Considering she has no money or ability to manage it (and she currently lives in a nice house with free food and lodging and utilities etc) her move out date is TBD and likely not any time soon. 

To me, she's using my gf. She's abusing her good nature and taking advantage, and being incredibly disrespectful along the way. 

She's recently regained custody of her teenage daughter and may be moving her in as well. 

I feel like if we can't move on at some point in the semi near future and set some serious boundaries or end this dynamic I may have to end things. We're both adults with good jobs, not kids in college.

20F here, i have a wonderful bf of 4 months that I truly care for and adore. We’ve gotten very close these past few months and it’s going great. 

He, however, has a “friend” that he’s known since like September that I’m acquaintances with, let’s call her Mary, About a month before we started dating Mary and my BF had several long talks about some issues that Mary is going through, which I don’t know about because I’m not close with Mary. After we started dating Mary and my BF kinda fell out of contact and only texted each other once in a blue moon. They went on a semi-date before we started dating but she made it clear to him that she wasn’t interested. 

Recently however, we were grocery shopping and I had to get my wallet from the car. I saw Mary’s car in the parking lot and my bf said he ran into her while I was gone. Mary asked my bf if they could catch up for drinks one-on-one but she wanted him to text her to remind her because of her busy schedule. My bf thinks that by her appearance and the way she was talking Mary is going through some stuff, and he wants to talk with her at drinks without me there. 

I don’t know if this is normal but I find it kind of weird that he’s trying to be her emotional support, especially since she’s terrible at reaching out to him and has kind of blown him off in the past. He also kind of mentions her frequently in convos. I honestly do trust him but I think he’s a little naive. I know that he’s opened up to her in the past too and I’m worried that he might be more open with her than he will be with me. 

What should I do? I told him I wasn’t sure about drinks and that it upset me but coffee with her alone might be okay, i don’t want to limit his social circle esp since he’s kind of lonely at the moment but I don’t feel 100% comfortable with him going out with an ex-crush, esp since they were super close just shared some private stuff since they felt comfortable with each other.

I need to plan a date for a guy I'm taking out (eventually)..  I'm more of a shy person, although I can be outgoing/surprising. I'm learning to put myself out there more. The whole social dynamics/standards of men taking out the women first is cute but very stereotypical and gender straining. I'd love to show him a good time but I'm wondering If I should base the date on what I like, what he likes, or both. 

For me, I don't like movies as a date, house dates, picnics, or dates such as (Stadium, beach, club). I like to have fun while having a few quiet moments. My preferred date is maybe he picks me up around 12pm, we spend the first few hours just breaking the ice at a nice but not too formal food place (both pay equally), Around like 2 pm our tickets are ready for some fun (maybe a festival, outdoor party, fair), when it's like 6:30 pm we start heading to a more quiet place like (casual drinks, sightseeing, waterfront, lake area, such public yet secluded places). Just places where you can walk and talk. I like to have active fun thrilling dates where you aren't just stagnant the whole time. Probably buy a few plushies or gift shop items there, or win one in a game. Then after the walk, we might share a few close touchy moments of kisses there. Before we head to the car for a late music-filled drive (nothing sexual- never on the first date for me). Driving we arrive at one of his favorite spots or my favorite spots (A secret place we enjoy spending time like a mountain view area). And end it with a kiss before dropping me home. (Yes it might sound stereotypical, so judge if you wish. But I feel this is more of an adventurous, while chill date that I would enjoy)

For him he seems to enjoy dates that are mind-challenging like a chess tournament, or going to a museum tour, sightseeing, bungee jumping, rock climbing, painting each other, video game arcade, laser tag, contests, and end with something calming while amusing. And food somewhere in there. I won't give too much info or hints on his end since he has his own view. 

What do you think his dream date would be with our dynamics (He likes doing things that I enjoy as well because he feels if I don't enjoy the date he doesn't either)? What would you say is a desirable date for a man? (I'm aware this is a subjective question, but it still gives a perspective)

And if we were to somehow end up at his house (Like say we're too tired to drive to my house and his place is closer), do you think cuddling is allowed for a first date, or is that sure to lead to something else?",False,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1160690,public,nsfw,I'm taking the man of my dreams out soon..,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/syqz6n/im_taking_the_man_of_my_dreams_out_soon/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,

After I told him about a guy that sort of screwed me over (cancelled a movie date last minute to see Scream), he comforted me, offered to see the movie with me, and even said ""wow, I didn't think I'd be jealous of a random guy"". I asked him why he would be jealous, and he revealed that he's had a massive crush on me. I had a crush on him too, but I assumed because he was older, he would never be interested in me for dating since people assume girls in their early 20s aren't looking/ready for steady dating.

We're exclusively dating now, and he's the best guy I've ever dated. We spent time on Valentine's Day together, and took photos together as a couple. When we were friends, I told him that I didn't really date often because I'm not really into the whole ""having sex by three dates"" things, and it made me nervous that a lot of people go by that standard, because I knew any guy I would try to date would expect that from me. He knew this, and I thought this would turn him off. But ever since we started dating, we haven't talked about having sex or anything. We're both essentially demisexuals, but he has let it slip once that the dress I wore on Valentine's Day was sexy. It's been a month since we've been dating, and I feel serene with him. 

I'm just scared that it's temporary. He's ready for a serious relationship. He even told me ever since his early twenties, he stopped doing random hookups because they weren't fulfilling for him. He was planning to marry his last girlfriend, but things ended badly with them. She wanted out of the relationship, and he wanted to get back together, but ultimately things just didn't work out. I remember him telling me when we were friends that he went on seven casual dates with different girls from Tinder a few months after they broke up, but he deleted it since everyone wanted to hook up lol. 

It feels so natural with us. We see each other when we can, but when we don't, we either text or call. He's been there for me when I got food poisoning, and I've been there for him when he found out about his dad's terminal illness. I just don't want to get my hopes up that he'll finally come to his senses and realize I'm too young for him. He's never given me any indication that he sees me a casual thing, but I just feel like because of my age, he'll dump me in like the next few months or a year from now. Should I just end things with him now so we both don't get hurt? This way, he could find someone closer to his age and he'll be happy. Maybe we could stay friends.

We have a lot of things in common so i was really  hopeful about dating this girl some day. Then that day came, i was nervous of course, but my excitment was of the roof. She looked pretty in her photos and the chemestry was there so... ;)

We agreed to see in a park not so far away from home, and for her i also close home, so i took the bus and head for the park, when i arrived she told me she was know the part of the park i was so he would came for me, i was sooo nervous but then again, excited. Saddly everything collapsed in front of me when the girl came, i was in shock, confused and a little angry at the same time, the girl was very overweigh, and her face was not exactly has in the photos, and i think you noticed my shock aswell, eventhough i tried to hide it.

The thing was that her photos weren't edited or anything but in everyone of them you could see only her face, and with the best light possible, never showing her body. As i see it, if you hide your body or any other feature on porpuse, you're flat-out lying and scaming people. You could say""well it's your fault since it was you who assumed she wasn't fat"", but how could i know? you shouldn't hide that specially in an app which big time superficial as Tinder, and then let me think i'm a monster for being ""superficial"", like... you're doing people dirty if you do that.

Back to the date, since i didn't want to be disrespectful i proceed as planned, we sat down next to some tree, talk for a good time about everything, it was kind of rough but i played it cool, i really didn't want to hurt the girl but i was angry. So, thank god, a drop of water hit my leg, it was the perfect way out, i told her we should return home since it was about to rain, she though the same so we walk towards the closest bus stop and say good bye.

At the end of the day, i was very angry because this girl has the nerves to decieve me, without any remorse and i sincerely till this day don't know what she was trying to pull there. Like, maybe her plan was to compensate with her personality once we met and talked? it wouldn't work since lying is a bad way to start any relationships.

I have gotten to know my colleagues pretty well but have especially developed an interest, feelings, for a woman that is a year older than me; also a shelve stocker.

Since the aisles that we stock are right next to each other we have been talking almost every day about, for example, our shared love of dogs and video games. 

The last two years of my life were pretty hard for me in terms of social interaction. Before COVID hit, I was already in a state of severe loneliness and the pandemic only exaggerated that. My depression got so far that I dropped out of school. Luckily I was aware enough of my situation - that it couldn't go on like this anymore - that I made the decision to go to a mental hospital for six weeks. During that time I made great progress in analyzing this illness and why it had manifested in the first place. After I got out of the hospital I looked for a way to get my degree without having to go back to school and got in touch with an organization that specializes in helping students who are not mentally stable enough for the normal school life and its social systems. 

This was a year ago and I am now a few months away of getting my degree. Because I spend so much time learning by myself and because I want to be financially independent of my mother (at least to an extent) I applied for the already mentioned job as a shelve stocker a couple of miles away from where I live.

I mention all this to illustrate how good it feels to finally have someone to talk to again after having had a pretty lonely stretch of time. 

She and I get along great. As I have already said, we share a lot of the same interests and also have a similar outlook on life in general. We make each other laugh but also have deep conversations about experiences we've had and what we've learned from them. 

Since the beginning of the new year I realized that I had feelings for her. First I thought it was just an affection or a crush even, but after being near her and trying to define exactly what it is that I am feeling, I really do think that it is love. 

Last week she and I left the store together because our shift was over and she talked about how she was going to the park with her dog later. I then asked if I could come with her and she said yes, that I could come to her house and that we could drive to the park together. We ended up having a great time talking and just being out in nature. 

Yesterday I messaged her saying if she ever wanted to walk the dogs together again, she could just ask me. She didn't respond to the message, which I took as a sign of her not being interested in me as a friend or potentially even more. We are co-workers after all, maybe she just doesn't want to enhance that relationship.

(I should say, I don't know her relationship status. She has never mentioned a partner but I have also never asked her directly.)

What I am confused about is the next part: today we walked back from the store together (my train station is on her way home) and the weather came up. She said how happy she was that it was sunny again, how nice it was going to be to walk her dog in the park. 

I don't know if I am maybe too sensitive or too invested in her that I think about everything she says over and over, but if she got my message, and I am quite certain she has, why would she then talk about the thing that I wanted to do with her but not including me in it? Couldn't she have just avoided talking to me about it if she knew that I was interested in doing exactly that? And, even if she is not interested in me, couldn't she have at least texted back something like: 'Sure.' or 'Yeah, okay.'? Why did she bring this topic up if she didn't even answer my message?

She told me that her boyfriend probably won't like it, because he doesn't even like her wearing revealing clothes due to worrying that guy's will stare.

I had a long-term long distance relationship in my late-teens/early 20s that ended with a terrible breakup. I feel like I spent most of my 20s getting over the loss of that relationship and never really tried ""dating"" aside from 1-2 tinder dates that led to nowhere. I've moved countries since, and finally feel like I want this. 

Since I only have one real relationship as a reference, and I fell into it organically - I am really struggling with the world of OLD. 

In the past few months, I've been on multiple first dates, and a few second dates but haven't been able to move ahead of that. Either due to lack of interest or incompatibility. 

There's this guy I'm seeing right now (33M) and we had our 2nd date this weekend. I think I like him and want to really try investing in building something stronger. Most of our conversation has been mostly been in-person, other than 1-2 text exchanges to set up the next date. I'm mostly okay with this kind of communication style as our in-person conversations are quite rich and gives me the old-school feeling of discovering people over the course of time. 

However, the uncertainty of it all is really driving my anxiety and unfortunately led me into a rabbit hole of dating psychology on the internet. Now I feel emotionally exhausted trying to figure out what/how to build healthier relationships and over-analysing every single detail. 

I'm not really in a rush and want to see how it plays out, but the constant struggle of starting from from scratch is really driving me crazy and wanting to give up.

What I meant was that was my DREAM date.. Not a date that would be every day. And of course, that's more down the line, I'm a dreamer as an INFP and I love to make good use of a special date. Life is too short to always be simple, although there is beauty in simplicity. I did not respond to comments because I will not indulge in being conceptualized when you don't even know me or what I'm going through. Yes, doing a lot on a date is asking for much and I agree, which is why that was only to give a concept of the type of dates in the FUTURE that would be most enjoyable so, therefore, you can have an idea of how I decode that into a reasonable first date. 

It's always good to ask questions, before jumping to conclusions ridiculing someone, and assumptions. You don't know me and I don't know you, so kindness is important but that's your choice. This post is for anyone who cares to want to understand more of where I was coming from in my last deleted post requesting advice on date ideas. I could have worded it better, but I was a bit overthinking and giving an overall idea of what would ""woo"" me on a date, not on a first date or every date.

I'm done looking. Not because I no longer believe in love, but what I'm looking for and hoping for doesn't really exist. 

I used to think that love was put there, already manufactured and ready to assemble. I used to think that, the moment I'd recognize this guy, suddenly the sky will open with angels singing and I'd be riding high on rainbows. I used to think that he would be looking for the EXACT SAME THING as I am and hoping he'd recognize me in a magical way.

But now I'm starting to think ... why, after meeting someone with whom I have compatibility, not just go for it? Instead of keeping my eyes peeled for this ""one"", instead we focus on simply getting to know each other and just seeing where it goes?

No one is perfect. There's not a soul on this planet that doesn't have wounds, scars, secrets, baggage, and everything else in between from living life. That's one of the reasons why I scrapped OLD because the premise - other than chemistry over compatibility - is that to catch a perfect person, we must be the perfect person. Crafting the right profile, snapping the right selfie, trying not to reveal too much but just enough in the bio section, sifting through matches with bated breath thinking ""Is this one it?!"" Not saying there aren't any successes from OLD ... they are out there, but they are more the exception than the rule.

I gave up online dating a long time ago, in my experience, everyone on there is single for a reason. Meeting someone in person is just as difficult unless you have a large number of attractive single friends in your network. There is no consensus on what is/isn't appropriate when approaching an attractive stranger in any setting. Some people like it, some people don't. Everyone will interpret the interaction differently, and you can't read a person's mind so it is impossible to know what to say, how to say it, whether it is okay to approach them at all, etc. And it's become clear to me that so many people are incapable of just communicating too. A woman I met at the climbing gym we are both members at ghosted me instead of just communicating that, for whatever reason, she wasn't interested. (I genuinely don't get that. We both go to the same gym regularly, we are bound to run into each other again. I have a stroke every time I think about the logistical gymnastics she performed to think that was the best option. Error 404, cannot compute.  Would have been much easier to just tell me she wasn't interested, because now when we do inevitably run into each other again, it'll just be weird and awkward.) I haven't had any luck talking to people at school, most of the women I find attractive at my university are already taken or too busy for a relationship. Frankly, I'm busy myself and probably don't have enough time for a relationship, but I'm a romantic and there is no switch to turn that part of my brain off. The fact that I'm single and lonely will always take precedence in my mind.

Sorry for the long rant here, the last paragraph is my real question, so feel free to skip.

Not saying that people here don't date or it doesn't happen, but dating somebody when you're young is considered some kind of taboo around here. Even though a lot of boys and girls do have a dating life, it involves a lot of sneaking around, a lot of lying to parents, lot of protocols. Even meeting girls is hard, you aren't supposed to cold approach anyone, if people see you talking to a girl, even if she's a friend, they give weird stares, especially middle-aged people are harsh and judgemental towards young couples. Dating apps are filled to the brim with horny creepy dudes, catfish accounts of women, and bots. The only decent app available is Tinder. Bumble, Hinge, and other apps aren't available here and all those southeast Asian apps are filled with scammers. A really popular way to find girls is Instagram and Facebook, just following girls and if they accept your follow request (most don't), just messaging them about something and straight-up asking them into a relationship without any dates or a few dates. All my friends met their love interests on Instagram, one of them just randomly followed hundreds of women and DM-ing them and somehow found his girlfriend, they've been together for 2 years. And I believe it's ten times harder for women.

Then it comes to nerdy, introvert me with really different tastes and a very different view of life, well that's just the cherry on top. I'm also an atheist, which could get me killed if I'm too vocal about it. I'm also bisexual which is also a direct death sentence of sorts. I could try and follow people on Instagram or even be an extremely bold person and try approaching random girls in public and risk getting beat up, but I don't want all the sneaking and lying and all this bullshit. I just want to have fun, go on dates, have nice conversations, do fun stuff, watch films together, and things like that, without being shamed or harassed for it. I look like your average Indian dude, brown skin, 5'7, 152 lbs (not fat but not muscular either). I am not a very handsome fella, just average. I might be wrong about the dating scene here, so please enlighten me if someone has any advice. 

I want to leave this country and move to the west, mainly Canada or the UK, the second choice is probably the US, then probably France or Germany (I'm learning French so it might be cool). I know I'm not going to be everyone's cup of tea, but frankly speaking, after reading some internet dating sites and threads, I feel like I'll be crushed in there. I mean height preference is here as well, but I've never seen it being a straight-up dealbreaker like I see in there, also south Asian dudes have pretty rough stereotypes attached to them, so I have two uncontrollable things killing a lot of my chance. Now I don't want to move there only for dating, but it's still a major part of it. I don't want to end up alone, but I also don't want to have an arranged marriage and end up with someone I hate. Is it a good idea? If I'm better off staying here, what can I do to increase my chances? And even if I make the move, what can I do?

I have tried it all. All the dating apps, bars, group events, common interests. 

I just don't know what to do anymore. It just makes me feel like I am somehow fundamentally broken or unloveable. That I am just destined to be alone.

I don't hate or resent these people for rejecting me, everyone is entitled to do that. If they don't feel it, I can't fault them. It just feels like being gutted when the date goes well, you have a good time, and then are ghosted or rejected.

I ( f, 24) have met a man (m, 38) online. Right now I am going through such time in life when I’m trying to give no judgement and just experience life, so here I am sharing one of my recent experiences.

Both me and this man work in same industry and pretty successful in it so it was the man topic why we clicked. We live in different cities (3 h away from each other) and firstly we spoke online, had a video call and after it decided to meet with no expectation, just meeting for the weekend. 

It happened this way that this was a person I had very special connection with. We were really on the same wavelength. I am pretty experienced at my age in personal life and have dated people of different ages so I really am not that easy to impress. So we definitely had the connection that is unusual and something you don’t see every day. 

I was planning just to have lunch with him and then for hangout next day maybe but we ended up spending all 48 hours together. We were sharing different life experiences, discussing everything, going sightseeing, then got intimate and it definitely was a great match as well. Even by both of our just body gestures I could say that we both really liked each other. He was being very much a gentleman and super caring. After we had this intimacy he made sure I was really comfortable and it was extremely respectful. We both did discuss some concerns about our age gap as it was unusual for both of us but decided just to try going with the flow. 

Then when he left , he did make a follow up and we both discussed that we really enjoyed company of each other but it was much more intense that we both expected. However, that we both enjoyed the experience and thanked each other. And since that day (Sunday, when we came back to his city) and we said bye bye to each other already via message and having discussed the weekend, he never messaged. So it’s like 2 days. Even though by how it was going I was pretty much sure we’d start communicating and plan a second meeting to see how it goes further. 

I mean, to be completely candid I am a bit shocked by myself and how much I liked the guy as well, so it feels like maybe both of us need a bit of time to proceed with what happened. However, it also makes me feel that maybe he’s withdrawing now? What do you think is that? Like I don’t really understanding why he would not message for 2 days.
