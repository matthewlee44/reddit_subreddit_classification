I am a straight male, so my bias in this post is toward women because that’s who I date. I don’t intend to generalize with this point or to imply that men don’t do this. If you respond, please speak to your experience. 

I am in my late 20s and use dating apps. I work aggressively on bettering myself and have a lot of hobbies. I am also a physician, and my time does not grow on trees. The free time I do have is split between activities that give me peace, like boxing, basketball, movies, etc. Like many people, I’m picky, and if I make a plan to meet someone, I always treat and court them because that means I’m pretty excited to meet them. For example, I have no problem moving a boxing session or cancelling it if it means I might meet my soulmate. Duh. But nothing is more annoying than being told by those people the day of (or an hour before) that they need to cancel or reschedule. The time that I cleared for them is now in total limbo and now I have to think about how (or if) I’m going to move my schedule to see them again. 

One of my female friends told me this happens often when a woman is tired, not feeling like she looks or is her best self, is too nervous, or some other things. I heard this from some women I’ve dated more extensively too. 

I’m not sure if that’s true or just a couple people’s experience, but this really has to stop. Folks are making time to meet (and treat!) you. If you aren’t interested, please let them know and stop dating them. If you are interested but need to reschedule, that’s fine cause life happens - please let them know before the day of. It’s irritating to make time and bring the energy to show someone a good time and court them, but to be bounced aside at the last minute like trash.

I have moderate depression and social anxiety. I’ve told my date I have social anxiety already before the first date. So he could understand why I was a nervous wreck.

I don’t want people to define me because of my mental health state. I’m okay functional and some days are harder than others. I take SSRI for my anxiety and depression. But I can’t hide it good when I feel worse because I start to dissociate, space out and talk slow. I have professional help. 

Right now I’m having my internship and also writing my bachelor thesis. I’m also job searching on the side and going to interviews. So I have a lot going on during my days but I stick to my routines I have and take one day at a time. But I’m starting to worry if I get in one of my bad states, he would notice something isn’t right because I’ve noticed he pick up my body language quite fast. He do it better than my friends or family even do. Which just makes me worry because I know a few can have a stigma against mental health.

Like I'm so sick of the ones in the younger crowd(early 20s to early 30s). From my experience they're mostly IG Disney princesses with a huge ego who are still figuring themselves out. All what they seem to care about is instability and noise because it's fun to them ... and that's all what matters to them. From my experience, they're not really long term relationship material and aren't willing to settle down. They're just looking for an entertainer with a greater banter who will show them the world. Very immature ... I don't really want to babysit someone pretty much ... And to me someone like that who doesn't know what they want is so unattractive ...

So I was wondering. Older ladies seem more mature and have their lives figured out. Like they seem more willing to use dating services and stuff. So put themselves out there rather than wait for a guy to approach them IRL. Any guys could comment on if they have the same insane standards or they are just more accepting? I'm assuming that they have matured by that age. Age is also not really a factor for me in a relationship as I don't plan to have kids at the moment.

I'm 26, she is 21. She was my first GF and I swear to you guys that I was the best person I could for her. I'm still really hurt and missing her after all of this. I just need some opinions of someone unbiased and if I'm really wrong here.

I met her at work and it was everything so easy and smooth. We had so many things in common that the first time we ever talked we lost many hours without realizing.
She was dating back then. I was a little upset when I found out because we had been talking for a while and we got along like we knew each other for ages.

One day she began to talk about how her boyfriend never seemed to really care about her, that a lot of small things she values he didn't really bother, etc..

When 2020 began, her boyfriend left her. I don't know why or the situation involved, but she didn't seemed really sad. She even started to talk to me more and at the end of February SHE asked me out on a date. 

The date was amazing, I fell really hard for her. She suggested that we should go to my place to continue the night. She was my first gf, my first sex, the first time I really fell for someone like this. 
As time went by, she was discovering more about me and sharing many many personal stuff. She knew how hurt I was in the past with previous flings and people on my life. I was fat growing up and everyone bullied and laughed at me all the time. Girls considered me a joke and even in college they would just laugh when I asked them out.

I'm fit now, everyone says I'm really good looking, I have my successful career, my own house, car, I used to travel around the world but women will would look the other way all the time.

She was the only girl to ever be interested in me, to think I was amazing. She would tell me everyday that I was the most special person in the world and that I was some sort of angel that she happened to find. 
She acted like she was in love with me, and I treated her with all the love, respect and showed how proud I was of the things she did all the time.

We used to spend the weekends having sex, and between each round I would cuddle with her and play with her hair. The way she used to look at me was so passionate and happy. Always on the next morning I would wake up early and make breakfast and cook some things for her. We saw each other only on weekends and I wanted to show her all the love I had inside of me. She was always looking so happy and in love that it made me feel like I was beyond rare and valuable.

I took care of her when she needed most during this COVID times. I knew she had low self-esteem and was having anxiety and panic attack because all of this and I drove to her house (even skipping work) to took care of her, hold her  tight and make her feel safe.
She asked me while crying to not leave her, and to be patient with this whole thing. I told her that I loved her. We were together for 4-5 months and I never ceased to show and tell her how much I wanted to be in a relationship with her and build things.

We were together for 7 months, and on the last 2 months she became really distant and a little cold. She would still say many wonderful things about me, but she would never find time to see me. She started to take much longer to answer my texts until finally she broke things off with me.

She cried so much that day, saying that she needed time to heal from her past relationship and that I was so perfect for her, and that we weren't on the same page, etc..  that she needed to be alone sort things out.

She never stopped texting me though. I thought she was missing me, because she would sometimes tell me so. But after somedays I discovered that she went travel with her ex to the place I always told her I wanted to go with her. She knew how special that place was for me and how much I wanted to be there with her.

When I told her ""really? You left me to be with him? To the place I wanted to take you?"", She cried a lot and basically said that I was the one to blame to pursue a relationship with someone that fresh out of one, and that she never reciprocated my feelings. ( Complete BS)

It has been many many months now since the last time we spoke, but she was my first real thing. I trusted her more than anyone, and she knew that and much more. How can I be left for the one that broke her heart that easily? I still miss her even after all this time and the pain never goes away. She never texted me back or looked for me and I'm still really hurt. I can't quite describe how low I'm feeling this latest months.

I feel like I'm not good enough or worthy of love. It's like I'm a joke that will keep being alone like I was being punished for something. I don't know what to do and my heart hurts.

Might sound odd as to why I'm asking for advice based on someone's career, but from what I understand IB takes up most of an IB's life. I'm used to dating people within my field of study (Biomed background) or through friends of friends and the occasional app date and have never dated someone with a corporate background. I swiped on an IB guy who is very different to me and I've enjoyed conversations/phone and video calls with him for 2 months (lockdown in the UK). He communicates often when he gets the time but then sometimes don't hear from him for days/a week max and I've put this down to work.

I know that IBs work crazy hours etc. have heard of the multiple rescheduling of dates or scenarios where they are late to dates a lot. But also have heard of this IB personality sterotype - i.e., they only care about/are obsessed with money, materialistic, cocky, ""players"" at the extreme side of things, etc.

This may sound stupid, but for some reason, I do feel like I'm nervous to date him because of these stereotypes/fear of being hurt and since he is out of my usual ""type"". So really want to debunk these thoughts/perspectives I've heard from friends/family.

So would love to hear what your experiences have been like! Did it work out for you? Did their personality surprise you? What should someone who doesn't really know much about IB expect when dating a banker? What tips would you give?

I failed to talk to her for more than 10 seconds and didn’t get her number and I’m kinda sad that I let my anxiety win over me again. Even alcohol couldn’t save me. I think what happened was that I was intimidated by her looks even though she called me cute but I’m still tired of fucking up every chance I have at talking to women.

It was pretty good but I ended up staying the night at his house because we both drank a lot and passed out. Nothing happened except for some making out.

I text him the day after (Sunday) and ask if he’s down to hangout again sometime. He says “yes please”. I take this as a good sign. We Snapchat back and forth and make plans for Thursday night. I ended up being a little late to the place we were going so he left and asked me to come to his place. So I do, and we end up watching a movie and having sex. I try to leave afterwards because I have work early in the morning and I’m not a morning person so I knew I would feel like shit staying and having to wake up early to go back to my apartment . Anyways, he asks me to stay and says “you can’t just smash and leave”. I was like, alright I’ll stay. 

We end up having sex in the morning too and whatever. In the morning I told him I was going to go to this historic movie theater by my apartment to watch the Oscar nominated short films and invited him if he wanted to. So he says maybe but that he will probably sleep after work. I text him Friday afternoon and ask if he wants to join. He says yes. We watch the films and then start to part ways(I wasn’t gonna ask him to come over because I figured he was tired and may have seen enough of me for one week). Well, he asks me, before we part ways, “what are you doing tomorrow?” And I’m just surprised he wanted to see me again after spending Thursday and Friday together.

So Saturday rolls around and he comes to my apartment at 8:30. We were drinking (me probably more than him, which was out of the normal since our first two dates he was way drunker than me) and I have to pee. So I go to my bathroom, pee, and realize the toilet won’t flush and my water has been turned off. 

At this point I’m panicking inside. It’s not like that was super gross because I had been drinking, my pee basically looked like water. But it was still undesirable. Well, I end up trying to email my apartment complex and figure out what is going on (water is included in our rent). And I was freaking out because I was like, this guy is gonna have to pee and he might be grossed out, or wonder why the fuck I wouldn’t have water at 11pm on a Saturday. So I start texting my friends and accidentally paying little attention to him because I’m so embarrassed at this point. He ends up saying “well I’m gonna go since you’re preoccupied right now” I apologized and said I was trying to email my property manager and he says “is that really all you were doing ?” Like he didn’t believe me. And  then I don’t even know what compelled me to say what I said next but I end up saying “you don’t want to stay even to have sex with me?”. Mortified thinking about this now. He says “another time, I have to go take my dog out”.

I end up texting him about ten minutes after he left (he lives about 20 minutes away from me) and I apologized for being preoccupied and sent him a picture of the email between me and my property manager. Then I text after that “I really liked having you over” then “/:” and he’s said nothing. 

He seemed really into me and I guess I messed things up. I feel bad because I’m usually a person who doesn’t touch their phone when they are with other people and I would hope he would know that from all of our dates. 

So is he ghosting me? Why would this make him not even want to talk to me? I don’t get it. Obviously I’m embarrassed and obviously I feel like shit about it.

For the record, the past couple months are when I realized I have feelings for her.

Here's the backstory.

Before we became coteachers, we worked in other classrooms and didn't know eachother. Despite that, she would pop into my classroom and make sure I was ready for admin to observe me, and even came in to let me know she heard from a mutual friend/coworker that I like the same band as her. Seemed a bit odd, as we didn't know eachother or work together, but I didn't think much further about it at the time. We hadn't developed a workplace friendship yet and hadn't even become acquaintances yet, but even back then it felt like a seed was being planted. This occured a couple months before we ended up as coteachers.

When we became coteachers, she learned about how I had moved to the city/state from another state right before COVID hit, so I hadn't explored the city yet or met anyone. She offered to be my ""tour guide"" and over the past 8 months is still developing a LONG list of places she wants to take me and show me. We were waiting till we became vaccinated and covid wasn't as big of a threat any more to start hanging out.

Rather quickly we found out that we share almost ALL the same interests and similar aspirations and life goals. We don't have a lot of time to chat as teachers, and only get to chat during nap time (students are asleep), and even then we lose track of time talking. So, for the past 6 or so months we have texted (and snapchatted) eachother WALLS of text every evening, having two conversations with entirely different topics across both the texts and snapchat, alternating between the two as we have time to respond to each. We have a million inside jokes, tell stories about our lives and childhoods, joke around (which gets flirty but I'm bad at reading flirtiness as romantic or not because I have very high functioning autism), and make a lot of plans for things we can do together in the post-covid world. My coteacher even told me once that our mutual coworker friend (my coteacher's best friend) thinks we're ""twin flames"" and my coteacher has told me numerous times that she never thought she'd meet someone who is so much like her.

When we do get to talk at work during nap time, we stand very close to eachother (like 2-3 feet), and she will even be the one to get closer. It seems like she either doesn't notice or care when her hair brushes against me when she moves around slightly while talking. During this, I notice we both end up mimicking eachothers body language, and we both have even jokingly pointed it out.


Now recently.

Our birthdays are one day apart, so that same mutual coworker friend arranged an outing for the three of us celebrate my coteacher's and my birthdays on a weekend before our birthdays. It was our first time seeing my coteacher outside of work, and we both had a blast. We ended up all staying out for nearly 11 hours, and neither of us realized it as we talked and had fun together the whole time.

My actual birthday was a few days after our get-together, and my coteacher hadn't finished my gifts in time to give them when we went out before, so she invited me over to her house to exchange gifts and have dinner and celebrate on my birthday after work. Just her and I. COVID has prevented me from making friends outside of work in my new city, so of course I took her up on the offer, even if only to spend my birthday with someone I enjoyed the company of.

Well while at work (school) during the day of my birthday (yesterday actually), the day of our birthday plans together, she gives me a gift that she has worked A WHOLE MONTH on, and even got our students to help with the past week. Fast forward to that evening, and I'm at her place after work. We ordered take-out, drove together to pick it up, and then went back to her place and we lost track of time talking the night away while eating and listening to music. We exchanged gifts and she gave me a personalized scrapbook (with location pictures and personal written anecdotes) of all the places she wants to take me to in our city. It must have taken her hours, days, and weeks to make the book. So much effort was put into it. She told me I was worth it and knew I would appreciate the gift. She asked for a hug at the end of the night before I left, so we hugged, but there was no urgency from her for the hug to end. She told me thank you for everything, and thanked her in return while we hugged. When I let go and looked at her (because I didn't want the hug to be weirdly long), she was already looking at me and then had a sad, maybe disappointed, expression. like she was looking at me longingly in a sad way. My mind went ""oh fuck I was supposed to kiss her"", but since neither of us have definitively expressed interest in eachother, and neither of us have used the ""date"" word, I felt it was safer to not act on my assumptions and we finished up our goodbyes. It was past 2am and we had work in the morning.

A few days later, we made plans for me to come over to her house so we could finish some required online training (2 hrs worth) quicker together. We finished the training, went and got some food to bring back, and then afterwards we just talked about our lives for 8 hours.

We've already made plans to go to a nearby park together on an evening after work this week. Is this normal to do platonically? I feel like she's waiting for me to ask her out and just let the cat out of the bag....

I'm left with torn feelings of really wanting to ask her on a date, but am dreadfully paranoid that a rejection (if I'm misreading things) would ruin our coteacher dynamic. I cannot for THE LIFE OF ME figure out if she's just the nicest woman on Earth, or is she the nicest woman on Earth AND interested in me. She touches my arm, but only occasionally, she plays with her hair but idk if that's just her. She does act like I'm incredibly funny, but we could just get along really well. I would be able to move on and be friendly and professional if I'm rejected, but she's a variable that I can't predict if she rejects me. If she says yes, then great. We're both mature adults. I don't have any qualms with shitting where I eat or whatever. I've thought about asking our mutual coworker friend (her best friend) if I'm crazy or not, as we have become very close as well, but am not sure how that looks. I also recognize I'm not a teenager and asking my crush's best friend if she likes me back seems a bit immature.



I tried to leave out as much of my own interpretations when making this post, and presented as much hard facts or observations I've come across, in hopes that it will help outside perspectives come to better conclusions.

Based off of what I've typed, am I crazy, or is she into me? I'm not focusing on the fact we're coteachers, just whether or not other people think she's interested  (I know, only I can really know) based on the data I've provided. I know what I want to hear, but am will not be deaf towards honesty.

She has this other habit which satisfies her is that she needs acknowledgment and affirmation from people around her like supporting her without credibility which of course is another weak  pattern further demoralizes her personality in my view and prospective plus she is the kind who fabricates stories and incidents just so that she secure her image in front of her friends  and will make her seem bona fide.

I hope she knows that because of serving herself be it joy or necessity she would ignore and would put her most precious thing on the line to live her moment of joy which only includes her and yes she's a woman with an advantage of getting sympathy from her ladies backing her up and telling her she's doing the right thing as if she lacks the capability of making decisions for herself in her best interest but no she's controlled and she lost control on her desires by putting her loved one at stake without any regret.

Now the problem which I have here is that she's continuously breaking into my privacy while advocating privacy breach herself and I know she's helpless because she has no control over me and I've dealt very decently giving her the space she needs but I hope she knows that she broke too many barriers already when it comes to my private space involving people who consider themselves as tech geeks which Ill take care of them very amazingly the day they step in to the airport but for her I want to tell her that she wouldn't be able to resist my blow which will eventually be my first act in response to her breaching my space with those losers.

I think she should've answered my calls back then wouldn't have brought us here or called me back if she was concerned now its not just late but her absence made me dig into those lies and I came to enquire about information and fortunately got revelations more than i was looking for again its because of her own behavior.

TLDR: I would like to know how people deal with rebounds and relationships when everyone has emotional baggage from past relationships. Do you just let go of people when you know if they were in a relationship half a year ago or 5 months ago? Or you just take it ultra-slow? I personally have tried everything. Taking it slow, making it fast, having sex, not having sex, giving space, and been there as a support.

Long text:  
Girl 1- F28: 4 years ago I met a girl everything was great. But she was just out of a long relationship. I was native then so I mistook her actions for affection for me. I also pushed her a bit, went fast, and reacted like a kid (you learn things and do things) it ended.

Girl 2-F23: Next one was also like that, I didn’t push her gave space but this time she called me gay for not sleeping with her and taking it slow.

Girl 3- F25: Another girl, things clicked, we had the same humor. She said things like talk to me and I’ll talk to you back. Things that were missing from past experiences. After a month it felt like I was the only one doing the talking. It ended.

Girl 4- F23: Past month I meet another girl. In my short dating/flings, she is the best person I meet. We talked about dark stuff and the worst things that you can’t talk about to anyone to each other. A mature person for her age. Our problem-solving things matched. We discussed and solved things rather than ignoring them acting like nothing happened the next day, like in all past experiences. But it turns out she hadn’t dealt with her baggage with her ex. But while talking to her at first she mentioned that she had dealt with it. I agree you learn better as time progresses. Her ex and she are gonna meet and talk about things. IMO that guy is just pretending and acting changed since it’s like 5 months and that is less time to change from what he used to do. Things seem to turn to a dead-end for me or maybe they will talk it out and it will end for them. I am free and am not pushing her in any way.

But at this point it’s not my job to worry about them, I am thinking about myself and how I can get out of this loop. Is dating like this? Is been too kind and listening to other people a trait to attract broken people? If you had an experience with someone with emotional baggage (griefcase xD) how did you do it? I feel lost since I always try to learn from past mistakes but still end up in the same loop.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,697473,public,self,Everyone has baggage - getting stuck in loops,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mk75md/everyone_has_baggage_getting_stuck_in_loops/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,

Your list of wants and needs from a partner are much smaller and you are more open to partners that you may give a hard no to later on. This is because we are still exploring and figuring out what we want in a partner, and so we give more people chances,  the benefit of the doubt, have more patience for them, and dismiss more red flags. Thus, the easy choice in your 20s is to keep on dating. Keep on putting yourself out there and letting the relationship completely fall apart, because there is a lesson to be learned from it all and help you have a better idea of what you will want down the line.

Now fast forward to your 30s. You now know what you want. You understand the difference between compatibility and chemistry and love and lust and the 5 important things you value in a relationship and want in a partner. But as I've touched on before, dating gets harder in your 30s (especially as a female) and online dating apps plus a year of Pandemic only makes this harder. So there is more to lose with each person you do decide to date. 

What results from this is the realization that you've hit a fork in the road. As someone in their 30s, do you continue to date and put yourself out there or completely cut off dating and give up on the idea of finding a long-term partner?

Sure,  the easy choice may be ""Just date! What do you have to lose?"", but oh, you have so much more to lose as someone dating in your 30s. The options are no longer endless and time is ticking. You are not getting any younger and many people within your age group have already settled down and have families of their own. You can no longer risk it all to date the wrong person, who is not on the same page as you or not compatible and just because date the sex is great. And if you spend a year dating that person who never wanted to commit, well you just lost a year of your life. It simply requires more mental toughness to continue dating in your 30s, because there will be a smaller pool of potential mates and more rejection than those younger. Having to keep getting your hopes up and being disappointed is mentally draining. And by the end of it, your energy may be completely depleted and you may feel even more jaded.

On the other side, if you completely cut off dating and finding a partner, you may feel more at ease, but empty as well. The headache of going through different potential matches may be gone, but it's instead replaced with this feeling of loneliness. The truth staring at you in the face that you will have no one to share your highs and lows with and that before you know it, you are 40 and then 50 and you can no longer get back the days of your 30s when dating was easier.

Do you continue to be hopeful but risk getting disappointed and exhausted from it all or do you give up hope of finding someone entirely but go through life feeling empty? Which one are you going to choose?

I know we are young, and people keep telling me not to panic over the future or stress about our relationship, but its been 2 years and I'm not sure how happy I am anymore. 

I struggle to motivate myself to do certain things like working (uni) or cleaning the house, so I keep a fairly loose schedule of the day to keep myself on track. I don't expect him to follow it, but I do feel he needs to contribute. Not only does he rarely contribute with housework, he rarely does any of his own work. Spends his time on games or with his friends. He also has the mentality of a child. If he's hungry, he asks me for food. If he's hurt himself, he whines like a child about it, not that I can do anything. 

He will go out for hours with his friends, come home, see a million jobs that need doing and say ""ill do it later, my feet are sore from.being out"" and then spend the next 3 hours reminding me his feet are sore. 

He loves to interupt whatever I'm doing to ask me a random question, or ask me to do something, interrupt what I'm saying, talk over me, mansplain my own degree to me, frustrate me to the point where I feel like I'm going to explode, and then ask why I'm being moody and short with him. 

Don't get me wrong, I love him to pieces when he isn't doing this. We have a well established relationship and plans for the future, and it almost makes it harder. I know for a fact I would have left him if our lives weren't so tangled together, but at the moment a clean break would be impossible and sometimes I feel like I'm still here because its too much effort to separate. 

Whenever I voice these issues, he cries and tells me he'll do better and he loves me, without voicing any issues of his own. I know I'm not perfect and I'd rather he tell me, because it makes me feel horrible for saying anything. I very rarely talk to him about my problems for this reason. 

We have very few similar interests and he actively jokes and makes fun of things he knows I enjoy, so I tend to try and hide these things, to save the upset. He likes to make jokes about my hometown and family, even though he knows they upset me. 

Honestly I do love him, but I'm not sure I'm happy with him anymore. While I know it will hurt and it will be messy for a while, I don't think it would be better to drag it out for the sake of an easy life, and I dont want to give him another chance because nothing really changes.

I'm 23F and now that it's been a full year since I've graduated and held a stable job, I finally feel like I'm in a good place to meet people and go on dates. So basically, I'm inexperienced with the whole dating scene.

I've downloaded some dating apps like Hinge and OkCupid, and I get a few messages a day. Some are too sexually straightforward (which I promptly ignore), some are neutral, but some guys send some genuinely thoughtful and respectful messages. So my question is, how should I handle those? I know I'm not obligated to message back, but I understand how tough and confidence-breaking dating apps can be for men (I've lurked around this subreddit for a while). Would something like ""Thank you so much for the nice message. I really appreciate it, but I don't think we're a good fit for eachother. I wish you all the best in search of the right partner for you!"" be nice, or would guys just prefer to receive no response at all?

I come from a pretty traditionalist immigrant family but now live on my own, across the country in likely the most secular city in the US. Because of our distance, it's very easy for me to put on a front when in town while actually living a more open-minded and modern life. When it comes to dating though, they've made it clear that there's an expectation to find someone that's Christian at the least but ideally our specific sect/ethnicity. This is something that I can't hide in any way considering how enmeshed our lives will become. I also love my family and would love to find a situation that resembles my upbringing around a large happy family, lots of ethnic food, and a shared sense of community and purpose.

Now that dating is starting to pick back up, I'm more seriously reflecting on my priorities and characteristics that I'm looking for in a partner. I've spent a lot of time dwelling on religion in particular, but am no longer making any progress. It would be amazing if I could find someone that's in the exact same shoes as me (I'm sure there are many) and are down to play the part around family; but I'm certainly limiting myself and the overlap between folks in that situation and the local philosophically minded, electronic music-loving, reader community is pretty slim... There's also a chance that willingness to put on this front is a sign of emotional and communicative immaturity, so I have progress to make myself, and finding a partner in the same place would not be the right long-term move.

We went for a two hour walk along the beach when we first met in person one Saturday afternoon and it went well. He was very easy to talk to and I could sense he was nervous. I wasn’t attracted to him right away as he dressed very casually so I felt like I could be myself. He was five months out of a seven year relationship. They were engaged and he postponed the wedding due to work commitments, which was a constant issue in their relationship apparently. They split up a few months later after a huge argument. Apparently, she is now dating a new guy. 

A couple hours after our first meeting, he asks me to dinner the next Saturday and makes a reservation at a pretty pricey restaurant, which was a mention in the Michelin guide in 2019 just to give you an idea. I forget that Friday is actually my birthday and I was supposed to spend it with my family but after some family drama, it is cancelled. I tell him what happens and he says he wants to take me out for my birthday on Friday instead. 

The restaurant he takes me to is a celebrity hotspot and we even sat next to two celebrities that evening. To top it all off, he got me a custom made cake with my favorite fruit in it. He really went out of his way to make me feel special and it was incredibly thoughtful. Plus, he got dressed up in a suit and at one point during the evening, I felt the urge to jump on top of him! I was very attracted to him during our dinner date. He made me feel so nervous and boy, was I awkward and shy.

He’s pretty well off but I can just tell he’s a decent guy and extremely respectful. The next morning, he texts me asking if I got home ok and that he had a great time with me. 

I really like this guy. I don’t have much experience in dating, I’ve only been in two long term relationships and I met them in college.

(23/yo female &amp; 35 /yo male)

I’m 23 and met a 35 year old guy from Australia on a dating app. We met and had dinner and really hit it off. I’ve dated guys with significant age gaps before but that didn’t really matter to me. After the first date we started seeing each other consistently and texting all day every day. I could tell he was developing feelings for me, and I had my reservations but I was too. 

The day of our first date, he told me a pipe burst in his bathroom and flooded is apartment (that’s NYC for you). Now that was true, but he told me because of that he was going to stay at a friend’s place. He also mentioned he wanted kids in the future, and made it clear he wanted them with me. We joked about it, which I was fine with. No guy had ever been that forward with about expressing them seeing a future with me. 

Today in what I thought was innocent conversation we got on the topic of kids. I asked him when he would want kids... and that’s when he revealed to me he already HAS a son... who is 10 years old. Him being from Australia is important because that’s where is son lives. He came to the U.S. a while back but he’s told me he had no intentions on going back. 

I asked him to tell me the real reason why we couldn’t go to his apartment, and he said it’s because his ex girlfriend lives there and he recently moved out, right before we began dating. He still pays his half of the rent as to not stick her with the full amount... and they don’t get along and have been broken up for months. 

I don’t know what to do, I do like spending time with him but I expressed we couldn’t have a long term relationship because frankly... this sh*t is crazy lol.

Prior to this, we didn't really talk - like he would sort of tease me when we were in the same classes together (e.g. if I was on my phone, he would be teasing me about me dating someone etc.). That was our only interaction. He confessed that he thought I was pretty for a while, and I didn't ask further at the time because he was dating someone. 

**Present day:** I recently posted on my story, and he replied to it and we had small talk. He asked for my availability so that we can schedule a day to find a place to eat.  I told him I was shocked he asked me to go eat, and then he said ""haha come on I called you pretty a while back"". 

I also told him to text my number to go over the details, but he said he didn't have it. FYI: We had multiple classes together, and I gave him my number when we were in group projects, and he had it saved back then. I asked him, and he said ""Nopee. Orr I didn't save it HAHA"". 

I don't even know what any of this is supposed to mean lol. Does he actually like me or is he just lonely? And what does it mean when a guy doesn't save your number, but he calls you pretty? I'm so confused. Red flags or am I overthinking. 

**Another question:** When I ask guys (who are interested in me) what they like about me, they always just say it's because I'm pretty or talk about my body. Like do they not like anything else?

I follow the advice of this sub as much as I can FOR MY OWN SAKE. Therapy, medication, exercise, running, sunlight, stretching, meditation, hobbies. 

I have no dating experience and would like to change that because intimacy and companionship with someone that shares a deep, mutual connection and attraction with me seem like something worth trying for. I am told that I have to have reasonable expectations in dating. These expectations include the fact that I'm one of the men who have to improve themselves in their 20s in ALL aspects to have a chance at dating in their 30s. 

I get WHY I have to accept this; I'm stunted in aspects of life in ways that women will find unattractive. Lack of physical strength, I still live with my mom, etc. It's a path that takes longer for men like me and shorter for successful men.

I do not know HOW to accept that dating in my 20s is an impossibility for me. I can't HELP but feel envious of the guys that have the privilege of being supported and loved by a significant other. Regardless of the other issues they possess, they have the advantage of having a best, BEST friend to assist them and be there for them, in cases where the relationship is sound. Guys tell me to come to terms with the notion that the decade I'm currently in will be void of this experience, but a decade is a really long time. I wish someone can tell me it's valid to feel down that I'm expected to remain single in a decade in which many other men feel love beyond what they can imagine. Being a perpetually single man is not what I aspire to be. 

The other concern is that by the time that I improve myself, it'll be too late. I say that I want to improve myself and better myself, but I can see how to women, my improvements will be perceived as ""The absolute bare minimum,"" and that my qualities outside what I've worked for will disqualify me from consideration. It'll feel amazing when I own a home, have a full-time career, and be a realized person as the rewards of working hard in my 20s, but I'm afraid that women will see that and be like, ""What else? Why should I pay you any mind when other guys outperformed you in most life milestones and have social proof of prior women being attracted to them?""

Also, being an inexperienced virgin at age 30 likely lowers my attractiveness quite a bit. A lot of women don't wish to be teachers at that age and that's their valid preference. I think I'm a good human being, just not one that is good at life enough to form a relationship compared to my peers. 

With that being said, I'd like to ask how I can accept that dating in my 20s is something I may only experience secondhand via movies or imagination? When I reach age 30, will my hard work and self-dedication be enough for women to overlook my inexperience?

There are pics of me on my profile if, for any reason, it helps you to form your response to me. Thanks in advance.
