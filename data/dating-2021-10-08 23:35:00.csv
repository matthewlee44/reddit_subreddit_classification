Depression had left me stagnant and unwilling to actively pursue anything worthwhile, and deprived me of emotion, personality and hobbies worth talking about.

In the last year or so, I finally feel as if I'm starting to become my own person and figure out who I am and what I want. But due to this stunt in emotional growth, I still feel as if I have a lot of catching up to do as a person before I feel ""worthy"" of dating someone. Most people my age already have career's built, children and even homes to call their own. I feel so far behind everyone else, and that alone is hurting my confidence.

I would say I'm a fairly attractive man (despite the balding lol) and I'm decently fit. I've dated a lot in the past, even engaged once, but it's been awhile since I've had a worthwhile and meaning relationship. I crave intimacy and someone to share feelings/thoughts with, but don't think it's fair to waste someone else's precious time and effort on someone still growing as a person.

13,q4g2a4,1633762834,happy but think about hookups,"
I (19F) have been in a very happy relationship with my bf (19M) for 6 months. However time to time I think about having casual hookups with random guys. We go to uni together so hookups are pretty normal. I honestly dont know why I think about this sometimes. We dont have penetrative sex rn in our relationship but will definitely in the future. Still we both can finish when having sex so thats not an issue (I am satisfied). 

It also is the case that I am definitely more attractive than him, not to the extent where its something I would ever mention but tbh initially when we started dating I didnt find him that attractive. Now I definitely find him attractive and he turns me on, but his personality and our past helps that a lot I think.

I love my bf so much and I could see us together for a very long time. Idk if its because there’s still a lot of things we dont do yet in our sex life or the idea that I could get a really hot guy/girl for one night of meaningless sex but I think about it time to time. I NEVER would come close to acting on this urge or doing anything disloyal.

Then he asked me today if I was free next week to get boba and watch anime (Haikyuu) together (doesn’t specify if it’s hanging out or a date). It sounds fun, so I agreed and we settled on a time, and I asked where and he said we can get boba and then relax at a park in our city and he said he can pick me up. The fact that he offered to pick me up is what is giving me ambiguous vibes, but I might be overthinking it since he could just be chivalrous. I've never really been on a date and I just think he's a cool person I'd enjoy hanging out and being friends with but I'm kinda scared that I'm either overthinking it or wouldn't be prepared if it turns out to be a date.

Later, at the same bar-I see another girl who’s insanely cute. Go up and talk to her. This time it’s going great, the vibes are on point, super smooth. Then I hear “hey remember when you were hitting on my friend earlier??”

I look over and there’s the first woman’s friend sitting next to us. I definitely made the wrong move and tried to deny it. She gives me some shit says it was definitely me (obviously). I basically respond “am I not allowed to talk to people at a bar?” 

First woman’s friend leaves. Made me look super dumb. I just tell the chick I’m interested in that I’ll leave her alone if she wants. She’s like “yeah…” so I walk away.

While on the trip we were devided into groups of six and stayed in small Bungalows at a center park in the netherlands. We weren't in the same group but the girls from her group always invited us over to them to eat, chill, play games and so did we.
At the third day we sat next to each other and she brought up that her uncle works at the same place as my father and that we descent from the same turkish city (we are both the grandchildren of turkish immigrants that came to germany after ww2)
And now there is my question. I am or was a very shy person before that trip and never really talked or did anything with girls because i wasn't really interested in them but rather in video games. So we just spoke 2 maybe 3 sentences and that's it. Looking back at it now i  think about all the great things we could have talked about bit they never came in my mind whilst in the conversation. I always get nervous when i am in new situations like this. All the things we did together as a group really changed my mind on women i just started to understand them. now i want to change everything and leave my old self behind because i just realised what i really want in life: love. I am gonna start buying new clothes, get a nice parfume, new haircut and start exercising again. And in the near future i want to ask her out on a date.

19,q4gqun,1633766125,Should i text him?,"I (19F) went on a date with a guy (23M) about two days ago. 

We went to have a couple beers at a pretty lively bar in the centre of our city’s night life. Conversation flowed pretty easily, and so this casual type of “date” went well. 

A few pints of beer turned into a couple more, all the while the bar kept giving us free shots. I handle beer like a champ, but i’m terrible with spirits. 

we both got really tipsy and decided we’d go to his place to sleep. Originally i was supposed to take a bus to go to my place outside the city, but busses had stopped driving already as it was really late. 

Everything after we left the bar was a blur. By the time we got to his place, i was blackout drunk. I usually know my limits, but I hadn’t eaten anything for hours, and those extra shots fucked me over. 


Flashforward a couple hours, i woke up at around.. 5 am? I noticed my apple watch was missing from my wrist and i started freaking out, thinking i lost it. About a minute later i noticed that I wasn’t in my own shirt. I was wearing one of his, with nothing underneath. No big deal, i thought. I tend to get naked when i’m drunk. 

He ended up initiating intimacy early in the morning, and i was originally on board until he started fingering me. The entrance to my vagina was hurting. Really, really hurting. When i mentioned this, he stopped and ended up cuddling me close. 

When i was fully awake in the morning, he mentioned to me that we were both really drunk last night. I’d apparently vomited and everything. He was really embarrassed, and revealed that we had sex. He felt bad- i was blackout drunk and couldn’t consent. He was very drunk too, so i’m honestly not too upset, but I wouldn’t have slept with him if i actually had any say in it.

I left around noon, and went to get myself a morning after pill asap. 

It’s been two days, and i haven’t heard anything from him. I don’t know if i should text him, even just to tell him that i took a morning after pill.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q4gqun/should_i_text_him/

To give some back ground, i havent been in the dating scene for 9 years and i feel like it has had an impact on how i start to approach women and it is starting to depress me.

So i do have this co worker whom her car broke for 2 days and is dealing with mechanical issues about it and for the past 2 days we talked a lot. We've worked together for about a month and a half now but this is the only time i've actually spoken to her a lot. So in the past 2 days i've offered to give her a ride home and the first time i've asked she was a little bit hesitant and ive told her no strings attached and gave her a ride home. We talked a lot in break time and she even shared a video which made her cry when she watched it before. The 2nd time (this was 2 days in a row) she gave me boba for the ride before and i told her if she wanted i could give her a ride back home again, little hesitant at first but agreed when we got out comfortably. We talked a lot in the car with what she loves and hobbies and stuff but i kind of noticed i kept asking the questions and she never asked me about something or anything.

I am the type of person that has to get to know someone first to like them and he has grown on me and I think I like him. 

We see each other so often and text so frequently and just get on so well it starts to feel like it could be something.

37,q4jddu,1633778428,I feel like I have an indifference to dating based on my expectations,"I have been having a burning indifference to the dating community. I am posting on this forum to get some perspective and support. 

I apologize for the length, but I spent a long time working through a lot of trauma and issues. Life is a journey. This is my story. 


The issue at hand:

I used to feel like there are are unspoken complexes that exists in the gay community. Come to find out, straight dating is the same way. I will explain what I’m talking about in a second. 


About me:

For a little back story, I am a 29 year normal guy. I like to think I’m perceived as decent looking. The only downside I will say is that I stopped growing in high school and I’m short (5’4”) and have a medium to slim body type that’s on the cusp of dad bod. I’ve been called an otter before to give you a good idea. 


My goals:

I’m looking to get back out and start dating again seriously and looking to get married to a guy and start a family. In the past, this expectation has scared away every guy that has been interested in me. 


My self discovery journey:

I have done a lot of self discovery and found out I have had an unhealthy attachment to a fairytale-like relationship. This led to what therapists call love addiction. I know these ideals and expectations were something I was conditioned to believe in from my parents. 

After many toxic/failed relationships later in life, I wanted so bad to fall in love that I would fall in love with men that resulted in being dumped repeatedly. I developed bad habits like prematurely falling in love with men only to find out they were not available the way I wanted. 

I have also been the type to prematurely to fall in love with a guy right away before even knowing if this person was right for me or had my best intentions in mind. I was addicted to the highs of knowing someone liked me back and I attracted them. 

I have recently made these connections and have been trying to find my triggers and trying to undo the expectations I have been wired to believe. 

I know it’s a long road to recovery but I feel like I have made so much progress in life I never thought I would be. There’s some things I need to work on that doesn’t have to deal with relationships, but enough is enough: I’m ready to find a husband. I still desire that and feel like I deserve to be happy with someone. 

I know it’s not going to happen like a fairy tale, but all I ever asked for was to be attracted to a guy and for there to be chemistry and intimate love making. 

As I am turning 30, I try to practice self love and getting into things I love and hobbies so I’m not obsessing about having a husband. I used to hold on to close friend and never wanted them to move on. That was always my biggest fear. 

But as I got older, I have come to the conclusion that friends and even guys come in seasons for me. There are good and bad seasons. I have come to peace that I have to be self sufficient and not be so codependent. 


About my dating history:

I have had one long term boyfriend. It was a very intense first love. Kinda like the ones you read about. He has been the closest I have come to having a soul mate. We were together for 2 years and I didn’t know how to communicate to him. I felt like he always invalidated my feelings and dismissed them. It eventually led to us breaking up. 


After that, I met guys mainly through Grindr with my premature love attachment. Can you imagine how that turned out for me? Disaster. 

The only perk during that time was how I felt so desirable and the only take away was that I at least got sex out of it. Every relationship ended with them dumping me, me discovering how unavailable they really were, or discovering that they were having some attachment to someone else and leading me on. 

To me I was hoping that each hookup would turn into a steady boyfriend and then husband. It began turning into a sort of emotional roadmap. To me, I definitely don’t feel like I ever came across as too desperate. But I will say I was always the one to make the first move and ask the other person out. It irritates me because I never got asked out. 

Occasionally, I would even get some of the guys to proclaim that we were dating. I’m afraid a good majority of them probably did not see to that way. I was just some guy they were fucking with to pass time until they moved on to someone else. This leads me to believe and wonder how many people have that kind of mindset and how they can live with themselves. 

The odd part was the worst guys with the worst complexes were the ones who were the most adored. To many, it came across as a false sense of confidence. I’m sure they thought, “I’m so desirable that I can lead someone on and lead him on.” They were a bunch of jackasses to me. No empathy or remorse whatsoever. 

If I can explain another complex example I was dealing with, Imagine that I am at work talking to a coworker in another department I like. I’ve been pining for him trying to drop subtle clues I’m interested for a little while . 

He doesn’t ignore my advances. He stares back at me and I have repeatedly checked him out with him watching, made eye contact and smiled at him invitingly. I keep hoping he makes the first move since when I shoot my shot, I always get turned down. 

Another gay man walks in and the guy I just laid all the groundwork on completely turns his attention away from me in a single second and fawns over this other guy that just walked in flirting with him. 

This other guy isn’t necessarily better looking than me. The guy that just walked in also isn’t even trying to win over the guy I like. But he is the one that was able to win over my crush in a single second even though he hasn’t made an attempt to stop me.  

This is the tip of the iceberg of what I have experienced trying to flirt and trying not come on too strong with guys considering my experience and life journey

39,q4jqb9,1633780041,"""I've been to X number of countries. And counting...""","I know some won't read this and they'll assume what I'm saying is I'm turned off or annoyed by this so I bypass these profiles. But I'm not saying that at all.

But what I am saying, or asking, is does anyone else automatically disqualify themselves from the running when they see this? For context, the X in the headline is usually a number like 23 or higher. Don't get me wrong, I love travel. I've been all over the US and been to a handful of countries. But also, most of that was when I was younger. I'm 39 now and my life's situation has changed. I just don't have the resources, but most importantly, the time, to travel the world. Although if I won the lotto doing just that would be at the top of my list.

So when I see this on profiles, it *could* just be something she is including as a fun fact about herself, in which case, yes, that's awesome. I love that. But really I'm assuming you're looking for a partner to grow that number with and unfortunately for me, I'm not going to be someone you can do that with at the pace you are probably looking to do it. So I assume you're using it as a bit of a filter to filter people like me out, and it works. Now if you want to fly from Boston to San Francisco for 5 days for the sole reason of going to the Tame Impala concert like I did last month, I'm your guy. But if you want to travel to Greece, go on an African safari, and scuba dive in Belize in the next 10 months, I just can't help you and I always swipe right on your profile, no matter how attracted I am to you and how much of a match we might seem to be otherwise.

40,q4jyhw,1633780953,My ex is hooking up every week and I haven’t found someone in a year.,"more of a vent/rant but as a 32 year old guy who hasn’t been physical with anyone in over a year this really is making me feel like my ex was pretty much the one that go away. 

I’ve been trying to go out but I have no real sex appeal. I dress well, I smell great, my hair is the best style I can get for my hair type and hair line. I try to talk to women when I go out but I honestly just don’t get anything. No looks, no smiles, no indications. I just stand at the bar and try to talk to someone who stands next to me and make small talk but it doesn’t seem like anyone really reciprocates. 

My ex on the other hand is hooking up with multiple people. Having the time of her life. I’m pretty much a distant memory in her mind but in my mind she’s the last person I had sex with and the last person that physically touched me. 

I’m feeling like I’m failing. Even though I have my life together and have good things going for me. But socially I’m just not there and it feels like it’s getting worse with age. I know guys who are getting laid and they literally have no jobs, no goals and no ambition but they know how to talk to women and create sexual tension I guess because they have no problems pulling even though they live with 4 other dudes ina literal dump, trust me, I’ve been over their place. 

I just don’t get it. I feel like there is something wrong with me. I’m either too boring, not attractive or something in between because it seems everyone from the bum on the street to my ex is just happily going out and having fun and having an active sex life and I’m going out twice a week to bars, Tricia, music nights and I literally leave without even talking to anyone sometimes. 

I don’t want to down spiral but it’s really hard to enjoy life when you do so many things alone and even in my meetup groups I know ppl are hooking up but I still am just a friend to everyone. Idk what else to do because a part of me is slowly starting to become bitter at everyone around me getting laid and being fun while I’m on the sideline. If I try to emulate what others are doing then I’ll look super awkward because I don’t have that kind of vibe so idk what to do anymore.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q4jyhw/my_ex_is_hooking_up_every_week_and_i_havent_found/

He can do next week.

But if I say three weeks time it would be six weeks that we haven’t met up before a date. I know that he will most probably not be interested anymore and that makes me so sad. 

I just don’t know what to do or how to tell him. If I should just try and bite the bullet and do it, or try and arrange at a later date but know it’ll probably be a no.

3 days ago, we were supposed to meet and she had to cancel because she said that its been too much of her sonm and his behaviour changed.

66,q4llzr,1633787024,I'm probably just going to leave my crush alone before things get worse.,"So the story is I 29M have a crush on this now 30F for a good year and a half. We use to work together at the same community college and we currently go to the same church. We don't talk much but when we do I usually am the one who starts conversation not in a flirty way but in a friendly way because she's a familiar face I used to work with and we go to the same church.  Anyway most my interactions with her from back when she worked at the college have always been a bit stuck up towards me. This was before I really developed a very strong crush on her which happened over the last year. 
I don't think there will ever be a chance for us to even be friends.

 She's so hot and cold with me which has been going on for a year now. One day she's nice, friendly and talkative with me then other days she stuck up. She turns her back to me while I'm trying to have normal conversation with her that doesn't involve me trying to put the moves on her. I've never once have made and romantic advances towards her. It's all been genuine friendly friendship conversation. Because I want to get to know her first as a person and then maybe develop an actual friendship with her.

 But I highly doubt that will ever happen between us. I've asked her two different times.""Why does she act so passive aggressive towards me whenever I'm around what's the issue?"" She told me both times there isn't an issue. Now I'm not fan of the he said she said stuff but multiple people have told me that's how is. One day she nice and friendly then other days she'll walk right pass you like she doesn't know you. It's kind of crazy she acts this way even at church as well. 

 Anyway with all that being said I think it's best for me not to talk to her or make any kind of connection with her and just move on to someone else.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q4llzr/im_probably_just_going_to_leave_my_crush_alone/

68,q4lnji,1633787168,I DON’T HAVE A DATING LIFE...,"OK, hear me out.

I recently turned 18 and my best friend (who also recently turned 18) is getting married. 

I’ve never had an active dating life unlike my BFF (by active, I mean she’s engaged to the first guy she’s ever dated. they’ve been dating for years and it never got serious for me but it got pretty serious pretty quick for her) I never had something ‘special’ just some old childhood crushes. Nothing more than that. I’ve never even had a heartbreak or got rejected or rejected someone. (I mean people has asked me out but what can I say, I am a people-pleaser!)

So basically, I feel bad about this. Because she found ‘the one’ quickly, I feel like I’m late on finding ‘the one’. Is it ridiculous? Yes. Do I know that it’s ridiculous? Of course I do. I just feel bad for not having a love life at all when she’s about to get married. I know I’m young and I’ll have a ton of time to fall in love but I can’t stop feeling bad. 

It almost feels like I don’t want ‘love’ to be with someone and actually love someone. It feels like I just want it because she has it (not in a “I’m jealous of her” kind of way. i just feel alone and left out). Childish thoughts...

I just walked up to her with a smile on my face and introduced myself. 

She gave me a look of disgust and then said ew and told me she doesn’t date midgets. She then threw her drink in my face which caused my friends to come running over and caused her friends to come running over and both sides started yelling at each other. We all ended up getting thrown out and on our way of being escorted out with them she just kept on insulting me telling me I’m ugly and short and that I ruined her night. I’m 5’4 and I was standing when she smiled at me so idk what she was so upset about she can clearly see how tall I was. 

My friends wanted to go to another bar but I just decided to go home since I felt sticky and dirty from her drink. I wasn’t drunk so I was able to drive. I got home and showered and just went to bed feeling like shit. 

I also recently found out my friends ex girlfriend absolutely hated me. Couldn’t stand me one bit even though I never did anything to her and was nothing but cordial. Apparently she found me annoying and insufferable and that I was undesirable which is why she never tried to set me up with her friends. They felt the same way about me. Thankfully his new girlfriend likes me or so I think at least. 

But am I doing something wrong here? I feel like I’m constantly getting kicked in the nuts for no reason. Even my friends say I’m not coming off creepy so they don’t know what it is. 

Yeah I’m short. I know that but I wouldn’t mind dating a woman taller than me. It doesn’t bother me. I’ve been on 3 dates in my life and they all went terrible. I have no experience and honesty no confidence at all. I’m also dealing with a heart problem so that’s put me under some stress.

76,q4m95y,1633789168,Did I do something wrong?,"Hi all!

I (24F) went on a last-minute date with a guy (27M) last night. We were hitting it off, and everything flowed pretty well. At one point, we were talking about dating apps fails, and he mentioned that the last girl he went on a date with brought up politics which was a no-go for him. I asked him why/how in-depth she got and mentioned that I do understand why someone might ask because it really does relate to values and whether-or-not you would be compatible. We moved on past that conversation, and it continued to go well.

I am very passionate about human rights, so I know I mentioned a few things throughout the conversation. Nothing too crazy, though. It didn’t seem to phase him, and he reciprocated the conversation. At the end of the night, he kept talking about how he really wants to hangout again and that he felt like we got along super well. 

Fast forward to this morning, he said, “I had fun, but I really don’t like the whole politics/race talk on the first date. It rubs me the wrong way. So I need to think.” I apologized and explained that it was in context of our conversations, but he hasn’t replied. 

I’m honestly so confused. Am I missing something? I never pushed anything, and we really didn’t talk about it a whole lot. I feel like a date is a place where you get to know what someone is passionate about, so I don’t think it’s wrong to briefly talk about human rights when it comes up in conversation. I guess if this is a dealbreaker for him, then it’s his problem, not mine.

I’m so over dating at this point and was actually pleasantly surprised with how well the date was going. I’m pretty bummed out and confused. Has anyone had a similar situation? Any advice? Thank you!!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q4m95y/did_i_do_something_wrong/

84,q4n487,1633791976,Does She Like Him Or Me?,"Hey guys,

I (M17) like this girl (F17). Problem is, so does one of my friends (M17), we'll call him Jake. Some context is that this girl is brand new to our school and the state in general as she just recently moved. I feel the need to explain that she thought Jake was gay even though he claims he didn't know why she thought so because  he believed he displayed all qualities ""opposite to someone who is gay"", whatever that means. Anyway, she would make fun of him about it behind his back. Me and a couple friends would tell her multiple times that he wasn't but she didn't believe it. Then we told her it hurt his feelings and she apologized to him about it and said she was really sorry. This was a couple days ago.

As to my current status with the girl, we talk a lot and she doesn't eat very much so I'm constantly trying to make sure she's eating and we talk a lot and all that. She is so perfect the way she is and I wish there was a way I could tell her that, she feels the need to not eat so she can lose weight...which pisses me off because she is, again, perfect. I guess technically we're ""friends"", my other friend asked her who she liked and she said she really doesn't know yet because she's new and all that, which is fair. 

Anyway all 3 of us went to a school football game last night. Me and her kinda spent a half hour before the game started just walking around, we went to her friend's car and she gave me a ""gift"" which was this pink boa (the theme of the football game was to wear pink). We went to the stadium and then Jake got there. For the next half hour I stood there while she touched his muscles and like was feeling the face paint on his face and she would take off the necklace he was wearing and asked if she could wear it for a couple minutes and then asked if she could give it back after a little. She was taking pictures with him and sending it to her friends. She took pictures with me too, but was just saving it to her camera roll. There was one point where she kinda stared at him, and then whispered to her friend next to her and they both giggled. I couldn't really do anything as Jake was blocking me off from her. He is 200 pounds of muscle, not much I could do. I literally felt sick to my stomach just sitting there, I excused myself for a few minutes and seriously contemplated leaving. 

I left, and she messaged me if everything was alright, I messaged her back ""yea"", and decided that if she likes him, I wasn't going to miss out on the last home game of the season while all my other friends were there as well. My friend who earlier asked her who she liked got pissed at me for almost leaving and said that there's no way she likes him, and that what she did that night was just stuff girls ""do"". This friend is kind of plotting stuff behind the scenes to try and get her to like me or put us in situations where me and her are alone, he's basically rooting for me. 

I get back and she's glad I'm back. I don't think I mentioned that she did also interact with me a bit, she would take feathers from the boa that she gave me and put them in my hair or my hoodie. She also held my hand at one point kinda just like clasping them closed with her hands for a couple of seconds. I feel like this is irrelevant though because compared to how she interacted with him, that's nothing. 

I guess what I'm asking here is the title, I know no one is a fortune teller, and writing all this out again after replaying every scenario in my head is probably just making it crystal clear that she does like him. No one just ""does"" all this stuff if they don't like a guy. It's odd, because she was making fun of him behind his back just a few days before. My other friend keeps telling me there's no way she likes Jake, and that if she does, he'll make sure she wont. I'm not sure what that means, and I don't want him slandering Jake or anything like that, because I don't want me and Jake's friendship to be fucked up.

93,q4ogil,1633796221,I'm a widower and finally want to try dating again,"Hi all. I'm 35, male, and a widower with 3 young children. I don't wan to give details about my wife's passings, but for context she passed from cancer. 

It's been 2 years now and I haven't dated at all, I've just focused on work and supporting my children. I  have had it in the back of my mind for the last year though, knowing eventually I'd feel ready again, and she would want that for me. So I've also been taking care of myself very well for this past year as well. Not just to be in shape for dating, but also because I want to be healthy for my children. I'm healthy and fit mentally and physically and I'm finally feeling like I have some control over my life again.

Because of this I've also decided I'm ready to put myself back out there, and I've signed up for bumble but haven't actually used it yet or flushed out my profile.

But now I find myself hesitating, because honestly I'm not sure who would want someone with all this baggage. Plus, it seems many women in their 30's who are still single are hoping for children of their own, and I don't want any more children. 3 is enough, I love my kids, they are my whole world, but financially speaking I know I can securely provide for 3 and worry that any more would be difficult to support, especially if I lost another partner somehow or my future partner lost me somehow. Also there is the factor of age, I just feel too old to have another baby now, not to mention if I date a woman it would likely be a few years before we even approach that topic, and at that point I'd be pushing 40. 

Sorry, I feel like I'm rambling. I suppose I'm just feeling hopeless here. Would women really want a widower with 3 young kids? Who doesn't want any more kids? 

TL;DR: Widower worries his baggage isn't appealing to women and feels like hes setting himself up for failure.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q4ogil/im_a_widower_and_finally_want_to_try_dating_again/

95,q4ogyp,1633796265,Is 22 too late to find a girlfriend,"Not ugly, I have a lot of money, I’m in shape, I don’t have a temper or attitude. Girls think I’m sweet but I think it’s too late. Never kissed, only dates I’ve been on I’ve got stood up so technical never had a date. I don’t want to pay someone to do me. Everyone else in my family who’s my age range is in relationships or is loved by girls. But none of them have the professional or financial accomplishments that I have. I just feel lonely. I wish someone liked me for me. I wish it wasn’t too late but I think it is.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q4ogyp/is_22_too_late_to_find_a_girlfriend/

97,q4op3e,1633796978,She doesn't offer an alternative day,"Usually when I ask a girl out, I start by asking when she's free and let her pick the day. But sometimes, due to logistics, I ask if she's free on a certain day/time.   


In such cases, if the girl says she can't meet up that day but doesn't offer an alternative day, I perceive it a as a lack of interest on her part. Am I wrong about this? My friends tell me I give up too easy.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q4op3e/she_doesnt_offer_an_alternative_day/
98,q4ox8f,1633797677,A guy from tinder who won’t text…,"So I matched with this guy few weeks on tinder. We had few days that we constantly texted sexual stuff. Then when I suggested to speak on the phone or meet he gone Cold a bit. Then he sent me a video telling me how much he wants me. Texted a bit again then haven’t heard from him and decided to WhatsApp him a quick text something like “hey you..” he read it and never replied. I deleted the match from him cos I realised he isn’t into me… 
Couple of weeks later I opened the app again and he literally was the first person who poped on my tinder .. just for the fun I swiped right and I got notification that’s it’s a match! Was couple of days ago. Now he is on my tinder but non of us texted each other … yet. What do I think shall I text him or wait until he text first ..

99,q4oyzv,1633797834,Is it okay to have sex with your friend when she is very drunk?,"So this is the little story behind it. I was FWB with this girl about 5 years ago and we were hanging out with a group of friends. I was not drinking but she was. She got “wasted” according to our other friend and yes I thought she was very drunk too. It’s not like she was unconscious or anything, she was still talking fine and was like a hyper drunk. She wanted to go back to my car to have sex and as we went back to my car but before we had sex I had asked her numerous times if are you sure you want to do this and said I know you’re drunk. She replied with we already had plenty of sex before that night anyway and that’s what I wanted to say next, we had already had sex a bunch of times so this wasn’t the first time. So with her consent we ended up having sex. This was the only time we did this when she was drunk and I was sober. I just hope this isn’t considered rape..",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q4oyzv/is_it_okay_to_have_sex_with_your_friend_when_she/
