After that breakup I've had kinda casual relationships but it was never the same. This ex gf marked a point in my dating life of ""before her and after her"" (Idk if I'm making sense with this, English is not my first language!).

Since this breakup, I've been attracted to women who were similar to her either physically or because of their personalities. And this is not something I can directly change because I don't choose who I am attracted to.

I've asked others for opinions and this is definitely not normal and they suggested to me therapy but at the moment I can't afford it.

I'm afraid if this is something that will stick with me to the very end, or if what's happening to me it's extremely detrimental for me or something.

Just as a note, she marked me because of how important she was for me, not because of bad reasons, although she had several mental disorders so obviously this wasn't all pretty.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1153958,public,self,Is it possible to never get over with a breakup?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s9c5at/is_it_possible_to_never_get_over_with_a_breakup/,no_ads,0.0,

Im sick though, i got some issues. I was a US Army Ranger for a decade and some strings came attached. That was 12 years ago and i have moved on but my body was injured. I love, I care deeply and if were together, youll be the ONLY thing that matters, my dogs and our life.  i hope we can spend long days gaming on our PCs, and then long days just walking up and down stores like spirits, or candle wax warehouse or even...ANY WHERE having a blast just window shoping. Im a stay at home mostly person and I dont just wanna have sex 5 times a day. Maybe a few times a week. not a really sexual person, but enough that it matters. If your drive in life is sex I am not the one for you. I am a person who needs YOU, not your body. I also enjoy most common television like ozark, peacekeeper, doom patrol, Stranger things, Euphoria, Dexter New Blood, Rick and Morty, etc. I love pop culture but my favorite thing is video games and I consider my self a gamer.

I was using Bumble, and the guy and I matched a month ago, and arranged to meet in a cafe. We really hit it off since the first meeting. There was an incredible amount of chemistry, and I felt an instant connection with him since the first coffee date - I have never felt that for many years. He is intelligent, eloquent, well-mannered, charismatic, gentleman. He mentioned that he had overseas experience and studied abroad in UK for close to ten years but returned to the country eight years back.

He asked for my phone number and asked me out the following day. Subsequently, we went for proper dates for a week - movie dates, dinner nights, long strolls etc. almost every day. He always asked me out again at the end of each date, and made plans/reservations and paid the dates, I offered to pay for some as well (because I felt bad). He was really very sweet and attentive during the dates, remembered my little details, and texted me regularly every day. I felt really happy around him and could be vulnerable with him.

There was once (on 6th/7th date), I asked him whether we were on the same page for relationship goals - if he is just looking for a casual date as he posted ""Not sure yet"" on his Bumble profile, because I am actually looking a long-term relationship. I made it very clear in my profile as well. He replied that he felt that we had a strong connection, which can potentially lead to something serious, which was an fair/honest answer in my opinion.

We started to make out at his place on the 8th or 9th date, which was the second week we met. I really appreciate that we waited long enough for sex when dating because I am a pretty conservative woman. And he actually brought me out for proper dates before heading to his place, so it was not just a pure make-out session.

Third week - I was busy with my master's assignment because it was due next Monday. So we met only two times early in the week, but we continued to keep in touch by texting. On Sunday, we planned to go out - he suggested having a celebration after I finish my assignment. He waited for me to have late dinner (9 pm), which touched me. We met and made out in his car that night.

The following day, I texted via WhatsApp in the morning but my message has only been sent with one tick. He replied in the late afternoon. It was unusual since he usually responds immediately, but I didn't ask him about his network connection. He asked me if I had submitted my assignment, and I said yes after the proofreading etc. He suddenly told me that he flew last night, and is in UK now, he didn't bear to tell me last night because I was preoccupied with my assignment, and he didn't want to affect my studies.

I was in total shock, he told me he just returned home for a one-month vacation in Dec/Jan, and he has been working in the UK since grad school. He told me he will stay in UK for 1-2 years, and should return home then. He apologized for lying to me from the start because he knew that I would not meet him again if he told me the truth. He told me that he likes me and cherish the limited time we had thus, he asked me out almost every day. And he would be like to see me again if I am willing to?

After I probed further, I realised he created a pseudo dating profile on Bumble, he revealed his real name. His age is actually 7 years older than what he posted in his profile. It's like one lie leads to another lie, to cover up the initial lie. He said he could not reveal his name to me; otherwise, I would find out that he is working in the UK. I was furious and rebuked him because he should not have lied and deprived me of the option to decide whether or not to meet again. I no longer know what the Real him. He told me it's still him. He only withheld information from me to keep me from finding out that he actually stays in the UK, but everything else, like his thinking etc, was exactly him.

I was so upset that I cried hours over it. I resented him for lying and being so sweet to me during the three weeks, making me fall for him, and also I missed having him around as well.

I really don't know what I should do now. I have developed feelings for him over the past three weeks. I have not blocked him on WhatsApp and he continues to text me - because I can't bring myself. He mentioned that he will try to return to the country during May to meet again. **Should I continue to communicate with him or I should cut communication and just move on?**",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1153962,public,self,The guy whom I am dating lied that he lived in the same country as me,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s9d0bc/the_guy_whom_i_am_dating_lied_that_he_lived_in/,no_ads,0.0,

I am a conventionally attractive woman who doesn't struggle to get attention from men, it's usually just an issue with the quality. Most men I meet are online and I met him online. he's more average and he's not someone I see and instantly want to jump his bones.

I'm someone that really values freedom and he wants a commitment but I don't think I like him enough to get there with him.

However, I can't help but feel like we aren't the right fit and now I don't know how to end it. When I last tried to end it, I was planning on blocking him after so I wouldn't be tempted to respond to his messages and get right back to square one, but I didn't block him. And now here we are. I don't know if I should just block him now or just not respond to his messages or send him one last message.

A little background, it is necessary, we've know each other for 14 years now. Out of which I've liked her romantically for the past 8 years, and I let her know about it. Our dads being in Navy were transferred and we had to part ways. For some reason I couldn't shake off the feelings I had for her. When I let her know about them, she said she doesn't believe in long distance relationship. So I backed off. Though for her, I remained a friend and did not push anymore. 

In the last year for my engineering school, in a chat session, we grew a little to intimate details and I had told her that I wasn't dating anyone and I knew she wasn't dating anyone either. Then she asks if we could try LDR. I was overwhelmed and though I never mentioned to her, I was hoping for such a chance and I jumped on it. Precisely 3 days into the 'LDR' she buckles and says she wasn't thinking straight and it was an impulse decision. She called that off. It hurt. It fucked up a few chances at school professionally. So I went to do my masters, recovered from the phase and for some reason we started chatting again. A year goes by and I'm kinda tired of hoping anything would happen and I let her know the same and when she wasn't able to decide, I shut off from her and backed out again. Threw myself into academics. 2 months go by and I recieve a text from her asking how I was and we chatted again. Then she proposes this idea of getting back together. I declined. She was understanding, but deep down we both wanted to give it a genuine shot. I could hold any longer and let her know my concerns regarding our past and we believed we could work past them and be happy together. We got back together. 

We're nearing 2 years together. Everything is good. We've met anytime we could, anytime we could find for ourselves. Living 4 states apart isn't easy. She lives with her family and they don't know about us. So the calls are scarce. We mostly chat through the day. 

The issue is I am more involved romantically in the relationship than her. She knows that. She's afraid that she couldn't reciprocate at my level. She is romantically very unresponsive. Like no romance from her at all. I am the one who always initiates the romantic stuff and mostly get ignored. She says she doesn't like to chat over texts as much as she once used to. I try to be very careful of talking to her about our past. We decided we w could make a fresh start. It has been good. We have good and long chats. But these are the kind, one would have with their friends. I am always afraid of freaking her out with my thoughts about our relationship and the future. She had told me once that she panicked when I told her what I had in mind for us. She says she's making efforts, I respect that but what I fear is,

 would I be selfish to have some expectations in the relationship? Would I risk our relationship in the fear of bringing stuff up to discuss about our future? 


She's a gem of a person, really very good at heart. She really isn't a romantic type of person and always says that she to broken to love somebody. But I love her. Very much. I can't shake this feeling of uneasiness. I want to talk to her, but I'm too afraid to lose her. But I also know that I am not happy with this arrangement. Is it wrong to carry expectations in the relationship?

Im fact I get many states by women (especially in summer, wearing short trousers). I'm also very confident, goal oriented — would even call myself an alpha, a leader type. I'd say I'm very experienced in life due to my difficult past. 

At the moment I've hit a weird spot in my experience with ""dating"". Basically most interactions didn't lead anywhere. Many women disqualify themselves rather quickly, mostly through immaturity or too much focus on sex. Often I am not enthusiastic about meeting them, except if they make me horny, but I don't feel that's my thing. At the moment I feel my approach in general is totally wrong. 

I feel rejected, even though I myself know they act different to what I would tolerate. I also feel like I don't attract women my age or experience or attitude, while also feeling that I am inexperienced because I seldom meet anybody that falls into that category. As a graduate student studying at my age I am older than most of my colleagues. 

I also recently have noticed, that women in the train sometimes look at me and notice some opportunities to chat some up. I always think what a suitable approach would be. Before I never traveled by train, and this option will fade in ten days too, often they look too young. 

Well I maybe am very picky and should just hit it off, even though this idea doesn't seem right even if I'm horny, since I'm a focus driven person and want to achieve my goal by dating a woman I think has potential. ... I'm also thinking, maybe I am too picky, and I'll just prioritize meeting up with them, even if they don't impress me too much. But then this also seems ingenuine and a waste of time 

I don't feel so lonely anymore, but I crave connection and intimacy. Also want to improve my style this year, to look more mature and be noticed by women who are more mature. I don't know, but maybe I should also transition to improving my chances in talking to women spontaneously to have more mature conversations. I know I am a high value man, my psychologist (f,~23) admires me, when I'm done with therapy I of course have to hit her up.

Do you guys have some tips or encouragement? What do you guys think? I am so busy with my love of physics and don't have a lot of time to really dig deep into what's the direction I need to go with dating, but maybe I should, to know what to focus on.

This story might be a bit long 

I met a guy online this summer through a talking app with strangers. He had a kink or a fetish that I was low-key into. He would ask to send feet pictures to masturbate to and sent his private pic. 

We both agreed that everything will be anonymous, neither would be able to know who they’re talking to and it was all under our consent. Keep in mind that my friend was the one who found him and shared his account with me so we could talk to him. My friend and I made a fake snap account to send pictures and chat with him and he has an account out of the talking app in snap chat that he uses with everyone he met through the talking app just like us.

Fast forward him and I started talking more than just sending pictures( I never sent my feet picture or masturbated it was just my friend and him). He started calling every day from 12-1 am till 4 am. A month after we got to know each other so much , deep talks got us sleeping on the call together and checking up on each other in the morning.

He told me he had a couple of relationships. They weren’t all healthy, got cheated on and fell out of love in some and some ended in good terms also one blocked/ghosted him and it didn’t really sit right with him. 


The second month of talking my friend stoped talking to him as much. She tried telling me that I’m going on the wrong direction and this is not the right person for me. It was too late at this point because I was already invested taking for 8 hours a day on the phone and the rest through test. 

We argued a lot since the calls would be at midnight or ams. He’d be online for hours and then call me at night to end his day with me. I confronted him about it and he started calling at night and texting or calling during the day. 

My friend disapproved of all of this, she found his insta account his real name and his pictures without me knowing about it. She dmmed him with a fake account and started talking to him, he flirted back but said he has a girlfriend when he was asked. Told the girl he’ll show her around since she said she moved to the area he’s in recently. My friend then told him she did all of this to show me that he’s not worthy and he’s not the right person since I was full on invested and loved him. He told her he knew this account was fake and treated it like so. He asked to call her to explain why he talked like that. She told him I’m not going to be the one to break the news to me and he will. 

He called me that day sounding so devastated, explained everything and said he knew the account was fabricated that’s why he talked to that girl in that way. 
He told me to take my time to think about if I still want this or not and he’s apologetic. 
This all happened when we didn’t meet in person all online and he doesn’t know how I looked like and who I am. 
 
I lied about my age, name and where I’m from. Right until our first date I told him everything. 

Fast forward I decided to forgive him and we had our first date. He saw me for the first time but I did see his picture on insta since the flirting event happened. He’s big on words of affirmation, he promised to love take care and we had a lot of deep talks. We talked like we’ve been hanging out for years and I don’t think I can describe how alive I felt that day. 

He told his best friend about me and a couple of his friends, and turns out we had a lot of mutuals too. 
He doesn’t like going out much so we have dates every once in a while ( once or twice a month). I called him out on it and we had huge arguments because of it. I also talked about how he calls at night only and would be online for hours and not reply to my messages. I hinted and asked who he’s talking to, he told me he’s not cheating if I’m trying to refer to that. His snap score was rising tho we weren’t talking there anymore. He said he made friends there too and he wanted to keep his identity and so do they so they wanted to only talk through the fake account.

About 2 months ago I found out that he has a TikTok account that I didn’t know of. He followed only one account and that account followed him back so one follower and one following. 
It was a girl, I asked who she was he said this account is really old and she is a friend from university. He quickly changed his account from public to private. When I asked he said he didn’t want his contacts following him cause he doesn’t use TikTok much and didn’t want to be spammed. Though his best friend said he never heard of her name ( the girl he follows). 
I gave the benefit of the doubt and decided not to dig in. 

On a date he was using his phone infront of me and though his most recent calls the contact he was talking to was “the girls friend letter of her name” the initial. I didn’t ask because I didn’t want to seem like I’m all up his ass. He showed me his female friends ( he’s an exovert and loves talking and meeting new people) on his phone and explained if they met through uni or school or family friends. I asked to see the girl when he was done he’s said she doesn’t post pictures and she’s not as active on socials. 

Ps. His outings are either with his family or me and barley his friends. So if there is a girl he’s talking to he barley goes out with her. 

Whenever I find myself overthinking though I don’t have any type of proof that he’s cheating but why would he be acting like that I feel guilty. So I find myself trying to always push him to the edge or corning him to talk and that I don’t believe the reasons he mentions. I start to hold grudges and treat him like shit, not answer his calls, reply late or reply half ass. 
I wouldn’t confront him on whats pissing me off or why I’m talking passive aggressively. He’s patient and would try to know why I’m pissed never cussed me out even when I did. And always had a very calm way of confronting or talking to me. 
Our dates are nothing but a fairytale every time he’s such a gentleman in public and private. Always told me I know how to love and everytime I asked to break up because of my overthinking and I’m jumping to conclusions he’d ask if we could work on this relationship together promises to change habits I hate, and he did work on it alot. 

Today marks our 7 months he makes me happy, though my brain is eating me trying to know if he’s cheating on me or not. 
Is him being online and not replying to me on time means that he’s talking to her? Though he calls me every single day and showers me with love in every phone call? 

Does me not having any type of proof of him cheating means that he’s not?

Am I overthinking and if is a female friend as he said ?

Does he only want to be with me because he knows I would be there and he knows the girl he’s talking to will leave him at some point? 

Or does he actually love me hence he actually worked on himself and this relationship when I asked him to change habits that I hate and showers me everyday with love and can’t go a day without talking to me and asking me how my day was?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1153974,public,self,Is he loyal?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s9eqvd/is_he_loyal/,no_ads,0.0,

I live in NYC and I match with some girls, most of them ghost me however and I haven't met up with any of them. I've recently been asking people to give me face ratings because I wanted to know where I stand and they have all told me I am above average. I just have very bad anxiety along with depression and even some agoraphobia (not severe) but it physically pains me to leave my house. When I do leave the house though I find girls staring at me. When it's happening my mind always gets scared because I'm not sure what they are thinking. Then later I think they probably found me attractive otherwise they wouldn't of been staring that long. My life has been in the gutter, and I've been working on it the best that I can. I'm very lonely and am thinking that my best bet is to just do cold approach because everyone is a stranger until you meet them and online just seems like a waste. (Online would be ideal due to anxiety but I'm just not seeing any success)

I used to have a girlfriend actually (pretty and popular) and go out most days like a normal person but around when covid first began a lot of terrible things happened. I lost my girlfriend, my parents told me I should off myself, my friends stopped being my friends, the lockdown happened, and I stopped leaving my house completely due to all of this. I have done some therapy mostly over the phone. 

The reality is that for me to build more of a life I will probably have to start being around more people in general and so that somewhat goes beyond just approaching girls but I really want to feel someone's love so badly.

Do they even want to be approached? How can I start? And would they even want to be with someone like me? 

Whenever I see girls in person they are always with their friends, and it increases my level of anxiety thinking that I would have to perform socially in front of three pretty girls when they probably reject 10 guys like me for breakfast. Or arguably worse when I see a girl with her parents/family. I could just imagine introducing myself only to get my lights punched out by daddy. I hate myself because I always find a reason or found reasons like this in the past.

If I find someone that wants to be with me though would they even be able to like me?

And keep in mind my generation is the tiktok generation.

I am very different and that's not necessarily good. I can imagine that if a girl did find me attractive enough to call me her boyfriend that she'd want to meet my parents (which can never happen), my nonexistent friends, know how perfect my life is...All I bring to the table is my looks, passion, and intellectual mind (aka myself). My ex was super extraverted as well and everyone is more extraverted than me. The more people I'm around, especially new people it's like my stress level just rises exponentially. I start to feel a lack of security and control, and a need to perform. I'm more comfortable with someone once I know they are part of my tribe so to speak but strangers who are not part of my tribe yet are danger to my ape brain.

Pros:

Tall, good face, works out, intellectually smart (maybe not socially), deep voice, dress well, have interests like photography (I'm pretty good with cameras), acting, music, I can cook, unique sense of humor, old soul, deep, open to doing lots of things

Cons:

Not a lot of money, no status, socially inept, you can't meet my family, anxiety, depression, very little to boast about, not a solid rock of masculinity, no friends to introduce you to, no parties to take you to

I liked her from the beginning but I thought that she was out of my league / no interest.

We did go to watch a sunset at a beach and it was great after that she texted me that she thinks we should go on a date. We did that we went to a restaurant and did. also go to to the beach we did hold hands briefly but then she like stopped 😂 and made it obvious that she didn’t want to anymore when I talked to her if there would be a second date she surprisingly kinda said yes though and we went to study this week together.
I did not text her after the date anymore as I didn’t want to put pressure and if she wanted to break contact she could’ve totally at this point.

But like I said she asked me if we could go study together at Starbucks and so we did I asked her if she wanted to do something this weekend and she said yes

I am confused I don’t know what’s happening she is giving me signs but at the same not. She asked for a date though.

It might be that it’s because we are both teenagers (17ish) and she never had a date before that I don’t understand her.

I had dated before and girlfriends before and it went so much faster but maybe it’s just that it’s her first date and she is kinda shy sometimes .

What do u think should I still pursue something ? I don’t want to make her feel uncomfortable or something but I really like her..

And if so what would u recommend as a second kind of date ?

Or should I just wait it out a second time until she asks

You've removed my power to make an informed decision on whether or not to invest time and energy in you.**

I just explained this to a guy who pulled the old ""not looking for anything serious"" after 3 months of dating. We met on Hinge, which, for those not in the gay community, bears a certain implication of being used primarily by people looking for something serious, as opposed to a hookup or FWB situation. (We have Grindr for that.) I had listed in my profile that I was not looking for a casual arrangement. So he was very clear at the outset on what I was looking for. Needless to say, I felt somewhat deceived, and the indignation was eating away at me after we called it quits. I don't like that feeling. So I texted him and said something about it.

He called me back. The confrontation went ... surprisingly well. He apologized, explained he didn't want to disclose his intentions at the beginning because he thought I'd reject him, and admitted it was a selfish, short-sighted move on his part. I thanked him for his honesty, hung up and promptly deleted any and all traces of him from my phone and social media. I got the closure I needed, and I'm reasonably confident he's going to change the way he deals with romantic prospects going forward.

I moved on, but he didn’t. He would keep on bringing up me having feelings for him in work-related discussions. Which is super weird because if you have nothing, why can’t we move on?

To be exact, I'm a bit shy introverted. I want to love someone unconditionally and explore the little time on this earth. Earthly things don't attract me. ( I read Franz Kafka a lot if that helps). I sit on my 6th-floor balcony on cold nights with some cigarettes and hallucinate about life, death, and her.

As much as I know about her, she's beautiful. She's spent most of her time at home. She reads a lot of books. She smiles when she talks, and she doesn't give a fuck about me (what I think).

She's my classmate. I told her that I liked her in my first year and she replied she's not interested in love. Then we had a little message chat, she tried to carry our conversation, but I sucked. Didn't go far. I don't get the point of texting someone. I can be silent for hours and still be with her in real life, but that doesn't happen when texting. Then pandemic happened. And for 1.5 years, we had no connection. Now that everything is back to normal, she's back, and so does my headache.

There are trillions of things I want to tell her, but when she's around me, I can't talk. I think it's the place where we meet. All my activities vary depending on my surroundings. And varsity is the most frustrating place I've ever been.

I am thinking of asking her out and telling her things from my perspective and all the things about her. I can't decide if it's right or wrong I'm doing. I don't mind breaking my boundaries for her. Could you all give me some advice on what to do in this situation?

My view on sex has always been that it's something sacred and special, not for any religious or spiritual beliefs, but more of the connection that binds two people together.

I've always been the relationship type, and when I wasn't in one I was focusing on myself. I didn't hookup with random strangers or have meaningless flings. I got into my first relationship at 18, and that lasted 2 years. After that, I decided to try out dating apps since they were very popular. I made the mistake of using tinder the first time. I was well-aware of it being infamously known as a hookup app, but I naively believed that it was just the snobby dudes that were looking for that, whereas the girls were more open to relationships. While I had no trouble getting matches, I was careful to only swipe right on girls who wrote in their bios that they were looking for serious inquiries only.

The first girl I ended up dating after my first relationship was from tinder, we were both around 20-21. We really hit it off, and she kept telling me how she herself was very relationship oriented. She was very kind, was studying to be a nurse, and had an amazing family. She kept telling me that I was so much kinder and more respectful than some of the previous guys she met off the app. Then there came a night a couple months into the relationship where we were having deep conversations. And she trusted me to the point where she revealed that the summer prior to us dating, she had a gone through heartbreak with an ex and decided to seek validation from men on tinder. She admitted that she had slept with 20 guys over that summer, most of whom she described as ""assholes"" and ""fkboys"". I didn't think anything of it until she revealed something else; she didn't use condoms with any of them. I asked her if she was on the pill and she said she wasn't, and she told the guys to pull out; there were 2 instances where she needed to take Plan B. I didn't react at first because I didn't want to upset her, but the next day I felt nauseous and sick. I understand that all these events happened before we even dated, and that she confirmed that she was clean, but I knew that I couldn't pursue a serious relationship with someone that had made reckless decisions like that. I understand many would say ""but the past is in the past"", but I knew that it wasn't something that I was able to overlook. To me, safe sex is a huge deal. I respected the fact that she was honest with me, so I had a conversation to be honest with her the next day, and I broke up with her. I wished her the best because I knew she was a good person, but I knew I had to move on.

I gave up on apps but when the pandemic hit, I was 22-23 and eventually got back, this time on Hinge. I had heard that it was more relationship-oriented, so I was relieved by that. I ended up dating a girl who was very career driven like me, and was doing her Masters. Months later, that conversation came up again and she had a lot to tell me as well. She had been in 2 relationships before, and in between relationships or after them, she had tinder phases. Similar to the last girl, she would sleep with random men and invite them over to her apartment the first time. However, she told me that she had been on the pill since 17, so she would willingly let them go raw and finish inside of her She too said that a lot of those guys were ""fkboys"". The same feelings came around as last time, and I had to make the decision to break up with her. It was a difficult decision to do because she was a great person overall, and I hoped she'd find someone for herself.

Since then, I took a break on dating and started reflecting on myself. I know some might argue that you shouldn't know about your partner's past, bit after disclosing my experiences with my cousin, she told me that it's important to trust your partner. She herself had an experience where she dated a guy who she found out with sleep with multiple women (unprotected) while traveling the country, and she was extremely turned off by that. Even though it was in the past, it made her question his ability to commit to a relationship, and his lack of safe sex practices was a complete turn-off.

I realized that I shared some of those aspects as well. My 2 recent exes had made decisions in the past (before dating me) to have non-safe sex with a bunch of strangers off tinder, and for the most part \*knew\* that most of them were ""fkboys"". Personally, I know there are girls out there that don't sleep around with those ""fkboys"" and certainly don't forget about using condoms when sleeping with random hookups (or letting them finish inside them just because it feels better).

I want to be clear with something: I'm not here saying they should or shouldn't have done what they did. That was their past, they made those decisions before getting involved with me. I respect the choices made by others. But I can also make the choice to not pursue them because of those choices, It doesn't mean I think they're a bad person by any means, but just not the right fit for me. Similar to how I won't tell someone to not smoke because I don't like it, but I can choose not to pursue a relationship with them. I just wanted to address this. I thought they were great girls, which is why it made breaking up with them harder. Am I missing out on something great? Possibly, but I know that there are girls out there that share the same values that I do. And before I get this comment, no I don't want to date a church girl haha (pretty sure as an atheist I would NOT get along with a christian family). I don't care how much sexual history a girl has, I care more about if she made smart decisions AND didn't settle for guys who treated her horribly. I really apologize to those that might be triggered by that, but

Now my struggles lately have been about trying to date again. I've been feeling really uncertain about how I want to put myself out there again. I don't want to go back on the apps, but I'm still a little traumatized by my past 2 relationships and how they ended. I made the same decision as my cousin who stopped dating the guy who slept with multiple women while travelling, but to me it seems that (even with a small sample size) I seem to run into the same kind of girl.

What should I do to reintegrate myself in today's dating world knowing how much the hookup culture and apps have influenced dating and relationships?

27F Back in Dec, we went out to dinner and talked for 3 hrs. We were in contact via Instagram messages. Later in wk we talked on the phone to buy tickets &amp; see the Spider-Man movie. Eventually I asked he could stop sending those IG video reels politely, it was a bit overboard. I was not as bubbly at movies compared to when we first met up, I was very quiet (not against him). He was annoying me during the movie, he’s the type to laugh and make noises when something exciting came on. He nudged me during the movie and asked if I was ok because I was quiet and I said yes. At the end I told him thanks, he said you’re welcome and he said drive safe. When we first met, we ended with a hug. When we spoke on phone, he told me that he talked about me with his friends but at movies it was odd, he sent a message after saying that he wasn’t really feeling it from me and it’s not going to work for him. Flash fwd to yesterday, he sends a message on IG with a reference to Xbox exclusives, we used to be back &amp; forth about console wars. He continued to follow me on IG but I removed him when he called it quits, why is he reaching out again?

It’s a wholesome date and at the end we agree we had a good time and he even texts me later that he had a good time and he hopes I did too. I tell him I did and I’d love to meet up again.

He likes my message and then I don’t hear from him. I get advice to just reach out to him so I do on a Thursday (last we spoke was Saturday) and I tell him “hey how’s your week going? if you don’t have plans this weekend we should plan to meet up.” 

He then just says this weekend wont work and asks how I am doing. I try to continue the convo based on something he said during our date but he seemed to not be following and then never responded.

I feel it’s odd since we were having good banter the previous week before the date and during the date and because he followed up with me after the date to re-establish he had a good time but when i ask him out he doesn’t provide another time that will work for him and just falls off texting.

She said that she felt bad then offered to go to an art museum on Sunday with me and I told her that id let her know if I was free

she was SUPER quiet and I carried the majority of the conversation (which was out of the norm for me as an introvert with sometimes crippling social anxiety). I was afraid that she wasn't actually interested but then she did say she'd be down to meet up again and also we've been texting daily since. 

I've had difficulty making plans with her for another date because of our schedules. she's expressed further interest in doing stuff together but the last time we were both free she ""wasn't feeling up to it"". but then it clicked: she had told me about how she spends hours modding for her streamer friend and is constantly staying up really late playing video games. I assume now that the quietness during the first date and not feeling up to going out is because she's the type that stays at home a lot interacting with friends over the internet and playing video games and she probably doesn't feel as comfortable going out to places, especially with someone she hasn't known long, which can already be an anxiety-inducing situation.

all that to say, tonight I'm going on a ""minecraft date"" (which is what I'm calling it lol) she's gonna show me how to play Minecraft remotely with voice chat on. i play a lot of single player Switch games but I'm not very familiar with the ""gamer community"", so what are some other ideas of what she and I could do together online or in person that might be more up her alley?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1154018,public,self,"(23 he/they) trying to date an actual ""gamer girl"" date ideas?",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s9m1n5/23_hethey_trying_to_date_an_actual_gamer_girl/,no_ads,0.0,

But knowing it doesn’t make this easier to deal with.

Essentially I don’t feel any difference when it comes to friendship or romance. I’m not aromantic. I very often form bonds with people that are much closer than ‘traditional’ friendships are meant to be. But for me it’s just a sliding scale of closeness, rather than this big separation between friendship and romance. I don’t have any kind of possessiveness or jealousy, or want a person I’m close to as my own. I don’t care if they’re just as close to another partner/friend.

When it comes to sex, it feels almost entirely unrelated to anything else. Often i’ll enjoy having sex with someone a couple of times, not want to sleep with them anymore, but still feel closer and closer to them and end up having a very close relationship which is neither a friendship nor a traditional romantic relationship.

I’m bisexual so these feelings don’t differ by gender. It makes it very very difficult not to lead people on. And it’s also quite lonely as I ultimately know that no-one will want me as a long term partner.

I struggle to make/maintain close platonic relationships with guys and I’m worried my lack of male friends might be considered a red flag


I (20F) have generally tended to make long lasting friendships with other girls throughout my life rather than with boys. I didn’t intentionally do this, it’s just how my friendships have formed over time. Would this be a deterrent for a potential partner?

That’s not to say I don’t get on well with guys. I currently live with 3 other guys (and 3 other girls) in my uni house and get on fine with everyone, but I definitely wouldn’t consider the boys close friends like I do with the girls that I live with.
I think I’m more “in my shell” when I’m around guys and generally just click better with the girls.

But when I’m on a date with a guy, I find that I’m much more confident - maybe because I’m interested in them romantically and there’s more topic for conversation (especially if we had only met). But having platonic conversations (for example with my male housemates) usually feels awkward for me and I just don’t make a connection with them. Like I get on fine with them, we never argue or anything but I wouldn’t say I’m close enough to ask for advice or vent to.

But now I’m worried that my lack of male friends might be considered a red flag if someone wanted to pursue me romantically.

Why does it seem very hard for most guys like myself to get a girlfriend??

I’m 19 years old and is really into things including video games, movies(Action, Super Heroes, Kaijus etc. to be more specific on the genres), and some other things.

My dream job is to be a game maker and game enterpenuer.

Heck I’m even looking for courses at the time being and is also making bios for video game characters who are just figments of my imagination at the time being.

Also I’ve never worked a job but will soon, I’m just going to take drivers Ed first and try to get my license before I start taking interviews.

I also don’t really go to public areas a lot and usually when I do, I go to school, shopping areas, restaurants, movie theaters, and amusement centers.

(Also just a side note about school, I graduated last year but I’m taking a program at a high school that is teaching life skills including cooking, paying bills, budgeting, writing resumes etc. but since it’s ,well, a high school, most of the girls there are minors and I don’t want to end up on the sex offender list over a kiss or something. So yeah I just wanted to state that. Also just keep in mind that just because I’m taking that program, it does not mean that I’m immature. I’m overall just not confident about my financial skills and overall job skills yet and so I’m just trying to learn those things by taking this program. I mean I am on the spectrum just FYI but I have overcame alot of my autism though to the point that people just would not notice)

Anyways, with that out of the way.

I just can’t seem to ever get a girlfriend especially since I don’t really go to areas where I can easily set up a date with someone.

I do often get told to go to areas like comic con and what such since I will be able to find girls who share the same interests that I do but what I tend to ask people on here alot is how exactly do I talk to them and when is the best time for me to approach them without making it seem random or creepy.

I just feel like people never really come up with the answer that I want to hear.

Another thing that I will state is that I’m actually going to the mall tomorrow to get my haircut, and not going to lie, but whenever I go to the mall I see young cute girls all over the place.

And I would really like to walk up to them and have a conversation with them but at the same time I don’t want to creep them out or seem desperate.

But yeah I just wish it was more simple to just “get a girl” but yet it’s not because you have to worry so much about making “a good first impression”.

Anyways can someone please help me out??

Because if I get the right advice, I may even Atleast have a good conversation with someone and get their number tomorrow.

I think as someone who is an introverted gamer who is 19 years old with zero dating experience, I tend to have a painful time giving  a good first impression to a girl that I’m attracted too.

Also how can I find out that a girl doesn’t have a boyfriend without asking her??

Because to be honest, I feel like girls tell guys “that they have a boyfriend” as an excuse to not go out with them which pisses me off.
