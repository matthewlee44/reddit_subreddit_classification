Context:  We had an impromptu date that started with hanging out with other  friends over food, then she (f22) and I (m21) went back to her place to  watch a movie that resulted in us talking about our interest in each  other + cuddling. We've only been friends for a few months. Both of us  transferred to a college this semester and formed a friend group with  some others.

I do like her. I  think we have really good chemistry + she's the only person I've talked  to for hours without realizing how much time has passed. However, the  doubt and uncertainty I'm experiencing now are the same ones I felt when  I started to date my ex.

She and I  have opposing religious and political views. Additionally, she doesn't  want to have sex until marriage, and I think sex is vital for any  short-term or long-term relationship. We also kinda have different  opinions on kids - she wants to have 4ish and start at like 27. I want a  couple, but it's not something I'm heavily thinking about at this time  like she seems to. Oh, and this is likely shallow, but she does have a  similar name to my mom's.

But she  prioritizes communication and discussions like I do. Both of us have  talked about the difference in our values and beliefs. Both of us were  willing to try but not sure how things would go. Neither of us have  experience dating someone who isn't close to our values and beliefs.

Additionally,  her ex still reaches out to her multiple times a day. When we hung out,  she must have received 10+ phone calls over the few hours we hung out. I  asked her how many times he calls a day, and she said sometimes its  30+. She won't block him because he's a part of her friend group back  home and thinks it's important to maintain a positive relationship with  him for her group. As of early last month, she was still on the fence  about getting back with him too.

Yes,  this does bother me. She says she has told him numerous times over the  semester that they're not getting back together, but he laughs at her  and ignores her. She also saw him sometime in October(?), but she said  she regretted it because it's just made him more determined. My view on  the situation is he's abusive/doesn't respect her and is trying to wear  her down to get back with him. I don't think she wants to get back with  him, but the situation does make me uneasy.

Am  I just overthinking and over-doubting this? On one hand, college is a  place for exploration, and I don't want to turn down an opportunity  because I'm too negative. On the other hand, there's 4 billion women in  the world for me and 4 billion men for her; If we stop it now, maybe our  group won't be majorly impacted.

Ultimately,  should I give it a try and reevaluate in a few weeks? Or is it best to  call it off now so we can try to squash feelings over winter break.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1138914,public,self,Dating someone who has different values and beliefs while in college?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rjr185/dating_someone_who_has_different_values_and/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,

Anyways, it just feels weird. How are we together for a month and never talked on the phone or facetime? Why don't we have better text convos? Why if he hates texting then maybe why doesn't he add me on snap? (that way we can send each other pictures and still keep in touch)

Idk... it just feels weird to me. We went on 7 dates so far. 

And what annoys me, is that I constantly see him active on Instagram. Why doesn't he send me posts or something? Does he not want to talk to me other than those stupid iMessage games?

Sigh. I am just tired feeling sad about this. It makes me feel like he doesn't actually like me, no matter how many times he tells me he does in person. 

Aside from that, two weeks ago the convo of bf and gf came up and he said he isn't ready yet.

So, I want to talk to him and just share my feelings. But I also don't want to sound like Im just saying ""why dont you think about me"". How do I express all of this in a good way?

I moved to a small town my junior year of Highschool but due to COVID, I stayed home and did schooling online. I just so happened to meet my ex through an app that let me make friends nearby since 1) I was new to the area and since I wasn’t physically going to school I didn’t really have the opportunity to meet people and 2) the friends I did have lived in the next state over back ‘home’. He messaged me and we became pretty good friends after realizing we coincidentally went to the same school together. After a few months and going to some events together, He asked me out in early July and I accepted. Right off the bat I noticed that we had two very different dating styles. I was raised by a single mother, taught to never completely depend on my partner (especially financially), to never settle for something, and to always communicate, even if it meant having the uncomfortable and emotional conversations. My ex (let’s just call him M) was heavily insistent on being the only way to pay for things, would argue to be right, and purposely ignore situations to not have tough conversations. I let it go and just accepted that we would butt heads on certain things. Fast forward many arguments and infidelity on his end, I ended things in early October. I packed his things up neatly and drove them to his house only to get cursed out and threatened. He took the break up hard and eventually acted like such an ass towards me in public, that he lost multiple friends. About a month ago, I was in Walmart with my cousin, laughing and joking around when I noticed someone looking at me pretty heavily. I stared back for a few seconds but I didn’t recognize him . About an hour later I got a snap from someone and after opening it I realized it was the same guy from Walmart! We talked for a little bit and he admitted that he had recognized me from posts on Facebook and being tagged in story’s on snap (I added back all of his friends since he insisted I must have been hiding something if I wouldn’t add the back). We started talking on the daily, sending funny pictures and genuinely just being decent people to one another. Last week, I noticed that he had started taking more of a flirtatious tome occasionally but was always very sweet and never said anything too much. I jokingly made a flirtatious remark back and upon seeing how flustered he got, I couldn’t help but think that he was taking his flirting seriously. So I asked him bluntly and he said that he had been since he had seen me in Walmart that day. I was shocked but I admitted that I find him funny and frankly put, attractive. We’ve been flirting nonstop since then and planning friendly hangouts like watching movies together or something as simple as going on a walk around some of the trails and grabbing lunch. I really enjoy how laid back he is and how it seems that he genuinely enjoys me for me. Now being in a small town where everyone knows everything, I know that sooner or later even just us visibly hanging out will get around town fast and the thought recently hit me, “Am I wrong for talking to one of his (now ex) friend especially when we haven’t even been broken up for 3 months?” What do or do I not do?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1138918,public,self,Am I wrong for talking to my ex’s friend?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rjr84z/am_i_wrong_for_talking_to_my_exs_friend/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,

The last time I was dating, online dating had a stigma around it, now it’s how everyone meets.  The thing with online dating is there is an opportunity to date so many people.  It’s great in that if you put in the time and effort, you’ll eventually meet someone you like since it’s basically a numbers game.  The part where I’m getting confused is how much do people talk about this, especially while in the early phases of dating and when is exclusivity expected?  

I’ve been seeing a guy for close to a year, but it’s not very serious.  We see each other every couple of weeks (I don’t date while on my weeks with the kids).  He’s sweet, we get along, he’s smart.  The problem is he smokes a lot of weed, and consequently has not much ambition.  It’s not a low paying job that bothers me, but that he is limited by his drug use because he won’t apply for jobs that drug test.  It doesn’t bother me now since we aren’t living together, but I can foresee resentment if I’m working hard to promote, get better, etc. and he is happy at a minimum wage job with no benefits and no safety net. 

We had a mild disagreement and I got back on the app and met someone I’ve been out with twice.  I can’t say if we’ll keep getting along, but I’m interested to find out.  Do I need to cut it off with the other guy or can I ethically see both while I test the waters?  I feel the first guy is someone whose friendship I would miss if we ended things,

I feel like I was under some sort of spell or Stockholm syndrome type stuff; I didn't break up with him because I was convinced I'd never find anyone else as good??? Idk what I was thinking. he wasn't good at anything including being nice or even being attractive. What was I on lol? 

So yeah he ended up breaking up with me because he said I was boring and that he wanted to try threesomes and polyamory.

I cried for a week, moved back in with my parents and suddenly I was fine. It felt like a weight lifted off my shoulders, and suddenly I wasn't so stressed all of the time. I started talking to someone new over tinder only 1 week after the breakup. 
The new guy and I connected so strongly, we met up in person 12 days after our first chat. Then he asked me to be his girlfriend...20 days after the mentioned breakup.

He's practically perfect as far as boyfriends go in my opinion. We've been together for 8 months now and both incredibly happy with eachother. He's become my best friend. It's domestic bliss. He's absolutely perfect for me in all the ways my ex wasn't. Instead of feeling on edge when I am around him, he makes me feel safe and secure. I can't believe I got so lucky. 

The only thing is. New boyfriend has no idea my last relationship ended so close to when I met him. He's not a rebound, and I don't want him to think as such. My past relationship was so dead by the time it ended that it kinda felt like it had already been over for a while if that makes any sense. 

I know the new bf told me he took a year and a half break after his ex before dating again, and that was coming from a 4 year relationship. Knowing this, it kinda made me stop for a sec and go ""woah wait, I only waited a week, am I a sociopath?"" Jk I know I'm not a sociopath but that sounds like some sociopath behavior for sure. 

And now it makes me feel weird and guilty when I think about it. Is this something I should tell the new boyfriend or is it better off not spoken? Is it important that he knows? Or does he need to?

It is somewhat of an odd one though and I really need some clarity please.

So around 2 weeks ago I (F23) get a text from a random guy’s number that’s not one of my contacts, telling me to go to a bar that he’s at. From the way the message was worded, I thought it was from someone that I actually knew and was about to hook up with once but didn’t. This guy (M23) was staying in a different city at the time though so I thought that he had mixed my number up with some other girl there that he wanted to get with. I replied saying “no thanks but you have fun xx”. He replies again but I just leave it on read thinking this guy is so pathetic, he can’t even get his numbers right.

Anyway the next day goes by and I get a call that night from the same number. I’m thinking he’s calling to clear things up or he still thinks I’m that other woman. I answer the call and it’s this totally unfamiliar guy’s voice apologising for texting me accidentally. I say that’s fine I thought you were someone else. We end up talking about random shit for the next couple of hours. Turns out we have quite a lot in common, same age, go to the same uni, similar interests, and I’m quite familiar with where he lives.

We end up texting/calling/FaceTiming more over the next week and we actually have some really enjoyable conversations; a lot more enjoyable than I’ve had of late. We talk about family and work issues. He’s really into gardening, does botany at uni, and he showed me the book of taxonomy he made with all the plants in his garden, (sounds lame but I thought it was cute). 

We had our last conversation about a week ago, it ended on a really positive note and he said he would text me the next day. He never ended up texting me. I thought he may have been busy, but in all my experiences of guys who have not followed through, it’s because they have slipped away and moved on. Sure enough he has ghosted me. I even called him a few days ago and he actually declined the call lol.

I am so confused. How can you be so interested in someone just for it to disappear within a matter of hours?? I understand ghosting someone youre

I regret redownloading for a couple reasons. 
I’m not sure if anyone has talked about  this, but i feel like the algorithms that these dating apps use are really fucking with everyone’s heads. They also shadow-ban very easily. They try to rope you into buying the higher tier levels and spend more money. It’s disgusting that they’re making all this profit over exploiting peoples love and sex lives. Especially in a pandemic where it’s like ‘how the fuck am i supposed to meet people when i can’t really do a lot of the things i used to do?’ 
It’s kind of nauseating. Technology is ruling a lot of people’s love/sex lives. They decide what matches you see, they decide who sees you. It also takes up so much time. The amount of screen time online dating takes is absurd. While I do give props to people for very creative and amusing bios, the messaging back and forth is frequently painful and a drag. 
Don’t get me wrong tho, almost all of my long term relationships have occurred because of online dating. So i have to be thankful for that because they were all with great partners.

I've finished school, I have my career set (I work at a fintech) and I love what I do. I also have a few streams of income and make six figures annually. 

My boyfriend of one year is a truck driver, he recently took this job to make more money than he was previously making at his family business working for his dad. He does not have any post secondary education, and does not wish to go back to school. 

Recently he got temporarily let go from his job (too long to explain but he has around 2 weeks off from work). His long term goal is not to do trucking but to start a business. He will stick to a business idea for a while and then switch it up completely within weeks. For some reason he believes he is going to be 'rich' one day. I asked him why he thinks that or how he's going to achieve it but he has no answer. 

Since the time he's been let go he's been devastated, he says he can not afford to take days off from work. So I told him this is a golden opportunity to work on his business idea since he hardly has time for that during the week. Instead of working on his idea that he's talked abt for a few weeks now he's been trying to go viral on ticktok. (For reference he's not a content creator, has no following and is starting this whole thing from scratch). I am beyond frustrated because I feel like I have my shit together, I work my ass off, I care abt my financial future and I been waiting on him to figure his career/ long term financial situation out. 

I've always been surrounded by hustlers my whole life, my parents are super hard working, I'm surrounded by hard working colleagues but it feels like my boyfriend is looking for shortcuts to become 'rich'.

He is a super sweet and caring person but I am just beyond frustrated when it comes to this topic. My parents are very strict and have not met him yet. I can not introduce him to my parents if hes a truck driver/ticktoker or w.e. I try to guide him and help him with his business ideas but it seems like that not his priority right now.

well i was 👌 this close to getting into a relationship for the first time in my 18 years with a dream girl,a girl who is beautiful,kind,sweet every single positive word.She is just perfect we met in driving school 3/4 months ago went out on coffea with other friends and she said i was the funniest guy she ever met.I made her laugh every single time i said anything,she was just ugh i love her still…I just love her her smile her beatiful eyes her hair her body her voice.We started chatting and it was quite possibly the most dry conversation ever so i quit thought about it for a week straight was in somewhat of a pain and forgot it.She just broke up at that time,she was totally uninterested,then few weeks later she invited me to this party,tells her friend who told me that she asked him to record her driving and send it to me,and was asking what i have been up to where am i and that sort of stuff.In the meantime i bought a nice car,found a good job,got closer to god (not quite close to where i wanna be) got serious about making money,got real plans for the future,etc…I basically grown into a more mature serious guy not the funny guy who doesn’t do anything the whole day and spends all his time playing video games.I decide to message her and every message i reply within a few minutes she takes much longer as she says she is doing something always so she isn’t available.Starts like the old way we talked uninterested and dry and then i said the first day or two that i liked her just to let her know.And somehow went left and right but at the end started out good.She started replying much more and was into it,it was 50/50 and not just me carrying it.She started being freaky started sending me all sorts of couple tiktoks,one in specific where it says hard working men are so hot and it made me feel really good like she sees the effort i put in to become a better version of myself,she told me all sort of stuff about sex and that sort of stuff and she was more freaky than me ( i practice no fap for multiple months,for religious and bodybuilding reasons) i never wanted to talk about sex and that sort of stuff since i really dont care about it.And especially because i know she prays daily and always said how she will NOT have sex till marriage so every time she send one of these and there are many tiktoks she would remind me after marriage only.She asked what i would call my kids name wise.She would ask about the wedding would i like it big or something small.She made me giggle of happines for the first time in my life,and then sometimes she would go to sleep usually at 10 11 since she has school she has one year left and i finished half a year ago.And then she would say in chat that she is my wife in random ways like i would work and be almost done and go home and she would say your wife is waiting for you and that just would make me happy like nothing else.She then would wait for me for half an hour or an hour and we would text for a hour straight or more and reply right away because she would not leave the chat just message with me.That made me feel special too,and then one night a week or two weeks ago not sure myself lol we stayed late and we started talking deep like she noticed and it shocked me that she was having a hard time first year of school she was suicidal and that was a big shock for me but she didn’t want to talk about it so i didn’t force it,and i wasn’t really ever suicidal but i guess i did think about it like everyone else sometimes life just gets hard.And then word to word she asks what made me change my opinion from leaving her on seen to writing back like 10 weeks later and i straight up told her the truth which is that my friend told me that she was asking about me if he didnt say that she was asking about me i would never message her again because in my mind she is not worth chasing since i dont belive in chasing girls.She replyed with he is lying i did invite you to the party but i didnt ask about you.My friend then sweared that she did and that she is lying.Idk who to belive but i do belive my friend more seems to make more sense and he is my homie…I got shocked because then i started questioning everything.Is this even real? like if she didnt say anything to me then i messaged her again and im chasing her and that dissapointed me soo much since it looked like she was somewhat interested in me after all she said to me and the tiktoks and the way she was chatting to me so i was confused and i asked her one question.What does she think of me? like does she think that we can work togethor or is she just being insanely over the top friendly because if she is she needs to tell me because i think of her more than a friend and i made my intentions clear i told her already before that i liked her and her reaction was oh really? is this sarcasm or? i said wth no 💀 and she replyed with well we might fight or might not (which made no sense like what does that even mean) and she said how previously she wasn’t ready for a relationship as she just stopped being in one and can now move on and she said how when i messaged her the first time it was not the right time and then i asked well is not the right time she said maybe.But then that night she made what i belive a mess of it no you cant ask me that we have been chatting for 3 days you want me to grow feelings if we date for months and we broke up you will be desperate and stuff like that i told her i wont and that it wont make a change (oh boy was i wrong) and basically she just changed from 0-100 insane quick i said im sorry u got the wrong idea i didnt mean it like that and she said that she is angry and that she needs to sleep i told her sorry again and we can disscus this tomorrow she likes the message and then tomorrow she dont reply open my messages replies later with i have made up my opinion and she says its best not to start it at the first place.Out of nothing i ruined everything.Is it my fault? How can that be too early if she jokingly started saying how i should install a pole in “our” house so she can tie me and she can do whatever i want.That isn’t too early? then after that well i mean i was heartbroken obvisouly i lost my girl of dreams.A one im a milion,i told my friend this and he said it was my fault and how she was just being freaky and she isnt wrong about just being freaky.How can that not be too early then is my question she literaly said i will tie you and all you get to do is watch that is not too early to say? Idek she deleted me from tiktok but left us friends on ig main accounts and ig private and on facebook too.And on that party my friend told me it was the night prior to the party that if i only waited one more night for that party me asking her that would not be a big deal since she already asked did i think about taking her somewhere else which i did so we can be just two of us.She and i and our friends still went to the party but i was mostly quiet and she looked at me a few times didn’t say a word 🥺 i remember coming back home and my dad asking me what is wrong why am i sad.I never cried and i still dont know how i held back the tears and i just said that she changed her opinion on me and he said there will be other girls.The same night she told me that i went to clear my mind and i scraped my front bumper+that day was stresfull at work too.When my dad asked me that question it just made my hearth break into a milion pieces because there is still that one glimmer of hope in my mind that she will come back say hey sorry i overreacted or her asking about me again or something happening.I later told my friend about how she said how he lied and he confronted her and basically told me how she said that she didnt lie.Nothing else and then said that i stop talking about her.I felt guilty when i came back home yesterday from a different party all these girls but non of them are her.I just want to hug her and not let go but i can’t now.And when my mom once came in my room and asked what happend to that girl you used to talk about i just was quiet she told me girls will come and go and i told her what happend she said that she overreacted but at the same time she told me that i asked her that a little bit too early and she told me that i need to take some time to let it grow itself and that she would fell in love with me as time goes on and she gets to know me.Her friend which i know from elementary and just sort of know and would hang out and talk a little bit sometimes started hating me seems like.I feel like she turned against me beacuse on the party she didn’t say a word to me.I have been through a lot alone a lof pain mentaly and physicaly i have been bullied the entire elementary school years i suffered a lot of pain but got through it alone.But this is a different type of pain she would have been my first girl.Because i never even tried to be in a relationship before.Knowing that she is not going to be the mother of my kids,that she will not be with me for the rest of my life hurts in a different way.I almost feel like there is something else that stopped her but i dont know what cant figure it out aswell and honestly its probably not worth to try to figure it out if she isnt interested.Which looks like she dont care one bit even if i died right now.And that is happening,i am literally dying i feel empty but dont want to feel that way i try to be thankfull to god but i still ask for her.So to recap everything i lost the girl of my dreams and now every girl i see i know that she isnt as perfect as her.Its been 2 weeks and i eventually just accepted the defeat and thing is if she messaged me right now all my homies tell me no man dont try she will make a fool from you i still would message her back right away no questions i still love her for who she is.Even tho i know that its a mistake from me.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1138981,public,self,Lost the girl of my dreams (long text),0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rjuyim/lost_the_girl_of_my_dreams_long_text/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,

He picked up the check with no hesitation, I didn’t even get the chance to get my wallet out. We said goodbye, he said he had a great time. Once I got home I texted him, saying I had a great time and that he should venmo me for lunch (it’s pretty normal to go Dutch where we live, we actually are Dutch lol). Also I just wanted to acknowledge him paying because I didn’t get the chance to while on the spot. He once again said he had a great time, too and: “No, don’t worry about it. You can pay next time.” I answered by saying thank you and promising I’d treat him to a snack he’d mentioned during the date and he said he’d keep me to that. 

It’s been almost a month since we had lunch together. However, I went out of town for a week in the meantime and he went out of a town a week later.

We've met a few times but I'm in the UK at the moment for Christmas. Usually, I wouldn't message anyone this much without meeting but it's all we can do so why not.

Anyway, the chat is hot and heavy. She's been sending me nudes which is obviously great. No complaints from me, surprisingly. 

Amidst the passion, she mentions last night that ""I've never shown anyone my body this much before""

To which I replied ""why am I so special""

She said ""You're just different to other guys. I feel safe to be myself with you""

And honestly, I get what she means because it's true. She really IS safe to be herself.

I feel this intense acceptance of her. I want her to show me all sides of her. Good, bad and ugly. She can feel profoundly safe with me because I won't fuck her over, lie to her and abuse her trust.

When I look into her eyes it isn't judgement. It's an appreciation of this amazing, beautiful woman in front of me. Not a desire to change her, just a playful wish to explore her.

And I think THIS is the key when it comes to women opening up to you as a man. 

Physically, emotionally, sexually, spiritually. 

It's SAFETY. 

If she doesn't feel physically, emotionally, sexually and spiritually safe with you, her guard will be up (and rightly so).

If you're finding that women are consistently ghosting you, being hot/cold with you or not opening up to you in the ways I mentioned above....

Maybe she just doesn't feel safe with you.

Now, you can't MAKE her feel that way. You can't make anyone feel anything and building safety with her is a long process. Longer for some guys than others, but still long.

But immediately you can work on being honest, vulnerable and setting the tone of the connection.

You can work on taking the lead (at least in the beginning). You can create a bubble between you where she can be fully herself without fearing judgement or harm from you. 

You can work on expressing yourself in direct, clear and unapologetic ways. That means your appreciation but also your boundaries (which also helps her feel safe).

You can soul-check your intentions. Do you just want to fuck her for your own ego? Do you just want her validation or approval? Do you care about her at all? Or is it all just for you?

Her openness to you is in direct proportion to how safe she feels with you.

And if she feels profoundly safe with you...

She will show you who she is. You will connect on a more profound emotional level. Your sex will be 1000x better. She will likely want to be around you way more because that kind of acceptance is extremely rare. We crave it.

So men. Learn from my lesson. It's as we've always been told.

Safety first ;)

Since when being masculine is considered toxic?

Treating your partner with lust, desire. Slapping her ass when i come home, making time to make sex out of nowhere, doing unpredictable things, not following routine, suprising your partner with new things.


As far as im concerned, pure lust and desire is objectification in simplest form.

I wont be naughty, i wont be prude i wont desire to do unimaginable things to someone who doesnt reciprocate or doesnt enjoy it at all.

So my question is:

Why is this considered objefication of women and its treated like the most hateful thing to do to women, while when im not doing it after they got used to it, its suddenly not okay that i stopped doing it, because they liked it.

It feels like im guilty for doing it. Feels like im guilty to be the villain to manipulate them only to show them what they will like or what not. How they are supposed to know what they like if they didnt try it yet.

Girl sits down. Proceeds to order double appetizers, double entrees (the most expensive on the menu) and then tells me she only drinks champagne. Of course, the restuarant doesn't sell champagne by the glass. She wanted the most expensive bottle of champagne on the menu. I told the waiter, no, MOET will suffice.

Im pretty shy and introverted guy, and i dont have really that much confidence in myself since im bigger guy (190cm tall, 122kg)

I(20M) used to have and still have a crush on my old classmate(20F), we havent talked since 4 years or something like that. We used to go out with our group of friends or chill at my place pretty much every night (the girl i have crush on was mostly the one who asked if we could go to my place etc). I stopped going out with them because of my injury, and after some time passed and i still didnt go out with them, they kicked me from that group (we also finished school that year and everyone went to study something else or go to work or something). I havent spoken to some of them for the last 4 years (I still talk with some of the boys, including the one who kicked me. He told me pretty much that since i didnt go out with them, then why am i in the group, he told me there was no hate, and i dont really give a fuck also about that group).

Im kind of shy, i never post any pics of myself anywhere, i just feel really awkward. I recently downloaded tinder (with fake name etc just to see who are using tinder near me etc), there was that same girl in tinder, and i dont know what to do. It just feels weird for me to make real tinder profile and swipe her right because tinder is pretty much ""hey, wanna date?"" kind of thing. Ofcourse i would like to date her,but i would like to start talking with her first etc, but it also feels really awkward to just message her on messenger or something since we havent spoken in so long.

 I was planning to message her and ask if she wanted to go to a song contest where they choose the song for Eurovision 2022. Its pretty much like a country based song contest, where winner represents our country at Eurovision. I know that she enjoyed the show alot when we were chilling at our place, she always loved watching it and even went to watch the live show. Thinking about saying like i got 2 tickets there for christmas or something and i dont have anyone else to bring or something, and i knew she was really interested in this song contest, and if she wanted to come. 

I have seen her sometimes around the city, when driving past her or something, and i cannot get her out of my head. I literally keep thinking about her. Ofcourse ive been thinking about her before, but now they have gone pretty crazy. Thinking about her got literally so bad that its difficult for me to even fall asleep, doesnt matter what time i go to bed, i still fall sleep around 3am, and my alarm is 5.30 am, So that really fucks me up at work.

What should i do?

I’m somewhat critical of my own body and I feel a lot of pressure when they expect me to start working out more or eat less but I also see it as them caring about me since I can be hard on my self about weight gain.

2nd date: better convo still seemed a lil nervous but he asked questions. Asked to kiss me tongue the whole time and I never gave tongue back my upper lip and near my chin was very wet. Again told me he liked me. He told his sister about me after the call, which occurred before the 2nd date.

the next day he texted me at work saying he was distracted at work ;) emoji

Did he say he liked me too soon-it seemed soon considering we met online

3rd date was going to be ice-skating. I was thinking of asking to reschedule but then before I could he told me he bough tickets. Does anyone think he is rushing or it was weird he told me he bought tickets? I feel like he did this because he sensed me pulling away and wanted to make me go on the date

He seems like a lovely guy sweet and kind over messenger just quite reserved and a lil nervous in person. Not sure if I should keep trying?

\*\*I have never seen him smile/laugh he never makes jokes and does not react when I do

he is not inexperienced with women he used to date a 9/10 law student for 4 years

The night I had introduced to her over drinks, he had only spoken to her. And later kept teasing me with her name. 

&amp;#x200B;

longer version: been seeing this guy for a month, slept over at his place for a week before he traveled to his home country for Christmas. Since date 1, I had noticed himc checking out other girls and he kept talking about how his exes are in love with him, etc. I thought he's doing that since he's insecure about his height (he's 165 cm) and so wants to show he's desirable. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I introduced him to my friends one night and he spent the entire night talking to just one girl friend of mine (they;re from the same city). She was also flirting with him. I walked out of the bar 4 hours later because I could not take it anymore. He followed me and told me that he was just trying to be nice and get along with my friends and was not interested in her. Anyway, he continued pulling my leg about the girl just for fun...until he met my friends another time and this time, I see my friend flirting with him. But I admit this time he didn't flirt - there was nothing from his side. 

&amp;#x200B;

2 days ago, my friend posted an Instagram story of her at a bar and he replied to the story saying ""I also want to come"". she told me this. i contacted him and asking him whats wrong with him because I don't want to be getting this unnecessary girl drama in my life - its awkward receiving messages from your friends saying my date messaged them this. he said he assumed I am with her and thought it was a normal message to send. he was looking for me in the rest of her insta stories later but didn't catch me and wondered why she found his message weird..I explained to him how he's always had 1000 girls in the picture, so much so, I don't expect us to go anywhere, but the least he could do is not hit on my friends when there's a million others he can find on bumble. 

&amp;#x200B;

AM I over reacting to this or do you also think it is weird for him to send such a message to my friend?

So then we start being open about our relationship at work and then rumors start that he is married, that he is a sex offender and ect. We talk about everything and he admits to me that he is a sex offender but that he didn’t have sex with a minor he said that he talked to a girl on Snapchat and got pics from her and once he realized she was underage he told her to stop contacting him and she got mad so she went to the police.....and then he told me he wasn’t married or living with the mother of his kids. Something wasn’t adding up to me it felt like he was lying and I tried leaving him countless times but it got to the point where he would beg me to be with him and since we worked together it was easier to just stay with him bc he would threaten me and say things like he was going to spread rumors about me or show people pictures of me so it was easier for me to just stay with him for the moment. Fast foward to yesterday, I kept trying to break up w him he started crying at work bc he had concert tickets and wanted to go w me even if it was the last time we hung out. I didn’t want to but after he started crying and acting hurt I was like fine I’ll go with you to the concert. We get to the concert and he is disgustingly fucked up can’t even stand straight, I had to baby him and at one point I decide to check his phone and read the convo between him and the mother of his child and sure enough the way the messages were they definitely lived together and were together. The night ended horribly he ended up breaking my phone and assaulting me bc I was talking to my ex even tho I kept trying to break up with him. I felt very suicidal after and it seems like from that first night of hanging w him my mental has been just getting darker and darker. I had to call my job and tell them about the assault and now I am pressing charges. I am so happy to say that I am out of this situation I hate that it had to get here. I say all of this to say, I’m never the type to judge anyone for their religion or anything honestly and although I am very spiritual. This situation really put my eyes in a different view when it comes to satanist, I don’t want to say all satanist are manipulative and liars but why is it that the one person I meet who is a satanist I have this horrible experience with? Most people assume satanist are bad people, I didn’t want to assume that but now I feel like I really should have.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1139030,public,self,Dating a satanist,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rk07j2/dating_a_satanist/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,

Everyone says talking about exes is a huge red flag, but I feel like it could actually be beneficial if people were more open about that (as long as they're being respectful ofc).

I've been talking with a girl I like the past 3 months, yesterday was our first date, we went to the cinema and had a couple drinks.

Date was going smooth but nearly at the end she said that right now she can offer friendship because she is healing from a past relationship (Due to her ex, she cut relationship with her parents, suffers anxiety and depression, etc.). 

I feel that since we are talking she cares about me because I've been like an emotional support for her, we do no talk about her past relationship, only about the problems with her parents, her job and her bad habits. She, in tears, said that im one of the reasons that make her feel motivated to never come back and improve in this new year 2022. 

After expressing the friendship thing, I said that I need to think about it because she knows that I care about her but I cannot risk my calmness and mental health. She, in tears again, said ""Please do not think, please don't change"" she indeed needs someone, but feel so broken to givin up her heart to someone at the moment. 

What do you, people of Reddit, think? What should I do? Stand still with her and see if the interest and the attention I give to her can change something in some months? Or maybe should I leave her on her way? 

I do the things because I care about her, but I feel lost after seeing her so broken and sad with herself.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1139029,public,self,"I've been talking with my crush a lot lately but she is really broken due to a past relationship, what to do?",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rk0gup/ive_been_talking_with_my_crush_a_lot_lately_but/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,
