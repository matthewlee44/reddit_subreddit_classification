When I say this I mean talking to women I don't know in public.  Small talk, hookups, etc are all incredibly difficult for me because I am utterly petrified as coming off like a desperate creep.  I'm incredibly self-conscious of how women I don't know feel around me. When women make extra space when walking by or when they cross the street very suddenly (rather than wait at a crosswalk or something) I always wonder if I did something that made them feel uncomfortable or if I creeped them out in some way.  I know I'm not the most attractive guy, but (I don't think, but dating apps have me second-guessing) I'm ugly either.  I'm just plain and average-looking most of the time. Due to this fear, I try to make myself as non-threatening as I can.  I try not to look at women in public, I try not to talk to women I don't know in public, I try to take up as little physical space as possible and try to appear as non-threatening as I can.  I have missed opportunities to talk with who I think would be interesting people.  I'm currently a Physics Graduate Student at a university and while waiting for my covid test I saw this girl with a very detailed homemade astronomy backpack and a T-shirt with stuff about general relativity on it and I was super interested to talk to her because I'm an Amature Astronomer and I love looking at the night sky, but I couldn't because I was worried about making her feel uncomfortable.  I have seen her 3 separate times and I'm kicking myself because I know I missed a huge opportunity to talk about an uncommon shared interest.    


This is not an aversion to talking to women either because when talking to my friends who are women, I have no such issues. This is purely when it comes to talking with women I don't know in public.  I come from a family where my twin sister and mother are very strong and outspoken women and I'm very sensitive to complaints women have about men.  I'm hyper-aware of how often women fear for their own lives or get creeped out by men walking up to them. I'm hyper-aware of how unsafe women sometimes feel around men and they do these things for their own safety because they feel that they can't trust men sometimes because too many men (which is a minority but not an insignificant minority) act like creeps toward women.  I vastly prefer when women ask me out rather than the other way around because it removes so much stress from me but that rarely happens because once again I'm a very plain-looking guy and two culturally it is the expectation for men to be the ones to make the first move.  However, this constant fear just paralyzes me from making the first move.   


I thought I would try dating apps to see if that would help, but again being a very plain guy I don't take very many photos of myself and I'm not that attractive. I have a few good photos and I posted the few good ones I had but they can't compare to some of the photos I find on dating sites.  I occasionally get matches but online dating has really started to hurt my self-confidence.  I know that online dating is really just an attractive game but it still hurts.   


Covid has really made this worse because I don't get the opportunity to talk in groups of people like I would normally to meet people.  This is made doubly worse because I also moved cross country during covid so I don't have a circle of friends where I live right now. That is what really helped me find dates in the past.  I don't have problems getting dates once people get to know me because I know I am a very interesting person to talk to.  I have a lot of really varied interests and I can usually hold conversations for hours with someone about any number of topics, even ones I'm not familiar with due to my curiosity and willingness to ask lots of questions.

We texted for two months, shared a mutual interest in art so we‚Äôd always exchange our work.

He would never talk about himself or reveal anything sensitive‚Äî I didn‚Äôt think this was a big deal because I am quite closed off myself. Whatever. I planned on returning to his city (I fly there for work pretty frequently and also have friends and family who live there) fairly soon so I figured we could save all the personal stuff for then. 

I would text him mostly towards the end of the week. This kind of became a routine. On occasion he would text me, but I definitely did most of the legwork. I remember there being two instances where he was like, ‚ÄúI have nothing of interest to share, just wanted to reach out and say what‚Äôs up.‚Äù I saw this as a positive sign. He had 0 reason to text me and he still did. Our conversations were always very surface level, we‚Äôd mostly just talk about how our weeks went.

Our last conversation was probably the best one we ever had. I sent him something I made, he asked about how my night was going, and the conversation took off from there. We went back and forth for a good 3 hours and at the end of the night he reiterated how impressed and proud he is of me and wished me a good rest of my weekend.

Since then, nothing. It‚Äôs been 10 days. Nothing from me and nothing from him. I guess in my defence I was trying to see if he would reach out.

So I (19f) am talking with this guy (22m) and we have an amazing connection. Currently we are fwb but it‚Äôs not like sex and not talk, we have sex and cuddle and admire each other. He‚Äôll hold me in my arms and tell me how cute I am, give me lots of kisses, and hold me close. We talked about where we stand after the first night we hooked up. I wanted an exclusive fwb situation but he doesn‚Äôt want to commit to that and be able to meet other people when he is actually ready to be in a relationship when he gets to the spot he wants to in life. 

He told me he would definitely date me and it‚Äôs not going to take it completely off the table and that the person he wants to be with could easily be me. but again he is working to improve himself so he doesn‚Äôt want to commit. The sex we have is amazing and we both expressed it‚Äôs the best we‚Äôve ever have, him even saying it‚Äôs addicting.

My question is why would he want to continue looking for potential partners for the future when he clearly likes me as a person and really enjoys sex with me. He makes his love for my personality and character well know and compliments it all of the time. I am a unique individual and honestly believe that there aren‚Äôt many girls out there that would be as goofy as me and have my little quirks. Essentially I am one of a kind and he will not find anyone else like me. 

He didn‚Äôt just start meeting new people by talking to me, he has been doing so, so he‚Äôs been around a bit. He told me that he is so so so happy that we met and that he really wants me in his life one way or another. 

My problem is I can‚Äôt stand the thought of him treating someone else like he does with me and giving them such an intense amount of affection and having sex with them (again why would he when out of 12 people I‚Äôm the hottest and the best?). 

I realize all of this is his choice and his right, I just personally and sitting here letting it eat me alive. 

He told me he would tell me if he does start to talk to other girls and I‚Äôm afraid that when that time comes I‚Äôm going to lose my shit.

So basically now she‚Äôs questioning if she has any sexual attraction to me at all because I tried to initiate it the morning after our last sleep over and she said she wasn‚Äôt into it. She stated  that she loves spending time with me she is attracted to me she enjoys cuddling and kissing me but doesn‚Äôt feel an urge to be sexual with me.

This person will forever stain any recollection I have of my old high school. Sometimes it feels so hard to believe this even happened to me, as it feels like something one can easily find on the pages of a corny romance novel. I swear whenever I think of this I can not help but find humor in how much it all seems to feel like a plot of some dumb chick flick. Anyways, here we go.

August 2017.

I had just returned to school following a rather enjoyable summer gone south, as less than a month prior my Nana died. It was rough as we were very close. I was employed at the local pizza place and was working less than part time. In other words I was still very much a teenager. I will not obsess over every detail as doing so will consume a lot of time and turn this simple Reddit post into a novel, which can easily be done as I love to write. Anyways I met this girl when during orientation of my Sophomore year. I did not directly introduce myself to her but we caught eachothers eyes during this interaction. Shortly after this I began to notice her shyly greeting me and blushing when we saw eachother. I did not entertain the possibility of her liking me, as she was H O T. I am talking absolutely gorgeous here. If you have ever seen Pulp Fiction, she looked a lot like that latina cab driver portrayed by Angela Jones. Like model material. Needless to say I felt she was out of my leauge, although girls have liked me before and asked me out, I often remained single due to some issues I had. She would often stare at me and shyly greet me as though she had a crush on me. I did not think it was possible, as my self esteem was shit. This continued throughout the year until the beggining of my junior year.

We ended up in the same class that year. At that time I was studying a certain language  and was well learned in it. I was deeply devoted to eventually becoming fluent in this language. I would often speak said language around my classmates, as I knew they wouldn't understand me, considering that this language was rarely spoken in my city. Anyways this girl approaches me and asks me what I said. I tell her and she suggests that I teach her. Great, now we have an excuse to talk. I though she genuinely wanted to be study partners and was excited that I had someone else to study this rare but beautiful language with. From then on she would flirt with me more, tease me more, and just talk with me more. One time we met eyes as I was walking down the hall and she smiled, looked down and blushed, It was then I was considering the posibility of her liking me.  For the longest time I suspected she wanted to be good friends, and was genuinely interested in being study partners. The flirting continued on her end and then one day right before Thanksgiving Break she asks me to hold her bag whilst she goes somewhere. Right before she leaves she tells  me "" u/whenthesunbleeds I want to let you know that I like you too. "" Then she ran off without giving me a chance to respond as if she feared what I would say next. 

Later that day, in the final period for the day she tells me clearly that she likes me, and that she has had a crush on me. Hearing this made me happy and estatic, but at the same time nervous. This beautiful girl has a crush on me but I have no way of being a good BF for her. Just for some context, I was quite depressed at that time, considering that I was mourning the death of a fiend and that I was having some issues at work. I was definitely not in a place to date or be with anyone, and in some way, Ii still am not today. ( I am a recovering addict)  She then began to put her hands on my shoulkders and caress them. It felt amazing. I was already falling in love with her at this moment, more so than any other girl. I wish I could say that I accepted her invitation to love her. I wish I could say that I kissed her. I wish I could say that we are together today. But no, I freed myself from her embrace and left the class without saying a word. I know I must have looked like a huge jerk, but I didn't know what else to do. I did like her..But I knew that allowing her into my life during this ugly time eouldnt end well. She deserves someone who isnt burdened with so many issues. She continued to greet me warmly on the rare days I did attend school, until one day I got kicked out for not going and completely lost my chance. I think about her a lot. I replay that day in my head a lot...But perhaps it was not meant to be. I still need to work on myself before I begin to share my life with others. Wherever she is and whoever she is with I hope she is happy.  I wish I can forget about her and move on, but alas it is never that easy is it? 



TLDR:  I met a beautiful and sweet girl who I imagine I hurt via my thoughtless actions. I have learned to work on myself so  I will be ready to be an ideal partner.

Which one is easier to deal with?

When looking for a job, you look for job listings and send in your resume. Many places won't contact you. Some places might call you in for an interview but will reject you after the interview. Some places might give you a second or third round of interviews only to reject you. A smaller number of places might give you a trial period. Some places might give you the job after that.

In some instances, you might get offered the job after the first interview.

At every level of the selection process, you think to yourself that there might be a chance you could get the job or not. It's not too dissimilar with dating where you have to convince the person to go on a date with you. Some might not want to see you after the first date, some might go on a few dates with you only to not want to see you anymore. At any of these stages you might picture a possible future with this person, only to get rejected.

The major difference I see is that when looking for a job, many might already be employed, just in a job they aren't completely happy with, so they're looking for something better. So if you get rejected in this circumstance, you still have a job to go back to, albeit one you're not fully satisfied with. However, it's still a job that can help pay the bills. With looking for a partner, most people are single so if they get rejected, you go back to being single. There's usually no stop gap in the meantime before you can find your true partner.

Another thing I feel is that romantic rejection is a rejection of your entire being. A job rejection might be simply you don't have the skills required for that job, so it doesn't feel as personal because it might just be one aspect of your person. Or they might have found a better candidate. With dating that's the same, but for some reason knowing or even thinking that they're met another person they like more than you can be heart shattering. It's a hit to the ego more than a job rejection I feel. 

When you get romantically rejected, it just feels more personal. You might really like a job because it pays well, is close to home, for a company you really want to be part of. But with romantic rejection, it seems like they're rejecting you as a person on every level. It's not as bad if you ask a stranger out and they're only judging you on your appearance and a very brief and quick interaction, but if they've gone out with you a few times and reject you, it feels like they've seen what you're about and thought to themselves that they don't want to have anything to do with you. And that stings. The pain from which can affect your mental health for a while.

I (24F) started dating when I was 22. When I started dating I met this guy (30M) and we started dating, ended up engaged and then broke up horribly... he was the first guy I've ever dated and this scarred me pretty bad.

One of our greatest issues was me ABSTAINING from sex till marriage, while he wanted us to be sexually active since the first month of us dating. I was totally against that and wanted us to learn more about each other and such. He kept on opening the subject of sex every now and then, and every time I would till him now is not the right time.

He proposed to me and we even started looking for a place together and worked on the interior design of the apartment we were considering.

I asked him one time if he was upset that we still haven't had sex although we've been together for a year and he replied ""I would be upset of we haven't had sex in a month over the relationship"".

One day we were having a date and suddenly he burst out and kept shouting at me for that he ""can't take it anymore"" and ""I should've done what crazy guys do"", implying forced sex. After this I told him I no longer want any problems and he could have sex if that's destroying our relationship. He ended up turning cold on me and would stop initiating conversations with me, refuse to have dates and such, although I said he could do what ever he want.

After several months I could not take it and ended up asking to break our engagement, which is what happened.

It's not that I've no sexual desires at all, it's that I've always been scared of the idea of sex, I was sexually harnessed by a family member when I was 10 ( which I shared with him), but I also wanted to share my first time with my husband... and him always opening the subject over and over made me uncomfortable, but when he proposed to me I thought he would understand...

I'm now open to dating and I'm scared of having to experience the same thing again.

Small talk, hookups, etc are all incredibly difficult for me because I am utterly petrified as coming off like a desperate creep. I'm incredibly self-conscious of how women I don't know feel around me. When women make extra space when walking by when I see women constantly looking when I'm walking behind them to campus, or when they cross the street very suddenly I always wonder if I did something that made them feel uncomfortable or if I creeped them out in some way. I know I'm not the most attractive guy, but I'm not ugly either. I'm just plain and average-looking.  I try to make myself as non-threatening as I can. I try not to look at women in public, I try not to talk to women I don't know in public, I try to take up as little physical space as possible and try to appear as non-threatening as I can. Today I missed an opportunity to talk with who I think would be an interesting woman. I'm currently a Physics Graduate Student at a university and while waiting for my covid test I a woman with a very detailed homemade astronomy backpack and a T-shirt with stuff about general relativity on it and I was super interested to talk to her because I'm an Amature Astronomer and I love looking at the night sky, but I couldn't because I was worried about making her feel uncomfortable. I have seen her 3 separate times on campus (the backpack was a giveaway each time) and I'm kicking myself because I know I missed a huge opportunity to talk about a shared interest.

This is not an aversion to talking to women either because when talking to my friends who are women, I have no such issues. This is purely when it comes to talking with women I don't know in public. I come from a family where my twin sister and mother are very strong and outspoken women and I'm very sensitive to complaints women have about men. I'm hyper-aware of how often women fear for their own lives or get creeped out by men walking up to them. I'm hyper-aware of how unsafe women sometimes feel around men and they do these things for their own safety because they feel that they can't trust men sometimes because too many men act like creeps toward women. I vastly prefer when women ask me out rather than the other way around because it removes so much stress from me but that rarely happens because once again I'm a very plain-looking guy and two culturally it is the expectation for men to be the ones to make the first move. However, this constant fear just paralyzes me from making the first move.

I normally don't have too much at get-togethers with groups of friends such as BBQs or other social gatherings where everyone is friends with someone because people are looking to socialize and once people get to know me and start talking to me I don't have any problems finding dates or asking people out.  I know I'm an interesting person and I can hold long, witty, and interesting conversations with others on a wide variety of topics. However because I'm attending Graduate school, my friend circle has reduced to Zero and Covid hasn't helped either.  I have tried online dating and I have gotten a few matches here and there but like many guys on here, being average looking means that online dating results in failure.  The one match I had that had resulted in a virtual meet-up has not really borne any fruit and though I think we will be good friends I really didn't feel anything click.  I've lost a lot of my confidence due to the online dating scene especially if it takes over a month of work to get a single meet-up that may or may not result in anything.

For example, I feel that the following are my ""minority"" traits:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Vegetarian.  Very little dairy.  Just nonfat Greek yogurt and a little cheese on pizza.

&amp;#x200B;

2. Don't drink alcohol.  Or caffeine.  Rarely take over-the-counter medications.

&amp;#x200B;

3. Relatively high wage earner.  Not a corporate ladder climber, just got a good education and am good at what I do.  I don't live extravagantly - have an average size suburban home and two vehicles that are 10+ years old (and one is a bit of an econo-box gas-mileage-wise).  I have a pile of second-chance paper towels and napkins that I keep for wiping stuff up.  I have an office-sized trash can in the kitchen so I can use plastic shopping bags in it instead of having to buy larger trash bags that I'm literally going to throw away.

&amp;#x200B;

4. Estranged from my parents.  I feel they failed in certain aspects as parents because of their own issues that has led to transgenerational trauma that has impacted my life in extremely negative ways.  The last straw was their betrayal by burying their heads in the sand and continuing to associate with someone else who they know has had direct negative impact on my life and that of my children, despite me directly telling them so.

&amp;#x200B;

5. Non-left, non-right political viewpoint.  Do what you want to do as long as it doesn't negatively impact anyone else.  You are responsible for your decisions and your life.  Don't expect anyone else to pay for your health care, your college, etc.  Don't have kids with someone and then cry to the government that you should get the lion's share of custody so that you can financially rape the other parent while the government holds them down.  Less government involvement in the lives of citizens (healthcare, abortion, guns, etc.)  The government should be there to make sure citizens' rights aren't violated, defend from other countries invading, maintain roads and infrastructure, and protect the environment.

&amp;#x200B;

6. Extreme do-it-yourselfer.  In 16 years of owning my home, the only thing I've paid anyone to do was install a new heat pump and extend a drainage culvert (and the latter was only because they could do the whole thing cheaper than I could buy the pipe).  I've installed a wood stove and built a hearth for it, front walkway, flooring, a radon mitigation system (that I designed), attic stairs, attic vent fan, attic flooring, ceiling fans, major yard excavating including horseshoeing the driveway, fencing, patio, built a jungle gym.  I also do all my own vehicle and equipment repair / maintenance.  I design and fabricate things that don't exist or because I can do it cheaper / better.

&amp;#x200B;

7. Like animals, but don't see the point of pets.  I've had fish, lizards, mice, rats, birds, cats, and have lived with someone who had dogs.  Maybe I'm just getting old, but I don't want to be an amateur zookeeper where I have to spend time and money on an animal.  I don't want to be tied down by an animal that I have to get home to feed, let out to go to the bathroom (or have my yard used as a bathroom), or pay someone to do those things when I go away.

&amp;#x200B;

8. Don't really have any friends.  I have a few guy buddies at work that are into similar stuff as me (cars, tinkering, guns), but we rarely hang out outside of work.  I just feel like everyone's too busy with their own families and their own lives and I don't want to be the loser single guy that's encroaching.

&amp;#x200B;

9. Not into watching/following sports.  I'd rather do something active myself.

&amp;#x200B;

10. Cynical / particular.  I have a lot of quirks about the way I do things and keep things in my house and other areas of life.  Tucking the front and back door curtains behind the door handle when I close them, ripping the four flaps off the tops of cereal and other food boxes once I open them, custom-made toothbrush holders that point the ends of the bristles down so they dry better, etc.  Wearing 30 dB noise-reducing ear muffs in my cubicle at work because some inconsiderate people think the whole common office space is their personal conference room where they can use their speakerphone for calls.

&amp;#x200B;

Do all these multiply together to create some ultra-minority where the likelihood of me finding someone compatible is some tiny fraction of a percent?

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I'm 40 and it kinda feels like that in itself narrows down the field so much already.  It reminds me of that car-finding-website commercial where the guy is standing there in a sea of cars and as he says what he's looking for, cars start disappearing until he's left with his perfect car.  Only it's the reverse and you feel like all the people you would mesh with are already in committed relationships and the people on dating sites are not what you're looking for in some aspect or another.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't live in or near a major metropolitan area either, so there's another narrowing of the field.

So backstory: I (25 M) have been friends with this girl (23) for a while, and we met on a dating app but never actually went on an official date (we have hung out a lot as friends). I recently asked her on a date (made it clear by using the word date specifically). She said yes but we ended up hanging out at her house instead (her roommate was there, but we snuggled up on the couch together). We rescheduled the date for a day later in the week on a day that she had something else to do but thought she could make it anyway. However, she didn‚Äôt end up being available; to me, it felt like I got blown off by her. Still, I do think she is interested as I asked about rescheduling again, but she informed me that she will be out of town for a few weeks.

This is all technically fine yet it bothered me a little. She went out of town on vacation and I got curious because I hadn‚Äôt been on the dating app in a while and saw that she had updated her profile and set her location to her vacation spot on the dating app (it's one where you have to set your location). It‚Äôs within her right to do so as we‚Äôre not officially dating but still made me feel very unwanted and my heart sank a little. It does make me question how she sees me. Weirdly, she did add me on some social media platforms as well this week. Not sure where I stand, but it has me feeling a bit down.

For context, at the tail end of summer last year I moved home from college after graduating to my hometown, a medium sized city that's big enough to have new faces, but lots and lots of old faces as well.

Quite frankly, moving home was terrible, without the ability to go out, a stagnant job market, and none of my friends being around and the ones who are around I'm just not that close with, this has definitely been probably the loneliest times of my life, and I fell into a rut of being stuck.

I got COVID pretty badly in January, and decided to redownload a dating app just out of boredom in quarantine, and every other face was a person from high school I dread of being even seen with, until a particular girl came across who I matched with that I immediately thought was the cutest thing ever, and still do, dark black hair, she's tall but so am I, dark skin, freckles with a good song in her profile and a funny ass bio.

I don't really fall for girls ever, I'm a relatively stoic person, I had one serious crush in college beforehand, but that's about it. I told myself I'd hit her up once I'm out of quarantine, and had my shit together.

I got out of quarantine, I quit smoking cigarettes which was a bad habit I picked up from being home out of stress/boredom, started working out again, and started working part time just to save up money and get my own spot, with hopes of subletting somewhere for the summer and figure out something later on.

She never weighed that heavy on my head, but I always had her in the back of my head that she would be someone I'd love to get to know if I had the chance this summer, and once I had my shit together a bit, and was always a bit of a motivating factor in my attempt to get my life back on track a bit.

Three days ago, I checked if she was still around for the first time since we matched, and she was still on there, I dunno why but I didn't hit her up then, I really have made strides since I first initially matched with her and I had thought of something funny in my head to say, but just figured I had too much to do over the weekend and I'd get to it on Monday once I'm free because I didn't wanna text her initially then leave her in the dark.

Opened it up today with the intention of sending a text I plotted on for a few days and she was gone, either unmatched or deleted her account.

I feel like such an idiot, and realize I am, all this time I was trying to fix myself for the better because I thought I couldn't actually be good enough for something that I was interested in for once but in reality I probably was just fine. I have this hole in my stomach like I just got shot with a double barreled.

I realize, it probably doesn't mean shit, there's always the next one, you didn't even talk to her, and you don't even know if you two would've connected. But I learned lesson the hard way that apathy does you no good if you really feel something, I think it came down to being nervous I wasn't good enough and lack of self confidence, now I'm left with a feeling of deep loneliness that's rid me for a minute since everything went to shit a year ago.

Her IG got recommended to me a few months ago and I didn't follow because I didn't wanna be weird, and I still don't wanna be weird and I probably won't follow but part of me wishes I just DM'ed her in the first place.

1. Corny to send a pic of you holding a flower?

There is sending a handwritten card but it will probably not get there on the right day (birthday, valentine's day?)

&amp;#x200B;

2. What might be some good options? 

3. Could send a picture of a handwritten letter and my hand, I guess, too corny?

Eventually if I git gud at taking selfies, idk that could be an option but could end up looking douche-bagy too

Dated a girl in high school, well, ""dated"" is a strong word, we went to formal together and hung out a few times. We were technically a thing, but it was pretty clear it wasn't going anywhere, she had overbearing (slightly racist) parents that hated me for existing and she had extremely high aspirations and the raw intellect to match so I can see why dating wasn't exactly super important to her.
All the same, everything she did made me feel happy, I swear her smile could light up a city, her empathy, intelligence, talent for everything left me in awe. And I truly felt something for her that I couldn't describe, I'd been in high school relationships before but I was still discovering myself. So what I felt for her was really hard to comprehend. 
Then one day she ended it, said she couldn't talk to me any more and that she couldn't really explain. I tried to figure it out, but respect her wishes and just let it go without an answer. (honestly the hardest thing I've ever done) and just like that, it was over...

It's definitely had an impact on me in a few other relationships, but it's still the only one I can look back on with any semblance of happiness. The problem is that happiness comes with a real uncomfortable longing, especially after coming out of a few really rocky relationships. 

Not knowing why it ended or having any real closure made it hard to move on, but now (6 years later) we've started talking again, she's made it pretty clear we're just talking and hanging out as friends, and as much as I want to respect her and just move on, she's a great friend and the last thing I want to do is impose in her life, but I can't help but want something more.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,767127,public,self,An old Ex,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n9q7q2/an_old_ex/,all_ads,6,,,

I came back to her after 3 weeks and when I confronted the topic she admitted to me she was sleeping with someone else.

We carried on dating as I didn‚Äôt care about the fact she slept with someone else after a short period of time because if she truly liked me that shouldn‚Äôt be a problem.

Later down the line I asked her who he was, I‚Äôm a clean cut guy so if a girl asks me about my body count or names for a general conversation I‚Äôm going to keep it real regardless of their reaction. 

She told me it was someone I wouldn‚Äôt know who lived far away, I replied ‚Äúoh so just a one night stand with a random guy‚Äù

She replied ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt call him just a random guy‚Äù 

Because she wouldn‚Äôt tell me his name and the response I got, I found it strange so I left...
