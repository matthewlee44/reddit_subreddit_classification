0,sh6q3v,1643650040,The Dreaded Fade,"I went out with a great woman 3 times.  The dates were awesome.  Great conversation, mutual attraction, flirty texts, we both initiated dates/texts, etc.  Then something happened and her messages turned from flirty to polite and she stopped initiating.  She canceled a date due to being sick  (not Covid) and having a lot of things going on in her life.

I am not asking why this is happening or whether she is interested.  I know I will likely never find out what happened and I believe there is a 99% chance she is no longer interested.  Actions speak louder than words and all that.  I'm fully aware many people do this to backburner someone while they are seeing someone they like better or because they hope to avoid delivering bad news.

What I am asking is how you handle it when it appears someone is trying to fade you rather than just tell you they aren't interested.  Especially after multiple dates.  3 dates is not a lot, but it is not nothing.

When I proposed going out again once she is feeling better, she texted, ""Sounds good!""  That was last week.  So, she just responds politely but there is clearly a lack of interest on her part due to another guy, finding something she doesn't like about me, other priorities, etc.  It feels like this could drag out with her just being polite until I stop texting altogether.

My friends are all married and they give terrible advice because they just don't get how dating currently works.  Their advice is, ""She told you she was sick and had stuff going on in her life.  That doesn't mean she's not interested.  Who uses being sick as an excuse?  There's a pandemic and everybody is going through a lot of shit right now.  Just text her every once in a while to see how she's doing.""

So I turn to you to see how you would handle it and see if I may be missing any options.

I see my options as:

1. Cut off all contact
2. Text periodically to see how she's doing in the very, very low likelihood she's interested but actually dealing with big stuff
3. Send a direct text along the lines of, ""It seems like you have less interest in continuing to see me than a couple weeks ago.  If that's a correct assumption, it's all good.  I just did not want to misinterpret things if you are still interested.""

TL;DR: After 3 dates, awesome woman has plausible reason for canceling date #4 and changes tone of texts from flirty to friendly.  I believe there is a 99% chance she hopes I lose interest.  How would you handle it - stop texting altogether, text once every week or two to check in, send a direct but non-confrontational text to task about her interest level?",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/sh6q3v/the_dreaded_fade/

We went out on a date and We both had a great time. The next day We made another date, however She has become very clingy with in the last few days . 
While We already have plans for another date . I’m thinking of ending it or at least tell Her I want to slow down. 
Most women I have dated this stage of the relationship has always been filled with head over heels excitement, but this time it is not there . I am even wondering if I am really attracted to Her. 
Should I just end it , or give it a little more time ? 
I fear that I may hurt my friends feelings by ending it so soon , and I also don’t want to do anything that my friend or this woman would consider hurtful. 

When I expressed how clingy She was to my friend . She said ( In a joking way ) , “ you done fucked up ,Your Welcome! “ 
We both had a chuckle at this comment ( not in a nasty way ) 

The biggest issue or perhaps the real issue is the friend is the one a have a crush on !! 

Yeah , I definitely done fucked up’ed !!

3,shdroa,1643666946,What do you do when you are just kind of over it?,"  

I don’t spend much time here. It’s kind of depressing, and I take it men and women don’t much like each other, if this place is representative of anything. Skip to the bottom for the TLDR.

I’m a 45 yr old man. Divorced by no choice of my own, even if I am the one that filed. The 3 kids are grown and graduated. The oldest 2 live with me as I have got them started in my industry. I have no obligations to anyone. I have an excellent career in a very in demand industry in a field ops manager role. Next logical step is a director position. The company I work for is well established and I am part of the start up team for a brand-new division. I haven’t made less then 100k in a decade. Work life is on point.

Financially, I’m 3 years post separation and closing in on 1 year actually divorced. Covid delayed it by at least 6 months. All obligations have been taken care of almost a year in advance of my youngest sons graduation a year ago. I walked away from everything and took all the bills. I kept my toys and a few meager possessions. I have since replaced everything with brand new items of higher quality and I get to dictate how it all looks. I now get to spend my time collecting things that interest me. I like sports cars, motorcycles, rustic antiques, Old West stuff of any kind, and several other things. I never plan of mixing finances again. I abhor the idea of anyone helping me out financially. I maintain 2 residences as I work on the road and have for about 15 years.

Physically, I’m 45, shit happens. I definitely don’t act my age, but I’m fully functioning adult. I’m 5’8” 160 with a BMI of 24. I consider my self average, but working on it. I set goals this year to get back into the gym as I want to see if I can get to six pack form. I want to do it for me because I lost roughly 70 pounds a couple of years ago and was on a good track until I injured my back. Now that I am comfortable that I won’t hurt myself again, I want to try to achieve my original goal. I’m bald. I don’t hide it. Yes I wear a hat, but it has nothing to do with hiding it. I cant be hidden, I own it. I shave clean on a regular basis. I have false teeth. I had them knocked out in a fall in a wind turbine years ago. I can’t do anything about it and it hasn’t been an issue to this point. I obviously don’t date dentists. Lol

Mentally, I’m at peace and have been content for some time. I didn’t have a good start and was hustling by the time I was 13. A 20 year marriage that was very one sided for many years that ended in a craptastic dumpster fire.  I have faced and fought my daemons and they are put in their place. Yes, everyone has baggage. Mine is cleaned, packed, and in the attic. I have my moments like anyone else, but I know my emotions, what drives them, what triggers things and I process them. My emotions are mine and mine alone and I can share or keep them to myself at my option. 

Socially, it’s a mixed bag. I regularly talk shop with Directors and VP’s. I oversee and lead teams of various sizes up to 500 people. I can talk to just about any one, because I have to. I have several young men I mentor at my job. That is a main job function for me. My industry is a sausage fest. Its annoying watching men make absolute asses of themselves when a woman is around. I have more passing social acquaintances than I can count, a few tight knit teams that I collaborate with, a smaller circle of pretty good friends and a couple of guys I can count on for anything. My job takes a lot of my time, all my friends are married or not single. I work on the road. It is wheat it is. 

With all that being said, dating has not been my cup of tea, and why I ask the question. I honestly believe context matters in a lot of the questions. That why I wrote a book. I was on the dating sites shortly after I separated. I won’t let someone keep me down. I move on. I have never once lied in my profile and I always stated I was separated living in a different state. There has never been a lie in my profile at all. I strive to undersell and over deliver. It’s a character quirk. I have had 5 women that I have dated in various capacities, none lasting longer than a couple months. I’m on all the big sites and a couple of others. I pay for a couple to maximize exposure. My tend to be very specific on what I’m looking for, so I don’t swipe right on many, maybe 1 in 200 or more. I prefer to hold one conversation/date at a time so I can focus on getting to know someone. Before my divorce I didn’t send many messages or likes due to the opinion is that a separated man is some where between a married man and a lying married man. Since my divorce, I haven’t sent many either, due to lack of honest choices and lifestyle differences. Seriously, once you take away the sketchy, social media, and over all no effort profiles, there isn’t many options left. I was seriously considering hiring a pro to do a dating profile shoot and have a profile review, now I’m not feeling it.

In real life, I can walk into any bar and be hit on consistently and never start a conversation. Sex is cheap, and to be honest lack luster at best since my divorce. I don’t claim anything, I just go by my experiences. I can’t be bad looking due to the feedback quite a few women have given, I kind of am over the ‘Hey sexy or handsome” messages. I feel they are low effort and a turn off. 

Thanks for reading.

TLDR. My life is phenomenal. I have no obligations and I’m at peace. I’m not sure the effort is worth the return in dating and I’m very cautious of screwing up my almost perfect life. Not that it matters because I travel for a living and my schedule makes it hard to connect.

9,shlxwl,1643689436,"Ok, guess this is silly…","Alright Reddit, let’s see whatcha got for me here. So I’ve been seeing this woman for going on four months, and it’s been great. We’re really falling for each other, and we’re having a blast going on fun dates, getting to know one another and our respective families and friends. It’s really been the opposite of most of my relationships I’ve had and tho there’s been trials, it’s been things we’ve been able to be there for each other and us, well we’ve been just..easy. And I love it. So, here’s the big question, and I’m sure some of you may think it’s silly, so I’ll explain. The big V-day is coming up, what should I do for this girl on valentines? I wanna make it special and show her how much I care but I obviously don’t wanna go all diamonds and love since we aren’t long term yet. Ideas completely welcome. 

Now, my caveat: I haven’t done any *real* Valentine’s Day stuff since I was a teen. My ex (who I was with roughly 20 years) didn’t care for “the corporate holidays” one bit. I’d always do something small and get her something but I never had to go all out. A card, some candy, maybe a stuffed animal or some trinket and boom, done. I’d really like to wow my new woman, since my last few dating excursions after my ex wife left have been…not like this. I think she’s just wonderful and amazing so I’d like to show that to her in how the holiday plays out and what I surprise her with. 

So, what should adulty adults do for valentines? I’ve had a couple ideas I’ll share later but I’m going to bed for now, so hopefully someone will see this and respond lol",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/shlxwl/ok_guess_this_is_silly/

17,shxvun,1643730026,Should i go to gym if my ex broke up recently and i know she is there?,"Hi and good afternoon!

An absurd question, i know (sorry for my english, not my native language).

My gf broke up with me around 5-6 days ago. No contact all these days and we don't want contact, we are two very proud people. But we go to the same gym, and it's impossible that we don't see each other there some afternoon, we both liked that and like sports a lot and also i need it for my back, i've to work hard after an injury.

It's simple as this:

1. I want to move on and do my gym, it makes me good for my body and my mind now. It's hard, feelings are there still. I can wait a couple weeks when i will be  (i hope) better and my self steem better.
2. I can easily go another time, but it changes my daily routine some days, and for some reason, it's just like thinking why i should do this? why i should get another day? if i see her, fuck her (not in a bad vibe, it's just like saying leave me alone that i want to move on). 

Well, on one side, i bet she is doing her thing and she does not care. On the other side, i should not think about what she thinks or does, this is time for me.

But it's an awnkward moment)(if it happens) and i don't want to see her or that she sees me searching for a reaction or something or that she thinks that i'm trying to stalk her or look her or whatever. My inner self says: relax, take time, you can choose another schedule, even it's not too nice for you now.

But i want to really do my routine.

I know that maybe it's a bit inmature question, but i'm still hurted and having good/bad days like a rollercoaster and i'm on my way trying to forget her and it's awkward. Don't wan't to return with her, absolutely (i know life changes things fast, but not in my mind right now and can't see it in a future).

So, what do you do in this situation, what's the best for me right now to keep moving on and being happy, what's the smart move. =)",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/shxvun/should_i_go_to_gym_if_my_ex_broke_up_recently_and/

I was just wondering if any other women out there are constantly being asked if they are a guy or trans? Or having men demand ""proof"" of being a natural born woman?

I understand that I am not the prettiest woman out there and I am heavy... but I certainly never thought I would be accused of being a man on a daily basis.

The other thing I don't get is getting accused of being a ""catfish"" even though all of my profiles are verified. What the heck is wrong with people? I am honest, kind, considerate and guys still treat me like a sack o' shite... like less than a human being.

The amount of sexual harassment, unsolicited dick pictures and threats of violence are also incredibly shocking. Most of the opening lines are just creepy and misogynistic. I have had guys message me telling how they would rape me. I report these but seemingly nothing is done. 

Of the men I have met in person... every one of them has lied to me about their intentions and ghosted me. Including 2 that I dated for 6 months each (one even talking about living together and marriage) and another I was seeing for a year. Then there was the one who told me that he was divorced and after a few months I found out he was still married.

20,si0jzu,1643736801,Rant,"There are so many weird people out there - I just ended things with someone who was involved still with an ex who still had feelings for him (but he called a “friend”) and was controlling and jealous. Something felt off after a while. Anyway I’m taking a break from online dating because having someone treat me the way he treated me - allowing his ex to monopolize his time and energy with her emotional “chats” that would leave him unable to spend time with me, and then incessant texting when she knew he and I were together. He did nothing about any of it. No boundaries. It made me feel like garbage because clearly my time and energy were worthless and this ex could barge in anytime and way she wanted and he’d just put up with it. 

I would never allow someone to treat me that way and sabotage my choices and life - and certainly not someone who says they care about me. I also can’t date someone who allows someone else in their life to be so blatantly disrespectful to me or them. It’s like being subject to some strangers emotional roller coaster of jealous, controlling, and manipulative behavior. That is not living, and it’s not friendship. I’m not a generally angry person but I’m so angry about being suckered into this situation in my 40s that I just have to take a break. 

Also, if only these fucked up people who do controlling and abusive things were outed so their peers could see how horrible they are, maybe they’d be shamed into behaving with some basic decency for other people.

21,si118z,1643738051,Commitment issue or we just want different kinds of relationships,"My (39 yrs old) bf (42 yrs old) have been dating for 2.5 years. I have been up front that I want kids and long term relationship. That’s my goal. Not necessarily marriage, but we should live under same roof and share daily life with each other if relationship goes well. 

We are happy together. Have same view about people, world, etc, same hobbies. We enjoy each other in general. 

The conflict part is my bf is happy with where we are at now. We live 30 mins away from each other. Spend all the weekends and holidays together. He has no motivation to move in with me. We both own our own house. 

We almost broke up last year because he failed to meet the schedule he promised about moving in. He said he was not ready to commit that much yet. Then he asked me to be patient and reassured me that it will happen, but refused to offer a new date. It has been another 4 months since then. I tried to be a supportive and understanding gf and gave him more time. But so far, nothing happened. He is not preparing about moving in although he talks about it occasionally. 

We talked the passed weekend. I made sure he understands I love him and want a future together. I think we are ready to take a step forward. But conversation didn’t go nowhere. He said it’s too cold to move that weekend. 

I’m torn now. We love each other. But I can’t figure out why he refuses to move in with me. We do talk about future quite a bit. I do believe he sees a future with me. But I don’t see he draws the path with me from now to the future. 

I don’t know what to do. I’m hang now.  He is a good guy and I believe we love each other.  But I can’t just date like this forever.

25,si90lq,1643758175,Men …tell me what he is thinking?,"
Met a guy whom I was attracted to physically. I had sex with him a couple of times and basically started the slow fade process because he wasn’t really my type and I didn’t want to start developing feelings for him. He strikes me as someone who is keeping his options open and multi dating ( seeing others). He doesn’t deny that he is a player when asked and is pretty honest about seeing other women. He told me he wasn’t looking for something long term which I agreed was the same for me when we met. Though I stopped keeping in touch, he’d continue to text me. 

We became friends and kept in touch sporadically. He would help me with little favours and basically would do nice things for me ( ie , cook for me). When we met up initially he would still try to initiate sex. After a few times of being rejected, he stopped trying. When we meet, he’d still often hold my hands , hug me or kiss ( with no plan for it leading to sex usually since it’s a public place ) . I don’t mind the physical contact or the PDA since I don’t have a bf and I do miss the physical contact. I know the multi dating is still going on and hear stories about the girls he dates.  The more I learn about him, the more I feel logically he doesn’t make a good partner and my initial gut feeling him was right ( that he isn’t my type) . We talked about how we are “ friends” and I even asked him before why does he bother to keep in touch (with me) since sex is off the table. He said “ life isn’t just about sex all the time”. 
The thing is the nicer he is to me, the more it is difficult for me to see him just as a friend. He no longer initiates trying to have sex anymore but I am on the other hand practicing a lot of self restraints not jumping him. I hope I don’t offend anyone with the cynicism but what does he want really? 
Is he really just interested In a friendship ? Or is he playing the long game?",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/si90lq/men_tell_me_what_he_is_thinking/
26,si9cuj,1643759112,I'm annoyed and even more annoyed.,"39F. I don't even know why I'm posting this but I feel like screaming right now. Sorry if its a jumbled mess. A man that I was talking to through OLD for 6 weeks late last Summer/early Fall has been trying to contact me. I have not spoken to him since October. This man lied to me about everything. 

I honestly couldn't even tell you what he told the truth about? Because it would be a very short list. It's that bad. I think he was only honest about his pictures/video calls he sent. 

Before anyone gives me hell for talking to someone for 6 weeks and not meeting them, please note that we live a few hours away from each other. And yeah, I already know it was stupid of me. It's incredibly difficult to meet someone near my age without children in my Midwestern town. And it's even more difficult to find someone whom i get along with so well.

 So one evening I started talking to this man through a dating app who messaged me. We'll call him Todd. 

Todd and I had a great conversation that evening and quickly moved to talking over the phone. He was interesting, witty, engaging, and could talk about everything and anything. We also held many of the same beliefs (or so I thought) which is very important to me. 

We would talk and text nearly everyday from then on.  Then one day he slipped up about his age. He had told me he was 45. One day we were talking about pop culture stuff and he said ""How could i possibly know about that?"" Then something about being way older than me, and I was like huh? You're 45.  When I pushed further he kept lying then finally told the truth. 

He was really 49 which didnt bother me. The lying did. He apologized profusely and I ended up forgiving  him. Again, dumb of me. But I didn't care about his age. I don't even know why he lied about being 4 years younger? It's not a huge difference to me.

Well I'm going to fast forward ahead because I don't want to bore you guys. But we were super close to meeting one another last October. Like within a week. I asked for his last name and wanted to Google him before we were going to meet.   

 You guys, he lied about everything. His job, his age, etc. Other things he told me which didn't add up. So I confront him and we get into a huge fight. He then brings up his ex and how he still speaks to her. Wtf. I think he brought her up to hurt me, which it did. All of it did. I wasn't in love with this man, but I started to have feelings for him.

Well I told him to fuck off and to never contact me again. I block his number. Then he ends up contacting me under a different number 3 weeks after that. No apology, nothing. Just something along the lines of ""Have you found anyone yet?""
 I let it go and ignore the text.

 I haven't spoken to him in over 3 months. He just messaged me literally 30 minutes ago under a phone # that i didn't recognize. It said ""Do you miss me or the great conversations we had at all?"" I asked ""Who is this?"" And he says Todd. Then he tells me some B.S that he's been thinking about me adlot lately.  

I then again tell him to fuck off. I'm fuming right now. I don't even know what I'm asking or why I'm posting this... I'm assuming he's only contacting me because no one else wants his sorry ass.

28,siassa,1643763028,The Truth About Why Break Up on Short Relationships hurts so much,"Hi! This is going to hurt, but this can help me a lot and maybe some catarsis about you if you can feel me or give me what do you think. Thanks in advance. English is not my native language, so be nice. ;-)

I'm 6 days from a hurting break up after 3 months and a half. I posted recently here and i'm now a little advanced.

I think a lot about what happened. That seems so nice it is hard to understand. But the doubts she said that last night, after provoking the break up (she told me she needed time first, i said no, she said she break up finally and no remorse), that final fight after i called her and said i was sorry for how i talked to her when i drive her to his home to return my things...

Well... she was so cold, and ruin, and harmful i did the same. I told her: why are you hurting me, and then i started doing the same. Why do yo say that we are not in love, that she's not going to change what she thinks (these days i notice she never, repeate, never, tried to talk about how i felt about some things in our relationship and never said that she understands how i felt, now i notice it after 3 months... man... love si so blind, you know...)

After all the things we said to each other, no one in their right mind would go back with a person like that (or one like me in that moment). 

I think i had a toxic relationship. But, do you know what.

I miss sleeping with her. I miss when she intertwined his feet with mine and held my hand. When she play with me like a little girl or do jokes made jokes about my hobbies or my way of being, even if they were biased.

The real thing about breaking up is that you have all those fantasies about:

1. What are she doing?
2. Does she ever loved me during this time?
3. Is she missing me?
4. Is she with another guy?
5. Why she did not text me or call me after a week?

People, this is so hard, so hard. This rollercoaster up and down.

For my perspective, i'm not a perfect guy, she was with me because i had all she needed and fits into her idea in that moment. Translated: she want to date a guy, with no compromise, having fun, and i was so nice to her. Not in an idiot way: she liked me. Maybe not in love with me, but some day, maybe a few days or a week after our last fight (it was our FIRST and SO RUDE fight, and was so harmful) she was thinking she have doubts.

She told me that night. She asked herself if she loves me, or if she likes me, our last day together at a nice resort she said she felt so nice, but in bed she said she felt weird; the next day she said she loved our weekend and wanna do sports with me again (first time at ping-pong, she love it, with me), etc.

But:

1. She was hiding our relationship until a extreme i can't handle into our town, because we work together and she does not want nobody knows (as teachers: families live around the High School, and a lot of teachers like us, wich lived in differente flats, never lived together, was her idea to go live together and never did, of course, in a couple months).
2. She did things for me, send me box with decorations saying i love you, did herself glasses with decoration with two hearts to drink tea, wich i loved... And was always caring me. Like if we were a couple, we had a very good communication, but she was shy at bed, shy talking about her love or what she feels about me, and shy or she does not care about when things went wrong for her (that i did not know).

So she was rude cause i wanted to debate what happened, that i need the break up too, but suddenly (i was not aware in that moment)  she placed herself in the role of the one who leaves and I began to talk (without realizing it) about what had happened and why she was like that, if she had empathy to put herself in my place and my needs.

He said nothing about this. She dodged the subject, she attacked me, I attacked her, the rest is history.

If I had weeks, weeks or days with doubts, I never noticed it. For me, the relationship was going well for her, but it is true that there were changes. In the mood. Of small themes from the past that came back, of certain passing jokes that are not important, but now you see them with another meaning. Of a strange arrogance, as if he could say whatever he wanted (without disrespecting me), but looking for conflict that he later placated by laughing, approaching me, etc.

Now I see her as a mix between a toxic person and another that I gave her exactly what she wanted: nothing too serious, fun, with a guy she liked, but as time went by she would realize (I imagine) that she didn't want follow, continue. And that must have been, I insist, a few days ago and with no margin for him to tell me anything.

That is to say: if I didn't cause the breakup of our relationship, maybe we would have stayed a while longer, weeks, I don't know. But my personality was uncomfortable, fed up with situations of hiding, and that in another city of travel he would hold my hand, hug me, etc.

It's hard not to feel confused.

When you analyze it, you see a toxic relationship, and yet the daily life, the memories, etc., make it so hard. I have not contacted her these days, nor she with me (I am convinced that she closed my story completely due to aspects that would take too long to tell), but you miss that voice, the shared moments, looking into each other's eyes, the affection, the complicity.

Even from the most toxic person in the world. You fall in love with that toxicity, you know. It's like an addiction. I am addicted to pain.

I try to rationalize and cry when I can, take it easy, play sports, little by little, I try to avoid tripping over it at work, but without thinking about it too much, a little bit flowing calmly.

I don't know how I'll react when I see her. She will be as always, cold, distant, professional, as if nothing mattered to her.

How can you confuse a person like this? Take her in your motorhome to spend nights at the lake, buy things together, give us gifts for Christmas, and never say I love you, I like you, I love being with you, and suddenly everything goes to shit like this, in a heartbeat because I I put myself in my place and say: up to here, and instead of reacting and saying: I don't want to lose you, she continues and says goodbye...?

It's really hard, huh. Even needing to break this relationship, because my other self needed it, is very hard. Love is blind, but so painful. I turned as if I were a 48-year-old adolescent with a 41-year-old girl between toxic and half childish, but who found what she wanted and how she wanted. And she left him when she wanted.

I don't understand why I'm hurting myself (well, I've been reading a lot about it these days, there are a few interesting theories), but the point is that I'm in a hurry to get through this painful phase of my life and it's really hard.

I know I shouldn't go back to a person like that, but that feeling of abandonment, as if half of your heart was taken away, is so intense and it never seems to go away. I think that in a month I will notice a great improvement, I hope, I am not yet a week old, but the number of times I have thought: and if I call her, what will she say... she will pick up the phone... she will smile saying: the poor silly this... I almost don't care, you know, I'm at that moment where I bask in my pain, ironically, of course, haha...

And of course it makes you want to say: the next woman or women I meet I'm going to play this game, I know how to play it too (we all know at this age) and I could have been smarter, see it more clearly, take advantage of myself to have good sex and little else while it lasted, etc. etc. She also wanted sex, a funny lover, writer, intelligent (excuse me for loving me so much, it's not a lie), but at the same time a good person, and this is a serious problem for women like you, mature, intelligent, with a sculpted body. at the stroke of the pool and the gym, that she would accept her things even with reluctance that she shows me her boobs and tells me two nonsense and drives me crazy doing what she likes... She's that cruel, but sincere. You don't see it until it's late because my desire to have a relationship was so intense that she said: I can control this, I let myself go... but when things got very serious she thought: until now, I don't want relationships (literally , furious, last night), with people from work. And then what are you doing with me for 3 and a half months and thinking about renting together... do you want to explain it to me?

He has nothing to explain. Just insulting me, being cold, saying that I don't even know who I am (those slum commonplaces, clichés of humiliation) and bye-bye, kid, fuck you.

&amp;#x200B;

And here I am as an asshole thinking about her, her lips and how i felt in the past months with a woman that i loved (not falling in love, but love) and she, with no clue, suddenly said: bye bye.

Never happened to me before. 48 years old. I think i should be glad to having gotten rid of her, it doesn't matter who leaves who, but i miss her, and if she calls me (thanks god she's not going to do it, too proud of herself), well, in half an hour I'm at his house doing oral sex and then we sleep together as lovers as usual did. That's how screwed up it is. You guys get it. Because I do not why i fucking miss this fucking toxic woman.

He’s an incredibly nice guy, he’s talented, we get along well, but after about three months I’m realizing he has really deep issues around self value and he doesn’t realize he needs to look at them; he just says he tries not to think about it. He also has said he’s starting to believe in his own value because he’s dating me. I’m so sad for him and want him to find a way through this but it’s not my job and the relationship is new and, as I said, he doesn’t have any interest in diving deep with a professional on this right now. 

I’d rather be solo than find myself being drained for someone else’s insecurities again, and I know that’s what I’m prone to doing if I stayed. 

Also we don’t even make out hardly ever, and even less of more intimate things. He’s too self-conscious all the time. (I wouldn’t bring this part up.)

51,siz4wm,1643834078,She (41F) ended the relationship (48M) with a Bizum,"Hi to everybody!

3rd post about the same brake up from this girl. I think this is helping me, to understand what happened and mostly to understand that i don't need to understand every little step. It's simple.

Well after the break up (typicall: she wants to hide our relationship still after 3 months cause we were coworkers, that was her excuse and in my inner sense i feel she thought that for real, and she has all her rights, but i don't have age to keep hiding nothing; without this, i like her a lot and it was reciprocicated, but with one issue: while things were into what she wants, a FWB and some romance, even when she is shy and was protecting her heart, i noticed that now after the breark up, it was ok, even her talking about living together to know me better and son on... a week ago i exploted about this things and she finaly broke up, i knew it could happen and some of me wanted, but hey, i'm not falling in love, but i had an infatuation, also with looking the future with her, that hurted a lot), we had a travell to Lisboa and because changes of the air company two times with dates and hours we decided to suspend it.

The thing is that she paid the ticket and i paid the hotel, and send her my part. So that horrible night, when she started to be cold and mean, that she never been before, we never had a ""fight"" as couple (well, lately she does not like the word and i thing this reaction was because she had doubts about her feelings with me, like that night told me), people, that was amazing for me, and i did it too, i was mean also like a defensive instincte, so, i return: she owe me money.

And also she said when the company refunds the money, she will gave my part to me. It's ok. And added half of 3-4 things we bought together for camping, because we liked that a lot.

I said that night: i don't want that money (maybe it was around 40-45$), but i was very proud and for me really that was not the issue, i said that i fucking don't care those, she can have it with no problem, all i want were my things that she had in her house.

After 1 week of zero communication between us, i bet you people she moved on, she's that kind of woman, and i know cause she told me she did this EXACTLY with previous relantionships (that feeling she described about she feels on top with a guy and then suddenly, she does not know why, she is on bot and don't feel nothing, and that when she break up a guy, she never return the relationship). All those i never... are so...

Well, so she send me a Bizum (it is very popular in my country, i dont know if in USA or other countries is the same, it's to send money via mobile), we used a lot for dinners, hotels or gifts, and she send me the money... and added the money of those other things we bought togheter and she owns in her caravan.

The concept was: Lisboa and other expenses.

I though: i don't know what to do with this. That was yesterday. I did not send a message as we usually did saying it's ok, received it.

She did not send me nothing saying: did you receive the money, it's ok?

Technically speaking, it's a bank transfer, it doesn't fail and it appears on his mobile without any problem and on mine and such, but since he doesn't want contact and such, well, I don't think so either.

Because I think that if he tells me something I'm capable of putting a how are you and mess it up, hahaha, I know myself. Then it will be even worse and I have a long way to go to recover, whatever it is, a month, I don't set a date, but it's fucked up.

Well, I don't know what you think, if it would be good to normalize and say ok, it came to me or nothing, because there he sent things that I didn't want him to return my money because it is not the object or its possession, it is the meaning, and even if the relationship was broken That it was there didn't hurt me.

Someday I'm going to meet her face to face in the gym or in the pool, it happened yesterday that I didn't look on purpose because I don't want to force anything and I don't want to feel strange with looks afterwards.

But it will happen, we go to the same gym and there is no other nearby. Oh, and we live on an island (with a larger population, of course) with few resources and it's really hard not to trip up outside of work.

Who told me to put all my eggs in the basket with this woman... life is so capricious and we are so complex.

There is no manual on this, right. What would you do, you would reply with a message about the money transferring to her, and if you saw her in this situation head-on at some point, you would say hello, you wait, you don't say nothing... It's silly, but it's these moments where the one who happens to it, like me, everything is a steep mountain to climb. Any opinion is good for me to reflect, thank you very much.

We set up a dinner date for a week later and all was going good. The date was great until she asked if I had been married. I told her I had been for 18 years and had two older daughters. She seemed a little taken back. But, I asked and found out she had also been married for a few years. She mentioned that she was concerned about my “baggage”. I assured her that I get along well with my ex and all was good with that part of my life and I didn’t consider it “baggage”. 

We enjoyed the rest of the evening. Although, I was a little concerned about her feelings about a second date based on her reaction to my history. She asked me to walk her to her car and I obliged. I didn’t expect anything at all, just being polite. She initiated an incredible kiss that lasted for a few minutes and was really nice. And, we talked about seeing each other again. 

I reached out to her a couple days later and asked if she and her dog would like to take a long walk with me. She said she had plans, that she would be busy all day and would call me the next day. That never happened.

So, I give it a few days thinking she might need a little time to think about my “baggage”. But, no call. So, I reached out to her a few days later and asked her out again. She said “Sure. We can give it another try. How about coffee sometime next week.”

I’m a little confused as to why we would go from dinner to coffee? And, should even bother to follow through? Any advice is welcome!",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/sj3dew/mixed_signals/

They tend to push away when things get closer. I can give them space whenever, so it hasn't been an issue until now... They've said they loved me some time ago. I've started feeling love as well myself and said so recently.

Everything changed shortly afterwards. They've started acting weird, conversations no longer flow, and they've said they feel emotionally weird. Sex went from amazing to awkward.

I decided to give them space. I told them ""I'm here, but I'm going to leave you alone. Figure out how you feel and come talk to me when you're ready.""

I'm inexperienced. I've only had one very long term relationship in my life. I'm seeking to learn from those that have seen it before. For any of you to whom this seems familiar: Am I asking for heartbreak trying to make it work with someone who is fearful avoidant?

We were both separated and in the middle of a divorce. Our connection was instant. We communicated several times a day and built a foundation of friendship and trust before it went any further because of our situation. We eventually became intimate and the chemistry was off the charts. Nothing either of us had ever experienced. I had 3 children from my previous marriage and he had none. He always said he wanted children and i was 100% sure I didn’t want anymore. I am physically unable to have anymore children but was willing to adopt for him. We quickly fell in love and he always talked about our future and how he could see his life without children of his own but couldn’t oicture his life without me. As out relationship progressed and both our divorces were final, he met my children and we began spending more time together. He spent every weekend (Thurs-Sun) at my house and we vacationed together often. Everything was progressing nicely and he would always compliment me and tell me how appreciative he was of me and how much he loved me. We never really went out too much on the weekends. I made excuses for him because he worked so much during the week. His apartment lease was up (2 years after we started dating) and I wanted him to move in with me and not be a part time boyfriend. He said he wasn’t ready. I kept making excuses for him because he would always show up for me (even if it was behind closed doors). He told me he felt like a failure for getting divorced and was constantly worried about running into acquaintances while we were out and the perception people would have of him for being with someone new. He was only married 2 years! Our families were very close. We’d soend Thanksgiving and Christmas with both of our parents. This Christmas he tells me he can’t give me what I want. Asks me to fake it for the kids and family (which I did). On New Years Eve as i left back home I gave him a hug and kiss. I said goobye. He got emotional and told me this isnt what he wanted and that he couldnt picture his life without me in it. I haven’t heard from him since. Wouldn’t someone who loves you reach out to make it work if he was really in love? How could he walk away from our life of almost 4 yrs and not look back? He never said goodbye or anything to the kids! Im devastated and every day it gets better but i dont know what happened. All his clothes and belongings are in my closet which I have to see daily. In December he said he was going to therapy to get some help. I know he deals with mental health issues and i was always supportive and encouraged him to go. I just dont get why we couldnt have worked thru it together. Should i wait for him? Should i move on?

Texted back and forth on Sunday and arranged a date for Friday. I left it at ""Great, see you friday"". 

This morning I texted to check we are still on for tonight. 

After a long time I received a lengthy reply that because she'd not heard from me in a while she wasn't sure she wanted to see me, that she has a lot on at the minute and although I'm charming and stuff that she's got too much on for dating. I'm paraphasing but that's the gist of it.  

The latter part is fine. If too much on that's fair enough. Bit surprised about the ""not heard from me"" part and a bit confused why it went from All go on Sunday to No go on Friday. 

Is the fact I didn't text her in the week a big mistake from me? I didn't as I didn't want to seem needy before a first date. Feels like I'm damned if I do, damned if I don't.

90,sl05dz,1644042204,Reconnection after time off possible...worth it?,"Hello wise people of reddit.  I love this sub and have found some great nuggets of advice here.  I am looking to receive some of that wisdom directly now.

&amp;#x200B;

I (47M) have been seeing a wonderful woman (45F) for about 2.5 years.  She has two weekends a month kid free, and these are the weekends we spend time together.  They are precious.  Until recently, this situation has worked well for us.  Despite our limited time together, we have grown very close.

&amp;#x200B;

The pandemic has obviously changed things for everyone.  Without going into details, it has caused her to become overwhelmed in the past six months and it has caused me to fall into a depression of sorts in the same six months.  Despite my depression and my feelings of wanting to be alone, I still made every effort I could to see her on her kid free weekends and be present.  This relationship has been amazing, in so many ways, and I didn't want to diminish it with what I have been struggling with.   I prioritized this over other things in my life because of the value I thought it had.  It's been one of the few things that I find positive.  Despite her feelings of overwhelmedness, she has received me and we continued to see each other and shared more vulnerability, with more TLC.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently, she communicated that she is now so overwhelmed, she doesn't feel comfortable in her body.  She has made some remarks that are very uncharacteristic of her.  Before going over for one of our weekends together, she warned me that she was not in a good place.  That didn't bother me, I just wanted to help provide what comfort I could.  However, when I saw her, she was physically distant.  Her body language was very guarded, and she didn't want to snuggle.  OK, I can understand that, I have been there.

&amp;#x200B;

Before deciding to spend another night, I asked her if she was pushing me away.  She didn't answer my question, and shared that she was in a tough spot and needed to figure things out.  I said OK and left her alone.  The next day, she asked if we could talk, and I said yes.  So, we went on a walk in a park and I asked her again if she is pushing me away.  Once again, she didn't answer my question and further explained her situation (which I already know because she has already shared it).  She said that she is juggling a lot of balls.  I asked her if she felt like I was one of those balls and she said no.  I asked her want she wants, and she shared what she needed to do... but not what she wants.

&amp;#x200B;

She doesn't have a lot of time to herself, and the weekends that she has free, she has chosen to share with me.  I told her that alone time is important, and understand that she needs it.  I told her that we should not see each other for a month, and that I hope that she can figure out what she wants.  She said that she was sorry, and I told her not to apologize for prioritizing herself... but she said that's not what she is sorry for.

&amp;#x200B;

I told her that I wasn't mad but bummed.  I told her that I only wish for her to be happy.

&amp;#x200B;

Further reflection finds me very disappointed and hurt.

&amp;#x200B;

My question to the sub is... after this time apart, if she decides that she wants me in her life, can I really trust that?  Should I trust that?

This amazing lady has given me no reason to distrust her up until the point when she wouldn't answer my direct questions.

I am curious know know if anyone has had a similar experience, or cares to share their perspective.
