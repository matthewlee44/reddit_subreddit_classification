Beta would be a man who always looks to the woman to make decisions, wants to be taken care of and told what to do, a follower.

Tomorrow there’s a foodie gathering I was interested in but now after catching up on the covid news I’m wondering if it’s such a good idea.


New covid news for this week includes, we are on a trajectory right now that says in three weeks we will be at peak numbers, there are increasing numbers of break out cases due to variants, even those vaccinated should still mask up because the breakout cases are concerning since they increase the likelihood that a vaccine resistant strain is produced.

Attentive in and out of bed, and just an all around great guy. BUT, he works full time, goes to school and has half custody of his three year old son. We barely have time to see each other. At this point, it has been more than two weeks since we've gotten together. For context, a couple months ago, we were seeing each other 1-2x week. We used to text constantly and have long phone conversations, which made up somewhat for the time we couldn't be together, but that has also slowed way down. When we do communicate, he's the same charming funny guy he's been this whole time, but it's getting less frequent and I hate it.  So I told him last night that this isn't working for me. He seemed genuinely hurt by this. I really care for this guy and I thought he really cared for me. But if he wanted me in his life, I feel like he would make it happen. Nobody is THAT busy. I feel like his actions and words do not match and I'm afraid to get in any deeper with someone like that.

Long story short.  Sold my house bought a new one.  Was married for 6 months. And my world turned upside down.

Is a 6 month marriage a huge red flag?  How do I explain it?  I am paranoid and assume every woman I meet now must think its a huge red flag and I worry they think I am toxic or abusive or something... when the reality is the literal opposite.  Women who deal with this and escape probably are more accepted.  But men suffering abuse i feel still has a stigma.

Worst case scenerio she just doesn't respond providing ultimate closure anyways.

Dating is such an uncomfortable experience, I highly doubt a 3 sentence text sent one time is going to cause any psych trauma.

One time I posted asking for 2nd chance advice, and the top rated comment was ""LEAVE HER ALONE. THAT'S WHAT ABUSERS DO!"" And I'm thinking seesh, way to hyperbole it.

34,owl4uy,1627930383,Potentially dating someone who's in an ethically non-monogamous relationship,"Apologies in advance for the long post.

I'm 51, female, and have a pretty horrendous relationship history - I've basically been a serial monogamist, going from one unsuitable relationship to another and even getting married twice (big mistake!). I've made very bad choices over the years, but that's not to say it was all down to me that the relationships didn't work. Every time I have had a 1 year plus relationship, it has ended in one of two ways: either (a) my anxious attachment side comes out full force and I end up pushing the other person too far, or (b) once the relationship has become 'safe' and secure, I totally lose interest and end it without looking back.

I've been single for nearly a year now, which is an absolute record for me and is probably only because of the pandemic! Last year's breakup forced me to take a long, hard look at myself and my behaviour patterns, and I have had lots of therapy. Now that things here are opening up again, I am back to seeing my friends and doing what I love most weekends, so there is a higher chance of meeting someone IRL (I don't do dating apps) although I'm not really looking for anything.

Last weekend I was out with some friends and, long story short, I got chatting to a guy who seemed interested. He's 10 years younger than me. We got on really well and had a great laugh, lots in common, found each other attractive etc.  Eventually I got a cab home, and he shared the cab with me part of the way as it was on his route. He held my hand in the cab, and before he got out he gave me quite a long kiss. We had already exchanged numbers. 

He messaged me the next day and said that he is in a long-term relationship with a woman he lives with, but it's a genuine ethically non-monogamous relationship. He had a great time with me and would really like to see me again, but would of course understand if I was angry with him or didn't want to know. I was slightly taken aback at first - I've never (knowingly) met anyone who is in any form of open relationship. I took some time to think about how to respond, and, in the process, began to warm to the idea that this could *possibly* be a way forward for me.

This type of arrangement would enable me to spend time with someone whose company I enjoy and who I find attractive, but not in the all-consuming way I have felt with other people. It would remove any pressure that comes with a 'regular' relationship, and I wouldn't be jumping into something in the way I have always done before. It would give me the freedom of being single and still open to meeting someone else. It would also give me a much-needed ego boost (he has already said he thinks I am awesome). However, I'm aware that this all sounds very naive bearing in mind I have zero experience of anything like this! 

I don't really see any reason to be cross with him for not mentioning it when we started talking - we did nothing more than kiss and hold hands, so it's not like either of us was used, and there was no need for him to be honest with me at all if he was just after a ONS. Also, just to clarify, both he and his partner are open to others outside of their relationship.

I'd be interested to hear views from folk who are, or have been, involved with someone in a similar situation. Thanks for reading if you got this far!

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - met someone who's in an ethically non-monogamous relationship, and I think this might be OK with me but would like to hear your views.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/owl4uy/potentially_dating_someone_whos_in_an_ethically/

47,owxkc9,1627971973,How do you keep up with the chatting/ texting? What’s with the need for instant gratification!?,"I (47F) don’t play games when it comes to communication response time. Sometimes I respond right away, sometimes it takes me a day or so. I typically keep my attention on my work phone and cut over to my personal phone during my downtime. The separation helps me stay sane — I’m introverted by nature but my job is quite demanding and requires a high degree of focus and timely responsiveness any time I’m “on”.  I get distracted and overwhelmed by so many texts, chats and notifications so I do my social communications either early morning or wait until later in the day.  Sometimes I’m so mentally drained that I literally just can’t do the social thing at all and skip a day entirely, but it’s rare. 
This appears to be an issue when I meet someone new and we’re getting acquainted based on what happened with the last two men I was trying to get to know. One flat out said that my responding a day later shows that his “crush” (I.e. me) isn’t as into him and he doesn’t want to get hurt. The last one got sore because I didn’t respond until later at night to his multiple texts (all were just social, no emergency or anything), to the point where a date we had set 2 days later ended up getting cancelled because he was so bothered by my tardiness, and we fizzled out. This current guy seemed cool — meaning he also responds sometimes the following day just like me — but now I’m not so sure. On Wednesday he asked when I’m free for dinner. I let him know I’m out of town for a couple of days and he said to let him know when I’m back in town. I said “sounds good!” and left it at that. I texted him yesterday letting him know I’m back. His response was he figured I wasn’t interested anymore when he didn’t hear from me “for so long.”  But then he said he’d still be up for finding a night that works, so this one isn’t dead yet. Hence my request for advice. 
In the dating world, how do you find the right balance between under-communicating  and overindulging the other person’s need for instant gratification after every text? Especially for those of us who work demanding jobs? What is reasonable? I’ve already shared that I’m not the best about checking texts throughout the day. They were fine till they weren’t.

But soon as i grow up i learned in life that being nice is not always right, people did take advantage of me and use my kindness against me making me feel like i am such a horrible person if i say 'no' or if i only consider myself and feelings in my choices. They would point out that i am selfless and kind and it is not my nature if i do things apart from that and honestly it is so tiring and burdening that i soon got burned out because it come to a point that i have nothing more left of myself to give. Not even self respect or self love, i ran out of myself to give and still they wanted more and when i can't give it they rejected me. Now it is a lesson learned, i am now enjoying myself with not much worries in life. I found someone who woke me up and made me realize how important it is to make peace with myself first, to consider my mental health and to care more about me as a human being, forgive myself if i am wrong and learn to say no and stop. To love myself and to be okay with me being vulnerable. It is not always right to be kind, definitely it is never enough to live and survive. Living your life, standing on your principles and loving yourself, there is nothing more important than being at peace with your innerself.

52,ox5zhs,1628005012,But we're just friends…,"So I (45/M) recently started dating a woman (37/F) who has more long-term friends of the opposite sex and when asked how she met the majority of the ""friends"" are either exes or individuals they had feelings for at one point in time. 

This wasn't really an issue until one of our upcoming date nights got canceled because a ""Friend"" is coming into town ""unexpectedly"" and wanted to meet up with her before leaving town. I had to specifically ask if she was meeting someone she was romantically or emotionally involved with because she chose not to volunteer this information when I asked ""Is there anything I should know about this friend you're meeting up with?""  

Normally if it's a girlfriend she's going out with she gives a name and a rough idea of their plans or invites me to tag along, so that's how I was able to deduce it was a guy in the first place. It wasn't until I pressed for details of the nature of the relationship that I found out she had a romantic interest in him at one point… for me, that's a huge violation of trust especially when I asked if there was anything I should know about the relationship (trusting her to volunteer information) and she got upset/ defensive with me for not being direct in my line of questioning.

I understand men and women can be friends. I have quite a few female friends myself, but none that I've dated or had an interest in, and would certainly volunteer that information if asked about the nature of our relationship. 

What I didn't like was that she was secretive about this meet-up and that she seems to have a few male online friends (at least 4) who she keeps around for emotional support, because they “get her”.  She has no female online friends that she speaks of.  I get having male friends that she shares interests/ hobbies or guys she has met organically … but not dudes she connected with emotionally and developed feelings for at one point or another.

I'm skeptical of the intentions of any man who accepts ""friendship"" after a relationship has run its course. I'm my experience, I've known MANY, MANY guys who will be friends with a woman if they've expressed interest in them and those feelings went away for reason... because they hope she will eventually fall for him or just to have sex if the opportunity presents itself. I think any man who denies this is full of crap, but I'm only speaking from my point of view and not all men, so please don't beat me up for my belief. 

I really like this woman, but this is actually a huge issue for me. I'm taking a big step back to evaluate if this is a deal-breaker for me or if her lack of candor is a red flag that can turn yellow over time.

Dating 9 months. Him 47. Me 42. 
Everything is great. Met each others families. Laugh and have fun together. No complaints about the time spent together but...
We hardly see each other. We live a mere 20 mins drive from each other but only see each other once a week. When we first started dating it was twice a week. I was fine with that, I felt like we were building a strong connection. That dropped down to Saturdays only. I thought i would be patient and not voice my concerns about this but he seems totally fine with just seeing me on a Saturday.  Then this weekend he had a boys night so we didn't see each other at all because he was hungover. He wanted to sleep all day rather than make the effort to see me. 
I feel like I'm not valued. I feel like I'm a fun weekend thing and that's it. Is it wrong to feel this way? I raised this with him and he said I would probably just find him boring during the week because he gets home late from work and has early starts. But then he suggested dinner this week to make up for the lack of weekend time. And it's now Wednesday and he hasn't done anything about planning that dinner. 
There's no secret double life or other woman invoked. I've met his 23 year old daughter who lives with him and his mother. 
I really just think he either doesn't love me and doesn't see a longterm future with me or he's lazy and doesn't want to put any effort in. I've probably messed this up in letting him get away with it for too long, so how do I address this? Is it even worth addressing or is the writing on the wall?

60,oxi5bu,1628041359,"It's been 2 years, should I reach out again? Or leave it?","This might not be your average story...  There's a lot to tell, TLDR at the bottom.

Just over 2 years ago I met a woman online. We'll call her Betsy. Chatting was great for several days so I said let's meet tonight! And she said OK!! Then she says, ""I have to tell you something first though... I'm pregnant.""

So, that's an unusual bit of info to find out from someone on a dating app.  But I figured - what the hell, this should be interesting - maybe I'll make a new friend at least. I was pretty curious about her circumstances because she said it might not be what I think it is. She also wanted to hear the details of my 10+year LTR that ended. So we met up.

I think she was about 4 months pregnant at the time. Definitely showing. We hung out for a few hours talking and really enjoyed each other's company. At this point I don't think I got all of the gritty details of her pregnancy situation that evening. Essentially what I learned at the beginning was that her clock had been ticking - bad - and having not found ""the one"", and looking into sperm banks, adoption, etc., and finding those options either extremely expensive or complicated, with many unknowns, she decided to make an arrangement with a guy for him to just be the donor and not be a father. Apparently this guy had done this for a friend of a friend in the past which gave her the idea so she talked to him and decided he had good genes and all that.

Definitely not an orthodox situation, but sounded somewhat reasonable. She wanted to be a mother, and she was about to be in a few months. Mission accomplished I guess!

Anyway, we get along great and after a couple more times hanging out, she really wants to have sex. Apparently her hormones are raging and having that effect. We don't really discuss what this could turn into, but it sounded like she wanted a FWB situation (with someone that doesn't mind her being pregnant). Turns out I'm that guy, apparently. (A guy not turning down sex, crazy, I know!) She asked me to get tested, and then we were off to the races. Great sex, and we would just chill at her place watching movies usually when we saw each other. Sometimes I'd sleep over. Sometimes an outing here and there. But as she got more pregnant we just stayed in all the time because it was easier for her.

It basically started feeling like a relationship, but I started to have doubts for a few reasons.

1. I found out the ""donor"" and her had zero legal arrangements. Just a handshake that he would have no rights. Wow. No need to go into how crazy that can potentially be. Another tid bit about the donor that I found weird - the ""donations"" happened via sex. She told me she wasn't attracted to him so it was awkward. Purely a transactional deal. I believe her, but it still weirded me out.
2. The elephant in the room was that this baby was coming. I've always been on the fence about having kids, but I wasn't even sure what to think about being in a LTR with someone that is having someone else's kid under odd circumstances. I just started getting more and more unsure about that whole situation the closer it got. We didn't really discuss it that I recall. I take responsibility for that. There's a LOT we should have discussed if things were to keep going.
3. I wasn't even sure if I was dating the real her. What I mean by that, and maybe some women who have had kids can help (or tell me I'm crazy), is that I know women can have extremely different experiences from each other when pregnant, but some might have slight changes in personalities, priorities, moods, emotions, etc. during that time due to the hormones. So, I was concerned that I'd gotten myself into a relationship with someone and the version of her that I was attracted to might change. Also, because it wasn't long before it became difficult for her to go out much, I wasn't really experiencing life with her as a way to get to know her like I would if she weren't pregnant. We would talk about things and watch movies, but that was most of what we did.

So I started to back off and put up a wall. We talked and she was very emotional and upset, having grown real attached to me. I was so torn because I liked her too, but I just had so many unknowns, and all I could say is that I didn't know how I felt about everything and I needed to step back and take a break. A few weeks later she had the baby. I was checking in and she was sending me photos and let me know they were both doing great. Soon after that I was set to go on a trip, so she said we should touch base when I got back, and I said I'd like that. But, I never did, and neither did she.

That was around 2 years ago. I felt guilty about Betsy, like I had left her at the worst time. I really have no idea if she quickly forgot about me because of her new bundle of joy, or if she had the bad luck of getting postpartum depression and me leaving only made it worse. I've thought about that a lot. Around that time, post Betsy, I had some personal issues I was dealing with so I wasn't interested in being with anyone. A few months later things got better and I randomly met someone else and ended up dating her for over a year, but that ended a few months ago.

Betsy has crossed my mind a number of times and lately I've had the urge to contact her to see how she's doing. I always try to analyze my intentions as objectively as possible, but I'm having a hard time. It's easy to think that by reaching out to check on her that I'm letting her know that I cared enough to see how she's doing and it would make her happy, but she might just not want to hear from me. And if I know that's a possibility and I still do it, then maybe it's a selfish purpose. But even if she's upset with me, I'm happy to talk with her about it now that I've had time to think back, and hopefully give her some closure. Or is it just me thinking I need closure because I feel bad for walking away from her at a really vulnerable time? Difficult for a stranger to answer that, I know. That's why I tried to give as much context as I could.

Any perspective and advice is appreciated :)

TLDR; Met gal online that was pregnant. Turns out it was an oddball donor situation so she could fulfill her dream of being a mother. She wanted a FWB situation with me that morphed into a sort of relationship. The baby situation and everything else became a lot for me so I took a step back, which made her sad. Essentially things ended right around when she had the baby and I haven't talked to her since then, 2 years ago, and I'm considering checking in just to see how she's doing.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/oxi5bu/its_been_2_years_should_i_reach_out_again_or/

But she talked with me and I explained that hey, I’ve been hurt, so I was protecting myself. We differ on communication styles. She’s introverted. I’m more verbose, but get text is the preferred method for her. I adjusted my communication. All good. When we started sleeping together, she felt that it went awol and I wasn’t matching how I texted early on. She felt that it was disrespectful and hurtful. I apologized and explained it was a miscommunication. She also felt like I overthink things and say stupid shit sometimes. I’ve since felt like I have overcompensated and initiated a lot of the communication going forward. I set the tone, but then it all falls on me because I’ve now set the expectation. We dropped the ball in discussing our styles. She’s a little hesitant in getting into any deep conversations.
We’ve both been out of town and hadn’t seen each other in several weeks. Had the chance to spend a few days together before not seeing each other for a month. We both made the effort and she elected to see me when it wasn’t the most convenient for her as she was getting ready to make a cross country trip. I got a “I missed your company”, which was great. We didn’t get into a DTR convo because time was limited and I thought it was best served being light and enjoying each other’s company.
I checked in several times (once a day) along the way to see how the drive was going. Asked if she could let me know if she got to the first stop ok, but no response. I had to follow up and she had just got there. Had a brief convo on Sunday. Asked a question that by the face of it she chose to ignore as my reply was immediate and she wasn’t driving.

I just want to put a positive vibe out in the universe for these folks!

\*\*\*

When I (52M) was 23, I was standing in the corner of a night club listening to the music and minding my own business while enjoying the energy of the club (sometimes I'd go to dance clubs by myself just to be around people and listen to good music) when this woman with stylish hair and a couple of years older than I was approached me with a friend in tow. 

""You're the best looking guy in this club (sic) and I wanted to say hi to you,"" she said to me, not because it was necessarily true but because it was her opening line. This triggered a laugh and a conversation and some dancing, and we ended up dating for a little while. During this time, she talked a lot about her ex-fiance, mentioning all these great things about him. I love people's stories and am generally confident (?) enough in myself so that I don't mind if people talk about their exes, even if they rave about them, but after she brought him up a few times during our first few dates I asked, ""Your ex sounds like a great guy -- what happened between you two?"" 

""He died,"" she said. 

How shocked and touched I was by this. It turned out that he had an undiagnosed heart condition, and despite being young and fit he died suddenly of a heart attack in his mid-20s. In fact, I was this lovely young woman's first boyfriend since his death, and I can't justify how touched/honored I was by this, even though we eventually agreed that we should just be friends (and actually stayed friends for awhile - I genuinely thought she was a good person).

Fast forward more than 25 years. 

I am on OLD and am looking for potential matches for dates after my STBXW , and there is a pleasant/kind looking woman a little younger than me (45) who I am interested in, so I click on her story and read what she has to say, since I did love reading people's stories. It turns out that we would not be matches -- she loved the outdoors and also home fixit projects, and I hate both those things -- but what really touched me was that she was widowed and this was her first foray into OLD. She mentioned she was looking for someone kind and supportive who understood that she was on the dating market after unexpectedly losing a man she loved with all her heart. 

How touched I was by her story, to the point I sent her a note stating that I was not a match for her (and mentioned why) but that her story had resonated with me and that I hoped she found someone. 

Anyway, I am thinking about these stories today after reading a post by a woman who is back on the dating market after unexpectedly losing -- to death -- her soulmate. 

And I'd like to put out there a wish, that people who are unexpectedly put on the dating market, especially because they were widowed but also because their SO unexpectedly ended their relationship, that they/you find kind and supportive dating partners out there.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/oy6dx7/sending_my_most_positive_thoughts_to_widows_and/

For example, I have been chatting with someone for two days, and we set up a FaceTime. But I can already tell I don’t want to continue. He’s asked me nothing about me, just bragged about himself, and though I share things about myself while responding to him, he doesn’t ask or even comment about any of what I say. Yesterday I rescheduled our first phone date because my sister had a minor accident and needed to go to urgent care, and his response was “ok.” Not, “I hope she’s ok!”, just “ok.”

Td;rl - I ended it. In the end, it was too much for me to deal with and I was having a physical and emotional reaction to the situation and knew that long-term this relationship wouldn’t be healthy for me. 

Things seemed good on Tuesday. She invited me to hang with her friend from out of town and a group of our mutual friends for happy hour. Before heading to my place and her spending the night, I told her it was cool getting to meet him, but that I still wasn’t comfortable with the whole situation. 

Yesterday is where things got weird. 

I found out via our group chat that she was hanging out with him again until his flight left at 8 pm, this was the first time I had heard about these plans. After she left my house, he apparently texted her to meet up for breakfast and drop off his rental car. At 1 pm, she texted me saying they were going to hang out at one of the local breweries and if I wanted to join when I got off work. I happily accepted. 

I think this is important for context.  Because I’m salaried, I don't have a set schedule.  In the past, I’ve taken off early to meet up with her and hang on a weekday afternoon where we both didn’t have our kids. 

At about 2:30, I had wrapped up my last meeting for the day and decided to head out to hang with them. 

When I got to the bar, she was shocked/ surprised to see me.  I sat next to her and they proceeded to tell me what they tasted on the menu was worth getting.  Once she stopped talking, I playfully said, “Hey,  can I get a kiss” as my lips were millimeters from her cheek  This was the way we normally greeted each other in public spots. She just stared off into space and I got upset and said “That's fucked up” before I got up and left.  

Overly dramatic? Maybe a little.... but I had been dealing with this nagging feeling for a few days and I felt everything was inflamed by her actions and disregard for how I felt about the whole situation. Since basically, they spent Sunday afternoon, Tuesday, and Wednesday together. 

A few seconds later she followed me outside and said “you know my rules, no PDA in front of friends, I don’t want to make him feel uncomfortable. “ Honestly, this was the first time I’d heard of this rule being enacted outside of our circle of friends. Because normally she’s the one who initiates contact. 

We had a few words outside and I told her that my feelings were hurt over her actions and that this isn’t normal behavior for her.  I told her the fact that she cared more about making her friend feel uncomfortable with a little kiss from the guy that he knows she's dating and was a little odd. Then I drove home. 

She continued to hang out with her friend and didn’t contact me until she had dropped him off at the airport 5 hours later.  

At first, she wanted to meet at my house and I told her I was more comfortable meeting her in a neutral place, like a bar. 

When she walked in, I told her it was over and that I wouldn't tolerate the disrespectful behavior she’s exhibited, and that we have a fundamental disagreement on what honesty, trust, and transparency looks like in a relationship and that those 3 things are non-negotiable for me. 

She was upset that I wasn’t willing to hear her side of things and that I needed to apologize for embarrassing her in front of her friend. I told her there was no room for discussion and that I was done.  She was dumbfounded and insisted that I was in the wrong and that I need to take ownership of my reaction.  She said that I purposely didn't tell her I was coming to meet them and that I was trying to ""catch"" them. 

What gets me is all she was worried about was how she looked in front of her friend and not how I felt.  Her blatant disregard for my feelings is ultimately why I chose to end things.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/oyl7nd/but_were_just_friends_update/

I don’t require a potential partner to be sober and I don’t mind if they drink from time to time, but I definitely don’t want someone that drinks often or daily.  So I matched with this woman Monday.  We text and have a couple phone calls and there’s definitely a vibe.  I communicate to her, during these texts and phone calls, my sobriety and where I stand on a potential partner’s drinking habits.  She responds that she doesn’t drink much and totally understands my stance. 

We agree to a first meet last night and and within seconds of being face to face, I can smell the beer.  We were outside at a park.  And I was shook.  I’m just truly confused.  Like, did she think I wouldn’t notice???  I could even give her a tentative pass if she had claimed nerves and disclosed that she had a beer to calm herself (this is a medium yellow flag still because it indicates alcohol as a coping mechanism but I would’ve been willing to give her a chance).  But she never acknowledged it and a couple times she even seemed buzzed.  Now, I don’t know her or her mannerisms so maybe that’s just how she is.  Idk.  I’m a “give people the benefit of doubt” type.  

But I’m honestly just staggered at the whole thing.  Anyone have advice on how to tell her I’m not interested and why?  Any similar stories?",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/oyq1b2/the_cluelessness_of_some_people/
94,oyq9bm,1628193000,When everything is perfect... Except for the ex,"I've been dating a guy since the end of March. I've posted a few times about it since this is my first time dating since my divorce was final two years ago and basically it's been almost 20 years since I had been in the dating world. Things have progressed amazingly... We have a lot in common, communication is superb, we both have professional careers, are emotionally mature. We really have just clicked. He was the first to say that he loves me and I also love him. It seems too good to be true. And maybe now it is... 

I'm almost 41F with two kids ages 14 and 9 who live with me over 95% of the time (youngest spends maybe 1-2 nights on the weekend with dad even though our custody agreement is 50-50...dad doesn't utilize that). New guy is 43 no kids, divorced over 10 years ago. My ex-husband was very controlling of me and is still very controlling over the kids. The biggest thing with him is that he uses his religion as his reason for wanting to control everything.

New guy wanted to meet the ex-husband since ex is in the kids' lives and new guy was hoping that we could all have one of those great relationships that dreams are made of where everyone gets along and share in birthday parties together etc. Ex-husband was his typical self at the meeting and tried to put down expectations he has about new guy being around the kids (no PDA in front of them unless we were to get married, no drinking alcohol in front of them, no sleepovers if the kids are with me unless we were married... All in the name of his religion). This first meeting lasted almost 3.5 hours. New guy and I both left with headaches and ex-husband left and texted me asking if I was trying to kill him with new guy because he felt antagonized and his blood pressure had skyrocketed. So needless to say we aren't planning any shared family gatherings soon. 

New guy understandably has a lot to digest with this because he doesn't want drama and problems. He says that he doesn't see red flags with me and that I'm great and amazing but my ex-husband is a huge red flag to him. He expected things wouldn't be good with meeting him, but he didn't expect to get what he got. He said I definitely made the right decision by divorcing him. He's talked to friends who tell him to be careful because he doesn't have any ""baggage"" and if he chooses to continue a relationship with me, my ex is still in my life because of the kids. New guy has met the kids and that went well. New guy says he really loves me and sees common ground for a future together (and so do I) and that he's not breaking up with me but he's not sure how things will work with my ex. He's dated younger women without kids and they aren't emotionally/professionally mature enough and that's not what he's looking for at this point in life. I feel like I'm still paying for the poor decision I made at 22 years old when I got involved with my ex.

95,oyqu6c,1628194655,update on woman who couldn't communicate her basic needs to boyfriend &amp; was about to snap at him for not paying her enough attention,"So.... you'll recall my earlier post about being frustrated by my boyfriend only spending time with me on Saturday nights. My initial plan was to confront him and then pretty much throw in the towel. Thanks to this forum, I decided with a less dramatic approach &amp; had an adult conversation instead. 

I acknowledged that I had never expressed my needs to him and that I felt we weren't spending enough time together. I told him that I needed more than just a weekend day/night and that I felt disconnected with the current situation. This was incredibly hard for me because I have never felt comfortable expressing my needs. I had tried before in a previous relationship and was basically shut down by my partner. i realise now this is something i need to work on. 

Anyway, his response was: ""I have been waiting on you to give me the go ahead &amp; take the relationship to the next level. You're so independent and you were very clear from the outset that you wanted to take things slowly. I know you've been hurt before, I wanted to show you that I was patient, wasn't going to rush things, and that I genuinely wanted to get to know you. I didn't want to scare you away in being more demanding with your time - i can see that you needed time to learn to really trust me and that I nothing but good intentions. I miss you during the week and I would love to see you more. I wish you'd told me this sooner &amp; I hope that in future, you can be more open with me because I love you and want this to work.""

Wow. 

So i can't say ""thank you"" enough to everyone for calming my farm! I could have completely ruined everything by going off at him, for a problem that he had no idea existed, because I wasn't communicating &amp; expecting him to mindread &amp; always initiate everything. 

I've deleted the old post because I feel so stupid about how i nearly blew this whole thing. But thank you to everyone who talked me through this &amp; helped me get some perspective before I went to my boyfriend. This group is like having access to a therapist - the comments really made me see where I was going wrong, whereas beforehand I laid the blame solely in his lap.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/oyqu6c/update_on_woman_who_couldnt_communicate_her_basic/

I didn't meet with the woman that I had been dating but sent her this message to close off the conversation:

*Hi. Before you made your decision I wanted to talk to find a way to slow things down so you were more comfortable and could choose the pace, rather than finish the relationship. I had a few things I wanted to discuss with you and some questions about our situation but I’m not sure I would find the answers. You’ve made your decision and I respect it, and thank you for being honest with me. I don’t think we need to talk/meet. I know you understand how I feel about you so if you change your mind or think you’ve made the wrong decision then call me and we can talk.*

She was previously in a 13 year toxic relationship and has been single for 18 months.

I received a long message back from her asking if I'm ok and explaining again that she just feels that she is not ready for a relationship but she thought she was.  She really likes me and acknowledged that she pushed the relationship to go too fast for her. She was also offering again to meet or call to talk about it twice in the message and said she didn't intend on hurting me and was really sorry.

I didn't respond as I accepted her decision but she sent another message last night saying ""Can you just let me know if you're doing ok please. I do care about you"" and then she called me.  I answered the call and we actually had a very nice conversation for about 45mins and discussed the situation and her decision for the first time outside of texting.  She then stated that she doesn't know what's going to happen and may/may not change her mind.  She then said that we could still talk/meet if I wanted but as long as I understood how she felt.  

This just seems to get even more confusing!!! I want a relationship with her and said that this might not be the best for me, she said that its something I should decide.  We ended the call there and she said I'll speak to you soon.

97,oyta7b,1628201987,When You Look Much Younger Than You Are...,"I (44F) will be 45 soon and consistently surprise people who think I'm 29. Not flexing here, but the disconnect between my chronological age and my appearance, while confusing for some...seems to be becoming a problem of sorts in my dating life now that I'm forty-something.

For example, last night I was at a party with folks who were so eager to set me up with someone, especially with a gentleman in another state, but when we confirmed his age was 34, my age became a major party-pooper, even though the matchmaker liked me so much to want to set me up with this bachelor in the first place. 

On dating sites, I'm honest about my age and my pics are recent so it's not like there's false advertising going on and there should be less of an issue. However, when I meet people IRL, especially men, it seems like when they find out my real age, I am all of the sudden in the clearance section - that something must be wrong, and whatever biases they have against older women kicks in, even if my appearance and lifestyle indicate otherwise. 

I don't feel the need to apologize for my age, which is ridiculous, but it feels like I'm constantly disappointing people who think I'm a certain (more desirable age), and find out I'm much older. #sorrynotsorry, but it sure doesn't feel great that a number has such an impact now that there's a four in front of my age. 

I will probably get downvoted for humble-bragging, but wondering if others have experienced the same disconnect to where you feel like you're a major disappointment and undesirable just because of your age and nothing else?",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/oyta7b/when_you_look_much_younger_than_you_are/
