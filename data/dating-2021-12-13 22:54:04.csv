0,rfzomb,1639457853,Do I have the right to be upset at the girl that went to hook up with an ex-fling after we hung out all night,"I have nowhere else to vent because, well… I have a feeling people will tell me I have no right to be upset. I am a 30 year old male, and I went to a Christmas party with co-workers last weekend. I saw my crush there, and things were going really well, until they weren’t. Let’s call her Jane.

I have had a crush on this woman (26F) since I met her at a Thanksgiving party a few weeks ago. We got to taking at the end of the night and hit it off. She even told me the nickname that her mom calls her. I missed the chance to ask for her number, was a little bummed about it, but decided it wasn’t that big of deal. She was just some girl I met at a party.

Then, I saw her again at a Christmas party this weekend. I played it cool and spoke with her for a minute and then when to talk with other people at the party. The first indication I got that my attraction to her was mutual was she kept following me around the party. As the night went on, she kept being very touchy/flirty.

Next thing I know, she recommends that we go out to a bar together. When I say that I’ll go, she goes around and gets a few people to go with us. We all leave, and she gets in the front seat of my car with me.

At this point, I’m not really thinking much about it. We are having fun, and I like this girl, but I’m not getting too far ahead of myself.

We get to the bar and she starts *aggressively* trying to get me to drink with her. I’m like “no thanks,” but she buys the group shots and insists that I drink with everyone. I managed to get my friend to take my shot for me. I was the DD, and I have a strict no drinking and driving policy, even it’s technically legal. Lost a friend when I was 21 to driving while intoxicated. Anyways, I digress.

After shots, we move to the dance floor, and everyone is having a good time. While we are dancing, she keeps grabbing my hand and dancing (mostly innocently with me). I hang out for a minute, but then I take a walk because I don’t like to dance unless I’m drunk. I’m walking around, just vibing being by myself, talking to some strangers. 

I walk back to find everyone, and they say that Jane is looking for me. I feel a tinge of excitement, and walk back around to find her. I find her and she seems a little upset. She keeps asking if I’m having a bad time, and I reassure her that I just like to sometimes do my own thing and was having a good time. 

We walk outside together and are really vibing with each other. We are talking effortlessly, she’s laughing at my stupid jokes, and she continues to do things like rest her head on my shoulder. We go inside and dance together. And she’s getting really affectionate with the dancing.

We go back outside to smoke. Then things started to get weird. Apparently some ex-fling is at the bar, and her attitude shifts. She seems anxious that he’s there and tells me that they used to be a fling and sleep together. I made the mistake of not seeing the red flag and then continuing on with the night.

We leave around the time the bar closes, and she insists on driving home after drinking from our friends place. This upsets me because I didn’t think she should be driving, but she’s an adult and insists she’s okay to drive.

I text her when I get home to see if she got home safe. She said that she did and told me she had fun. I went to bed thinking, “what the fuck happened?” At some level though, I was just thinking about the night and how much fun we had. It had been awhile since I felt myself starting to open up to someone.

The next day, I still feel a little funky. Around noon though, I gather up the courage to text her and see if she wanted to go shopping with me. It was so last minute, I figured she’d say no and I would move on from the whole experience. She ended up eagerly saying yes and seeming to have the same attitude as before things got weird.

To wrap things up, we went to a few shops and eventually it just dawned on me to ask her a question: “Did you end up going home after I dropped you off?” She pauses and says, “uhhh yeah.” And I laugh and say, “You don’t sound too sure.” She says, “well I went home and then went to a friends. And I ask, “oh that guy?” And she said, “yes.”

Don’t get me wrong. I know we aren’t together. I know she has every right to sleep with whoever she wants. But damn, did I feel like the wind was knocked out of my stomach. It would be one thing to see him the next day, but really? After we had just spent the whole night together and almost kissed on the dance floor? And to lie to me about it and say she needed to get home because she had something to do in the morning? I felt completely manipulated. 

Guys… I’m going to be honest. As much as I knew I should be upset, I was and didn’t respond well. Basically, we stopped speaking, she made some comment about me being a “law abiding citizen” and I said “one of us was supposed to be when y’all were drinking and driving.” I proceeded to tell her I would never have a one-night stand with a co-worker because of how unprofessional it was and she should be aware of her reputation. Oddly enough, it was sincere because it’s the reason I didn’t actually make a move.

But I have been in a horrible mood ever since. I’m not sure if I should apologize and explain how I feel or just let it go. I think it was more hurtful than anything. The way she actively pursued me all night and then was able to lie and ditch me for a late night booty call. It made me feel like I was being used to make the other guy jealous or to validate her. 

If you made it this far, what do you think? Do I have a right to be upset?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rfzomb/do_i_have_the_right_to_be_upset_at_the_girl_that/
1,rfzrf4,1639458093,Rejected a girl and I feel like shit.,"I've been talking to a girl for about 20 days and we finally went on a date yesterday and had fun, but ultimately I felt like we'd be better off as friends rather than boyfriend/girlfriend. I didn't know when or how to tell her that I'd rather we stay friends and could hang out just as friends, but she ended up leaving me in an awkward situation. I joked about being in a crowded room and that I might have COVID and she joked back that it would be 14 days until our next date. I figured this was my chance to just tell her that I wasn't interested in a romantic relationship with her and I did. I told her that I really enjoy talking to her and that I wouldn't mind hanging out as friends. She just responded with a thumbs up. So I asked her if she was okay and that I just didn't feel any romantic connection and she responded saying she understands. I said to her that I still want to be friends and talk with her but if she needed some space for a bit I understand. Last thing she said to me was ""We can still talk"". I don't know how often ""We can still be friends"" is thrown out, but I meant it legitimately. She is in the same profession as me so it felt nice being able to talk to someone who knew what I was talking about.

This is my first time rejecting a girl and I think I wouldn't feel bad normally, but she's a foreign student with 0 friends nearby and without a car. It just makes me feel that much worse. I think I may have been her first fun legit social outing since she came to the US this year that didn't involve annoying relatives/classmates. My friends told me maybe I should have gone on a second date, but I know for sure that it wouldn't work out between her and I long term. I also didn't want to feel like I was leading her on or something.

I don't know, I feel like poop right now despite not being the one rejected. I don't know if I handled the situation the best way I could have, but if there is one thing I don't do, its ghost people or lead them on. I guess those are the only two things I could say I'm proud of.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rfzrf4/rejected_a_girl_and_i_feel_like_shit/
2,rfzuyq,1639458421,Deleting all my dating apps was the greatest thing I ever did for my dating life,"I was on Tinder and Bumble for literally YEARS and never got one date. The girls I liked would ignore my messages, ghost me, and flake out on plans. Many of them were absolutely horrible at conversation and there wasn't a damn thing on this earth I could do to squeeze more than a word out of them. They just had horrible personality traits and were mostly shit people. 

My self-esteem would TANK every time one of these girls ghosted me or flaked on me. I started to take it way too seriously and it destroyed me. My friend is getting married to a girl he met on Tinder, and I can't even score one date???!! 

The reality is, these dating apps are goddamn scams. You have the ELO score working against you. All you see is the person's out-of-context picture and that's literally it. Fucking nobody on there is serious and many people just use it for validation. I got so fed up with all of this, that I just deleted all my accounts and apps. 

Since then, I've had success meeting girls! I realized some things that I needed to change and work on within myself. I've been meeting women in different environments, sometimes places where I would never expect to meet someone. I just play it cool, I be myself. I realized that it's totally not rocket science at all. Dating apps led me to believe that women just truly hated me and there was nothing I could do to change that. But when I was placed in an environment where they actually had a chance at getting to know me and seeing me for more than just my profile picture and dumb bio, they actually liked me way more than I expected and I've had way more success. 

Anyway yeah. Fuck Tinder, fuck all dating apps.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rfzuyq/deleting_all_my_dating_apps_was_the_greatest/
3,rfzvir,1639458472,Is there still a chance to develop sexual attraction?,"So I’ve been talking to this guy for over a month from a dating app and I’m definitely attracted to his personality, but after meeting him once I am not really sexually attracted to him. His face is cute but he has a short, slender body and is basically my size (although he looked like an average-sized guy in his photos). We’re hanging out later this week and I might feel differently afterwards, but I’m concerned if the sexual attraction hasn’t arrived by now it never will. 

It doesn’t even have to be instant. On multiple occasions I’ll see a guy and think he’s just okay looking. Not ugly, just not appealing to me. And once I get to know him and realize what an attractive personality he has I start to appreciate his looks and become physically attracted to him soon after. That hasn’t happened with this guy yet. 

I feel so guilty about it because he’s great otherwise, I think he really likes me, and it shouldn’t matter that much how he’s built. But I just know I crave someone larger than myself. I think I’ll feel self-conscious and turned off with a boyfriend that small. 

I’m still interested and looking forward to seeing him, although I worry it’s too late to turn things around.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rfzvir/is_there_still_a_chance_to_develop_sexual/
4,rfzyzo,1639458800,"21M living at home, hiding dating from parents","


I graduated college 6 months ago and just recently started dating someone. I do live at home which has been weird as this has been née to me. I’ve been seeing them for about 2 months but haven’t told my parents. I will usually come back really late after a date and come back at around midnight. I let my parents know if I’ll be out late but then when I get home the next morning they ask who I was with and what was I doing? 

That’s understandable as any parent would be curious but I honestly don’t know what to tell them. My parents are very loving and supportive but I would like to wait before telling them about her until it gets more serious. I’ve just been kind of avoiding them for a month or so and they kind of forget after a couple of days.

I want to spend the night at her place one day but I think that would be a clear giveaway as to what I’m doing. I really would just like to be private about the whole thing but I feel like ever since coming home im a teenager again. Also I feel like my mom has a hard time keeping my business private and will start casually mentioning it in conversations. 

How would you recommend I bring this up to my parents? She isn’t my girlfriend yet so what do I call her when discussing it with them?

5,rg01ll,1639459052,"Got immediately turned off but what my date said, am I overreacting?","Talking to this guy I met on hinge. This is our third time meeting up.

TLDR: I say “are you gonna come for me” in a non sexual way in the middle of a conversation, he then responds with “can you take it?”. Im grossed out by it and under the impression that he’s being sexual. He says was just responding to what I say-not trying to be nasty, but I believe that he was intentionally trying to sneak a nasty line in. 

We’re having a conversation and I end up saying, “are you gonna come for me?”, in a non sexual context. I was saying it in regards to him roasting me. Like “are you gonna come at me?” but it came out as “are you gonna come for me” due to the nature of the conversation. 

He then follows up by saying “can you take it?” Or some shit like that. So the convo goes like this:

Me: “Are you gonna come for me?”
Him: “Can you take it”

 And I’m immediately repulsed. I’m assuming he took what I was saying sexually and I got so turned off I told him I’m ready to go home. I’m not into sexy talk with men I’m just meeting. 

He got defensive and was saying that he feels like I’m judging him, that he has no idea where I even got this “sexual context” from and that he in no way intended it to sound like that…

So am I really crazy for thinking his response was sexual? Does that not seem like an inappropriate response? Either way it grossed me out and I was ready to go but, I feel like he was poorly trying to gaslight me towards the end.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rg01ll/got_immediately_turned_off_but_what_my_date_said/
6,rg03q8,1639459260,For all of you women/girls out there. Would you do this kind of thing with your boyfriend?,"Okay so I honestly don’t know if I should really ask this question or not but I’m just going to ask it anyways.
So at some point in time in my life I think it would be interesting if I went somewhere natural completely nude with my significant other like maybe a beach, a forest of some sort, a desert area etc.
Basically just go to a place that’s naturally beautiful with both me and my significant other being completely nude together and maybe even have sex too.
Like we could basically just drive and park somewhere and then leave all of our clothes in the vehicle and then grab a tent or something and hike until we find somewhere to stay.
And no I’m not thinking about doing any survival stuff heck no, so don’t think of this as a naked and afraid type thing, it would be more of a fun camping trip with my potential girlfriend/wife where we can just ditch our clothes and enjoy nature and feel free completely nude.
So just out of curiosity, for those of you women out there is this something that you would do with your boyfriend once you’ve already got to know him very well?
I honestly feel like I shouldn’t share this thought with anyone but at the same time my curiosity is getting the best of me.
I’m definitely going to delete this in like a day after I read some replies lol.

9,rg053v,1639459391,A guy (24M) that I (21F) really like has a girlfriend,"In September I met a guy through Reddit who makes me feel really happy. It’s the first time in like 3 years that I’ve felt infatuated with someone. I always have my guard up with people and dating feels like a boring routine just so I can have sex and appease my hornyness. 

He really changed my views about sex. I’m always used to having meaningless sex with people and I’m afraid to talk about my feelings with people out of fear of coming off too “clingy”.  I always felt so numb to dating and sex and it just feels like something I have to do to avoid feeling lonely. 

However, this guy I felt really comfortable with. I felt like I could talk about my feelings and he actually cared how I felt. He was the only guy who wanted to wait to have sex (although we never got that far). He said he likes to have sex out of love and wants it to be really passionate and affectionate. This felt so foreign to me but I realized I really want something like that. 

I always felt like I was being a “badass” by having wild and degrading sex (sex in public, degrading dirty talk) but after meeting this guy I realized that while that type of sex can be really fun, it’s also okay to want and ask for more than that. 

School got pretty busy and I haven’t reached out to him much this semester. Last time I messaged him was 5 weeks ago and he said ideally he wants to be friends who go and do cool/fun things and also have sex sometimes. He said he wishes he could see me more often because he hasn’t determined yet if we would be good together. 

School has just be crazy and I haven’t had a chance to hang out with him. I stalked his Reddit most today and saw a recent post (2 weeks ago) in which he mentioned having a girlfriend. 

This feels like a missed opportunity and I feel really sad. He means so much to me and really changed my perspective on things.

25,rg1w96,1639465945,Am I crazy? She (23) wanted to date me (25) and her ex at the same time. I said no.,"Hey folks. **TLDR:** Started dating a girl (virgin) (4 dates - once a week) who said she broke it off with some guy she was seeing after our 3rd date because she really liked me and only wants to date one person at a time then told me she actually wants to date both of us at the same time after our 4th date. I would be cool with a situationship/casual type thing if we were sleeping together and it was just a not so serious dating kinda thing but she is a virgin with anxiety problems (Borderline personality disorder) and used to cut herself etc, but is very charming and sexy and fun, who wants to look for a serious relationship whilst dating me and some other guy. I basically said I want to be a priority and not an option and that I will only date her if its us and I walked away. She is confused, young, inexperienced and conflicted with obviously has a lot of personal issues. Is this normal? Am I taking things too seriously to walk away from this? Should I have just accepted to date her while she sees this other guy but she isnt sleeping with either of us?   
 I think its completely reasonable for me after 4 dates with her, lots of making out and ***the proviso we both expressed by date 3 we were looking for a relationship and to date one person at a time*** to do exactly that and not re-write the contract after starting to build some momentum. I think its normal i walked away. I think accepting it would go against what i want, would diminish me and cause me uncertainty and anxiety and i could potentially get enmeshed with someone with a lot of baggage.

I met a girl on Hinge and we started dating. We have been on 4 dates. We started kissing and making out on the 2nd date. We really hit it off. there was a lot of chemistry and every time we met up we ended up spending the whole day together and doing lots of activities. The attraction was high and she was really into me. I was doing everything right and things were going well. Our last date we went out for drinks and I took her back to mine, we cuddled and got intimate but didnt have sex as she is still a virgin and wants to take it slow. I am cool with that. She told me she has some anxiety issues and childhood trauma and thats why she is a virgin and that she is looking for a serious relationship, that she has never 'been in a relationship' before. On our 2nd date she mentioned she felt a connection with me. i replied 'me too'. on our third date she told me she broke it off with some guy she had been seeing for 4 months because she really liked me and wanted to only date one person at a time. Things were going well dating and I could see things progressing nicely with the potential of an intimate relationship developing. by the 3rd and 4th date she was really into me. Couldnt keep her lips and hands off me and kepts saying how much she likes me and feels a connection. Some of you may say I did something to turn her off but i really believe this isnt the case this time. I have experience with girls and have made many mistakes ive learnt from. Im confident to say that it appears this girl doesnt know what she wants and really likes me but obviously still has feelings for this other guy and wants to date both of us, and overtime get to know both of us more and eventually decide if she really likes one of us and will choose to sleep with one of us. i think thats foolish and i dont want to be part of it. I think its normal to date lots of people at once during 1st and 2nd dates, maybe even 3rd dates, but by a 4th date with lots of kissing and both of us having been clear by the 3rd date that we are looking for a serious relationship and only want to date one person at a time, that dating other people wouldnt be appropriate, unless both of us were keen on doing that. I mean she was the one who brought up the 'exclusivity'. I was dating other people until she brought that up so by the 3rd date so i decided to focus on her. I am busy and only really had time to meet up with her for dates. I didnt mention anything about being exclusive or deep feelings etc. She brought that up. She really likes me and is clearly disappointed i walked away from her. It was hard because i could see a lot of potential with her. I told her that. It would be different if we were sleeping together and she said something along the lines of ''Hey I just want to date you and other people right not and not be locked into anything'', I would have been fine with that. I would have been happy to have a casual relationship with her while I date other people and find someone who wants something more serious. But thats not what she wanted. She wanted to date me seriously along with this guy who the week earlier she had dumped but then decided she wanted to get back with. She hinted to the fact that she has a lot of personal problems and the reason she wants to keep it open is because she is not sure how i will react to learning about these issues of hers. She has scars on her arms from cutting herself, anxiety issues and borderline personality disorder so i probably dodged a bullet here. I told her that it takes time to get to know someone and that is part of the fun of dating. I said i was fine she has issues and that I really like her and would like to get to know her more and the issues arent a barrier. We had some good talks on previous dates about some of her anxiety and they were really good discussions and i felt after her attraction towards me was increased. I said that i really wanted to date her and see where things go but not if she is seeing another guy as she will only give half of her self to me. I also said it leaves a lot of uncertainty and that I will end up having to hold my self back a lot and that in doing this she wont really get to know me. I also said that it can get complicated if she starts sleeping with one of us. I said to her that these things usually never work and she'll find it hard to find people who would agree to such a thing. She said something along the lines of that she is an open book but wants to do this because she wants to see if she likes one of us before she commits. I said to her that surely after 4 months of seeing this guy she would be certain about whether of not she likes him and wants to be with him. She is new to dating and obviously wants to see whats out there but I find it rather strange what she wants in particular. the fact that me and him would both be competing for her virginity and be in a serious relationship is not on. If we were both just fucking her and she wanted to be loose I would actually be fine with having a fuck buddy on the side. This whole scenario combined with the fact she comes with a lot of baggage made me decide to leave. I said to her im going to start dating again but that she has my number and if things change she can contact me. I didnt say I am going to wait for her but that she can send me a message in the future and if im single we can see where things go but i wished her luck with everything, dropped her home and gave her a final kiss. She was visibly shaken and distraught/conflicted by this and disappointed. I value my self and i just cannot see this going any where, whereas I could use that time to find someone more stable and suited to me. If she didnt have all the personal issues and wasnt a virgin I would probably accept to date her and start dating other girls too. She yo-yo'd and i think shes making a mistake. I can tell shes really into me and things will likely not work out with this guy. Anyways, i wish her the best but im conflicted because im old school but it seems these days 'normal' to be in situationships and encouraged for people not to commit and date lots of people at once. I think in some cases thats ok if both people want that but i think its completely reasonable for me after 4 dates with her, lots of making out and the proviso we both expressed we were looking for a relationship and to date one person at a time to do exactly that and not re-write the contract after starting to build some momentum. I think its normal i walked away. I think accepting it would go against what i want, would diminish me and cause me uncertainty and anxiety and i could potentially get enmeshed with someone with a lot of baggage. My anxious brain tells me I have too much integrity and that i am being fussy and unreasonable for expecting her to commit after such a short time. I said we can just continue to date and see where things go and not be serious but that I only like to date once at a time.  I dont know. Am i crazy? Am i stupid? or did I do the right thing? Is this normal? when do people starting dating exclusive? surely after 4 dates and making out etc and expressing everything i have mentioned it would be normal to just want to date each other and see where it goes? if it works out great, if it doesnt then so be it but you just cant seriously date multiple people at once. You cant seriously date for a committed relationship and sleep with multiple at once! well you can but youre called a player and its hard to do and you have to keep a lot of secrets and im sure most people dont do that or would want that. thank you for reading! &lt;3",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rg1w96/am_i_crazy_she_23_wanted_to_date_me_25_and_her_ex/

27,rg1xp9,1639466102,Do I have a right to be upset with crush who did the dirty deed with a late night booty call after spending the whole night with me?,"I (25ish M) went to a Christmas party with co-workers last weekend. I saw my crush there (25ish F), and things started going really well, until they weren’t.

I met her at a Thanksgiving party a few weeks ago. We got to taking at the end of the night and hit it off. I missed the chance to ask for her number and was a little bummed about it because that “vibe” was just there.

I saw her again at a Christmas party this weekend. I started a chat with her at one point and then went to talk with other people at the party. I noticed something was up when she kept following me around the party. As the night went on, things started to escalate.

Next thing I know, we are laughing and she says that we go to this particular bar together. I say that I’ll go, and she gets a few people to go with us. We leave and she gets in the front seat of my car with me.

At this point, I’m not really thinking much about the whole situation. We are having fun, and I like this girl, but I’m not getting ahead of myself. I was playing things slow because we work together. I didn’t want to do anything in front of our co-workers.

As the night goes on, it’s pretty clear she’s into me. She *aggressively* tries to get me to drink with her. I’m like “no thanks,” but she buys me drinks anyways. We move to the dance floor, and she keeps grabbing my hand to get me to dance with her. I take a walk because I don’t like to dance and start to just walk around the venue. 

I’m walking, just vibing by myself, talking to strangers, and she comes to find me. We walk outside to smoke, and she keeps trying to get me alone. We go inside and dance together. And she’s getting *really* affectionate. We almost kiss at one point, but (again) coworkers. I don’t want to be included in any office rumors. 

We go back outside later and things started to get weird. One of her ex-flings is at the bar, and her attitude changed. She seems anxious that he’s there and tells me that they still sometimes sleep together. We go back inside and dance some more together, and she continues to be really affectionate. 

We leave around the time the bar closes, and she insists on driving home, even though she’s been drinking. I did not think she should be driving, but she’s an adult and insists she’s okay to drive.

I text her when I get home to see if she got home safe. She said that she did and told me she had fun. I went to bed feeling like something was off, but I mostly felt happy about meeting this girl, who seems legitimately cool to me at this point.

The next day, I gather up the courage to see if she wanted to hang out and go Christmas shopping with me. It was so last minute, I figured she’d say no. She ended up saying yes almost immediately, so I was a mix of nervous and excited.

We were hanging out and I got this nagging feeling to ask her a question: “Did you end up going home after the bar?” She pauses and says, “uhhh yeah.” And I laugh and say, “You don’t sound too sure.” She says, “well I went home and then went to a friends. And I ask, “Oh, that guy?” And she said, “Yeahh.”

After that, things just got weird. I tried to act normal, but it was probably noticeable I was disappointed. At one point, I said some poorly worded things that probably came off as judgmental, even though they weren’t intended to be. It just threw me off that she went to go bone some dude after spending all that time together. Plus, she lied, which is such a deal breaker. I told her I would never date a co-worker randomly, kindof pretending like nothing happened.

I am wondering if maybe I overreacted. Like, do I even have a right to be mad at her? She seemed legitimately a little confused/hurt when I said I would never date a co-worker. Plus she hung out the next day, which I doubt she would have done if she wasn’t into me. I guess maybe she didn’t want to tell me initially because she liked me. But she clearly isn’t over this guy... so probably not in a place to date me anyways.

28,rg1ybp,1639466170,Is this a date?,"Hello, long time lurker here (23M) and I think it’s happening (finally going on a date) (key word I think). I’m not the best at articulating/explaining things so if I fudge it up I just want to apologize in advance.

Anyways, I’ll give y’all the whole story. I recently moved very far away from home for a job. I do have some family (my brother goes to school down here and I have an aunt with younger cousins down as well) down here but other than that I don’t really know anyone except for people within my job. My brother was telling me how there was a girl from my class in high school who had also recently moved down here. I didn’t really think anything about it. I never really talked with her all that much in high school, i dated a friend within her friend group, I was friends with her brother and had a whole bunch of classes with her as well but other than I never really talked with her a whole lot. She was also a pretty quiet girl too. A solid reason as to why I never talked to her is due to the fact I had baaaaaad self esteem issues and thought she was waaaaay out of my league. 

About a week ago I decided to give hinge a try and wouldn’t you know guess who I stumbled upon. Yep that’s right. When I say her account I said you can’t make this shit up. Anyways I liked her photo and she was surprised to see my like. Long story short I end up getting her number and said fuck it and asked if she’d like to meet up for a bite to eat. In the back of my mind I thought for sure she’d say no or make an excuse as to why she can’t go but that did not happen!! She very enthusiastically texted that we should . I thought we’d do a casual lunch meet up or something of that nature but she said she’d prefer to go at night on a water front restaurant. 

I kinda know how I’m gonna tackle this “date” (my goal is to just have as much fun as possible). I just don’t know if I should treat it as a date or a meet up to catch up. I think I’m overthinking it and it is a date(why should she bother with saying what’s up on hinge as well as saying yes to get food. What do y’all think?

34,rg2fhf,1639468156,Who should pay on the First Date?,"There's something I dislike a lot about some women these days. They ask for ""equality"" until it's time to pay for the plate. I feel that attitude is hypocrite and a double standard.

In cave times, women looked for the strongest man, so they could bring them food, take care of them and protect them. Today they are looking for the one with the most money and credit.

When money or credit runs out, ""love"" also runs out, because it was never love for you, it was only love for money, for economic stability and a roof to sleep under.

Many women think like this:
-Men and women are equal, but men pay for the dinner.
-I don't want them to take advantage of me, but I want them to pay for my drinks and buy me gifts.

Really? Talking about equality and taking advantage of?

In my opinion, considering that two unknown people are meeting for the first time, both should pay half and half.

I think we live in a time when it is easy for women to accept a date because they know that the man is going to pay for the meal, and in the same way it is easy for them to get another date for another free meal.

37,rg2trq,1639469791,Do I give her space or do I reach out?,"So I am recently dating a girl, only a week in and Recently I slipped up. I meant to give a compliment and critique on one of (F20) her projects. And instead of saying “weaker”, which I said in my brain, I said “weird.” And she took it very personally, because it was something she had poured her heart into. Now I MEANT to say “weaker in this regard…” and give feedback to improve! Because normally she wants feedback on these things. But all that came out was a slip of the tongue and said “weird.” She said she needed space and hasn’t talked to me in 3 days. 

I feel like I’m drowning because she’s my best friend, and I don’t want to lose her. But a simple slip of the tongue, and no time to go into detail until AFTER The damage was done… she said she understood and forgave me, once I explained what I meant to say versus what came out of my mouth. And I SWEAR on my life I meant to say “it’s great but is a little weaker in these aspects..” and all that came out was “it’s great but a little weird..”  she said she understood, and forgave me, and it’s in the past… but She said she needed space. To collect herself, so we can talk and work through this in the future when she’s more emotionally stable. She also said “this won’t be the thing that ends us.” But… it’s been 3 days. And I’m drowning in guilt and anxiety because I don’t want to lose her.

Should I wait till she initiates contact? Or should I send some long and meaningful note to her? I don’t want to come off as clingy, or desperate, and I’m trying to honor her boundaries of her asking for space to process things.

Was she lying? Did she not forgive me? Am I boned? I don’t want to lose her and I’m beginning to feel desperate…

Anyways asking her out on a real date goes something like this.  She's gotta go grocery shopping tomorrow.  She's gotta take the dog to the groomer the day after that.  This weekend her parents have visitors.  The day after that she has to take the car to a mechanic.  The week after is Christmas.  Next month she will start part time college...etc etc.

So I'm like ""well you're not busy right now, so let's get a bite to eat"".  Her response usually has to do with her parents are in a bad mood and her mom will get angry if she leaves.  Or her health issues are flaring up.

47,rg3sek,1639473917,"""Man must pay"" needs to die","*Inspired by* [*this recent post*](http://redd.it/rfne7f/) *, I want to* *~~voice~~* *rant my opinion on this separately, since it will just get lost among the many replies already there.*

IMHO, the tradition that the guy must always pay for the first date is ***outdated***, ***sexist***, ***materialistic***, and ***disrespectful*** to both men and women. I'm not in favor of the death penalty, but this tradition should be shot and buried in an unmarked grave, and the sooner the better. Traditions are just peer pressure from dead people - so let *them* have it!

Saying ""the one who invites is the one who pays"" may be a little better if women made the first move more often; but in the current reality where this still falls mostly on men, this is just saying the same thing in prettier words. (Which is a good place to repeat the call to women everywhere: *if you like us, approach us!* Don't wait for us to make the first move. Most of us will appreciate it.)

Why do I think this way?

The **sexist** part should be quite clear: expecting different things based solely on a person's gender, and judging them differently for it. AKA, discrimination. If a guy doesn't pay, he's ""cheap"", ""uninterested"", ""has no manners"", ""not a gentleman"", ""a looser"", ""pathetic"", etc. If a girl doesn't pay, she's fine; it's not her job.

It's **outdated** because it's based on a world where men were the breadwinners and women stayed at home to cook and clean. We no longer live in that world, at least not in the west. Women today are financially independent, they're capable, they have careers. Sometimes the woman makes more than the man (not getting into the whole wage gap debate here - I'm talking about individuals, not statistics).

It's **materialistic** since it gives *money* too much importance. It contaminates the interaction, and if such attitudes persist, it contaminates the relationship. Money is nice, it is useful, it is helpful. But when it becomes a key factor, we lose focus of what really matters. Money is volatile. Temporary. It comes and goes. Even a homeless person can find a job, and turn their life around. Even a millionaire can lose everything in a moment. And then what are you left with? The person themselves, their personality, how they treat you - *that's* what really matters. And those are the things that are much harder to fix.

It's **disrespectful to women** because it paints them in the same way the old world did. Weak, dependent, incapable. And when a woman insists that a man must pay, let alone when she forces him, or tricks him into it, or abuses the custom for her own benefit, I can think a several other titles for her, none of which are good. To women's credit though, those last few bad cases are rather rare. Or at least, I hope so.

And it's **disrespectful to men** because it takes them for granted. It takes *their generosity* for granted. It treats them like an ATM. Judges them by the content of their bank account. Is that all that a man is worth to you? A wallet? Surely not.

If you want to judge a man's character, his manners, his interest, there are better ways than relying on money. And there are many ways to be a gentleman.

When a man *chooses* to pay for you, chooses to spoil you, chooses to be nice, don't take that for granted. It was *his choice*. If you're just meeting for the first time, he doesn't owe you anything, except to treat you with respect. And you don't own him anything, except to treat him with respect. So please do.

She's a young, good looking skinny girl, working in a warehouse (fulfillment center) surrounded by men, in a fairly sketchy neighborhood, with several hundred colleagues. 

I'm not considerable with this, given the following risks involved: 

- sketchy neighborhood
- working with strangers at such odd hours
- warehouse employs ex-cons all the time
- men would be hitting on her, getting inappropriate

56,rg52p0,1639479484,How could I have approached this girl?,"So a few months ago I was at a bar with some friends, playing some pool to kill some time before going off on our other plans for the night. I noticed a cute girl walking our direction, but I didn't think anything of it and continued playing. Just before I went to hit the ball, I found her stood right next to me and asked us (noticeably taking a few glances at me), where the toilet was. I found it odd because there was a large sign that pointed to the toilets nearby us, but maybe she just didn't notice, so I pointed that direction and she thanked me and went. 

A few mins later she walks out of the toilets and went towards her group of friends on another pool table not far from us. For the next hour or so, I catch her looking at me a few times. My guess (and wishful thinking) was that was into me and she intentionally approached me earlier to make herself noticed, or something? Disappointingly, I just didn't do anything, and my friends and I eventually left the place.

Now, anyone who actually has courage and the balls to take action - what could I have done in that situation? Should I have approached her in front of her friends and asked if she wanted a drink? Gesture her over to the bar or something?

He says he was shocked because he thought he was bringing me round to watching more anime and that his hopes were dashed because of this. The rest of the night was really tense. He was just sulking for most of the night. Like sighing and huffing and not actually talking about things. 

So I spoke to him and he said he was sad and that he would get over it. Yet he continues to sulk. I said he was being immature and that he was making me angry and frustrated.  He then goes on to say I have invalidated his feelings and I have done what past girlfriends did and made it about me. I then said, do my feelings not count?

I know the post is a little all over the place but I guess the point and my main question is, should I try and tell him all these concerns and see how he reacts or should I weigh my options and try to figure which one I think would be the best?

 I've been on a certain online advice forum for eight years but a couple of years ago I saw a man posting there a lot giving everyone advice.

We've been messaging literally every day and sending a lot of photos and videos. We did also video call for an hour and said we'd video call again. We've been talking for many weeks or even a couple of months at least now. We have quite a bit in common and similar values. We both said we want to get married and have a family.

76,rg6wl4,1639486579,Can I fix this?,"I’ve (37f) been dating this guy (42m) since the summer. I’m more attracted to him than I want to be, and he’s nice and all. 

But I’m now quite sure he is somewhat selfish. Examples include booking a hotel we are both paying for without confirming the choice with me, not asking me which of the two last types of pizza slices I want, not asking me if I want a drive home from his friend saying we will walk despite the cold. I guess after leaving my narcissist ex, I want to be with someone who puts me first. 

However, could this be a matter of setting boundaries with the new guy and being honest about his selfishness? Or should I just cut my losses…",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rg6wl4/can_i_fix_this/

78,rg71hi,1639487024,He text me saying he felt 'vulnerable' after our second date and I don't know how to feel about that. 31f/33m,"4 months ago I got out of ab u healthy 5 year relationship with an alcoholic who tried to control my every move through guilt tripping. The whole ""Don't work overtime because that means you don't love me."" ""Don't get your own car because then you'll go out without me sometimes"" ""Don't say hi to any guys or else I'll sulk."" As well as wanting to know what I was doing etc. I'm ridiculously loyal and don't have a high sex drive, definitely never cheated on anyone, but the alcohol made him incredibly paranoid.

As a result I'm really wary about guilt-tripping, controlling, and woe-is-me people. Friends, family, relationships, doesn't matter. If someone says ""If you do *perfectly normal thing* then it means you don't love me"" or ""Do this for me or else I'll sulk"" I distance myself from them instantly.

Anyway I had my first date the other week with a guy I met online, and it went well, we both discussed beforehand that we wanted it casual, take it slow, see how things go. He's a nice person so I thought if one or both of us weren't attracted perhaps we could be friends. We just went for a coffee. I always offer to pay if I initiated the date or I offer to split 50/50 if they did. That's just manners imo. We split this one 50/50.

We went on our second date last night at a local pub. He had 3 beers, I had one and a lime and soda since I don't drink much and my ex really put me off it. It went well and was very funny and casual.

I got home and said ""thank you for tonight it was really fun :) did you get home safe?""

He sent me a reply saying, ""Yeah thanks I had such a good time with you. I hope we carry on like this because we have such a connection. I feel really vulnerable right now.""

I asked what he meant by that and he said ""I just don't want to lose you, it would be painful for me.""

At the time I put it down to the drink and replied saying ""oh right well we if you're free we can meet up at the weekend if you like?"" Which I know wasn't the best response but I'm battling with my mind over whether his reply was normal or not.

I might be over-reacting but this seems like a LOT for me on a second date, and it reminds me of stuff my ex used to say. Especially since we discussed taking it slowly and casually  Am I right to think this is a bit full on?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rg71hi/he_text_me_saying_he_felt_vulnerable_after_our/
79,rg720j,1639487075,Are there expectations for men to be Hornier than their female partners?,"
Don’t know if this sounds odd but I have a pretty high libido and have an expectation that men are supposed to be hornier than their female partners. It could also be what is portrayed in the media and everything i read about how men behave especially when they are with women they are attracted too. 
As such this fucks with my brain a bit when I meet and date men who do not instantly have a hard on when kissing or when we make out, I get immediately offended and read that as a sign of disinterest. 
This may also be related to an previous relationship I had with a man who had ED. The experience with him completely destroyed my self esteem and since then any “ unresponsiveness” is an instant turn off for me. I even stopped seeing a guy because of this. I didn’t say anything about to him it so I imagine he must have been completely blind sighted. 

Is it incredibly unfair to expect this of guys ?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rg720j/are_there_expectations_for_men_to_be_hornier_than/
80,rg72kj,1639487123,Need girl advice,"Hey everyone, just needed some advice here.

So I’ve been talking to this girl the last month and a half, we’ve gone on two dates and both went well as I slept over at her place both times. She was gone traveling for the last week and ignored my last text but I also never reached out after that.

This week (a week later) I sent her a short hey how was your trip sort of text and she sent me a long response telling me all about her trip so it seems she’s still interested.


With the holidays coming up, we’re both traveling a lot. Should I just try to set up a date before we leave and all that and try not to text her too much? Don’t wanna come off as needy and I think she’s still interested. I think people overemphasize texting and the talking stage and everyone just needs to chill but want to make sure I’m doing that right.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rg72kj/need_girl_advice/
81,rg75zw,1639487451,Do women ever follow up after saying they’ll let you know,"I’ve been messaging this girl on facebook messenger, and we started on 🔥 with jokes &amp; banter. 

And so i used to jokingly initiate meeting for a drink which she seemed to play along with, and to eventually initiating a concrete plan - like this Saturday evening @ 7pm at location. Which she said she was up for and, would be nice to see me. For her to drop out, as she’d been struggling with mental health issues (&amp; was in A&amp;E) but said it’d be nice to see me, and we could arrange something soon as she sorts out her medication.

After that our messages were slow, but I assumed it was due to her not being well &amp; i feel like i gave her time, checked in how she was doing etc.

But she’d react to all of my posts with ❤️ or laughing, depending on the content &amp; we’d make an odd comment on our posts, where the energy genuinely seemed really good.

But this left me confused so i had to ask her to make it clear with where we stood and, whenever she was still interested.. for her to say she hadn’t been herself lately. Which then, i responded with couple of wellbeing quote pics to show i was thinking of her - for her to just react with a ❤️ (no word response, which she hadn’t done before).

&amp; so i took bite of the bullet to initiate meeting on the 29th if she was feeling up to it then, and she responded with she wasn’t sure she would get back to me as she was busy with her family &amp; her son.

I understand she may be genuine but, how do i move forward from this &amp; do women ever follow up after saying they’ll let you know? 

To make it clear, we’re probably only something casual.. as she’s an older woman which I’m fine with",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rg75zw/do_women_ever_follow_up_after_saying_theyll_let/
82,rg786x,1639487658,Has she lost interest in me?,"Hey guys!

So I've been texting with this girl for 3 weeks now and what can I say she seemed really interested in me. So before I decided to ask her on a date, I decided to ask her random questions to get to know her better and to see if we have some things in common. (Little disclaimer: She isn’t really fast when it comes to replying) Anyways, after a little bit of texting I finally asked her if she was interested in a date and she replied that she would love to go out with me sometime. So the next day I suggested a date on when we could meet. After two days she replied that she can’t go out, because she is too busy with university at the moment and that she has to study for a lot of exams for this month and January. So I replied to her and said, that it doesn’t matter we can go out another time as soon as she is free. She hasn’t replied yet.

Do you guys think that this is just a lame excuse and she basically lost interest in me? I would definitely appreciate any kind of advice and help!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rg786x/has_she_lost_interest_in_me/
