We were never really official but she kind of just rejected me. More of a ghost but just slowly just faded with shorter responses and not being available to see me.

I realise that she probably was never more invested in it than I was. I know it's neither of our fault that she lost interest in me but I can't help bit feel deflated.

5,nwnoq1,1623331776,I am seen as shit value. Now much more than ever. After “bettering myself.” My eyes have been opened,"My last time I had sex was about a year ago. I lowered my standards completely. Had no standards anymore. After having nothing to show for it. The woman didn’t shower or brush her teeth that day, she was very obese, she lived at a Motel 6 and the place was a huge mess, she worked a job she seemed to hate. I ate her out and she tasted completely awful but I ignored it. The taste of her mouth almost made me gag. I don’t think I ever got it up at all. When we talked she just talked about how depressed she was all the time. I won’t list what I am, because people will say I feel entitled if I do that at all, but basically I’m the opposite of all of that. We weren’t the same at all.

After a long time of me not getting it up she told me, “You just don’t like me at all do you?”

I didn’t say anything. But she was right. I really didn’t like a single thing about her basically. And I would never do this to myself again because of that. And that made me realize something. Apparently almost every woman out there sees me the same way. I don’t know why exactly. But everyone out there just doesn’t like me at all. I feel like, in my eyes, I have upped my game in pretty much every area of life. But I can’t talk about that much. That would mean I feel entitled. But suffice it to say that I have put a huge effort into “bettering myself.” And if anything, I was liked better when I had nothing to offer. So, so much for that I guess.

When women see me, they apparently see what I saw in this woman. That’s what I am to them. So best for me to remove myself from their worlds completely.

I texted with a guy I met on tinder for a few weeks and we met last week. The date went well, he texted me immediately after, saying he had a great time and wants to meet up again soon. He texted me the same thing the next day as well. 

On the weekend I asked him, whether he wants to meet up spontaneously. I saw him online several times, not answering. I don’t know how to explain it, but I lost control of my thoughts and emotions. I am very mistrusting and have to work on that. I sent him a long text, telling him that I can’t deal with his late responses or that I feel fooled. 

He is ignoring me ever since last Saturday. I tried to reach out several times via WhatsApp and called one time. He isn’t responding whatsoever. I tried to apologize and everything, but nothing works. 

He still has my number saved him, since I still see his photo and he has it on „only for contacts“. Of course he still could have deleted the chat. He didn’t block me or sth like that and still follows me on Instagram. It’s really weird. 

I know i made a big mistake by telling a date that soon that I feel fooled, but I didn’t expect that he would ghost me after 5 weeks of texting every day, talking on the phone for 9 hours and a nice meet up.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nwnrus/he_is_ignoring_me_but_still_follows_me_on_insta/

My dad was okay with it as the guy’s career background would help our family business if things went well. (Though I’d like to establish that my dad isn’t forcing my hand on this.) I reluctantly agreed to be polite. 
So basically, my dad’s friend gave my mobile number to this guy and I, in turn, received no information whatsoever (not even a name!) about the guy except that he’s shy. 

The guy started texting me (we can’t meet face to face as we’re currently both in different cities) and was also ‘uncomfortable’ sharing his name since he was after all, ‘shy’. After texting with him for a few days, I found out that we don’t have anything in common. Like none at all. Our topics would only revolve around work and the pandemic (and srsly no one wants to talk about those all the time). After days of texting, I was finally able to get his name. I suggested video chatting to mix things up but he rejected the idea from the get-go. As for me, I wasn’t really comfortable talking to someone I haven’t really met, and not having able to put a face to the person I was currently talking to. Not giving me his name upfront too was also red flag for me. I don’t think being shy is an excuse not to give out your name. 
Now, I’ve been replying late to his text messages and sometimes not replying at all, which is rude, I know, but he’s so insistent with texting me every single night. I seriously don’t want to waste each other’s time and I also don’t want to ghost him because other than it’s rude, my dad’s friend would also be offended if they knew. 
So now, I need help on how to turn him down. Any advice?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nwnsms/i_was_setup_with_someone_i_dont_like_how_do_i/

I'm 37 year old man, have no experience in terms of dating or women. I'm below average in terms of appearance. I'm only 5 feet, and have a asymmetrical face (one of my eye is higher than the other and my jaw is more tilted towards the left). I was balding and have decided to have a shaved head and I do go to the gym.

Previously I've had a lot of issues with self confidence and was insecure due to my appearance and bullying. I still have some insecurities but after seeking professional help I'm in somewhat of a better place.

I've never had any success with the ladies, either online or in person. During my late 20's I got a desperate and paid for two dating platform but never even got a match. I even tried asking my friends if they had any single friends who they can introduce me to, it would usually result in either I getting ghosted after a few texts messages or them saying they already have a boyfriend/not ready for a relationship.

Due to the nature of my job I have to take care of myself (like hygiene, grooming, and clothing), and as mentioned earlier I go to the gym too. I'm completely lost here. I want to have at least one relationship in my lifetime, I also want to experience my first kiss.

I met them online basically through dating apps. We've made things clear very early when we started to talk and all agreed to look for serious relationship. They usually mention their ex's family, hobbies, or some experience (with or without these guys I'm talking to). But I never really brought up things related to my ex unless they ask me to cuz I don't want to confuse them or let them think I haven't moved on (I did, and I rarely think of my ex during the conversation). All the talk about their ex is not solicited by me.
Should I consider this as a good thing or a bad thing? Would anyone here do the same thing? 
Sometimes I think they obviously haven't moved on or use me as a rebound. But probably they are trying to bring up new topics to talk about? Or they are just being honest about their past?

So far we’ve been on 5 dates, about once per week, 4 of them one on one, and the last one was at a BBQ where I met his group of friends.

I’ve been just dealing with it and haven’t brought it up because it’s so early and I want to play it cool. 

This Friday my friends are going out for a bday/going away party, and I’m thinking about inviting him. I also have a wedding in a little over 2 weeks and I’m thinking about inviting him to that too (for an old college friend, so he may know people there too). Obviously I need to text him soon about Friday, but also I want to give him enough notice for the wedding. But I feel weird being like “hey do you wanna come to this event and then also this event?”. Feel like it’s too much and I’m coming on too strong. Should I ask him out for Friday today and then wait a few days for the wedding? Or just do it all at once?

I called Honey Boo Boo last week to ask if their company could help mine out.

They also sounded disappointed when I told them that they'll find someone else walking by with a different color shirt (inside joke).

My poorly planned valentines was because I tried to pick a place the day of in a busy city and we ended up going to a overworked and seemingly understaffed (or un-prepared) restaurant where everyone in there had at least an hour wait. They gave us wine and my ex got a headache cause she was drinking but not eating. It wasn’t a good night. Lots of things led to us breaking up but this certainly didn’t help on my end.

I responded to say I hope she's feeling better and to let me know when she's feeling well enough to meet up. She got back to me the day after to say she would be free on Tuesday coming up but would be busy for the rest of the week, and if not then she would be happy to set something up for the week after ( this was sent on the Saturday). Unfortunately I was busy on the Tuesday so couldn't meet up, I replied to explain this and that I'd love to meet up the following week instead, we've been using WhatsApp so I saw that she had read this message on Sunday but didn't reply. I didn't think much of it and thought she would reply at some point but she never did.

I’ll try to put everything that might be important so maybe you can get a better sense of what happened, and I apologize in advance if my English or writing skills aren’t the best.
I (24,M) have been chatting lately with a girl from my university (22,f).
I still don’t know her very well, but from what I have understood for now is that she is a very kind, gentle person, she speaks in a very soft voice, very intelligent (one of the best in our university, and our university is very big), she is shy and introverted, kinda awkward sometimes, and I think she might have some OCD (she doesn’t cross the road unless in some specific points and other weird things).
At first she was very warm and friendly, then we started to get into politics, and she got kinda cold from that point. 
I was starting to feel kinda interested in her so it was disappointing, but I said to myself whatever and I let the conversation die off. 
Then she writes me again, but the friendliness was still gone, and she was just asking for help in statistics. Again, weird, she is like levels above me so why should she ask me? I didn’t want to keep the conversation going, so I let it die.
Then she writes me again, but ended in the same way. Because every time I try to be friendly but she acts very cold and it didn’t give me a good vibe.
This pattern goes on for a while, Until three days ago she gets back to being friendly suddently. Long story short I compliment her, she takes it well, make a couple of jokes, it feels like everything is going well, and I ask her out. 
We went out yesterday evening, and I really liked her and passing my time with her. I thought it went great.
She writes me again yesterday night thanking me for the time passed together, I answer her this morning with a light joke and complimenting her smile (which I really think it was amazing, maybe she thought it was cheesy?) and a heart. And then the dreaded answer “😊”.
Another thing that might be important: every time I was “too kind”, in the most general way, she would back off a little.

I (M22) had a visceral connection with this girl (F23) I met through tinder, who was super into me and I was her, but this was at the beginning of the pandemic. We talked a lot, sending long messages, discussing our passions and hobbies such as painting and Animal Crossing. We zoomed once and talked for like two hours, she genuinely seemed interested in me, and would ask questions about me, asking my opinions on things. The sad thing about all this is I never actually got to meet her, as both our parents were incredibly strict about COVID, so meeting in person wasn’t an option, except I was fine waiting till after the pandemic as I’m a very patient person.

As of September, this girl went to grad school in the UK, so she moved away (we live in the states), and left my last message without responding. We had talked about her going away but never touched on where ‘we’ stood. I had asked her if she wanted to zoom again, I decided to give her some time and let things flow, as we both suffer from depression. I didn’t hear anything back from her, so I sent another text in January, saying I’m still interested in meeting up. Still nothing. A few days later, I see on her Spotify that she has a playlist ‘fucking depressed’. A month after that, a playlist of hers popped up with the title ‘LDR’ she had made. These threw me off because I thought they were about me (songs in her playlists that we used to talk about). I also understand being single in a different country (I wouldn’t necessarily want to be tethered to someone I haven’t actually met)  

Recently, she had another Instagram account pop up, this one about Animal Crossing. I thought this was dope, so I hit that follow button. A few days progress, and she removed me on all social media, except switch and tinder (???) I’m having a hard time getting closure or figuring out what to do.

I really like her, and I thought she felt the same but it feels like she is pushing me away. I’m not sure if me following that new account triggered her depression, but I just want to know where we stand. She returns from grad school in August, so I want to reconnect with her.

So I'm a little worried. I (18F) know that a guy (18M) is going to ask me for a date in a few months but I don't know if I should agree. (He's 18, I'm 17 but he's planning to ask me on my 18th birthday) 

On one hand, I have developed strong feelings for him. I'm completely smitten and blinded but I don't want to get myself hurt. 

On the other hand, I don't think that I can trust him. 

He was a player but I don't know what happened, he suddenly got obsessed with me. I was indifferent and cut contact with him because at that time I didn't want to be associated with such a person. (Once he did pull a risky stunt just to be able to see me) 

Now, he has transformed himself completely (as in he has become more understanding, ambitious about his career and all that). I have respect for him as he isn't just being a bully, he is actively trying to work on himself and his mistakes. 

We reconnected about an year or an year and a half back. He has been such a positive influence and I have never felt this way. I have never even dated anyone purely because I never wanted to but now I feel a little different. 

Is the past a problem or should I forget how he was? 

I feel like he truly cares and is genuine but I can't help it, I don't want to see myself hurt. My closest 3 friends have been in abusive relationships and 1 is pregnant right now. I live in a third world country and almost everyone is against them now, they've become so weak. I want to continue being their support, not be stuck in an abusive relationship.

I obliviously revealed too much about my darkness, and she tried to change to the one that I'm obviously not. For example, she always complains that I'm such a serious, studious person, and keeps pushing me to become a ""happy"" person. The problem is, our worldview is very different and our perception of happiness is very different. I feel lucky to get to know her and really appreciate her effort, but at the same time, this makes me kind of uncomfortable and I feel repelled by what she tries to make of me.

I usually cut people off very easily once I find they are toxic, and I am scared that I will cut her off eventually. My gut instinct tells me that I should keep her as a friend for my personal development until she gets tired of me but her action is kind of destructive to my ego. Yes, I want to sometimes have fun in my life but I'm a more goal-oriented person and she doesn't seem to understand this. She is a very light-hearted, down-to-earth type of person.

Yesterday she told me that she was interested in me, in a playful manner. I didn't know how to react and she obviously misunderstood what I responded and got suddenly angry (she thought I said ""you should know yourself.""

I feel like I'm going to keep a little distance with her in order to protect myself and focus on my work. Honestly, it's kind of overwhelming. But I also don't want to hurt her.

77,nwvc4a,1623351169,"Is it just me, or is being an Asian dude kind of a handicap when it comes to dating in the US, especially online?","So a bit of context: I'm a 27 year old Korean-American dude. I'm not what I would personally consider attractive, despite being in okay shape and not overweight, but I'm also not terrible to look at. I guess...middle of the pack? Average?

I've been online dating on and off for years, largely because I get uncomfortable being around large groups of new people/strangers and because I'm more introverted than not.

I'm definitely on the more geeky side of hobbies, but some of my more mainstream ones are cooking, performing stand-up comedy, pets, and writing. I'm a graduate student looking for a post-pandemic job while finishing up school for advertising/marketing.

Admittedly, I haven't had nearly as much time spent dating IRL/in-person, and COVID obviously took a year and change from everyone's life outside, but even before lockdowns and what not. I've put work into my online profiles and pictures, but I just get this sense that a lot of women aren't interested in dating an Asian man, whether it be biases, stereotypes, etc. I've also encountered studies done on online dating which seem to reinforce this point, and I'm getting a little frustrated with how much effort I'm putting into dating/making connections (online until California reopens), but not really getting anything out of it.

I guess what I'm asking for is advice, opinions, and input. I'm not trying to date because my mental or emotional state would be dependent on finding someone, I just want to get out there and try to get close to someone else.

Me ""Do you live around here?""

Her ""yeah I live off of ***** street""

Me ""You want go on a date sometime?"" 

Her ""No I have a boyfriend right now.""

The we talked a little more but that was the gist.  

So I mentioned this interaction with a friend of mine and she mentioned she might have found it too forward or creepy.  So my question is, is that generally an exceptable thing to do these days?

Recently had a date with a girl a few days ago and things seem to have gone pretty well by my standards! she ended up spending the night, but kind of rushed off in the morning, which I guess is understandable.

probably a big thing is that she's moving back to france for the summer, and she only has a few weeks left in the summer. Taking this into consideration, I recently sent her a follow-up text to see if she'd like to hang out again before she leaves... and nothing since then...

- Guys who were down for fwbs and so was I back then. After a few hookup they ghosted me. I brought it up to save my time. I don’t like being strung along. Anyway they admitted they didn’t find it interesting. Fine by me. I moved on. A few months later they came back. I of course was just nicely responded. A couple of small talk then lead to them saying “I’m seeing this girl. She’s hot. We’re having a lot of fun.” yadayada… Um why do I need to hear that?

- Guys who didn’t really put efforts when we were going out  then came back saying “I should’ve tried harder”. No problems, but I moved on with someone already. They kept coming back after a few months checking on me and suggesting going out as friends. I’m fine with that. But until I talk to them in a friendly way they left me on read lol

I mean, can somebody here just tell those guys to grow up?

Basically this girl I’ve been seeing did a full 180 and has decided she wants to move away (about 300/400 miles away) so a relationship really wouldn’t be realistic. We still have enormous amounts of feelings for each other but she’s more or less decided she has to prioritise improving her life and she believes moving away would do this. I agree this is a good opportunity for her but still I can’t help but think about myself and how I want her to stay. We have a holiday booked 2 weeks away. Do you think I should just cut all ties now and cancel the holiday. Do you think I should spend the next weeks before she leaves trying to covertly make her want to stay. Or any other option.

87,nwwoar,1623354568,Will a passive guy let you know if he’s interested or shy away from his feelings altogether? Need help navigating my situation,"Hoping to gain some insight here, preferably some male perspective.

I met this guy while I was travelling to a nearby city for work. We’ve been talking since February. Prior to leaving on vacation to see his boys for Memorial Day weekend, he texted me to say that he needed to get his last fill before leaving. We went back and forth for a couple of hours and I wished him well on the trip. He returned on Tuesday evening, but I didn’t wanna reach out in case he had the post vacation blues. 10 days passed and he finally texted me. We had a very great conversation and at the end he said, “I wanted to make sure we didn’t go out of touch because I do like talking to you a bunch. I have a tendency to be shitty with reaching out, but didn’t want to let that happen here.” Furthermore, he called me a gem and said he would keep the train moving somehow.

3 days pass and I text him to see how he’s doing. Not just that, but I let him know that he was on my mind. I realize this was very forward of me. He responded by saying he thought his novelty would’ve worn out by now. Wished me a goodnight and said, “You know you’re in my mind, too.”

Up until our last interaction, he has given me absolutely nothing to distinguish whether he sees me romantically or as a friend. I’m not used to talking to someone for this long and not knowing where we stand. I could ask him, but I don’t want to make the situation uncomfortable and risk losing the bond we’ve built.

For a while, I tried my best at dating but got ignored, ghosted or hurt time and time again. I know this is what happens, but it doesn't change that it did hurt and that I started realising the biggest problem: I am boring. I just play videogames and study nerdy things like some myths, mythological creatures, game lore, started studying reptiles a while ago, etc. But other than dropping some mildly fun facts to those who care, I'm boring. I don't go out because of social anxiety, I don't have interesting experiences, got no real interesting hobbies, etc. 

So, I'm not sure. People always say ""just be yourself,"" but if being myself makes me boring I'm not sure if I want that. Should I change? If so, I'm not sure how.

1) The guy tries again to ask you out another day
Or
2) The girl who is busy should counter to suggest another day

As a guy (m27) with some integrity I wouldn't suggest another day as I think if the girls is truly interested they would. However I understand that some girls might not be confident or forward enouth to do so. 

The way I see it is the girl has said they are busy and don't suggest a different day it's probably because they don't fancy another date but don't want to hurt the guys feelings/or just rather take the easy way by fading out

I'm interested to hear what people's opinions are in the situation and if they have been in the same place, so if you don't mind including your gender and age so we can see how it differs from person to person.
