No exaggeration I just reported five in the last half hour. Some of the profiles are getting harder to spot because I guess they're stealing pictures from regular accounts rather than model accounts. There's usually pretty easy to spot because there are no selfies and pictures look obviously staged. And way too good of a quality to be not professional. I have to laugh the ones that list doctor or MD as a profession but only a master's degree for education. Even then you can usually tell within a message or two if it's from a real person or not. It's so aggravating and makes it harder to weed through accounts to actually talk to a real person.

So recently I have been struggling with constant obsessive worries. I am in a committed and happy relationship with my boyfriend of 2 years but about a month ago I got this sudden overwhelming feeling of ‚Äúwhat if you are gay‚Äù ‚Äúyour gay‚Äù etc. I have never been sexually attracted to another woman and have never been in a relationship with another woman and never could imagine it! However it is a thought that has constantly been consuming me! I think I‚Äôm straight yet I keep getting these thoughts which are really really distressing me to the point of not being able to function in daily life. Everytime I‚Äôm watching tv or see something about gay or homosexuality I instantly get the thoughts back so my mind try‚Äôs to avoid anything to do with homosexuality incase it triggers the thoughts again( may I also state I have gay friends and am not homophobic). 

This obsessive worry is now intertwined with me questioning my relationship. My mind keeps questioning ‚Äúdo you still love him‚Äù or ‚Äúyour feelings aren‚Äôt the same anymore‚Äù- which I am aware I‚Äôm past the honeymoon phase in my relationship hence why I don‚Äôt feel this excitement as much anymore but the thought of leaving my boyfriend is causing anxiety and obsession also again to the point I can‚Äôt function properly in daily life, I‚Äôm loosing my appetite, my sleeping pattern is all over the place and I‚Äôm struggling to look at him in the same way at the moment. 

I‚Äôve have just started an antidepressant from my doctor for anxiety.

If we discuss love languages, mine is 1. quality time and 2. physical touch. I can't imagine having enough time to develop a loving relationship with two people as my quality time means A LOT.

I grew up in a small town where I was friends with a lot of guys. I hung out with one of them alone all the time and we had always jokingly said we‚Äôre gonna marry eachother. We basically always went on dates and flirted but never made a move. I‚Äôm oblivious so I didn‚Äôt think he liked me but everyone always told me he did. I didn‚Äôt even realize I liked him because it was just so natural and we always had a connection like I‚Äôve never had before. We just got eachother and it took no thought. Everyone else around us always saw it too. My family would say we‚Äôre going to get married along with a lot of my friends. It‚Äôs a feeling I can‚Äôt explain. I look back and realize he was always nothing but respectful and never tried to pull a move on me. We ended up going to date functions together and he slept over a few times. Long story short we did everything basically but have sex. I ended up realizing how much I liked him and he told me that he liked me too. We ultimately talked it out and decided not to make it into a relationship because we valued the friendship too much. Well a year later one of our bestfriends tells me he likes me. He also says that he thought we always had a connection but tbh I wasn‚Äôt very close with this friend. I tell him I can‚Äôt do this to our other friend because I did not want to ruin that. Everyone tells me I‚Äôm crazy and that if the other guy really liked me then he would‚Äôve given me the time a day when he had the chance. So I end up dating the second guy who is so perfect and treats me like a queen. I couldn‚Äôt of asked for more. The problem is I still thought about the first friend and ultimately convinced myself I didn‚Äôt like him anymore and I was just overthinking. I dated the second friend for a year and a half. I realized after I cut contact that I was still crazy into the first friend. To the point where I truly believe he was the only person I‚Äôve been sexually attracted to. The problem in my relationship was I didn‚Äôt feel much sexual feelings at all torwards him. Anyway the first friend would get drunk and always tell me how he regretted it and that I was the one for him. He has a girlfriend now so we keep our space but I can‚Äôt help but feel like he has always been the one. I‚Äôve never felt this way about anyone and I felt this way before I ever dated the other guy and just suppressed those feelings. We were all 3 really close friends so I want to know what are the odds that we‚Äôll ever be able to be together?

A side note is the guy I dated always said he felt like I was gonna marry the first friend too so I know I‚Äôm not crazy for feeling this way when everyone saw if",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1158644,public,self,Torn between two guys and a happily ever after,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sr7ptx/torn_between_two_guys_and_a_happily_ever_after/,no_ads,0,dating

We hit it off immediately. We have different interests, but our personalities, values, and humor just really worked well. We talked every day, went to hiking events together, and went on actual dates. 

Fast forward 2.5 months, and he still hasn't kissed me. I tried gently hinting that I wanted that, but nada. Finally, I was like, ""What if he just sees me as a friend?"" So I texted him to ask if he actually saw me as a romantic interest, or just as a friend. He responded saying that he didn't think he could provide what I was looking for, and therefore, thought friendship would be the better choice. 

I finally saw him today for the first time in a few weeks. I brought up the ""just friends"" decision, and we talked about how we'd proceed with that. He said that once he makes a decision to be friends, he doesn't go back on it. 

But then, I asked him how he knew what I was looking for in a relationship, since he'd never asked. And he brought up my OKC profile, where I had said, ""I like to be friends with someone before I start dating them."" He said that he totally respected if I wanted to be friends with someone for 5 or 6 months before dating them, but that wasn't something he could do. Thing is...I meant friends for like a few weeks. I never said 5 or 6 months. 

He said he hadn't kissed me because he wanted to respect starting as friends and assumed I'd tell him when I was ready, but that backfired, because I assumed he just wasn't interested in me. And when I texted him asking how he saw me, he assumed I was forcing him to define things...and he made his decision based on my OKC profile. 

So there we were, standing awkwardly in a parking lot, realizing we both accidentally friend-zoned each other. I told him I'd really wanted to kiss him this whole time, and he told me he's attracted to me. But I had other plans, so I had to cut things off. Before I left, I kissed him on the cheek, and he was like, ""Oh, I thought you were going to try something else."" So I felt like I messed up again by not just going for an actual kiss.

Now, I don't know if this is a salvageable situation. We both like each other and we're both attracted to each other, which we admitted out loud, in person. We both realize that our assumptions backfired. But he also said before that once he makes the decision to be friends, he sticks with it. Is there anything I can or should do? I really like this guy, and I don't want to mess things up more than I already have. I'm just so upset at myself. 

TL;DR: Me and the guy I was seeing both assumed the other person was only interested in being friends, so we decided to just be friends‚Äîuntil we realized that we both really liked each other and wanted the same thing.

At work, a woman started hitting on me. She's 35. Has 2 kids, has a house. We have had a few lunch dates, grabbed coffee, and chatted some. In conversation she told me she isn't sure that she really would want to start over with more kids at this point. I do like her though. 

I don't have a lot of close friends, so having someone new to talk to is exciting to me. I'm not really sure I'm getting the butterflies with her though. I do like spending time with her, but I wonder if it's because I don't have a lot of people to talk to in general. She also doesn't fit into what I was hoping to find for a partner.

Anyways, I (24M) wanna get back out there on the dating scene once things have calmed down with Omicron. But I also plan on finding a gym or dojo, or taking up some other physical, male-dominated hobby so I can get fit and lose weight. The reason?

&amp;#x200B;

Like I said, I wanna try my luck dating and enter a serious relationship. And I agree with that Spike Spiegel quote from Cowboy Bebop: *""I love the kind of woman that can kick my ass.""* Essentially, I find it attractive when a woman is either tomboyish/masculine, or if she's physically capable and can hold her own (especially since I lack the protective ""Hero Instinct"" some guys have). Strong, tough, athletic, stocky, muscles, fighting skill, skill with weapons, tall being preferred. Those are just my types: Tomboys and strong women. 

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, I plan on going to a gym/dojo to kill two birds with one stone: Losing weight/getting stronger, and hoping to find a strong/masculine partner. The reason why I'm not trying my luck online is because I'm short at 5'6/167 cm. Online dating is more superficial, which makes dating worse for short men. It's better for me to try to build an actual connection and try my luck in the real world.

I honestly figure maybe one or two people will read this and respond at all, maybe I'll get randomly down voted. That's probably about it.

Almost 30, lived the life of a hermit, am kind of broke for someone my age and figure no one who would find me attractive and enjoy my personality would be OK with that even if I'm trying to better my situation long-term. 

With my luck, after struggling with body dysmorphic tendencies for years which stopped me from going out I'm sure that despite thinking that I'm actually an alright looking and even handsome guy that I'm probably actually below average or ugly. Regardless, even if I was good looking, I doubt most women would care to stick around at/around 30+, they want a guy who's got his shit together. A REAL man.

I only have like one close friend left in my life from high school since my major anxiety/depression stopped me from engaging with classmates or even going towards the last two years.. Not sure how I graduated on time, honestly. 

So was going to make an effort to go out on my own and try to find local places (I live somewhere just outside NY. My local area is apparently dead and everyone goes to NY and other surrounding places) and then the pandemic happened and that's basically put that idea on hold. 

Now I just work two shitty jobs and will hopefully try to get a better long-term job in the next few months and barely have time to play a video game or write a song or something as it is, let alone waste my time wandering around locally to find a good social place that isn't a much older crowd.. 

I basically come home from the first job, work out and eat and do whatever for maybe 2 hours, then go to the next job most days. Even if I get a better job, it won't suddenly make single women more available to me. I don't really know where they are besides NY or a surrounding borough. What young woman in NY is not going to be financially ambitious or an aspiring model or actress or some other lofty goal? Whatever it is that they're looking for, I doubt that it's anything that I've got. 

I don't even know where I could go to meet single women, and chances are better looking dudes will be around to basically render me invisible. lol. Online dating never worked, wasted my time. Might've gotten a message or two but it never actually led to a real life date or anything close to a relationship. I feel like I have no control over this aspect of my life. You can't MAKE someone desire to talk to, approach, or be with you.

I just don't know what to do. Just because I'm still working on my financial situation probably shouldn't mean that I should not work on that aspect of my life, but.. Seems like it's just never going to happen regardless of what I do and I should probably truly accept it. I think to myself that it is what it is, but I'm not sure that I truly feel that way and am at peace with the idea of spending the rest of my life alone. 

At this point, I'm feeling like I'm set in my ways, like being locked into a rollercoaster even though you hate heights. Why bring some random stranger into my life to force expectations and judgement on me. If I'm mostly (at first sight, subconsciously/mentally, or verbally) rejected to begin with, it's sort of an irrelevant concern anyway. lol. 

I've had some minor successes in a way but won't get into specifics.. At the end of the day I've never been in a relationship with someone who wanted to be a part of my life and I a part of theirs... And if someone does show interest at this point, I'm probably gonna wonder why even if I don't actually express that to them. 

It really does hurt, though. I wish that I could at least figure out  a plan of action but I can't think of anything that is an exact location to go, or a specific thing to do... It's really frustrating.

We had sex for the first time yesterday, but before we got it on I asked what he wanted. He said he wanted to date me and i said i didn't want something casual. First, what does that mean ? 

I am a very detailed oriented person, and the first time i slept over i saw that on his phone (did not go through it. He left it unlocked) he had 200 something hinge notifications, today the tinder notification were going off. I understand we are not together, and that we haven't made things exclusive. But it kind of bothers me that now i know he is playing the numbers game. I myself am talking to other people but haven't officially gone on any dates other than him.

What i know so far, is that i do like him. He is someone i normally wouldn't really be interested in, but just being around him I find myself opening more and more, than i did with my previous person. Last night , i also told him i want to stick around and it kind of seems like he wants the same. 

Here is the part where i need help! I want to know when is the right time to have the ""what are we talk"". I want to take reigns of this relationship too, i don't just want to be a log drifting in the river, i like that i'm allowing myself to go with the flow but don't want to make the same mistake that I did last time which was getting comfortable in the flow. I was wondering if I should talk to him about it and tell him, where I stand and what I want from him and that he doesn't have to respond at the moment but that he has a deadline. I was thinking of doing so when we hit the one month mark and have him give me his response in two weeks to the end of the month tops.

Most coworkers left by 12:30 and one of my coworkers Mike (m27) didn‚Äôt want to leave and I (f23) was worried about him driving home so I thought I‚Äôd stay with him as a way to stall him to sober up a tiny bit I also wasn‚Äôt ready to leave.

Mike has a girlfriend of 6 years who I‚Äôve met and hung out with the two of them and others once before- I‚Äôm even friends with his GF on Facebook. I‚Äôd call us work acquaintances not friends yet. 

Once everyone left he suggested i sit next to him instead across from him. I assumed it was because it was loud- didn‚Äôt think anything of it. We were just shooting the shit (laughing and talking about work, life, etc.) for 30 min before the bar closed.

All of a sudden he put his hand on my leg and asked if he could kiss me. I said no! Absolutely not- we can‚Äôt. He kept trying to convince me.  He was supposed to drive me home so we walk to the parking garage and on our walk he still is asking to kiss me and tries to turn me around. I tell him he‚Äôs going to regret this tomorrow and that I can‚Äôt kiss him he has a GF. 

I make sure he‚Äôs good to drive. We get in the car and I‚Äôm just talking about random stuff and I kept saying ‚Äúanywho‚Äù and he called me out and he said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm kind of in love with that you‚Äôre saying that‚Äù (?!) I laugh it off. In the car he‚Äôs like okay as soon as we get to this red light you‚Äôre going to kiss me. I laugh because i don‚Äôt want things to be weird between us and I‚Äôm drunk but I‚Äôm like no definitely not you‚Äôre horrible. I said i won‚Äôt tell anyone but stop. 

He texts me asking me not to say anything to anyone but he still wants to kiss me but he also doesn‚Äôt at the same time. The next morning I said let‚Äôs forget about this I won‚Äôt say a word but delete all those texts! 

His only response was ‚Äúhahahahah you‚Äôre the best‚Äù . No apology or regret or a thank you?! Then at work he has been over compensating I think for that and has just been talking to me even more than normal with more confidence and I can‚Äôt look at him the same. I‚Äôm just confused and would hate for the same thing to happen again where he would try to kiss me granted he‚Äôs super handsome and we are bowling again this coming Friday. It only worries me if we find ourselves in this situation again but we‚Äôre even more drunk I may not think about it. Don‚Äôt plan on that happening but I‚Äôm confused why he even decided to kiss me - I never thought of him in that way at all but now I can‚Äôt stop especially now that he‚Äôs coming up to my desk more to talk to me/ texting me about funny things in the office which we wouldn‚Äôt do much before it worries me that he may continue this. What do you think and why is he acting this way now?

TLDR; handsome coworker who I was only acquaintances with tried to kiss me- I declined bc he has girlfriend.

I (20M) met a girl (20F, lets call her Lisa) this summer in the same city my parents live in. Told her that I wasn't interested in any sort of long-distance relationship but that I'd be happy to date her for a few weeks or something until I moved back to my university city after summer break. She was cool with that, then when I moved she asked if she could come visist every once in a while since her friend lives in the same city I study in. I said sure but made it clear that I didn't want anything serious if we aren't living in the same city. After she visisted me a few times over a month or two I felt it was getting too serious and said that I think we should stop seeing eachother before anyone gets hurt since this won't work out. More or less after I said that we should stop seeing eachother she came with news that she was going to move to my city around new years. I asked if she was 100% sure and she said that yes she was going to move. So I agreed to date casually for a few more months and to potentially become exclusive with her afters she moved here. Turns out, she didn't move here around new years and instead post-poned it to next summer. I told her that this was a major thing for me and that I think it was bad for her to essentially lie about when she was going to move since I had been so clear about how important the distance issue was for me, she made it sound like it wasn't her fault that she couldn't move but I was upset because she said she was sure when I asked her the first time.

All this time I haven't dated anyone else, even though we weren't explicitly exclusive because it felt like the right thing to do. However this week I met someone by accident and went on a really nice first date. After which I called up Lisa and said that we should stop seeing eachother, partly because I was unhappy about how she ""lied"" about when she was moving and partly because I have met someone else. She had a hard time accepting this, got mad at me for not telling her about the first date earlier (even though it was two days ago), and mad at me for not telling her sooner about how upset I got over her post-poning moving (even though I have told her that she just thought I wasn't clear enough or something). She also said that she was planning on surprising me on valentines day with my favorite animal knitted (sewn, whatever idk) in my favorite color. I have never been in a serious relationship and noone has put in so much time to make something special for me, so hearing that she has put in the effort to make something like that for me just makes me wanna cry. Made me feel so bad about rejecting her but I felt like it had to be done.

Truth is, Lisa was really nice to me. She cared about me a lot and my mom has been very, very sick lately and Lisa has comforted me a lot. I liked Lisa but honestly I didn't love her. However I think it's time for me to find a relationship, and I just can't wait another 6 months for her to potentially move here and for it to potentially work out.

I'd really appreciate someone's opinion on all of this, I haven't really told the entire story to anyone. Do you think I've done Lisa wrong? Please be honest.

TLDR: Met a girl (Lisa) over the summer 2021 in another city, didn't really want anything serious long-distnace but she convinced me she was moving to my city in January 2022. That didn't happen, I met another girl and had to tell Lisa we should stop seeing eachother.

She actually came back to our job during her winter break and we were cool with each other. But we agreed while she‚Äôs there to keep our distance because we both acknowledged that feelings were still there. She reiterated that the breakup was all her and that she was upset with how things ended.

Our second date was last week. It was a joy. We'd initially planned for a night out with art-related things, but our schedules didn't work out. Instead, we went to a board game bar. We chatted for well over an hour, both realized, ""Oh yeah, we should play a game,"" and picked a card game that, coincidentally, taught us more about each other. It was sweet.

I dropped her off at her house. I don't think either of us wanted to leave, so we just chatted inside my car before we kissed. Again, it was very sweet and a nice change of pace from what I'm used to on early dates.

We planned a third by the time I went to bed that night. We're going to a museum then getting dinner this upcoming weekend. I'm giddy knowing I get to see her again; it's been what feels like ages since I've liked someone to this degree. I'm very excited.

Plus, we went from casually chatting over text to talking the entire day in the aftermath of our second date. I like to believe this is a good thing and I'm not just looking too much into it.

I recall within the day we'd met we were on the phone for like 4 hours. As cliche as it sounds, I felt like I'd known him my whole life. He lives in the States and I live in New Zealand by the way.

Despite how great it was I did notice he began to be quite inconsistent, which was fair enough because I understood he was very busy (not to mention we were just two people on the internet who had just begun talking so I couldn't expect much, naturally), and then eventually we'd only have some small talk every other week or so. Initially, during all of this, I would always try to be as engaging as possible but within a few messages back and forth he'd always leave me on read. Naturally, I figured he just wasn't very interested and though we'd still talk occasionally, I wouldn't be as engaged as previously. By the way, when he texts he's very brief and to the point, even 'dry' maybe. That's how I began to be as I didn't want to seem too eager and I was also just growing uninterested myself seeing as how I didn't see my level of interest being returned. The rare times he'd talk to me he'd always talk about how much he missed me and how we hates how far we live from each other because otherwise, he'd definitely want a relationship with me, and just saying all this sweet stuff that any girl would want to hear in that 'honeymoon' sorta phase. So this continues for a while and then eventually we stop talking entirely for about almost a month.

Last Sunday he reached out to me and we started talking again, we were on the phone pretty much immediately and it was just like old times. We also exchanged other social media and became friends. This went on for most of this week, we'd be on the phone for hours at a time and then text also. He also went on to ask me if I'd ever thought about a long-distance relationship. I told him definitely and that my last relationship was long-distance but just from another state. Can't remember exactly what he said afterwards but pretty much that he'd want that with me. I told him I like him just as much and we'd definitely do that, just maybe after a little more time. No hard feelings on either side, he seemed to understand and it didn't come up again except one comment where he said he 'Can't wait to call me his girlfriend'. So yeah that was good and we continued to text and talk on the phone. When it came to texting though, although he was still fairly engaging he was usually on the more lacklustre side and would take very long to reply sometimes. I didn't care too much though because again, real life, other priorities, commitments etc.

So about two nights ago I had texted him during the earlier hours of the night and asked if we could talk on the phone. By the time he replied, I was fast asleep, I'd gone to sleep about two hours before he replied. So I wake a couple hours after he replies and see that he said yes we can call. I text him back asking if he's still free but stupidly I try to call him anyway. Almost immediately after, I get a text saying 'Why tf are you calling me? I sent that message hours ago'. I'm a little taken aback because I found it abit rude how he responded, a simple 'Sorry, I can't talk at the moment' would've sufficed in my mind. And it was especially confusing because the previous day he made a fuss about how I didn't call him though I was free and I told him I didn't like to call people unannounced and he made it seem like I was able to just call him without asking. So I apologise about calling but state my confusion regarding what he implied the previous day and also mention how although I understand perfectly his position, he didn't need to be so hostile. He basically tells me he wasn't being rude and that he never did actually say I can just call unannounced. I understood that and apologised that I misconstrued it.

The next day he texts me and says he wants to make it clear that I mean a lot to him even if it may not seem like it. I reply something like 'Haha that's so cute, it's all good. You mean a lot to me too'. To which he replies 'I never said sorry' and then a few other unrelated things. Cause I guess in his mind, me saying 'it's all good' was me thinking he was apologizing for the previous night. So eventually we get to a point where he's giving me one-word replies and so at some point I stop replying after he texts me 'Yep' in response to me saying something to the effect of 'I think I'm gonna stop being lazy and start going to the gym'. Like most people I assume, when I get one-word responses I think the person is no longer interested in talking at that moment. Rather than explicitly asking if they still want to talk I take it as a hint and leave them alone for a while.

So last night I wake up to a text from him upset that I left him on read and didn't talk to him for the entire day. I swiftly reply with how he replied to me with just 'Yep', so I assumed he no longer wanted to talk. And at this point, I'm very frustrated because it almost seems like he just likes creating non-existent drama. He goes on about how he only said 'Yep' because I said I was about to leave for the gym. I told him that I only said I think I might start going to the gym soon, as a conversation starter, not because I was literally leaving for the gym, which I think he was well aware of. He also tells me that despite responding with one word, he never told me he didn't want to talk. So for that I apologise but we still go back and forth for a while. At some point it seems we've settled it all and I apologise again for leaving him on read earlier. He makes a comment after this and I ask him to elaborate to which he replies 'Nothing dw'. So I leave it and ask him if he's free and he replies 'Why?'. This has always been to imply a phone call, and I'd usually follow it up with 'Wanna call?'. Though we would talk on the phone regularly, half the time I'd ask if he wanted to call, he'd ignore it entirely. In my mind he knows exactly what I'm talking about when I ask if he's free, cause of course, what else could I be asking for, it's not like I'm asking so we could make plans. We have an ocean separating us. I figured he didn't want to call so I say 'Nevermind' and start talking about something else and I guess that completely sets him off. He tells me I can kick rocks, and how I'm weird for that, and I'm just stunned. Because I have no idea how I'm always a villain every single time. And mind you he had just said 'Nothing dw' when I'd asked him to elaborate on a comment he'd made, so I didn't understand the double standard. I get my side out only to see that he's unfriended me and then blocked me too, on both platforms we speak on.

So that's basically it. Sorry for the long-winded story! And I don't even think I can condense it into a TL;DR. I know it's about as long as a novel. And I apologise for any unnecessary bits, it turns out I ramble even when typing lol.

( just imagine the worst) I have somehow managed not to fall apart and everything at least from the outside looks as if I am thriving. Doing well in school, social, bills are okay and finding ways to get things done financially.
 However, when I tried to date .. I had not idea what I was doing and kinda ruined a budding friendship. It was through him that I realized I was okay and was blindsided by so many triggers that I hardly recognized myself. I feel somewhat embarrassed bc this person is avoiding me like the plague. I am currently working with a therapist on the root of these triggers and I am very self aware now that my ex truly damaged a big part of me. 

I know that I need to be focused on healing myself and I am now. 

I am wondering if this is what I have to look forward to when I get out there again.

Communication is the real key to all misunderstandings. 

I have learned so much from here. But that was my mistake. Because I should‚Äôve talked to him instead. 

I always thought he was insensitive about a lot of things, but he was just inexperienced to explain himself. He thought about it, but let it go because he thought I wasnt thinking about things. 

I had this huge doubt about like a girl called ‚Äúsister‚Äù(which wasn‚Äôt really a sister). So it was bugging me so much that started to rehearse with my bestfriend how to approach him about this but also stand up for myself. Yes, I was actually so happy that I was gonna take a big step for me, because I was not like this before. 

He suggested a date outside, we went to the main city, we had good food, coffee, and we laughed a lot. He kissed me in my forehead as we were going down on elevator in a mall ( people didn‚Äôt often do this before due to cultural differences so I somehow still a little stuck to being scared of what people think). But it was the best feeling ever. He stared into my eyes a lot like I felt so pretty and confidence. It was a good night. 

Then we had the convo. It was.. nerve wrecking at first, but it went smoothly. I got the explanations that I think enough to actually explain a lot of my doubts. He‚Äôs more mature than I thought, he was just scared of saying things. And I ended up agreed with him to open up more in the future and he would do the same. 

Overall it was a beautiful night, a beautiful date. I‚Äôm just a happy person now. 

He thanked me so much for the conversation and the night before I left.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1158685,public,self,Learned that communication is really important.

We had a few really great dates, great chemistry, could talk for hours and hours without running out of things to say. Humour was a perfect match. Mutual attraction galore. It seemed really friggin great!!

But (and there‚Äôs always a but isn‚Äôt there üòë) he had told me since before we met that he wasn‚Äôt ready for a relationship rn due to school being very intense and needing to work on some personal things  (he has baggage from his last relationship). I was only looking for something casual at the time too so it was fine. But neither of us realized how much we would like each other.

So, he gets all scared and starts pulling away. I notice, we have a big discussion about it, and I decide to walk away because I can‚Äôt make him want me again like he did. We end things on good terms. Everything peaceful.

A week later I went into our snap convo to delete some sensitive saved chats and he starts messaging me cause it showed i was typing. We chat for a bit, then I end the convo.

Then another week later he messaged me asking if I deleted him on tinder, cause he saw me while swiping, and I told him I had deleted then remade the app a while ago (like before we met up). We chat again and he shows me his tinder bio, says he‚Äôs searching barely half heartedly, asks about my swiping luck and I tell him about a couple dates I‚Äôd been on. Again I‚Äôm the one who ends the convo (just not replying after a statement).

Days later I see him on tinder and swipe right. We match. He messages me on the app almost immediately and we chat for a little bit until I fall asleep and that‚Äôs it. We had another short conversation the next night that I initiated (I was drunk lol). Not doing that again though!

I can‚Äôt tell if this is really breadcrumbing or just coincidences? Is he just trying to test me, or make sure i don‚Äôt forget him? I still really like the guy but I‚Äôm not holding out hope. I know if he actually wanted me he‚Äôd do something about it. But what gives? Why even message me?

TL;dr: A guy who liked me a ton then lost interest in me almost overnight will find a reason to message me once a week.
