So my ex asked me how I am doing during the pandemic and he suggested to call me. 15 minute before the call he said that he is too tired from the holidays (Jewish holidays) and asked me if we can reschedule for tomorrow.

A year ago when he wanted to reconcile, he did the same thing. He told me he will call, but then did not follow through, left me hanging although he saw I was trying to call him back. He kind of enjoyed seeing me in pain OR he was really not aware how much it hurt me.

So now I told him that I feel unimportant when he is doing that and then suddenly he said he was actually dehydrated from moving houses and I was like what? He first told me that he was too tired.

I know he is in therapy, I know he struggles with self-esteem issues etc. He betrayed me in our relationship so the trust was gone. But when he is in therapy, he should know better or not? He apologised half a year ago for betraying and hurting me an being selfish. I do not know if I can trust him. He certainly is more aware of his problems, he is working on himself, maybe he is not capable of acting different, but I do not know if I can believe him now or trust him...

The more I learn about modern day romance and relationships it makes me wonder why we even seek out romantic partners? 

First off men are biologically programmed to want sexual variety, so as a result they're more likely to get bored of having sex with the same person after a while. Secondly, with so many dating apps that lead to countless options, at what point do we decide when somebody is right for us? 

Even then what if we do find somebody who choses to be loyal. How much longer before we start to get bored of each other and start to desire other people? 

What's the point of committing your whole life to somebody when you can just live your life by yourself without any extra stress? Yeah maybe your S.O can help you during times of turmoil but at the end of the day it's your life and your SO can't live your life for you. 

What's the point of having kids? Do you decide to have children once you decide your relationship starts to get boring and you no longer can think of other ways to bring the spark back?

Said mutual friend already gave me a heads up that this guy was kind of a player but all in all was a decent guy. Typically I don’t go for guys like that but since I wasn’t seeing anyone and wanted to explore, I figured why not. I’ve also considered my friend’s heads up that the guy was a player so I agreed and went into it without any expectations. I was also looking to lose my vcard and it seemed that this guy was perfect for it (a story for another time). 

Our first meeting was in a group setting. He and our mutual friend was out with their friend group and our mutual friend decided it was a fun and casual way to introduce us to each other. Long story short, we hit it off and ended the night with a kiss. 

After that he was consistent with texting me, greeting me good morning and good night everyday, giving me updates on what he’s up to etc. It was definitely something new since I haven’t experienced this with the guys I’ve casually dated before. I was pleasantly surprised with this so in return I’d keep him updated as well. 

We went on 3 more dates after the initial meeting and it all went well. On the third date he tried going to 3rd base but I refused since I was on my period. He withdrew his advances and we still finished the date on a good note. 

Oh and FYI, he knows I’m a virgin.

After that we started exchanging nsfw texts. He’d send a photo, I would send a photo. He then officially propositioned me by offering himself to take my vcard. Since I’ve also been dropping not-so subtle texts regarding that, I said yes. He seemed pretty excited and we were planning things for our next date, presumably the time he’d take my vcard away. 

After a few days he started texting dry but I owed it all up to him being busy since he’s in med school. Then out of the blue, he mentioned getting a call from his dad (he was currently dealing with a family problem) then he proceeded to just say he wasn’t in the mood because of everything that happened (whatever that meant). I asked him to elaborate but he never opened my messages after that. 
I also sent him a ffup text the next day asking if he was okay but he didn’t even bother opening my message. 

I stopped texting him after that thinking he was just busy with school and family stuff and that he needed space. But then I see that he started viewing my stories on instagram. Which probably meant he had the time to go online but why hasn’t he bothered opening my messages? I already accepted his proposition, I wonder why he went cold on me all of a sudden. 

I must say that I think I also got attached even when I conditioned myself to not expect anything from the guy. 

It’s been 10 days since our last communication. The question now is, should I send him another text or do I just move on? And why does he keep viewing my stories? Should I just block him?

All of the close friends I’ve made in college are guys who have the same problem I do. It’s not that I’m awkward, I enjoy talking to people and get along with almost everyone despite being an introvert at heart, but no part of my personality lends itself well to being socially active. Most of my hobbies are one-person deals (anything that involves a good story: reading, single player games, fanfiction, anime, etc.) and I have pretty bad agoraphobia and tend to gravitate to the corner of any room with more than six people in it like a magnet. Or go pet the dog should one be available.

Now, I’m still in college (got another year left) so it’s not a matter of opportunity, but every public event I might see myself going to wouldn’t lend itself well to kickstarting a good social life.

On top of that, I’d ideally like to meet someone relatively similar to myself, so I don’t think clubs and bars are the place to look anyways. But, bookstores nearby seem always empty, cafes are generally full of people who don’t want to be disturbed, other nerdy shops I might have liked are just as empty as the bookstores, and I’m hard pressed to find anything on meetup.com with attendees younger than 35. 

So, where should I start? What sorts of places should I go to meet girls, hopefully likeminded and relatively introverted ones I could see myself getting on well with? It’s not that I don’t talk to girls, I just never seem to really *meet* them, ya know?

I should add as well, I don’t think I’m willing to try online dating again, 95% of the people that populate any site I’ve tried are there for hookups, or have huge lifestyle differences I don’t think I would mesh with. Maybe it’s something on my end, but it was definitely too soul-crushing for me to want to dry again, at risk of sounding a bit dramatic there…

I (33F) can’t compromise on my list of expectations towards a potential partner (male). Here is the list:

\- Open-minded and friendly - no racist/sexist shit, but also no antivaxxing, climate-denying bullshit (overall a trusting, people-oriented person)

\- with a real, true passion for something ( which he invests time and money into )

\- self-supporting

\- of high emotional intelligence - working on fixing his issues/family issues/ recognizing unhealthy patterns in his life/able to communicate/ emotionally stable

\- accepting and better yet participating in my parallel life of clubbing, raves, consciousness expansion (I can't fathom a partner not experienced with or, worse, opposing the use of psychoactive substances)

\- well educated (not necessarily the titles, but real knowledge, ability to think critically, to be able to hold conversations on variety of topics)

\- experienced in life - with stories to tell, cool places to recommend and interesting people to meet

\- selfless - ACTIVELY helping people, NOTICING when others need assistance, not expecting gratitude for helping, initiating projects for his community/those in need

\- aware of his privileges and willing to step down and give space to those who had less luck in life/never had a chance to shine (nothing more sexy than this!)

\- caring for his body (healthy food and sports) and having a personal style (can't stand those men who mumble 'i don't need to look attractive, attractive is for girls'. Go away. you’re not masculine, you're lazy)

Is this too much to expect? I have been actively screening my environment for someone with all these traits, and so far I have found a few... women :D I am a part of different social circles, and I haven’t met one guy that would have these traits ☹

Do you find this list excessive? I feel like these are reasonable things to look for in a partner, but maybe men should have a lower bar?

Do you have expectations towards potential partner or you just go where the wind blows?（me- I’m done with that!）

If you have expectations, how do you compromise on them when choosing a partner? How much is too much and what expectations are ok? (my new rule of thumb: I will only date men who will fulfill the same expectations that I have of (and fulfill) myself)

Not sure what to do now after our conversation.

The topic of sex came up after watching the news and we discussed how people view sex.

I said that I wouldn’t date any girl that engaged in casual sex and we had an argument and she said that I was being misogynistic even though I didn’t say anything bad about those type of girls.

Like I don’t think there’s anything wrong with men/women who engage in casual sex, it’s just not my thing and I’m only interested in those who have sex when committed.

These surgeries were not botched — now I look undeniably conventionally attractive.

(2) Your height doesn’t matter either. I changed my height on Hinge and Bumble to three inches above my actual height (so from 5’10” to 6’1”) and to three inches below (so 5’7”). I used photos where they were either facial shots or my height was ambiguous. Quality and number of matches was pretty much exactly the same.

(3) I’ve been in bed with various women when I was in my lifetime-best cover model shape. I’m talking eating disorder, 8% bodyfat, striations in delts, veins in abs, and capped shoulders. Zero compliments, zero comments of any kind by girls in far worse shape (not necessarily overweight, just usually skinny with no tone or moderately slim). No change in quality and number of girls nor in the proportion of repeat calls.

(4) Size doesn’t matter. Through enlargment devices over 18mo I managed to increase my penis size from slightly above average to very big. We are talking about top 1% in volume judging by the calcSD Western Average (top 0.25% with the Global Average). Any compliments by girls about my size? Any ‘addiction to my penis’ from girls I slept with? Nope. All I got was uncomfortable oral sex with teeth, ‘sorry can’t do this position’ and sometimes having difficulty getting it in. No clear difference in number of repeat calls.

I want to settle down and stop going out. I just starting dating again after my last relationship. I love giving in relationships, as that is how I show I care. I always supported my bf, loved surprising him with expensive gifts or sentimental gifts, cook and clean, etc.. I always tend to get taken advantage of in all of my previous relationships. I feel I’m always taking care of men and I’m never given anything back emotionally or physically.

I recently went on two dates I met online. One guy was 34 years old claimed he owned several houses and was a successful real estate developer in NYC. He made sure to show me his $160,000 Mercedez and all the celebrities he’s met. On our first date we went to this bar for drinks. He had paid for the first round of drinks at the first bar, but then at the next bar he asked me to buy the round of drinks and shots for him and his friends. Then obviously he proceeded to try to take  me home.

Recently Iv been speaking to this guy who seems really nice and interested in more than sex. We went on a first date out to dinner at this nice steakhouse. One thing I thought was weird was that when the waiter came over to ask if we wanted a second cocktail he responded no right away before asking me. I did want another drink though so i went to the bar and got us a shot to take and he thanked me. Then I offered him money for the food bill, but he replied “it’s ok I got this one for now”. Then we went to this bar and he had asked me to buy all the drinks there, which I obviously did.

I’m not trying to sound entitled, because I believe things should be split equally in a relationship. However, my friends noted that it is weird that these men who have established careers would invite me on a first date and ask me to pay. Also I had to drive an hour and a half to meet them. I think this coupled with my past experiences is making me worried. I’m not sure if it’s me lol 

Now the second guy continues to text me and wants to keep seeing me. I’m just scared because we were talking over text and I told him I appreciated that he was making dinner plans for us, and he responded that he is trying  to impress me now until he wins me over and then he would stop. I was shocked he would say this even if it was a joke.

There is this guy that I ""met"" in weird circumstances. I used to work in a pub where he would occasionally come with friends and there was never anything other than the regular customer-weightress talk. However, after I stopped working there he added me on Instagram (he asked my colleagues about my @) and we randomly started talking. He had a gf at the time but it was never anything more than a friendly talk. We stopped talking at some point and I never initiated any kind of communication with him since he had a gf and I wasn't rly comfortable with that since we were strangers. Recently we started talking again, and we kind of ""clicked"" since we joke in the same manner, like similar things, have similar opinions and we also both struggle with depression so we wound understand each other when talking about those things too. 

What confuses me about this  situation is that he wouldn't mention his gf much, and when he would do that he wouldn't feel comfortable while doing so. He would tell me about his family and friends different types of stuff but he wouldn't speak about her much at all. I also showed our chats to my friends and they agree that it ""flirty"" in a way since we would basically text all day and talk about nonsense, he would also tell me he thinks I am pretty, and a great person and how he feels super comfortable talking to me. We recently went on a ""date"" where we would get filthy at some point. For example he fed me the food he ordered(literally with his fork(like a true friend would lol)), he also paid for everything and we would unnecessarily touch each other's hands but he would make comments like ""while you are my friend it is gonna be like this"", and he also mentioned his gf in a very weird sense but didn't actually want to talk about it even if I would ask about it. He didn't text me after the ""date"" but he apologized about it the day after and even tho I gave him the cold shoulder since I don't like this type of a behavior, he would persist initiating communication with me. He also complimented me in person, how I look pretty, my clothes are pretty etc. and he would go out of his way to ""take care of me"" so that I don't fall down or put my hood on my head so snow doesn't get on my hair.


I am not sure how he sees me, but I am much more comfortable with my friends, I don't rly feed them and I can talk to them about everything (especially guys) and I don't know how to kindly ""get rid of him""... can you guys pls tell me what you think?

I'm not a virgin but its been a few years since I had sex. I'm not the type that goes to bars and pick up girls easily, i'm really shy and the thought of approaching a woman in a club/bar or any public place freaks me out.

So I tried online dating. But the problem with dating apps is that its one huge picture contest. The girls are showing their makeup and curves, and the dudes are showing their muscles at the gym, cars, and holiday pictures. I HATE pictures, I don't have any good ones. So what now?

Search for an erotic advert site that doesn't force you to add pictures, you can just add a topic title and text. Its a kind of erotic craigslist/Reddit I suppose. So search for a free site like this in your area.

So in this ad, I posed as a 29 year old virgin who wants to lose his virginity. It turns out that some women (not a lot of them, but some) find this cute or interesting. I got some messages in my mailbox, most of them were from hookers but 1 or 2 from normal women. I gave her my tel number and we started chatting for a short while and exchanged pictures. She was a hot looking single mom who had this hidden kink of sleeping with someone who doesn't have any experience.

We set a date and I went to her house last saturday, and spent the night there. We watched a movie and then we started kissing and went upstairs to her room, we took of our clothes and she started to suck on my dick for a short while and ofcourse then came ""the big moment"". I wasn't a virgin ofcourse but I needed to pose as one so when she gently guided my dick in her (without condom) I came like a fountain deep inside her. Great relief after years of not getting laid. The next morning I kissed her and thanked her and went back home.

So I'm sharing this with you because, if it works for me (and i'm a really introverted and shy guy), it can for you. If you are a virgin, and you are affraid to approach women the normal way, this might work. Or if you are not a virgin like me, and don't like hookers that much, this is a good tactic to get laid as well.

So good luck, give it a shot, and keep safe. :)",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1154938,public,self,"Found a way to get laid, or lose virginity",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sdkftw/found_a_way_to_get_laid_or_lose_virginity/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,

There is a lot of pain associated with this because I've missed out on a lot of opportunities by selling myself short. 

I am working on being more ""open"" when I'm out, I'm just selective with people because I had surface-level conversations and while I do meet people online and date often (online) I would like to make a habit of pushing myself outside my comfort zone and being able to approach ""offline"" so to speak lol. 

So I go to the gym frequently and it's the one place I REALLY dislike approaching anyone because I would rather spend the 90 minutes working out and this is my church, not a place I would really approach, I'm sweating, I'm focused I'm not in the mindset to approach I'm in the mindset to lift and do cardio. However, over a period of time, I've gotten to know the regulars. There is one woman who works there and when I met her, she would always giggle and smile and joke around. I would even go as far as asking, what do you going on this weekend. And she would say, oh working, then nothing just chilling.. and being the jackass that I was crushing over her, I wouldn't say anything. BUT the reason for that is because I felt she didn't say ""what about you"" so I figured she's not interested so I would let it go. This happened twice, my friends and I had a laugh about how stupid I was.

Anyways we spoke a bit here and there whenever I would check in at the gym, and she would always sort of stare at me from a distance or clean the gym equipment next to me. Whenever we looked at each other she would smile, but being the jackass that I am I never approached. So a couple of months later, she became cold towards me, very very cold and dismissive, would ignore me and walk away. You know, it's whatever - this person doesn't owe me anything, so I let it be you know. 

I think I missed my chance with her, she now is talking to me and being friendly but I'm being super cautious and careful. She is in my eyesight most of the time regardless of where I'm at because she's either cleaning or working out on her lunch break while I'm there, but I notice that she avoids looking at me really hard. 

It makes me feel uncomfortable like I smile or nod at people once in a while, but with her, it's like me and her are trying our best to avoid each other, and it's awkward. I can see she even tries to look away as if I'm not there, she almost walked into a wall the other day by not paying attention. It's weird, and I certainly don't want to make her feel uncomfortable so I don't approach you to know or compliment or anything, but she keeps coming close to me and I don't know what to do.

I(M) want to preface this by saying forgive me for the inclusion of some of my background history and if sounds “stereotypically Redditor” I guess and a little bit rambly . I’ve been introspecting a lot in regards to this and I feel it provides some background for my current problem .

I just started university and I’ve very much felt the sense of this being a fresh start. I had a hard time making friends and connecting with in High School and while it still feels challenging, I think I’m benefitting from a new locale and new people. 

I’ve also tried to keep dating on the back burner and focus on making friends first.  During the beginning High School and parts Middle School I had a warped view on dating and crushes and had a habit of putting girls I was interested in on a pedestal or tricking myself into being interested in girls that gave me any sort of attention . Along with that I was bad at catching onto hints that they weren’t interested and would pester them as a result. I’ve grown past that, but that tendency evolved into an anxiety about girls thinking I was weird or annoying which caused me to overthink and over analyze everything that’s said, every messages that’s sent, being left on read, and response time. Those tendencies too have improved by telling myself to not read into things and trying to build more confidence in general. But they’re still around and I’m still trying to get better at managing them.

Anyway all that backgrounds brings me to a girl I met last semester. We met at an event for a club we’re both in. We talked for about an hour(mostly about our major which were both pursuing) and did end up leaving the event together before parting ways. We ended up chatting sporadically over social media the next month but I got a sense it kinda fizzled out a bit though she was still fairly chatty when we saw each other in person a couple times.

I don’t hear from her over the winter recess but when I returned to campus we ended being in the same lecture. First day of class she saw me and actually sat with me and we got a chance to just talk about what we’ve been. She sat with me again and I’ve at least gotten a sense that whatever this relationship is can resume.

That’s basically the gist of our relationship so far. 

Now a few friends I’ve mentioned her to asked if I was interested in dating her, and it got me thinking. The thing is: I don’t know.  I think she’s attractive and I guess admire her academic and professional drive and I can’t say I’m opposed to it. But on the other hand I’m conflicted as to whether my judgement is being clouded by a resurgence of all of my past behaviors when it comes to people I’m interested in. Along with that, I know that there’d be catharsis if I just asked her out, but conversely I’m afraid that if she says no then this sorta friendship relationship we have right now will be over. And there’s just doubt as to whether I’m able to handle a relationship and if I’m trying to jump into something too early. So my question I guess is:should I bite the bullet and ask her out or hold off and figure myself out some more?

I imagine there are lots of other posts with similar questions posted by similarly socially awkward Redditors.

Last summer, hooked up with girl I had known for a little. Made plans the week after, but she ghosted. Went to work shit out with ex. Four months later, get a big apology text from her (now single). I call her out on her shit. Month goes by, still like her, so I reach out. We meet a few days later, discuss what happened, tell her whatever excuse she gives isn't good enough and that actions &gt; words.

The last 7 weeks or so, we've been hanging out, going on dates, hang with her friends a couple times. All fun times, ending in sex and sleepovers at either of our homes. Started to feel more ""coupley"" at the end of Dec/beg of Jan. I would never blow up her phone and mainly texted to make plans and her response times were either quick or not like 3-4 hr waits, but I was the initiator for most of the hang outs. That annoyed me and wish I stopped cause she was the one that fucked up and wasn't putting enough effort in. 

On the 8th/9th, chill both nights and had fun. In the am, kiss each other goodbye to work. Hang out on the 14th, fun, but felt off to me. She sleepovers, but night ended awkardly. Brunch with her and her friend in the am, tells me we need to go see this movie next week but I tell her to pick the date and time.

So we go this last Tuesday, feels off/distant again. Get a text last Thursday, saying she was sorry if she wasn't talking much, but was overly exhausted and woke up sick Wed, and went to doctor's Thu. Wanted to let me know in case I got sick. Ask her if she needs anything then exchange a couple more texts. Don't hear from her all weekend (shocker). Like an idiot, I text this past Mon night, get a weak ass response late Tue morning and I don't respond.

So I'm 99.9% sure she was out with another dude on Sunday (and prob other times for all I know). I know we're not exclusive. I've also been trying to make plans with other girls because of my confusion/uncertainty with her so I can't be a hypocrite, but besides the not initiating as much part, feel like most of her actions showed she is interested. Always agreed to plans (or worked around her previous plans) and never once flaked. Conversations were great, funny. I was just waiting for her to bring up the exclusivity part, but I should've just stated what I wanted from the beginning and asked her what she wanted by coming back after ghosting.

I went to the doc to run some tests, to see if I have it. I’d feel badly if I it was me who gave it to her. But if I’m positive it’s also possible she’s the one who gave it to me. 

Anyway, I still like her. She said she was kinda down this past week but we have been going back and forth trying to schedule a time to see each other. 

We had plans for tonight but she needed to cancel because she had to work late and was burnt out. Otherwise she texts me as though she’s still interested. Offering up different days, etc. 

I don’t know. Can’t tell if this altered things for her for the worse. Thoughts ?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1154955,public,self,Herpes 2,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sdmp9w/herpes_2/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,

Honestly  dating feels hopeless at this point. Some info about me for reference.  I'm 27M, doing a masters in engineering at an awesome uni. I'm  respectful and polite to everyone I meet (thanks to my parents). I have a  great relationship with my family (mom, dad, sister, cousins, aunts).

My  hobbies include cars (racing, track, autocross, mods), snowboarding,  fashion, working out. I have a job, plenty of friends (male and female),  a very nice social life, a cool car, my own place (w/ roommates). I  don't consider myself unattractive at all, my self steam is honestly  high. I like the way I look and I dress nice ( I don't mean to sound  arrogant at all, it's just how I see myself) and yet I've never had a  gf.

I have been rejected my whole  life. Every single time I meet a girl that I like and connect with, I  get rejected. These are girls I meet at school, work, parties, etc. And  they are definitely not 10/10s just regular looking girls.

Nobody  ever looks my way and tbh women seem to hate when I approach them, some  are outright mean to me. Like they seem offended that I had the  audacity to say hi or approach them. And It's not just one or two. It's  literally every single woman I have every shown interest in.

All  the advice that it's commonly given to guys I already follow, so I have  no idea what I'm doing wrong or how to improve myself. I tried OLD and  got a decent amount of matches, gone on dates and I've even had sex. But  it never turns into a relationship. I always get ghosted.

At  this point I believe that It's because of my height (5'7). It's the  reason OLD worked. Because women can't tell how tall I am, they just see  my face and body shape. It's not a regular thing but plenty of women  have messaged me first and asked to hang out. I really hate to think  this way but I don't see any other reason.

Am  I really doomed to be alone forever because I'm not tall? It sounds  ridiculous to say. I'm sacred to become a bitter person because of it or  develop a hatred for women. I'm happy with almost every single aspect  of my life and I'm surrounded by awesome family and friends, but my  dating life is complete shit/non-existent. It's so embarrassing to be  only single person in my circle or to be asked why I don's have a gf.

Considering how decently I got to know these ladies and they all made mention of these things while or before we dated, it doesn’t sound like a last minute excuse. But in 4 months I’ve run into this issue 5 times now. 

Few more things to point out, all these girls I met via online dating. I’ve also met my ex wife via online dating and never met a girl unless it was via online dating. Since I’ve moved to a new city 4 months ago, meeting someone via my friends network is out. I’ve also been going to meetup groups and groups who do hobbies I like, no luck so far. Not for lack of trying other options but I’d like to maybe meet a girl without having to use online dating. 

I know socially I’m very good as friends and family tell me so, and I do manage to at least get these ladies to agree to a date. Is there something I’m missing, or is it simply I’m an unlucky guy?

Note - I am overweight right now, but 40kg down and still going strong. I know being overweight will get me rejected by some girls but it shouldn’t by all. Most of the girls I’ve met or dated have been of a similar or a bit smaller size than me. But I thought this is a fact you should consider as well.

Then when I reached out on Mon, he said he’s really overwhelmed with both work and our relationship issues and he didn’t have time to think about what he wants to do or how we should proceed. We then agreed to regroup on Fri. I’ve texted a couple of times since then and told him that his 180 shift from Sat to Sun was very confusing to me at that several days feels too long to go without an explanation. He replied that I wasn’t respecting his need for space. Is he in the wrong, and do you think this is a precursor to an almost definite breakup? I feel totally heartbroken and anxious and I haven’t been able to be productive at work. It seems like he doesn’t care about my feelings anymore.
