The relationship was emotionally abusive for a very long time and turned physically abusive. 2 weeks post-BU (9/26/21) i decided to download tinder to try to get my mind off things and honestly, bc i was looking for attention. I matched with this extremely sweet man the first day I was on the app. Fast forward 2.5 months later, things with the new man are progressing and it is evident that both of us could be in a relationship with one another very soon. We talk about only having eyes for one another, he knows my past, he knows I‚Äôm still working through some trauma from my last relationship, and we hang out multiple times a week. My question is- how do you differentiate a rebound relationship from something that feels right? With my ex, i rushed into the relationship because outwardly, he checked all the boxes. With this new guy, I‚Äôm in no rush, but what draws me in is how SAFE he feels. I‚Äôm attracted to him for so many reasons but I truly don‚Äôt think lust is one of them.

Then as I got older I started to become more attractive and as a result I got a lot more attention, sleeping with 3 different  women a week sorta thing. Anyway, when ever a girl treats me like garbage, ghosts me, or stands me up I get this internal anger and have to seek revenge, so I‚Äôll arrange to meet another girl I‚Äôd been talking to and stand her up just for the satisfaction. I‚Äôll ghost women for fun after telling them how much I like them. When my ex broke up with me I organised to meet two girls in the same bar on the same night just to make them feel shit. 

Recently a girl id known for a while told me she loved me and I was all she wanted, cool I felt the same then she began saying she wasn‚Äôt sure anymore because of her job being too stressful. Again my anger got the better of me and I started dating another girl and convinced her that I wanted to be with her and she started to fall for me, so I immediately ghosted her and made her feel like shit.

I work at a pizza place part time since I'm in college, and I met one of my friends there who is a few years older than me. Recently her boyfriend of a couple years broke up with her. She was devastated. Several days later, a young guy was hired who had worked at the pizza place off and on over the years. My friend and boss wanted to set me up with him, and I immediately was attracted to him. He was really sweet to me at this work party I went to. However, it turns out that my friend instantly started catching up with him and within days, they were spending all their time together and now I guess they're exclusive. The whole thing seems rushed and kind of absurd, or maybe I'm just jealous. Now they're all touchy feely at work and he seems more awkward around me. I thought it was kind of rude that she would just start seeing him before I even got a chance since it was her idea to set me up. However, they had already been friends.

Especially because after this happens it's not like they come back and setup a new date, so I call bullshit.

Despite this... now I'm doing the same to someone else. I'll explain why.

Basically we were just talking and stuff, and she says she's free on day X and if I wanted to roam around the city with her.

I say yes and that I could take a day off for that.

She mentions strictly ""friends only"" and that she's not interested in a relationship. I was taken aback, like, why are you on tinder on the first place lol.

Maybe it's a culture clash or something, but for me if the boundary is so explicit, it's a real thing and not open to negotiations.

Initially I said ok, but thinking about this a bit more, I really didn't feel like using up a vacation day for this would be a smart move. Also if I liked her this would have been even worse for me, I don't need a friendzoner thanks.

So eventually I told her that and I basically cancelled the date.

He said no one ever did him a portrait and that he didn't know what to say except for ""thank you"" and asked me why I did that.
I was caught off guard and told him  it was for art class, a black and white portrait.
He said he could see now why i did that and asked me if  he could keep it. I said of course and he was all happy.
He kept repeating ""a portrait. For me... no one ever did that before. Wow. Thank you""
It was so awkward because I started to blush and he blushed too while holding the drawing. It was soooo awkward. But he was smiling and became some more self confident and started joking and asked why it was urgent.
I said because he was going away for work (he got a new job in the field he wanted) and he said ""so I deserved it? Cool. Like an award for my achievement""
He didn't even understand my liking for him but ok. I'm still satisfied about the twinkle in his eyes. He was so innocent and special...

I'm female, 23, very well educated and my friends, family and peers are all surprised why I've been single for 4 years. I have a range of artistic hobbies, I enjoy the outdoors and love animals. I am also an athlete, competing in MMA/wrestling at a national/international level. So I'm very physically fit.

I've met people organically, on apps, through friends and have even dated a couple of my friends but it all ends the same way. 

I've very different people too, I don't have a particular ""type"" so I'm not noticing a pattern in their interests or appearances. They are however all really lovely people, but they just don't want to pursue anything with me seriously.

They all give a similar reasoning of ""I just don't want a relationship"", ""something doesn't quite feel right"" etc. Classic ""it's not you it's me"".

My fear is - why am I attracting emotionally unavailable people? I normally date a little older, and the issue is much the same, nobody is ready for a serious relationship.

However, there might be one thing that is potentially putting men off. Guys I've dated have commented about wanting to get into the gym and have even joined gyms whilst dating me as ""look how much bigger your muscles are than mine"" but they've also always been very complimentary about how beautiful/fit I am. I thought maybe they just wanted to gym with me? But perhaps it's a turn off all together?

I recent found out he had been sending a lot of money (over $1000) to a ""Local Lash Bar"". When I asked him about it, he said he was paying off drug debts that I didn't know about.

The other night, he fell asleep with his phone unlocked.. I went through it (yes I know.. It's not my proudest moment). He deletes ALL of his messages..

I met her at a party after we made eye contact across the room a few times and she introduced herself to me when I walked past her. A day later, I slid into her dms and asked for her snap and she gave it to me. However, after I got her snap, I found out from a mutual friend that she had a boyfriend so I texted her infrequently just to get to know her better and talked to her at parties, but did not flirt with her. After a month of knowing her, I found out that she broke up with her boyfriend so I began to text her more frequently and flirted with her a little bit. For example, I asked her what she was gonna be for Halloween and she told me and I said that it was a boring costume for someone so interesting and she saved it in Snapchat. I was at a Halloween party with her and I flirted with her and put my arm around her and she flirted back with me because she put her hand on my chest for a few seconds, was comfortable with my contact, and shared a drink with me. Many Redditors agreed that she was flirting with me. 

I decided to ask her to dinner as friends because she just got out of a relationship and didn‚Äôt want to rush anything and make her feel uncomfortable. She said she‚Äôd get dinner with me, but added that she‚Äôs not looking for a relationship right now. I said that I understood and we‚Äôd get dinner as friends and she agreed, but the day before the dinner, she texted me and said that getting dinner together was a bad idea because we have different expectations and that we don‚Äôt get along that well. After she rejected me, I cut contact with her for two weeks except saying hi in passing. 

Then at my friend‚Äôs birthday party, I talked to her and had a casual conversation with her for 5 minutes and planned not to talk to her for the rest of the night. However, when I walked out of a room, she was standing nearby and walked up to me and started playing with my hat for not reason and I asked her why she was doing it and she said why wouldn‚Äôt I be playing with your hat. During this conversation, her face was really close to mine and we were making deep eye contact. My drunk ass really wanted to kiss her, but I decided to go for a hug and we hugged for a good 10 seconds.

Then, a few days ago she came over o my apartment to hangout with me and my roommate and she showed me a video and put her hand that was holding her phone on my hand. And a day after that, we were at a party together and she came up and talked to me and she fell forward a bit and I had to catch her and I kept my hands around her waist and back and she didn‚Äôt pull away.

Was she just using me for attention or just looking for a hookup and got scared off by my feelings? Is she attracted to me or is she only flirty because she‚Äôs drunk? Why did she say that we don‚Äôt get along that well, but flirted with me and initiated touch and conversation? How do I get over her? Sorry for ranting, but I just wanted to get it off my chest.

Nonetheless I‚Äôm ecstatic that he‚Äôs asked to meet up but I feel as though it‚Äôs only because I posted these photos, which puts a dampener on my excitement.

Is this a warranted feeling? Do I pursue this?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rab81t/is_it_sleazy_for_a_guy_to_ask_to_ask_you_out_on_a/
34,rabd1z,1638808497,How can I date if I‚Äôm not in a good place financially or career wise? 21F,"So I‚Äôm a very socially anxious person to begin with, and I think I ruled out dating because I‚Äôve no idea how to even do it. I also don‚Äôt get attention from anyone. I identify as bi but I‚Äôm in the closet to my parents and old friends. Other than that, when I meet new people, they know I‚Äôm bi. My closest friend group knows too and so do my brother.

I think I‚Äôm tired of being so closed off when it comes dating. I remove myself from such conversations because it‚Äôs just something I cannot relate to. I‚Äôm also at a point in life where I‚Äôm struggling to know what I want. I‚Äôm a college graduate but I work in retail. I‚Äôve since dropped out of a postgrad. So in terms of the future, I‚Äôm not very positive about that at all. This is important to dating, as I see it all the time. ‚ÄúI just need someone who has goals and is continuously working on themselves‚Äù, especially from women. I honestly don‚Äôt think that description fits me at all. I‚Äôm not not doing anything about it, but that description is far from who I am, sadly. I think my biggest motivation since to do well in school was the fear of my parents. I never felt like I wanted it for myself.

That being said, I don‚Äôt want that to be me forever. I do want to change my life but I‚Äôm going to need time. I feel as though whatever I do next, is only to appear like I have some plan.

As I‚Äôm getting older, I‚Äôm starting to crave affection and love. And even with all my insecurities, I think I deserve love. My question is, am I in a good state to date anyone? I think social media makes it seem like you need to be a successful person to find love.

36,rabwlh,1638809906,33M: Do you think you can only fall madly for someone once in your life?,"Almost 2 years ago I met a girl who, as it turns out, had NPD. Before things fell apart she love bombed me, not just in the typical highly affectionate and loved up way, but she seemed to know just how to simulate the girl of my dreams in everything from body language to sexuality to (pretending to) have the same hobbies and interests as me. She had supermodel looks and yet would send me the nerdiest YouTube videos you can imagine and play along with all of my random conversational tangents. I fell madly in love until it turned on most of the aforementioned was just manufactured.

Over time as I began to realise I didn't really know who she was and felt no emotional depth to her. it was almost disputing, like she was an android. She would stare at me with cold eyes and give me increasingly backhanded compliments. I became concerned by it and started to pull away. She flipped and became cold and angry. We broke up, twice, the second time being for good. We haven't spoken since.

In the near 2 years since then I have been basically unable to feel anything for any girl I have met. I have tried meeting different kinds of people in different kinds of settings, I've tried periods of lots of casual sex, periods of only looking for something serious and periods of no dating at all. **I've tried therapy also.**

I am happy and enjoying life but at 33 I really want to settle down with someone I feel passionate about and start a family but I just can't seem to feel anything. I think back to how I fell madly for that girl and feel as though I can never experience that again, like a lightbulb in my head has blown and now can't be lit again. I feel jaded and unexcited by dating.

I know that the most common answer to the question in the title would be ""of course you can"" but maybe once you have felt you found the person of your dreams and then realised you didn't and it all fell apart, your brain basically rewires itself not to feel that way about anyone so as to protect you from that disappointment?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rabwlh/33m_do_you_think_you_can_only_fall_madly_for/
37,rabzub,1638810121,Is this just bad luck?,"For the past 6 years I‚Äôve had small relationships with a handful of women. Basically all of them have been interested in me but due to circumstances they‚Äôve all been unable to commit to anything. I‚Äôve obviously gone through it in my head countless times on what I need to do differently, assuming some of these might just be excuses and it‚Äôs me that‚Äôs doing something wrong. I‚Äôve struggled a lot during this time thinking I‚Äôll never find anyone. Until I met this other girl, and she checked off every box for me, as near perfect as you could get. We saw each other for a few months and I had never had a start of a relationship go this well. She did warn me early on that she also had commitment issues but not worry as she was fully prepared to see this through and open to a relationship, it would just take time. So I nearly shit myself at the sound of this but she was very convincing that she thought I was worth it. A week or so ago she even told me she wanted to talk to me in a positive way about moving things forward in a more serious way. Then all of a sudden a few days later after a great day spent with her, she panics and ends it because she still can‚Äôt commit to anything yet and it‚Äôs unfair to keep me guessing. I was happy thinking I finally broke the curse, and she was awesome and I feel like we matched up so well‚Ä¶.but nope same story somehow. This was a long emotional talk between us and she emphasized excessively that it‚Äôs not me that was the problem and it was her own issues. I‚Äôm in sort of shock and denial that the same exact thing happened to me again and this time with a person who set the bar so high for me. Guess I just wanna know if anyone else has run into this and if it actually is just bad luck? Or is it me? No clue what‚Äôs going on.

43,racesj,1638811165,Had a really Genuine Connection!,"I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôd call this a dating story but it‚Äôs very similar,  so remove it if need be. 

This weekend I was working an event away from home and at this meeting I met this girl. Hadn‚Äôt seen her at the previous events so didn‚Äôt think anything of her. Well we briefly introduced each other and shared some of our work. 

Since she didn‚Äôt know anything about the event I offered to walk her around and show her who‚Äôs who and what‚Äôs what. Conversation was flowing great and there was banter back and forth and she was really excited to be there and I was happy to introduce her to this world that I work in. 

Well that initial meeting turned into the entire day of laughs and hanging out working together and walking around. We were practically glued at the hip. We shared fries, and walked through the woods, and talked about everything under the sun, and she occasionally made physical contact. So the first day ends and we part ways and I offer to take her out for food is she‚Äôs free. Unfortunately she got stuck in traffic and got back late so nothing happened. 

The next day I decided to let her do her own and I‚Äôll do my own thing. Well I see her again and go over to say a quick hello and it turns into another full day of hanging out and working. The conversation was just so easy and flowed well and everything was good. 

The end of the day came and I offered to hang out a bit longer until she left and then walked her to her car. We live in separates states and quiet far apart and she also ended her relationship just last week and I was perfectly fine not making a move cause I didn‚Äôt want to force anything for a short weekend trip. But we hugged and took a selfie together and agreed to hopefully see each other next year. 

I‚Äôm really happy by this experience as it‚Äôs a confidence booster in that I know how to confidently talk to women and I could do so for upwards of 10 hours. In some essence I‚Äôd like to call it a first date(s) but again I wasn‚Äôt going to force anything or there looking for a date that so I‚Äôm perfectly fine gaining a new friend.

44,raclqp,1638811639,Is it worth texting someone who ghosted you for closure?,"Before you immediately say no hear me out. 

Like many others on here I was ghosted seemingly out of nowhere when I thought things were going well. We had hung out twice (once at my place and once at hers) and had made out but not gone beyond that yet. I know you‚Äôre thinking ‚Äúthis sounds like a hookup situation‚Äù since we hadn‚Äôt really gone on proper ‚Äúdates‚Äù but I wasn‚Äôt getting that vibe from her. We had plans to hang out again the following week (she even said ‚Äúsee you next week‚Äù as I left her place). We then made plans to get dinner one day during the week before this next planned date and this is where it goes downhill. She cancelled the day of the dinner date with a seemingly legitimate excuse so I wasn‚Äôt too concerned but the seed of doubt had been planted in my head. A couple days go by with no talking (strike two) and I reach out to her to discuss the date we had originally planned the last time we hung out, which at this point was now two days away. She responded a bit and more or less confirmed we were still on but when I brought up specifics she didn‚Äôt respond. And that‚Äôs the last time I heard from her. I texted her the day of asking if we were good but I already knew the answer at that point. 

So I‚Äôm left here wondering what the hell happened like so many of us are in this situation. I have to assume she found someone else (we met on tinder) because I don‚Äôt think we spoke enough between the dates for me to say something to put her off. Anyway I‚Äôm tempted to reach out this week and just ask what happened even though I know I shouldn‚Äôt. But in my mind worst case scenario is she continues to not respond and best case scenario she tells me how she is feeling so I understand why she decided to end it. I know she doesn‚Äôt owe me anything since we only talked for a few weeks but it would be nice to know her side so I can stop thinking about it.

45,racm2b,1638811663,Is she attracted to me? Do I have a chance in the future or should I move on?,"I (21M) had a crush on this girl (21F) for about 2 months. I met her at a party after we made eye contact across the room a few times and she introduced herself to me when I walked past her. A day later, I slid into her dms and asked for her snap and she gave it to me. However, after I got her snap, I found out from a mutual friend that she had a boyfriend so I texted her infrequently just to get to know her better and talked to her at parties, but did not flirt with her. After a month of knowing her, I found out that she broke up with her boyfriend so I began to text her more frequently and flirted with her a little bit. For example, I asked her what she was gonna be for Halloween and she told me and I said that it was a boring costume for someone so interesting and she saved it in Snapchat. I was at a Halloween party with her and I flirted with her and put my arm around her and she flirted back with me because she put her hand on my chest for a few seconds, was comfortable with my contact, and shared a drink with me. Many Redditors agreed that she was flirting with me. 

I decided to ask her to dinner as friends because she just got out of a relationship and didn‚Äôt want to rush anything and make her feel uncomfortable. She said she‚Äôd get dinner with me, but added that she‚Äôs not looking for a relationship right now. I said that I understood and we‚Äôd get dinner as friends and she agreed, but the day before the dinner, she texted me and said that getting dinner together was a bad idea because we have different expectations and that we don‚Äôt get along that well. After she rejected me, I cut contact with her for two weeks except saying hi in passing. 

Then at my friend‚Äôs birthday party, I talked to her and had a casual conversation with her for 5 minutes and planned not to talk to her for the rest of the night. However, when I walked out of a room, she was standing nearby and walked up to me and started playing with my hat for not reason and I asked her why she was doing it and she said why wouldn‚Äôt I be playing with your hat. During this conversation, her face was really close to mine and we were making deep eye contact. My drunk ass really wanted to kiss her, but I decided to go for a hug and we hugged for a good 10 seconds.

Then, a few days ago she came over o my apartment to hangout with me and my roommate and she showed me a video and put her hand that was holding her phone on my hand. And a day after that, we were at a party together and she came up and talked to me and she fell forward a bit and I had to catch her and I kept my hands around her waist and back and she didn‚Äôt pull away.

Was she just using me for attention or just looking for a hookup and got scared off by my feelings? Is she attracted to me or is she only flirty because she‚Äôs drunk? Why did she say that we don‚Äôt get along that well, but flirted with me and initiated touch and conversation? How do I get over her? Sorry for ranting, but I just wanted to get it off my chest.

One girl there (my cousin's friend) I had met before once, but didn't really know that well. I was definitely the most outgoing and best conversationalist there, so naturally I talk to this girl over the course of the weekend. I ask her questions about herself, and we're getting along pretty well. I didn't even consider her to be a romantic interest, although I do think she is very attractive. Over the weekend our conversation is pretty flirty at times. She was doing things like pretending to hit me with objects, and would give the occasional touch on the arm. When we were drunk she asked if I would go hiking with her at some place where she lives. At one point she walked up to me and asked me what my zodiac sign is, and my cousin who was standing behind me gave me a big smile, like she was hinting that this girl was into me. When I told her she said that I had the same zodiac sign as all her boyfriends. When we were leaving, she gave me a hug goodbye.

So while I'm not sure she was interested in me, I do think she was clearly flirting with me. Which brings me to my next question. I have 0 issues getting very hot girls to show interest and flirt with me, yet I'm not that experienced. I've only slept with one person. To my defense, I don't really ask out a lot of women.

The first time I hung out at his house was about 2 week ago. He cooked me dinner (he's a brilliant chef), we cuddled and watched movies and yeah, sex happened.

The second time we hung out at his house was this past weekend. I went over on the Friday evening and we were together until Saturday afternoon. Oddly this time, we did not have sex.

I initially didn't particularly mind that we didn't have sex. I thought we were having a good time overall; we visited the spa in his apartment building, made food back at his place, watched movies, cuddled, I having fun. I was genuinely enjoying his company.

At the end of the last movie we watched on the Friday night, he said to me he was really tired. It was around 11pm. I asked him why he was so tired; ""what did you do today?"" I ask him, and he goes ""Not you."" We laughed and went to sleep.

So literally, I went home the next day, and we didn't have any sex, we cuddled a lot, but no sex. And my mind is making me question when he said "" Not you"" was he lowkey insinuating he had sex with someone else perhaps earlier?

""I'm sorry I realized it so late but I see you more as a friend than partner. You're a really great guy and you've been so wonderful during this time and I'm certain you'll meet someone great""

67,raehqa,1638816401,How should I just accept love and stop having anxiety?,"So I (23F) am dating a Man (23M) currently, we still haven't agreed to a relationship yet. I feel like the way I went about things when we first started was clingy. I started telling him how much I liked him and we started going places together. In November, he decided that he wanted to stop talking to other women, him talking to other woman made me feel insecure and made me had anxiety. Last month he decided to solely be involved with only me. 

But This month however I feel like I'm slowly losing his attention because sometimes he says that I am too affectionate and sentimental. I feel like it's my anxiety that makes me have a clouded mind, because honestly I do feel like in every relationship I would possibly be replaced. I will take accountability and say that yes i was really affectionate and sentimental, because I feel like I wanted to be the only one that had his attention. I really wanted to be the one that he could have fun with and enjoy life with. So I would sit and tell him how I felt so that he could be aware that I wanted more. He makes it aware that he wants more too with me too because when I ask him if he wants to leave, he doesn't want to and voices that he wants me to just relax.

he makes jokes about how he doesn't know if he could be around me for so long when I buy my apartment. I don't know how I could fix things, I really things to be better. I feel like he wants me to stop taking everything so seriously and just enjoy life instead of keep worrying when the relationship will start and just have fun now that I'm the only woman he is currently dating but I really do not know where to start.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/raehqa/how_should_i_just_accept_love_and_stop_having/

69,raelsd,1638816694,What Does This Sorta-Rejection Mean?,"So, I reconnected with a girl I knew back in high school of my senior year. We talked a little bit and were sorta friends, but it was nothing beyond that. We're around 24 now, and I reached out to her through instagram just out of curiosity.

To my surprise, we actually had an enjoyable conversation, and she even seemed invested in maintaining the conversation. For example, she would say her phone was low on battery and would text me as soon as she recharged it, and she followed through on that. If something caused her to take a long time, she would apologize for it. I, personally, don't even do those kind of things because I don't usually engage in these kind of lengthy text conversations.

More importantly, she even texted me first the next day. So, I thought I might be interested in her and if things continued to go well, I would ask her on a first date. In most cases, I jump out of the texting stage ASAP, but I felt it was appropriate in this case since we hadn't talked in ages, and she seemed invested anyway.

What ended up happening is that Freud must have possessed our conversation, and I somehow accidentally ended up asking her out. I made a certain joke, and she took it as me asking her out. Basically, I said I wasn't in that context, but if she was interested then why not? I thought it was more important to roll with it then to simply say no because that might close the deal on that forever.

Basically, she said ""**I don't know, we really don't know much about each other anymore**.""

Basically, I ended up retreating back in a playful way, and the conversation ended on (I think) a positive note. 

I haven't texted her today, and I don't plan to just to kind of roll back some of the steam. My question is: **Do you think that this is something that's dead in the water, or is she genuinely just unsure?**

70,raenaz,1638816807,Tried polyamory/non-monogamy and it absolutely failed despite me believing in it 100%. Absolutely heartbroken.,"

Hi, this is mostly about a rant about me and my journey to polyamory. For context I‚Äôm 20f and I just got out of a polyamorous triad relationship. This was also my first ever real relationship. I‚Äôm extremely heartbroken and want to rant. Any advice or tips is appreciated. 



I had two partners ‚ÄúF‚Äù 27f and ‚ÄúD‚Äù 27m. Me and D and F met online and originally were friends with benefits. I had my first ever real sexual experience with them and our feelings grew, soon we were all really close and began dating. Previously F and D had been together for 4 years, lived together, had 2 cats and planned on getting married one day. I joined their relationship as a third, we were in a throuple for 1 year and lived together for 4 months, F and D had lived together for a majority of their relationship and I moved in with them while leaving behind an abusive living situation. They assured me that they would help me and that they wanted nothing more than me moving in with them. They promised me that we will always work out our problems, that it wouldn‚Äôt be easy but that they wanted nothing else but to be with me. I always thought our relationship was absolutely perfect and that we were extremely happy, I had never felt so safe and loved in my life, despite it being a difficult choice to move out while being 20 and not yet financially independent I decided to take the risk because of that. Since I moved in we have traveled, gone camping, have spent all of our free time together laughing and in love, have gone on many dates and worked on our individual relationships as well as our relationship as a whole. We always worked on our relationship and tried to make sure everyone was happy and was getting plenty of time with one another. I was hopeful and saw myself being with them for many years. 





The problems began when me and D became more close. Before I moved in, me and F had been really close and in love and had so much fun hanging out, going on dates and spending our free time together, we were also the most intimate we had ever been. Me and D where also very close but didn‚Äôt get to spend as much time together as me and F. When I moved in, F began to work more in person which meant she was gone from the morning until night, me and D both worked from home so we got to spend more time together. F couldn‚Äôt handle it, she was not only getting less alone time with D but now I was living with them and getting to spend all my time with D while not seeing F as much. This began to cause some problems between me and F‚Äôs relationship. On top of that, since F became more busy with work we stopped having as much time to be intimate, while me and D had the most time to be intimate.  Insecurities grew more and F became uncomfortable with having to share D with me during intimate time, she also began to feel more emotionally and physically distant from D.






F decided yesterday to pack all of her things and leave, saying that she couldn‚Äôt deal with our dynamic anymore. She said she really needed to work on her mental health, go to therapy, get new meds. She has been feeling extremely depressed since I moved in and she hasn‚Äôt been able to adjust to our dynamic change from not living together to being nesting partners. I know she still loves our partner D very much, and he also loves her since they have so much history (4 years together, plans of marriage). She still wants to be with him and not ‚Äúshare‚Äù him with me. I decided  that while she works on herself and her mental health, I can work on preparing to move out so that she can come back and be with D while I leave the relationship. For context, I have never lived on my own before.  I‚Äôm 20, a college student and had previously lived with my abusive parents before moving in with my partners. 








I‚Äôm extremely heartbroken. I‚Äôm sad me, F and D will never have our beautiful throuple dynamic ever again. I still believe our relationship was a peak in my life and I‚Äôm sad to let that go, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever get to experience the beautiful harmony of being loved by a man and a woman at the same time again. I‚Äôm sad that I will have to leave D so that F can come back to be with him, I love him so much and he was my first true love. Im sad that D would be willing to sadly let me go so that he can be with F and continue with their plans to be together forever. I‚Äôm scared to be out on the world on my own for the first time. I‚Äôm scared that I‚Äôm not worthy of love, or one person loving me in a monogamous relationship. I hope that I can one day find someone and grow to love them the way F and D did, they saw each other as a ‚Äúforever‚Äù I want to find my forever too.  I don‚Äôt think I ever want to be polyamorous again or participate emotionally in a pre-exciting relationship with two people who love each other more than they‚Äôll ever love me. I have a lot of feelings and don‚Äôt know how to process it all. Taking it one day at a time. I hope things can get better but I feel very hopeless at the moment . 










Summary: Im 20f and for the last year and a half I had a polyamorous relationship with a couple that had been together for 4 years. Everything was perfect until I moved in with them. Now I‚Äôm loosing them both and don‚Äôt know what to do.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/raenaz/tried_polyamorynonmonogamy_and_it_absolutely/

Speaking from experience, It shocked me when a very pretty girl liked me &amp; I blew it twice taking to long to ask her out because I wanted to be more interesting.

For some guys, self-esteem has been damaged from fake ask outs, parents talking bad about your hobbies, hearing people whisper call you ugly, and getting called the ugliest person in school/college.

So when a very pretty girl likes us back, we're already scared. Some guys like me take too long ask pretty girls that likes us back because we want to appear interesting to them. Some are scared of being the ugly boyfriend, some are considered lying when they show a pretty girl that likes them back, and some even consider the girl is in it for something.

77,raf8jm,1638818328,How to spot a player,"I had an interesting date last night that left me all confused. As soon as I met the guy in person, my first thought was 'he is out of my league' and the next one was 'he is a player'. He is very good looking(women at the restaurant were staring ), dress well, well spoken, good career etc etc. We both got out of a marriage, I have kids but he doesn't. The date went well, but the entire time I had thoughts in my mind, is he a player and why is he so interested in me? I was almost certain he is in for hookups. After he dropped me off at my place, we started making out. I was lil uncomfortable making out outside thinking neighbors are watching, so asked him to come inside for a short while(it was also to see what he does). He seemed hesitant but then said 'maybe for a lil while'. We kept making out inside, and he told me he doesn't wana sleep with me tonight cause he likes me. At one point he took off his shirt, which I found weird. But he has eight packs or whatever and I think he wanted to show me how fit he was. Then he asked we are not sleeping but if he can go down on me, I wasn't comfortable going through that without getting tested and such. So we kept on kissing and then he said you need to sleep and left. Honestly I wasn't expecting to hear from him anymore cause I was pretty certain he wanted to hook up. But he texted me few times after getting home last night and then again this morning. Here are my confusion, I have been told I am attractive, decent career but he is way more attractive and childless, so not sure if he is genuinely interested. He didn't ask much about my kids other than how old was the older one and the schedule, nothing about whether they are boy/girl, how old is the younger one etc which I found bit weird. I am really not sure whether he was actually trying to hookup or not, and I am confused how to proceed with him.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/raf8jm/how_to_spot_a_player/

79,rafenk,1638818772,25M with no relationship experience. Feeling bad about prospects after trying online dating,"Like the title says, I've never been in a relationship of any duration or seriousness before. It didn't use to be something I would worry about too much, I just figured it would happen organically when the time was right, like a lot of people. But as I got into my mid-20s and the pandemic hit, I realized that I truly was unhappy being alone and that I probably wasn't going to meet anyone any time soon unless I put myself out there. So, about 7 months ago, I started using dating apps (Tinder, Bumble) pretty earnestly and regularly.

Overall, not an encouraging experience. I'm okay with the number of matches I get, but over 99% are no-replies, one-sided conversations that fizzle out, and random ghosting in the middle of conversations that seemed to be going great. I've started to dread even messaging someone I'm immediately attracted to, because I probably know how it'll end already. The remaining &lt; 1% was one date (my first) that apparently went so poorly, she decided to leave suddenly and ghosted afterwards. It was disorienting for me because I didn't think it was bad at all, just a bit awkward, and I felt like we'd connected over a lot.

I think that would have been something to take in stride and not get hung up over if I were able to go out with more people. But that's 7 months of trying my best to meet people and only getting one date. Since most first dates usually don't work out, it'll take years and years before I find my first relationship at this rate. Is that flawed thinking? It doesn't sound like it can be right, but I also can't tell what's wrong with it.

Maybe I'm just doing something wrong on these apps? I try to be confident, but I usually don't project excessive boldness that I can't back up in real life. I don't act like a ""nice guy"". I mostly just do my best to show (the positive sides of) my authentic self and converse as if I were talking to a potential friend who I happen to think is cute, but it never leads to anything. It's like there's always this huge asymmetry of interest: whatever level of interest I might have in this person, she's only a tiny fraction as interested in me. It doesn't matter our compared physical attractiveness or any superficial stuff like that, that's just the rule. That's what it feels like, at least.

I hate complaining about this stuff. It feels lame to do so. But as someone with no prior relationship experience, trying to date has really hurt my self-esteem. It's made me feel like there's something fundamentally wrong with me and question whether I'm dateable at all or worthy to be in a relationship with someone. And I don't know how to dispel these ideas except objectively, by having more success with dating.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rafenk/25m_with_no_relationship_experience_feeling_bad/

87,ragmuv,1638821921,Talking to a girl at the gym,"So basically, I know that hitting on a girl at the gym is a big no-no. However, there is this one girl at the gym that I go to that I have caught staring at me whenever I see her there. I think I have a pretty good sense of reality and think that she is looking at me and I‚Äôm not just being hopeful. 

My question to the single girls on here is, if a guy were to approach you at the gym, how would you prefer he do it? I dont want to be that creep that makes her uncomfortable but also dont want to be thinking ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù. I‚Äôm a pretty shy guy but I‚Äôve been trying to work on just shooting my shot recently.

91,rags12,1638822292,We had sex on the 1st date: is it ghosting or should I give it more time?,"Last week I (f,23) met a guy (27). We were supposed to go out just for the drinks or dinner but it ended up being a longer type of the date. We went to the bar, then a walk, then we went to him and were talking like until 4 am and after we did have sex. I like him a lot as a guy, he‚Äôs been extremely respectful and gentleman in all ways. During our date and after sex he made sure I was comfortable with everything, that applies to experiences inside and outside of bed. I did feel like we had chemistry + alcohol + I was lacking some physical intercourse experience so I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs why it happened so fast. But I basically totally enjoyed both parts of the evening.

Then he invited me to meet during the weekend and we also firstly spent some time together hanging out (restaurants, walk, Xmas markets) and then we went to his place. Sexual experience was great again. But it‚Äôs definitely not just about sex, we talk a lot about everything and share many similar ideas, tell stories about our families and etc. He also does make some plans for us in a way that he‚Äôs suggesting that next time we should go there or there and etc. Last time he wanted to make plans but then told me let‚Äôs keep in touch and see how our schedule goes though. 

I don‚Äôt want to give it any label yet but I‚Äôm just wondering, where to go from there? He hasn‚Äôt messaged me since we last saw each other (Sunday morning) but yesterday (on Sunday evening) he somehow found my Facebook and added me.  


What is it? He‚Äôs thinking what to do with a situation, ghosting me or just trying not to be too desperate?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rags12/we_had_sex_on_the_1st_date_is_it_ghosting_or/
92,rah1t1,1638822993,Need advice for myself,"I think I‚Äôm really needing some advice or just a outlet to chit chat on, sometimes anonymously is just overall better. I‚Äôm in a really good happy relationship right now, it‚Äôs going great. We have dated about a year now and made it more official a few months ago. In the begging I think we made it official to quickly and didn‚Äôt have time to realize each others baggage/ learn about eachother. He‚Äôs left me a couple times/ slow faded (ghosted) me before, even when we were together or when we agreed to just talk, due to his own baggage and I guess being scared (we‚Äôve communicated about it more recently) I‚Äôve learned in this time that he‚Äôs responsible for his baggage and I‚Äôm responsible for mine. 
  Saying that to say this, I‚Äôm more worried about my baggage right now. I was in a abusive relationship for 3 years, cheated on and manipulated (so basically a sad excuse of a relationship). I‚Äôm really worried I‚Äôm going to sabotage this relationship, not intentionally. But there‚Äôs certain things that trigger me, and I get defensive with him and always end up regretting it. I feel like I have a lot of learning to do, and I don‚Äôt want him to leave me (I guess I have a deep fear he‚Äôs going to because of our history so far). We have a lot in common and jive really well, I see myself spending my future with him. 
  I‚Äôm also a hopeless romantic and wear my heart on my sleeve, so I guess there‚Äôs a underlying fear of heartbreak.  
   I‚Äôm trying to get out of my negative way of thinking, I‚Äôve came a long way; but I definitely have a lot of growing to do. I don‚Äôt want to keep repeating the same patterns, and I want to hold myself more accountable for my actions! 
   I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs a bad guy or a cheater at all but sometimes I let my mind race and overthink things that are weird or odd and let my mind wonder to the dark corners. It‚Äôs almost like I let the irrational thoughts over take the fact that thinks are great. Does anyone have advice how they got out of this way of thinking/ trauma response? I‚Äôm sure if he‚Äôs the right one for me he will understand and be patient as I have with him.

He (new boyfriend) starts doing heroin and overdosed , I find him just like our friend who died.

Of my anxiety stems from this traumatic event.

The words he told me, his wise advice, the way he just hugged me without saying a word when we got off of the bus after I started crying on the bus.
How he looks so happy if we talk about football or sports and his face when I thanked him for repairing my earrings and necklace (he's quite good at repairing things).
He looks so innocent and special and I feel like I found some special guy among mean people.

Okay...then please tell me what makes someone obligated to be responsible for their child besides I don't know, being their biological parent? lol

I don't understand how you would feel comfortable having a child out in the world who knows you don't give a eff about them cause you told their Mom you would never want them. Like that excuse really sits well with plenty of men.

I don't mind the way he looks and in no way do I think he is ugly. Strangely enough all my past relationships started this way where my initial reaction was that I didn't think they were physically suoer attractive but I grew to love the way they looked more and more. I will also never say this to him because it does no good to hurt his feelings, especially bc I like him. I'm not being an asshole right? I feel like we have a connection and good intimacy regardless. I just feel bad bc he goes on and on about how gorgeous I am.
