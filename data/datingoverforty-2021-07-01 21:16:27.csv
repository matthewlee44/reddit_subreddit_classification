2,oc1myt,1625195720,What would you bring?,"Hi all, 

I‚Äôve been on a few dates with a sweet man who lives a few hours away. We both love nature and the outdoors. The first date was a simple hike. Some brief hand holding. A pileated woodpecker swooped by us. 

On the second date, we had a picnic by the river. We found a nest of Great Horned owls and observed them for a time.We sat and talked and ate, getting to know each other better and watching folks out at the park for a Sunday stroll. He let his hand rest on my lower back. I asked if he‚Äôd like to lay his head in my lap, and I scratched his head and rubbed his neck and shoulders. We hugged goodbye. And I gave him a few plants for his garden. 

On the third date, we went sailing in a little Sunfish sailboat. We navigated the waters, found a little island filled with birds, glided along the Gulf of Mexico. We laid on the beach together afterwards, kissed a bit, snuggled, fed each other cherries and gazed at the clouds. 

Our fourth date is coming up. We are staying for two nights on a Sail bnb- a sailboat that has been converted into a floating Airbnb. It is very basic- it includes a bed, a dinette, a battery operated fan, and a cooler of ice. That‚Äôs it. We‚Äôll use a dinghy to ferry ourselves and whatever we bring onboard. There‚Äôs no bathroom or AC, although there is a truck stop nearby (LOL). We‚Äôre both ok with roughing it. 

My question to you, Dating over 40 tribe, is what would you bring on such an adventure? What sounds sweet, practical, comfortable, useful? I‚Äôve camped, but never on a boat!

5,oc2wb4,1625200720,Recently divorced and not trusting my gut,"(Also posted on DatingAdvice, thought this might be more appropriate)

After getting out of a 10 year marriage, I decided to sign up for tinder. I‚Äôve talked to a few guys here and there, but recently met a guy who seemed really cool and we had a lot in common. He asked me out to dinner after chatting for a couple days, and we met at a restaurant last night. 

From my perspective, we had a great time. Had a lot in common had a lot to talk about. He too has been through a divorce, and hasn‚Äôt dated much especially during the last year. After dinner, we went to a local carnival, went on the Ferris wheel and some other rides, and laughed a lot and had a lot to talk about. He had taken the train to meet me, so after the carnival I drove him to the train station where we sat and talked while we were waiting for the train. When the train came he hugged me and kissed me on the cheek, and told me that he had a great time and then he‚Äôd like to see me again. I told him that I also had a great time and that I like to see him again, and drove away feeling really happy and positive for the first time in a long time. 

Today I get this text message from him: 

‚ÄúMy enchiladas didn't like the tilt-a-whirl, but I on the other hand had a great time üòâ. You're a really fun person to be with. Please keep in touch. If there are any shows you're going to and you're looking for company, let me know. And if you'd like to come out to (his town), they're performing Shakespeare's The Tempest outdoors July 17 though August 21.‚Äù 

Maybe it‚Äôs low self-esteem, maybe it‚Äôs the emotional abuse that I‚Äôve dealt with for the last 10 years that makes me question how people view me, or maybe I am correct in my assessment that ‚Äúkeep in touch‚Äù doesn‚Äôt sound like he‚Äôs too into me or would rather just keep it as friends.

She is 45 years old and got divorced 4 years ago with 2 kids sharing custody with her ex. We had messaged back and forth for about a month. Then she invited me to visit her city. We had 3 hours driving distance. She suggested we could spend some time together this weekend to see if we click. I think it‚Äôs a good plan. So I reserved hotel room for 2 days and drove here yesterday. Yesterday when I was on the way, she told me that her feet got hurt at home. She sent me a picture that indicates it is real. I was a little concerned about it and asked her if we could cancel the meetup. She texted me it is okay. She doesn‚Äôt want to break her promise. Then I continued the driving and came here. As planned we were about to have a meetup last night for a dinner once I arrived. But she has feet issue and asked for canceling. I think it is reasonable to do that and agreed. Today we had a lunch meetup and hangout a little bit. Then I drove her home. Before she got home she said we will meet tonight for dinner. But just now she texted me again that her feet is not so good. She want to stay home and ask for another meetup tomorrow. 

  Sorry for the complicated text here. I hope to explain what has been happening and ask your suggestions. Before I came to her city, she suggested I book a room with 2 beds and mentioned to me she had never had casual sex. Weird? Then I said we don‚Äôt have to live together. She suggested I can live at her home when I come here. I told her it would be too brutal for me to live at her home for the first time meetup. She agreed. Basically the meetup plans kept changing.

I dated a guy in college for about six months. We were in love, but I think at that time I was too intense for him (fair). There was fault on both sides.

A few years after college, we reconnected and unexpectedly formed a strong friendship. I got married and he was the first one to hold my newborn son after my then husband and me. We texted/talked every few weeks and hung out every few months, even when he eventually got married too.

We‚Äôd been close friends about 12 years when we both separated from our spouses. During that period we slept together once. My friend was very traumatized by his ex-wife‚Äôs infidelity and thought it had happened because he was undesirable as a man. I wanted to show him that wasn‚Äôt true, and I didn‚Äôt really regret the decision.

Our friendship did suffer for a while because we realized we‚Äôd cultivated romantic feelings for each other once again but sensed a relationship wouldn‚Äôt work long term. But we took time and space and eventually the friendship seemed like it was returning to baseline.

When my divorce was final, I entered a new relationship. I also moved to his part of town. My friend had a long-term girlfriend by then with whom he had a fairly superficial partnership. I didn‚Äôt judge because it seemed to be what he wanted. 

Over the pandemic period, my friend faded me out. He was never super proactive over the years, but he always responded to my overtures and checked in if he hadn‚Äôt heard from me for a while. The next thing I know, he was leaving my few messages on read and not even RSVP‚Äôing to an important virtual event in my family that he once would have had a front row seat to.

I think that over the last year, I‚Äôve blocked out the hurt and resentment of being ghosted and just tried to move on. It has been seven months since I last reached out, and reflecting on the situation, I guess I‚Äôm not sure why this silence happened when it did. It would have made a lot more sense after we slept together and things got messy. This timing seems random.

So if you‚Äôve taken the time to read this (thank you) should I let this ending be or try to talk to him?",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/ocq8sq/repairing_or_not_with_my_best_male_friend/

34,od1b5o,1625329727,This dating stuff is weird and different,"So I recently made a foray into the dating and apps world.  I've met some very nice women and am seeing where that goes.

However, I've also met some women whose behavior or assertions greatly surprised me.  I'm curious \\whether these represent a shift in social norms of which I'm simply unaware.  

Men dating women, have y'all experienced these?

1.  Being yelled at for: opening the door, pulling out her chair, standing up when she arrives or leaves the table, trying to pay the bill and telling her not to worry about it.
2. Descriptive dislike of your physique.  I realize no one is everyone's cup of tea.  That said, I didn't realize how blunt criticism would be.  Apparently muscles are unattractive.  They are hard, uncomfortable when cuddling, and unattractive to some women.  Visible disappoint in the lack of a spare tire or ""Dad bod.""
3. Being asked why I exercise so much.  When I explained I have a heart condition and my choices are fitness and lower body fat or heart attack, one woman made a face and sound I thought usually reserved for tasting foods smelling of Sulphur.

The second one caught me off guard as the last time I was single (admittedly measured in decades) muscles were a GOOD thing.

Don't get me wrong here.  I've also met some really nice women.  I certainly don't need any external validation to know I'm awesome. I just smile at these moments and shrugged.

But it never occurred to me that this would be a real thing.  I mean, sure people have their preferences and I'm not going to be everyone's cup of tea.  But I figured if you meet someone in person there is a certain level of being nice and respectful that we all try to maintain.

For the record I was still as kind and respectful as I could be to these women and we amicably parted ways.  

I think maybe they didn't realize the potential impact of what they said?  But I have to imagine if I had commented on their bodies in such a detailed way on a first date they would have had a stronger reaction than I did.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/od1b5o/this_dating_stuff_is_weird_and_different/

He‚Äôs not married, no kids, I know this to be 100% true. I don‚Äôt know if there are any other women in the picture but I guess I couldn‚Äôt be upset if there was because we are not exclusive. My problem is the complete drop in contact on these days. I can only assume he‚Äôs up to no good.

41,od5uzj,1625344613,"OLD ""etiquette""?","Umm, OK, I am so new to this. Signed up yesterday. Got a message from a guy I'd already discounted for having a bad attitude (imo - I took offense at his answer to the question of what a relationship is (freely translated) ""doing it like bunnies""). And what he said in the message was rather negative. So I replied, pretty much saying ""wow you're cheerful (sarcasm), have a good life"" then he replied asking if I was saying I wasn't interested. I confirmed and told him I thought he might want to reconsider the bunny line. Now he keeps messaging sounding like he wants to pick a fight... asking if I wanted someone to dance to my tune or what. I'm just rolling my eyes at this point. (Catch a hint, dude, this won't change your outlook.)

So, for future reference. I gather it's a bad idea to even reply to people you're not interested in, let alone try and let them know just why you aren't interested?

I was just trying to be polite. But guess that ain't working so well...

As I‚Äôm sitting here over coffee, I think of the things that I regret the most. Let‚Äôs start by saying that I did love this man for his honesty, intelligence, and caring ways.  However, I was also extremely sexually attracted to him. I had also imagined crazy, wild sex with him. The problem was that I could never really get the words out of my mouth to explain what was really going through my mind. I‚Äôm not totally sure why this is an issue for me, but what I can conclude is that we really never spent a great deal of time together over the few years dating. Plus, a great deal of our communication was through texting. This is where I did not open my mouth and set clear boundaries.  Every time we got closer and I began feeling more comfortable sexually, then we wouldn‚Äôt see each other for awhile. I can‚Äôt take complete blame. He did have other issues he was dealing with, but other than a couple questions asking what I wanted, he never shared any of his fantasies with me either.  This leaves me with regret, and paraphernalia that never got used, because I never opened my mouth.  So, my advice today is to make your boundaries clear, and to learn to express your needs and desires.

Anyhow, I am curious about something here. 

When someone talks to you, saying they're a single parent, then mentions their job, hobbies etc. - is that an invite to ask about the family? I mean, if they mention a dog, I have no hesitation, but kids?

I feel asking about family indicates an interest beyond entry level friendship. And asking about kids is testing out a future?

Am I overthinking it? Do people like to talk to random strangers about their kids? Or is it more an early disclosure to see if the other person will cut and run?

What is the etiquette here? Do I have to tell complete strangers who have spent no more than one second talking to me my entire medical history?

84,oe7so5,1625493041,Don't know where else to ask this.,"I'm new to Reddit.  Don't know of any other place to ask advice here.  There was a post I saw here where a woman says she meets men she thinks are gay.  It sort of sparked this post.

I am single.  I date when I find someone that I find suitable.  But I'm not a bedhopper.  I don't have parades of women in my life.

I have had high stress, high responsibility jobs until the Covid reset.
My last long term partner was also high stress, high responsibility.  To facilitate having free time, I hired a male valet.  He took care of my house, my clothes, my errands, and personal care and attire.  He also happens to be gay.  He is a huge help and she adored him for his giving spirit and time he opened up for me.

We broke up.  I have the same need for free time and have kept the valet.

So now to the dating scene.  I dont't pressure a woman to get to bed.  I mean maybe we sleep together by date 3 but there would need to be great chemistry   I can date for months before sharing my bead comes up.  

I am not a great cook but I can cook.  I do all of my homes colors and interiors.  I also put on a tool belt and boots and tear them down and rebuild them.  But women seem to focus on the fact that I cook, do my own interiors and have a male valet taking care of all he does.  And I don't pressure them for sex.

I am not sure how to proceed when a woman starts asking me about my life.  I am not ashamed of my life.  If I say I have a housekeeper that doesn't seem to cause a ripple in the flow.  If I say I have a male valet, the brow lift, the sudden processing of info, I can tell it's being processed in a different fashion. And they begin to pullback. 

If I don't disclose he is a gay male and they later learn, I feel like it would be worse.  If I don't bring it up, it will come up soon enough. 

So I want to hear from both men and women in this dating genre how you'd feel something like this gets meshed into the conversations.  I mean in dating you exchange things about your life.  But deep things come in time.  I don't think a valet should be something I keep for later like I'm trying to keep a secret.  If I was considering a LTR as things progressed and she didn't like it, I'd terminate him.  But I don't think keeping it a secret helps.

87,oe99m8,1625497591,I try to do the right thing,"Just wanted to share an interaction I had on a dating site today. Noticed someone had liked a few things on my profile. I read her bio. I sent her a message thanking her for the likes &amp; I had 2 questions for her. If I am not into antiquing at all &amp; I‚Äôm more spiritual then religious are those dealbreakers?

She replied that she is a regular church goer &amp; would be looking in an LTR for someone to go with her. I explained that while I believe in a higher power that I really have no use for organized religions of any kind. I told her That I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôd match well but wished her the best of luck in finding someone who does. 

To me being honest ( but nice) was better then simply ignoring her likes of things on my profile. I figured if she was brave enough to put her self out there the least I could fo was treat her respectfully.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/oe99m8/i_try_to_do_the_right_thing/

89,oebpii,1625505025,Just curious how you would handle this.,"Hey there.  Met this lady online, we got along really well and quickly moved to texting.  We're both pretty busy so it was difficult to find a time to meet and after about a week of back and forth she left a text hanging so I just let things lie.  

A month later she texts me out of the blue, apologizing, saying her daughter had some health problems but all was good now and she wanted to arrange a video date.  I had some reservations about the video date but in the end it went really well and she was cuter and cooler than I expected.  

However I had some doubts because she's in a club that does these realllly intense, competitive athletic competitions that can take hours of a weekend day, and in the summers they compete a lot.  And it's co-ed.  Gotta admit it made me a bit self-conscious.  I go to the gym and am in good shape for my age but I'm also not some super ripped health freak.  Not to mention the time commitment she makes.  So after the video date I didn't contact her.  

A week later though I figured, wth, got nothing to lose and texted her and kind of told her about my hesitations.  She responded positively and we exchanged a few fairly banal texts until I texted her ""let's stop with the texting foolishness, how about a real date?""  And...silence.  

Then this morning, a month later, she texts me saying ""sorry I had some family problems but I'd like to find a time to have a coffee this week if you're up for it.""  

From the very beginning I was wondering if she has enough time to date, for reasons I won't go into here.  And my suspicions have sorta played out.  

But let's be frank, over the past 9 months I've been on dates with maybe 15 women and (I know this is gonna sound bad) she is in the top 3 in terms of attractiveness and intelligence.  Only problem is she's gone dark for a month on two occasions, although it may have been for good reasons. 

So without revealing the various ideas I have on this, I thought it might be interesting to see what you all thought.  Thanks!",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/oebpii/just_curious_how_you_would_handle_this/

91,oecebx,1625507164,Update: 40m breaks up with 38f. We cleared the air and she wished that I could have learnt to be tolerant of her bad behaviour. Go figure!,"The original post. 

I sent my ex a letter (a balanced letter) about my reasons for the break up. She thanked me for the nice letter and counter some of the comments with questions of her own. I then address every question/accusation objectively so she has no doubt that I was speaking the truth. Her last message to me was she wished that I learnt to be tolerant about these things and communicated my concerns.

I thought her comment was hilarious. Basically I needed to be more tolerant about her lateness to everything, her lack of life responsibility towards all things that requires normal adult function and her maturity level.

In the end I have made the right decision.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/oecebx/update_40m_breaks_up_with_38f_we_cleared_the_air/

93,oedndu,1625510972,When to take the plunge?,"Here on vacation with family, sitting by the pool‚Ä¶ looking at all the couples my age with a bittersweet taste that isn‚Äôt my Old Fashioned. It gets very tempting to just throw up that dating profile and fill the void. 

My whole mission was to wait until I didn‚Äôt feel that *tiny* tinge of desperation. That I need to sit with that. Enjoy the conversations I‚Äôm having with family, friends, and peers. Learn to love myself and be content. 

My ex-husband (27 years together) had an affair with a family member, and it left quite a mark. It‚Äôs been years. We‚Äôre divorced. I think I‚Äôve rounded the corner, but then I get that sense of loneliness that calls for an escape. 

So I‚Äôve been resisting until I feel like I‚Äôm solid. Is anyone else playing this game of ‚Äúnot yet?‚Äù Maybe this fall I‚Äôll see what‚Äôs out there. 

Is that a silly scenario I‚Äôve created in my own head? Or a reasonable rationale?

This painted a picture of something I'm not which created anxiety. When she later learned the truth, she was pissed.

Lying, even by omission, is a total deal breaker.

Now I'm just confidently honest.

96,oegm4o,1625519983,Seeking advice for a friend (40F),"I have a 40-year-old friend (F) who recently opened up to me about how she felt like 'something was wrong with her because she hasn't found a relationship or love. She is sporty, kind, has a good job, and likes to go out in the world and do things. Whilst we were talking, she broke down in tears and I didn't know what the right thing to say was.

I wanted to ask, for those of you who have felt this way, what would you want a friend to say to you? Or do you have any good resources or advice?

The things I did say were these, but I don't know if I helped or not. I should also mention that most of the time was spent listening, I know I'm well out of my depth.

1.) If something isn't working change your approach. I.e she hasn't used Match maybe she should give that a go.

2.) It's tough to put yourself out there repeatedly, make sure you spend time on rewarding yourself for doing it i.e with spas or holidays.

3.) Your value is self-defined, others couldn't even conceive of her accomplishments i.e moving to another country, good job, owns a house in a metropolitan city, etc.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/oegm4o/seeking_advice_for_a_friend_40f/

I invited them to sit next to me and the one I was interested in sat next to me.  We had nice conversation and we both had nice body language.  Around an hour or so, a guy that she did a meet up event with a week before showed up.  She invited that guy to sit with his, I didn't think anything of it but it seemed like they had connection,  Once the event was over, I left.  She did ask me if I wanted to join them, I said no thanks.  Just sucks because she was someone who I would have liked to get to  know better.  I did have a great time at the event and I left with my head held high...
