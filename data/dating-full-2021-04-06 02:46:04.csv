Here‚Äôs the backstory: we met in high school and had classes together and became friends. I ended up getting a huge crush on him, got drunk senior year and confessed my love.... he did NOT feel the same way, he was crushing hard on a girl he knew but she had a boyfriend. We decided to go to the local park one night and smoke some weed when a police office found us. He ended up taking all the blame, and said I wasn‚Äôt involved at all and that it was his drugs and that he invited me there. And Really, I asked him to hangout and said we should go to the park, bc that‚Äôs where everyone goes to smoke. 

Well since we were underage, the police let me go and he ended up arrested and had to do community service. The next day in school he said it would probably be best that we weren‚Äôt friends anymore. I low key was heartbroken but understood, plus I was going away to college in a few months anyways. 

Well, I ended up transferring home to a local school were he goes 2 years later (it‚Äôs a huge state school, everyone from high school goes there). I was posting on my story one day that I got lost and he texted me directions and offered to show me around campus one day as we were in similar majors. We grabbed lunch a few times but our heavy course loads, work, etc and opposite class schedules never really gave us the chance to keep it going.

It‚Äôs been 2 years since then, (I think) we both are still single and will sometimes randomly message each other on snap and will chat for a bit. I think he‚Äôs a really great guy, we are interested in a lot of the same things, and we have some mutual friends. He recently moved to my area of town, too.

**He met her 3 years ago. They were friends for a year.** **He used to have a crush on her (which he denied until tonight).** **Then she started dating a guy for 2 years and they barely talked** unless it was every few months over text or a snap of her face saying ‚Äústreaks!‚Äù 

**Fast forward, she started calling him whenever she had boyfriend trouble and wanted to break up with her bf.** His friends told him he needed to tell me that they were talking on the phone. She invited him out of town (to another city for a volunteer trip which they had gone on a trip like that before when they were both single) without considering me (he asked me, but she did not). They would‚Äôve been staying in a hotel room together with maybe one other guy. I told him this made me uncomfortable and she seemed to be going after him. She never asked me to go out (or even asked to meet me), but always invited him to go out one-on-one. **I asked him to stop talking to her. He defended her and kept saying they had been great friends for years and he wasn‚Äôt going to stop talking to her.**

**A few weeks later he tried to break up with me because ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt understanding his POV that they were just friends.‚Äù He told me he‚Äôs not going to stop talking to her, but he was tired of arguing about that situation with her so he was going to break up with me.**

I felt like he was choosing her over me.

I eventually caved and agreed to try talking to her.  We realized we both have a lot of similarities and now she‚Äôs started asking if I want to hang out with her and my bf more. I think my bf might have part to do with that, but idk. I let it go for a while. 

I got upset tonight after he told me that he ‚Äúused to have a crush on her.‚Äù He claims he doesn‚Äôt anymore, but I felt lied to that he never told me that in the first place. I‚Äôve also been upset that he tried to break up with me over her (he claims it‚Äôs not about her and about his POV that they‚Äôre just friends). I told him to choose between her or me. He said it‚Äôs toxic that I‚Äôm trying to make him choose between his girlfriend and friend. She is not his best friend (I know his best girl friend very well and we get along).

I‚Äôve met her friends, been to her work, she said her mom knows about me (they live in a different city so I haven‚Äôt met them), she talked about meeting her parents, and we‚Äôve been on like 8 plus dates so far. 

Yesterday was sort of a weird day and we couldn‚Äôt decide what to do, and for some reason we were indecisive the whole day and drove around a lot. It was still fun but it was sort of exhausting and I guess it was both of our faults but it was Easter so there was just no parking anywhere and every restaurant was packed.

Anyways, I gave her her birthday present that I had bought for her and even though I didn‚Äôt spend her birthday with her I thought I‚Äôd buy her something small. I bought her some slippers (bc her dog chewed them up) and a plushie bc she has a lot of them. Well she forgot them in my car, she also forgot her hydro flask as well, and she was wearing my jacket and she forgot to give that back too.

It sort of hurt me that she didn‚Äôt remember to grab the presents and she was appreciative when I gave it to her, but like I would never forgot something like that. If I overthink the situation in my head I feel like this is sort of a bad sign, bc I went into the effort of buying the things for her, deciding what to buy, and she just forgot them in my car. It‚Äôs an inside joke that she‚Äôs forgetful and stuff, but that kind of hurt me.

I actually texted her that it made me feel sort of bad, but that since she since she left her hydro flask too that it lessened it a little bit. She said she was sorry and that we could meet up today, but I had work and was busy so I said that another day would be better. She thanked me again for the presents and then we stopped messaging. I know it‚Äôs probably not a big deal but I can‚Äôt help to feel how I feel.

Nobody had respect for her and taken advantage of her. I didn't like the way people treated her so everytime she was going the wrong way I tried to protect her. In that, sometimes I would have to scold her, sometimes she will cry. I thought it is okay for me to sometimes become villain to save her. I didn't think even ones selfishly in our relationship and tried always to look after her. Due to COVID she has to move to her hometown as her parents was forcing her and in a way she wanted too.

I matched with a few and shortly after struck up a conversation with one in particular. 
We talked for a couple days via text and phone calls, she said she didn't want to meet for coffee when I asked I understood why you don't run off to meet someone from the internet rite away. She said a few things that seemed weird to me at the time but I was so tired I didn't dig into it. But yesterday what she said hit like a ton of bricks and everything made sense! She says, ""what if I told you we have talked before""
Now for the back story. For the past few years I have had a Facebook friend. I think one of the random people I added when I moved to a new area, I digress. We would talk pretty regularly and it was more then apparent she was interested in me when I made very clear I was not interested in her. Me, ""I enjoy talking to you, but I don't want to date you"" it got to a point where she started saying some very negative shit and I noticed a pattern developing that was definitely a character defect in my mind. So I stopped talking to her. She would still send odd messages that I didn't even open and some time passed with nothing. Then recently I received a message and replied, it started off nice but quickly I remembered oh yeah don't talk to her...
So this girl I match with turned out to be the Facebook friend with a fake name. She led me on for days under false pretense and now can't understand why I called her actions dishonest. I haven't responded yet to ""thanks for making me feel like shit"" well you feel that way because you did a shifty thing. 
Of course after this goes down the girl in the real world that I really like steps back in the picture. I was missing her in the first place e that's where the lonely stems from.

It went really well in my opinion and he said it went really well too and we both agreed that we'd like to see each other again.
So towards the end of our date, he asked me if I've only been with my ex (I was in a 6 year relationship and have been single for a year now and I'm 24). I questioned if he meant in a relationship as I was surprised by his question. He said he meant intimately. I become really awkward and began to laugh awkwardly and said sorry I wasn't expecting that question. I told him no and said I've just been intimate with 2 people (which is true). I'm not proud of the second person as it was after my ex and I was in a bad place mentally. It also didn't end well. 
I feel like I should've lied and just said it was only my ex, but I'm a really honest person (sometimes too honest *rolls eyes*). I just don't want him to judge me because I slept with someone I wasn't in a relationship with (which I don't think is wrong but I'm just ashamed of it because of the place I was in when it happened) because I know how guys can be about body count. I don't even know why he asked me to be honest. He seemed fine after and I asked him why he asked and he said he was just asking. We kissed not long after and he seems fine when he's messaging me but you never know.

So a few months back I sent a friend request to a girl on facebook that was really beautiful and we had same interests.

A week ago I decided to give it a try and text her and see how it goes.

Suprisingly, everything went so smooth, we talked for about 2 hours and It was really nice, she was asking questions, making an effort to keep the conversation going.

2-3 days later I texted her again, and we talked for about 1 hour. She really seemed interested in me and I was feeling very happy inside.

Then 1 day later I messaged her again, and I noticed we had built a good connection, she really seemed to like me, sending a lot of emoticons. being very sweet

Now, I kinda like her, and the next time we gonna talk I will ask her for a date.

The thing is that everytime we talked I was the one to text her first.

And now Im overthinking the fact that I have to wait for her to text me this time, to see if she is really interested of me. I dont want to come out as desperate or something, neither I know If she really wants to text so often. Its been 2 days since we last talk. I know its a very short time to making conclusions, but Im overthinking it and time feels so slow. So Im kinda confused cause I feel like I like her so much and I dont wanna fuck up. Im pretty sure she is interested in me, but Im confused at the same time. I've never met her So I kinda dont know her at all.

I wasn't having a good night because women who were meant to be at my calibre were not approaching me. I told her to go away and told her that I do not have sex with fat girls. The reason I said because it is a well accepted fact that fact women really have nothing special to offer for a man who is in his prime. A couple of minutes later, her friends a mix between obese and a little too flabby for me were angry that I had told Piggy that I wasn't interested in her. I told them all that I wasn't interested in having sex with a fat girl and that was that. I left the bar angry and crying because no thin woman approach me and I ended up getting yelled at by a group of killer whales getting in my face and acting entitled. I told my co-worker about it and she was I kid you not, ""disgusted"" with my behavior all because I stood for myself and didn't let no killer whale crush my pelvis in bed.

I have been seeing someone since the start of the year who hasn't been a great texter. I initiate most texts and we exchange a couple of texts almost every day. However, she tends to take hours to reply and conversations typically short with little to no affection. Good dates in real life, though.

I've always been a texter myself with most people I've dated and conversations can last through the day. Granted, people get busy. But it'll be nice to be pre-empted ahead of a busy week or receive a good morning/good night text to know that they are thinking of you.  


It does bother me a little bit and I can't figure out if I'm just not used to it, or the lack of communication/affirmation is at play.

I've never had a serious relationship nor have I ever had sex. But you know what? That's okay. 

Two years ago I would have been ashamed to even think so but honestly, who cares? I definitely don't and seeing a lot of posts on this sub have helped me realise that there is no timeframe. 

Don't get me wrong, I am incredibly frustrated. I can't count the amount of times I've been ghosted, but that's just part of the dating game now. 

The idea of a hookup has never appealed to me, I've always wanted a proper connection with a woman. As a man though you can probably imagine what a lot of my friends think of the fact I don't want a hookup. 

The pandemic caused a whole shutdown here in the UK so dating has been completely out of the question. It's been a blessing if I'm honest. 

Yes, I still use dating apps but don't expect anything. I just want to have a nice conversation with someone and maybe get to know them, it's the smaller things that mean a lot to me. 

Since last March I graduated with my bachelor's, started my master's, worked on projects and started working at home since gyms closed. I've never felt better. 

I always get told I'm good looking but I think using dating apps can be a disadvantage as I'm 5ft7. Let's be real, dating apps are entirely judging a book by its cover but it is what it is. 

Despite my frustrations, I know there is someone out there for me and there is someone out there for you too. We really do have to work on ourselves and strive to become better people.

So, to give some context, I‚Äôm (20M) in college and fresh out of a long term relationship. A few weeks after it ended I started putting myself out there, not necessarily looking for a new gf, but maybe a fwb or just regular good old friends. Got on tinder just to see what was out there.

Anyway, outside of tinder I ended up meeting this girl organically (she lives in my apartment complex). We hit it off, I got her contact, and we made plans to hang out. Before we actually met up, she made sure to let me know that she was recently out of a long term relationship and wanted to know if I was looking for anything. I told her I was in the exact same boat and I wasn‚Äôt looking for anything serious, and she said great. We met for dinner, had a pretty good time. I can‚Äôt speak for her, but I‚Äôm pretty sure there was some attraction between us.

So we made plans to hang out again. However, this time she texts me the day we were supposed to go out and tells me she really enjoys hanging out with me, but she doesn‚Äôt think she‚Äôs ready for this, that she‚Äôs been having a rough time lately (presumably about her breakup), and she didn‚Äôt want to lead me on. I‚Äôm obviously a little confused, since we both prefaced that we weren‚Äôt looking for a relationship. She said she was just nervous because even if our goal wasn‚Äôt a relationship, it‚Äôs just too soon after the breakup. But we‚Äôd only texted for a few days and hung out once, and I didn‚Äôt actually know her well enough to feel comfortable grilling her about all the details of her personal life. I told her she should take all the time she needed. We haven‚Äôt talked since then.

A few days later, I‚Äôm scrolling through tinder and I find her profile. Obviously, I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything wrong with being on tinder, since I‚Äôm also on it, but the reasons she gave me for cutting me off didn‚Äôt quite line up with having a tinder profile. And I know she was active on it because she added a new photo in that same night.

So I‚Äôm obviously a little confused. My self esteem is telling me she lied about not being ready, so she could let me down easy and then ghost me. But a friend told me they think she actually likes me and doesn‚Äôt want to catch feelings so soon after her breakup, and that‚Äôs why she cut me off. But this girl is absolutely drop-dead gorgeous and several leagues above mine, so it‚Äôs a little hard for me to believe that.

Ladies, which one, if any, do you think seems more likely? I want to ask her about her tinder profile, and without accusing her of anything, kind of get an explanation for why she told me she couldn‚Äôt see me. There‚Äôs a hundred possible explanations for why she has it. She never seemed disingenuous in our previous interactions, and I say that as someone with slight trust issues.
I just want an answer so I can get on with my life.
