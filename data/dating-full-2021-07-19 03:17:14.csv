For a quick backstory  this girl is really shy and don’t talk much and is a book worm and spends literally 18 hours a day in the library. Everyone always automatically assumes she’s a virgin because of this and most guys don’t approach her because she’s not an easy type of girl to sleep with me. But me I generally care about this person and I want to start a relationship with her and her being hard to sleep with me makes me respect and admire her even more. And we both 21 as  university students. 



The other day my Crush  was having a panic attack and I had to calm her down and afterwords she calmed down and  I asked her if she wanted to go eat dinner with my friends and she said can’t the thought of food will make her throw up and she wants to go to the park and play tennis with two guys and I said that’s fine and I dropped her off there but she said after dinner if we go watch a movie at someone’s house she would come and I should text her. After dinner everyone went home and we never watched a movie so I never texted her. I have a feeling one of the guys at the park also has a crush on her and everyone always saids it’s between me and him to get the girl. 

A week later in a group setting she brings that  day back up and then saids the weirdest  thing ever she was like I don’t even remember where I slept that day but I know it wasn’t at my house. I instantly get scared thinking she slept with the guy (the one I think has a crush on her) from the park. So I start pressing and asking her where she went after the park and she’s like I don’t remember completely. 
It sounds like she had a hookup with him from my perspective then she even started saying she wants a  guy that drives a black car and this guy from the park has a black car.  Then she said she knows who she wants her husband to be when the other day she said she has a list of potential husbands in her mind. She said all of this in a group setting with 5 girls and one guy (me). 

All my friends are saying this was said on purpose to make me jealous and want to chase her more and the way she worded everything was on purpose and they said she also said to that to see my reaction. One person went as far as to say she done it as test to see if I’m insecure or not as girls don’t like insecure guys. My friends were also saying it’s just not in her personality to sleep with someone and she’s religious as well. They also said most girls hide there bodycount especially from guys so why would she expose herself if it was true. They also said when I talk to other girls she always observes the conversation which is true so they said this is her way of getting payback. 
I don’t care if she had sex with him the only issue is that if she did have sex with him they will most likely start dating  especially based on what she said about the car and husband and I would have missed my chance to ask her out which is so annoying as I spent 3 months building up a good bound with her and it took me so long to finally get the confidence to ask her out. 

I really don’t believe this they my friends so they just saying this to make me feel better so I want to ask reddit do you guys think she hooked up with the guy from the park or was it really a test?  Do you guys think my chances are over?

I ordered myself some sushi and talked to the waiter about becoming a sushi chef (different post for a different time) but I started to think.

There needs to be a dating app where this behavior can't happen without consequences. 

In short I propose an app that lightly punishes people who flake. Essentially you'd out money into a pot online. Then that money sits to be used for the actual date (probably could partner with a payment service like Google pay) and then the funds can be used towards the date. 

Both parties have actual stakes by putting say 5$ in there and then it's up the the couple to decide who pays the rest.

If one party flakes. And this could be done by setting a location, and time and if after that point the app doesn't register you were there then sorry. You lose your money.

If neither show up then nobody loses.

Positive reinforcement is weak. We need to bring back some form of punishment to prevent BLATANT FLAKES. I'm aware this isn't gonna change the world. But I know for myself it'd make dating that much less stressful.

If you're reading this and you flaked without saying anything. SHAME.

I want feedback from this subreddit, if I launched a GoFundMe and offered free premium for lifetime would that be a good incentive enough to 1)invest in the app 2)try it out for a spin?

But somehow I couldn’t be trusted yet again when I was foward with that. After this situation though, my ex now went ahead and hung out with some friends which was alright with me. I told him drink responsibly, be careful, get home at a reasonable time specially 2am or 1am knowing his mother can be strict and he lives in brooklyn, and to just watch himself ( he’s a bit friendly when he’s drunk) But he didn’t listen to me at all. He got black out drunk, this girl friend he had there, that he knew from highschool but hadn’t talked to her in years) sat on his lap in a photo booth and put her tongue super close to his face while he was drunk smiling his face off..then sat on his lap again in a bunched up car. He told me that was nessacary and he didn’t know what he was doing.. To me they were excuses. I’ve got black out drunk before and recall certain things but everyone isn’t the same. But that hurt me. Gave it a second chance only to be unhappy again. A endless cycle of unhappiness because he’s an adult (22) and i’m only 19 and we have a lot of differences. Sure we communicated but did that get anywhere ? no. Because he thinks he’s always right, and I’m stubborn. He’s always too tired to talk, cranky and tired to hang out working 40 hours a week from home- weekends off only. Hasn’t planned any of our dates recently. Yeah I understood at one point, but I was overdoing it. Overdoing on trying to make things work, his laziness, etc.  Also,  his girl best friend would bug me. Just recently after the breakup ( 2 days after) she texts me, “ yeah I was creeping, just wanted to send love and positivity”. I knew she was waiting for this moment but imma be an adult about it and say thanks. Me and her barely talk in the first place. but anyways, this is my advice to everyone.. if you feel like your doing too much, leave. It’s not worth it. Give all that attention to yourself. One day they’ll realize what they missed out on.. maybe they won’t.

One of which she was “seeing” for a few months. This was about 3 or 4 years ago that it happened, and the guy has actually since started up a serious relationship with one of my girlfriends best friends. 

They’ve all moved on, everyone involved is very mature and kind, and obviously my girlfriend and her housemates past means nothing to anybody involved. Hence the reason why my girlfriend and her ex “flame” can live together without any awkwardness. For me being new to the situation it’s hard to not let emotions get in the way. They’ve all dealt with the situation and moved on, but I haven’t. I trust my girlfriend, and I trust her housemate. 

I guess the issue is jealousy, and the fact my girlfriend and I haven’t even been together for the same length of time she was “seeing” her housemate for in the past. Its hard to process that she’s moving in with someone that she has likely shared deeper experiences with and more time with than she has with me.

He recently asked me to give him more time with his friends which I thought was dumb and unreasonable bc I give him every opportunity to hang with his friends and even let him make time for his friends before making time for me. Which probably sounds bad? I won’t go into every detail. but he basically said sorry that he was being selfish. also we see each orher on the weekends now and when we do, he stays over and rushes to go home the next day saying he needs to do homework but when he gets home, he texts me and often sounds like he doesn’t have much to do or nothing to do. He just wants to be home. tonight, he has rushed off the phone again but after hearing my change in tone, he says sorry and that I don’t have to get off the phone right now. but I get real frustrated and upset and he even admits he wants to play games and he is already playing video games while talking to me on the phone and before we called. I say goodnight bc I always feel bad for taking up his time. but texted him how I am upset. He says he messed up and that he is sorry but this time, I am really mad and can’t find myself to not be mad at him at all. I had a busy long day and he knows I want him to make time for me and continues to rush off the phone to do whatever he wants to do either playing videos games or being with his friends.

I love him and he has done more good than anything ever bad to me, this isn’t worth breaking up for but I told him I am tired of how he treats this stupid phone calls of ours. but I am kind and nice to everyone and feel bad for even carrying this madness until the next day which we normally make up in the moment.

21M here. I am a recent college grad and I am starting a gap-year/post-bacc before I apply to grad school. I’ve been kind of lonely most of my life but never the type to make a big deal about dating. I’m honestly pretty okay with the idea of living alone.

My question, however. How would I get into the “dating scene” at this point if I’ve never dated a girl or had a girlfriend? I’ve downloaded a few apps and didn’t really get anywhere despite getting a good number of matches.

I’m a 6’0” guy. About 240 lbs but I’m starting a diet and beginning the process of working out. Hope to be down to 200lbs by the end of the year maybe. 

I’m starting classes at a local community college while I prepare for grad school. I thought I might meet someone that way but I’m not sure. I’m also starting work at a hospital.

Drinking is not something I do, so I’d prefer to stay away from bars. I also live in a pretty rural area (not terrible, but a lot of farmland and a few small towns/cities) so there aren’t a whole lot of bars anyway.

I dress okay, I guess. Usually jeans/khakis and polos/button downs/t-shirts/sweaters depending on the weather. My clothes fit me well and my personal hygiene is very good. 

I have some mental health issues that I think may make it hard for me to date. Anxiety and OCD etc are pretty bad for me personally, so I worry a lot. I’m worried a girl might think I’m too much trouble

So I'm 35M dating 34F, we've been on 5 dates and slept together on the 6th date, it was pretty good and I stayed the night at her place.

I was previously very morbidly obese for most of my adult life, and for that and other reasons I avoided relationships, so I have no experience/baggage as it were, being in a relationship.

She on the other hand was with someone for 8 years, and I think they broke up around 6 months ago. I don't really know much else besides that. She's mentioned it a couple times now but I've never asked any follow up questions - from my point of view I don't really care about her ex, but it almost seems like she feels like she wants to talk about it. I think she might have said it didn't end well and he doesn't live here anymore but that's about it. Maybe he cheated on her? She did tell me she got tested after she broke up with her ex ""just in case"" so that's what I'm kind of thinking.

Anyway I suppose I'm just asking, or thinking out loud, should I just ask if she wants to talk about it? I suppose again it's just a bit tricky since I have no past relationships to speak of.

Last weekend, on the 4th date, she said ""I'm not sleeping with you"" as if she thought I expected it since I bought her flowers (I genuinely didn't expect anything other than hope she liked them). She said she didn't want to ruin it and she said it was hard to find nice people (like me) and she wanted to take it slow. Again all fine by me.

One thing was, she was a little reluctant to sleep together, but was almost acting guilty as if she felt like she was leading me on - on the 5th date we went to my bedroom to keep fooling around but stopped short of having sex, that didn't bother me at all and I at no point put any pressure on her, any pressure she was just putting on herself. She said something like ""I'm just such a mess of a person"". I asked her what she meant but didn't get a straight answer.

On the 6th date we actually slept together (sex and stayed the night), and it was a good time for both of us from what I can tell.

I assume it's all leading back to her ex - would I be right in assuming that? Because she seems to have her life together pretty well from what I can tell. Seems to have affected her quite badly and again not sure how I should navigate this.

Somewhat related but when should we talk about exclusivity? We have plans again for next weekend, which will be the 7/8th time we hang out. We did talk about it on the 5th date and she was like 'obviously we are both free to see other people etc' but it more like seemed like she was trying to see if I was dating anyone else.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,906474,public,self,"Dealing with someone who got out of long term relationship, as a novice myself",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/on8e19/dealing_with_someone_who_got_out_of_long_term/,all_ads,6,,,,,,

The men who date me almost always end up telling me “they can’t keep up being romantic” and withdrawing all physical touch outside of sex. It just makes me sad and hesitant to start dating again. My partners have always told me how sexy they find me and how intensely physically attracted to me they are which is why they pursue me in the first place, but they always lose that affection for me. 

No hugs, no hand holding, no kisses. I only get physical affection when we have sex. It’s great and all, but I need more. When a guy tells me he’s not romantic or affectionate, I just shut the entire thing down now no matter how happy I currently am in the relationship. I hate feeling like I have to beg for scraps of attention and affection after the initial honeymoon phase. Once the relationship starts to lose that intimacy, I lose energy and passion for it.

So, I’m heavily convinced I’m currently with my soulmate. We’ve known each other for years, but we’ve been officially in a relationship for about a month. She’s the easiest person to talk to, and she’s genuinely the most gorgeous girl I’ve ever seen. I’ve always been mature for my age, with this, we’re both only 18(please don’t stop reading lol) but we’re both so in love. Every time we’re together it’s full of laughter and memories for the rest of our lives. My biggest fear is losing her, but it seems like that’s coming closer and closer to reality. 

We’re so drastically different. We’ve always acknowledged this, but it’s kind of played into the friendship(now relationship) so well. She’s probably the most religious person I know, yet I’m the complete opposite. She’s heavily oriented around her family, yet I love being independent and I hardly speak to family unless I have to(I don’t hate them, just not my thing). And she’s quite shy around those she’s just met, whilst I’m quite good at public speaking or making conversation. The list goes on. Like I said, this has always played well into our relationship, and said differences lead to great conversations. 

As previously stated, she’s extremely religious. I’m convinced she was one of Jesus’ apostles. With this, she wants to wait until marriage to have sex. I’m deeply in love with her, and I’ve shared my desire to make love multiple times. I’ve always thought I’d be able to hold off until marriage, but every time I see her I fall in love even more. I simply cannot wait years and years, but she insists on doing so. I refuse to disrespect her and try to force anything upon her, but it’s really killing me. 

Lastly, she’s quite sensitive. I often find myself frustrating her too much with my lighthearted jokes. I’m quite the comedian around those I’m close with, so me having to change the way I act or text when it involves her hurts my heart. I feel like I can’t be myself, which seems like the biggest part of a healthy relationship.

And for a website with so many members that actually seems pretty low to me. They have 35 million members, so assuming the ratio can work out so that everyone of them can pair up with another, that's 17.5 million couples. So if it takes 14 minutes to pair together a single couple, it would take nearly 500 years for every current member to find a match on the site. Obviously the real world doesn't work like this, but it still seems like you could spend your lifetime on this site and still not find a match, based on the numbers they provided. Don't take this the wrong way, in no way is this a criticism of the site, this is purely numbers on paper. And there's so many more circumstances that should be taken into consideration to find out the true likely hood of finding love on any website. Just something to think about before you go out and spend money on becoming a member, so you can be better aware of how long you might be paying before you ""find love"".

anyways..i met a guy a couple weeks ago. he's 29. first date, we spent a couple hours doing an activity. then hung out a couple days later, planning to do another outdoor activity. then we ended up getting dinner and meeting up with his friends and going to a few bars..prob together like 7 hours ish. he did ask me to go home with him but i said no and he was respectful of that and drove me home. 

third time we see each other, he invited me on a rafting day trip with like 20 of his friends, which was supposed to be ~7 hours. had a great time, his friends like me and i like them. then after the day trip, we spent the following 24 hours together. obviously we had sex, but we also did coupley weekend things.

the thing is...he's very attractive, great job, etc. when we go out, it seems like girls will come up to him almost as often as guys will come up to me. i'm sure he has no shortage of options. from talking and just things that came up over the weekend, i definitely gather that he gets around.

so like what are red flags i need to be looking for? or green flags? for whatever reason, i'm way too trusting when it comes to screening potential partners. but he honestly seems like a great guy. i would NEVER spend an entire weekend with someone i didn't like, but maybe he didn't have anything else to do?

I (24M) started seeing this girl (24 as well) a bit over 2 months ago. We both got out of relationships late March, a few weeks later started going on regular dates and to get along really well.

Our final week before leaving for the summer we spent almost every night together, I was with her 1 hour before she left to the airport for her summer plans.

We’re now both out of town until late August, even though things were going great I’m not sure if they might die off until we see each other again which would be earliest in 6 weeks.

It’s been 2 weeks since we left for the summer, we’re texting every day. Not constantly, but the pattern is usually a few texts each (4-5) with a few hours between our answers, around twice a day. At a certain point she even offered for me to come visit her at her place, I offered the same but unfortunately the dates didn’t work for either of us. We tried to make something work before late August but our summer plans are too different unfortunately 

Even though we’re texting every day, we haven’t actually talked about our summer before leaving, or where things stand etc

I’m wondering if hopping on a call to catch up is a good move or not as it’s a stronger connection than just texting, or if the best move would be to ease off the texting for a bit? In your experience, is there any “best practice” of maintaining a solid connection over the summer with a person you only recently started seeing?

I might be overthinking here but I like this girl and just don’t want things to become stale!

TL;DR: started seeing a girl 2 months ago, we have a great connection and like each other but now we won’t see each other until the end of the summer.

We've hungout about 3 times now and have made out and cuddled and stuff. The only thing worth noting here is that she doesn't like to be intimate in public, which of course is perfectly fine, and I've respected her wishes.

After our last date I proposed the idea that we get dinner, go to art exhibition and/or movie, and then spend the night together at a hotel. She told me she'd like to wait till a while till we spend the night at the hotel together, to which I said I was cool with, and that I didn't want to pressure her into anything.

However, after that (and where I am potentially the asshole) I asked her if she was asexual. For some reason my brain came to the conclusion that because she didn't want to get intimate (in addition to the fact she didn't like being intimate in public) she might be asexual. She asked me what made me think that, and I said that because she wanted to wait to get intimate. Afterwards I told her that I didn't really think it through because she just said she wanted to 'wait' and not do it all. I said I realised that it was a dumb question.

We were meant to hangout yesterday but she didn't respond to my last txt so I just assumed she was busy with stuff. So I txt her today asking her if she's mad and she responded by saying that it was pretty disrespectful to ask if she was asexual and that she doesn't just sleep with anyone. She then said it showed her that I'm only interested in one thing.

Now I feel as though it wasn't that offensive of a question ask seeing as there are countless different sexualities now, and in all honesty I thought I was being polite by asking. Obviously I realise now that the question didn't make sense, and have told her so.

Tl:dr - I am fully grieving the loss of a relationship that never had the chance to happen. 

So I met up with a friend of a friend for dinner and drinks. We had been out drinking before and spent time at small gatherings together, but never just the two of us. I didn’t know what to expect, but just decided to go with the flow. I did have the expectation that if we hooked up, it would be a one-night thing and this guy would be a random acquaintance (e.g., we see each other on social media but essentially never talk again or maintain any level of emotional intimacy) at the end like other hookups. 

He stayed that night, and then I spent a few days at his house in another city. And then he stayed over here quite a few times after that. Not just staying to hook up (though that part was extremely fun), but talking until the sun rose every night and laughing constantly and walking in the morning. He is an incredibly beautiful person, inside and out, and I knew at that point (after about our 3rd sleepover) that it would be really difficult on either end: lose that level of intimacy forever, or try and maintain a friendship when my feelings were much stronger than his. 

We went back and forth about this, and it definitely caused more pain for both of us. I work over 40 hours a week (60 at most) split between two jobs to keep myself afloat. He’s in a different place in life, but he still pulls a lot of working hours in a high-stress position, so free time is usually spent hanging out with a group of close friends and meeting folks from dating apps. I have a tinder profile, but never really meet people from there and prefer to meet folks organically through my interests and work. I honestly don’t know if this was just his usual hookup style (some folks are fine having a high level of emotional intimacy with a hookup, but I am not). 

So anyway, he was in the process of moving to a new city when all of this unfolded. He created a decision matrix and decided that it wasn’t feasible for us to keep seeing each other, and that conversation made me very sad and the whole matrix thing felt very impersonal and emotionless. We parted ways, but he said that he didn’t want to lose me as a friend, so I maintained loose contact and told him that if he wanted to see me, I was available to hang out. We made plans to hang out, and then he canceled an hour and a half before our meeting time. Then he showed up anyway, and we ended up talking about “making it work” before hooking up again. So, making it work involves continuing to see each other, getting to know each other as potential long-term partners, and fostering that connection until things worked out differently. 

He had to leave the next day to go back to his new apartment, and over the course of the next few days, I consistently had to initiate conversation with him and stopped when I consistently got no reply. I wanted to show 1) I was making time for this, 2) I cared about what was going on in his life, and 3) that’s the level of communication that I need at the beginning of a relationship (e.g., not talking all the time, but being excited to engage and flirt with one another on a regular basis). We had made two plans for seeing each other again: hanging out on the following weekend (all his other free time in my city was booked with prior engagements) and my visit to his new city for a festival in a couple weeks. 

Traveling involves a lot for me. I have several pets that need care arrangements and I am not paycheck-to-paycheck at the moment, but expenses and scheduling ticket purchases is a huge deal for my well-being. So with that context in mind, I asked him what days/times I should book a train for my visit. His response was just that we would talk about it at a later time after he checked in with his friends. This made me feel like it didn’t matter to him since I was just an add-on to the weekend and would probably also make things awkward with his friends. 

We ended up meeting a day early this week, at my request, so we could talk. I told him that I had a bad gut feeling about making things work based on these things (I did not give a list of specific examples), and I just said it felt like I was much more interested in him and invested in our connection than he was. He agreed, apologized because I was sad, gave me an awkward hug, and saw himself out. 

I’m crushed and have been an emotional train wreck for a while now. I am just so sad that neither of us could see eye to eye or make compromises in the situation. It brought up a lot of concerns for me that I am unworthy of effort, too emotionally available/vulnerable, and that there has to be something (he said he couldn’t put a finger on exactly what it was/when it happened) about me that caused someone I was falling for to just have zero feelings in return after everything we shared. 

Anyway, I’m coping by bright-siding (reappraising the situation as a learning experience hopefully), avoidance, and digging into the things that make me happy (seeing my friends, doing art, etc.), but other suggestions on how to cope are welcome. I just want to talk to him, but I know that will only probably bring both of us more pain at this point.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,906717,public,self,This is just a full rant about how the last few weeks have absolutely crushed me.

My boyfriend (30) rarely engages with social media. He consistently likes all my posts, but hasn't posted anything about us as a couple and I've never seen him leave a comment on anyones post. He is a really slow responder to me, and often it makes me feel frustrated when i see him reply much faster to the group chats he has with ""the boys"".

This weekend he went away for a ""boys weekend"", he promised to keep in touch periodically and let me know how his weekend was going. I told him it would be nice to see some pics for sure, but only if he has a minute. As a disclaimer, I've never once thought to go through his phone or stalk his exes online in a jealous way or anything  like that. At any rate, I ended up hearing next to nothing from him for the first night he was away and it kind of bummed me out that he didn't respond to my goodnight message. I told myself he was likely super busy so I shouldn't be so self centred. He's having fun with his friends. 

I woke up super early the next day to attend a hike I was really excited about. While i waited for the kettle to boil I was creeping through my IG discovery page and clicked on a picture of a girl who looked vaguely familiar. It took me a second to realize they were a couple of french girls I'd seen in my boyfriends photos from when he attended an event, and Instagram was suggesting them as ""posts I might like"". They were on a boat, posing suggestively and squishing their boobs together. They are both very pretty, and one of them is an IG model. It was posted just after I went to bed and my boyfriend had both liked it, and left a comment underneath it that I can only assume was an inside joke as it didn't make any sense to me. This was actually kind of a shock to me as he never leaves comments on anyones posts, not mine, not his friends, not anyones. The girl liked but didn't respond to his message. 

Now, I have no bad feelings towards these women, jealousy or anything... all they did was post a picture. What really bummed me out was that instead of saying goodnight to me, and replying to my message and sending pictures like he had promised. He was choosing to flick through IG and like these sorts of photos. It sent me down a rabbithole looking at all the public accounts of other girls he follows... and there were so many selfies he had liked... not the graduation pics, or the pics of their new nephew... always the selfies. It made me feel so crumby I didn't bother going on my hike... which I know sounds stupid but I was just feeling this creeping neglect and foolishness that I couldn't shake.

I’ve been on 3 dates with both and slept with both already. 

The first one (25) is a British that is a clinical scientist, he’s tall, with a gorgeous angel face, nice apartment in down town. I really like him, we both like to dable with drugs (that’s part of my life sorry) and he likes all the adventurous activities that I find exiting. I my friends consider me as a very intense / crazy person, and to be honest he is too. We have the same humor, same list for adrenaline and we can talk for hours into the sunrise in his balcony about very deep conversation.

And the the things that I find a down side is he texts very little ( I don’t like to initiate. But when we see each other we talk non stop. Another thing I don’t like his is extensive sexual history and insane sex drive - it makes me a little insecure especially that he has sex toys in his apt. 


The other guy (also 25) is very sweet, tall handsome, very funny too, we talk non stop as well, he doesn’t hide the fact he’s in to me and has asked if I was looking for something serious because he is. I told him I really like him but I need some time to see his real personality and him to see mine. He has an intense personality too but he minimum drugs due to his employment in the Navy. 
Thing with him is that he’s the total opposite- he is very clingy and it Wired me off sometimes - he also lives in navy housing so we need to go to hotels If we wanna do our thing. 
Also yesterday we had sex and he ass all the hickies in my boobs, he would press in them but not say anything. 

I still need to get to know both of them better as I’m still very skeptical of everything they say or do . But I’m wondering what will happen if things get a bit serious between us.

As disrespectful as I think it is to ghost someone, especially if you've been dating them for a while, after having one too many of these situations I do understand why some people do it. 

The last 2 dating situations I've been in, I told the other person I wasn't feeling it. In both cases, I was asked to elaborate on why I didn't feel it would work. 

Now, I've actually been someone before recently who's mostly been on the receiving end of rejections, and after getting one too many ""no spark/chemistry"" texts, I wish I could've gotten more honest feedback (If the person had any) to potentially improve future dates. 

So, in both these situations, I was respectfully honest about my reasoning. The first person I felt was too codependent/anxious/low confidence and me constantly feeling like I had to walk on eggshells in fear of saying/doing the wrong thing to hurt his feelings turned me off. The second person was almost the exact opposite of the spectrum: too domineering/aggressive/combative; I felt like they would pick fights for little to no reason and always had to have the loudest opinion regardless of how inappropriate the context. (I said this in a nicer way) 

In both cases, I gave the reasoning and got major pushback: either by telling me why my assessment of them/the situation was wrong or telling me my feelings about them were invalid. It was as if both these people thought they could negotiate attraction/compatibility on my end.

The worst part, and why I'm writing this, is I told the 1st person I was down to be friends in the future. He texted me yesterday morning saying something funny, and I was going to respond to it later. Then, I was with my friends and got another text ""I guess you don't want to talk, I'll see ya"" and decided then and there maybe a friendship isn't the best idea because I felt the codependent aspect hadn't gone away. 

THEN, the next day, I got a Facebook message from him just to make sure I had actually got his text and was choosing to ignore him. That's when I finally responded and told him I felt like he hadn't gotten over the situation and the anxiousness/clinginess was a turn off as friends. He then went on this huge rant about how I could've been more courteous and responded, how maybe I should think before going on multiple dates with someone and leading them on, how he thinks I never actually intended on being friends in the first place, how he still doesn't fully understand exactly the reason I'm not interested, etc. 

He went from ""passive"" to ""passive-aggressive/blaming"" real quick and I spent the night trying to be gentle with my delivery and being fearful I'd set him off. 

This is often why people push the ""no chemistry/spark"" narrative: sometimes that's genuinely what it is, but sometimes it actually IS something you did that put off the other person or made them realize you're incompatible.

If you ask for the honest truth (which the other person isn't entitled to give you anyway), and they give it to you, you have to be able to accept it. Don't ask questions you don't want the answer to: yeah, maybe your photos are too flattering and you're less attractive IRL, maybe you barely asked the other person about themselves, maybe you're too needy/clingy and you need to work on your confidence.

I do believe we had a good connection at one point, she helped me see new perspectives on some of my deepest personal conflicts and I thought it would lead somewhere maybe? 

Perhaps it was actually only my ego telling me it'd lead somewhere. Perhaps I was blinded by love. Perhaps she was merely an idea of a person I manufactured in my head. 

About a month ago we ended contact, as I asked her one final time if she was ready for a relationship or not. She said she cares about me a lot, which I do believe, but was not ready, because she couldn't meet my needs for a relationship: the distance, her depression, and dealing with her family's expectations (we come from different religious/ethnic backgrounds and her family is discriminatory). 

We did have a lot of good conversations and I believe at one point there was a connection, but now that I look back on it, I see that her actions (or lack of) showed that she didn't really care. For example, she put in little effort to hang out in person, didn't say thank you for food and driving when we did hang out, she sent me nudes the day she went out with another dude and let me compliment the outfit she was wearing for that date, after 4 months of talking. The only reason she told me about this other guy was after I confronted her about a hickey on her neck. I invested months, and this other dude gets face to face after a few days of talking. I am very glad we ended it.

Now that I'm looking back on it, I feel like I was just an attention provider (despite her claiming I wasn't) and I feel so stupid that I let myself be played like that. I knew deep down it wasn't going to work, but held on because she made me feel good in some type of way...? 

It is obvious I was some kind of attention/void filler for her,  but it makes me question what kind of void I was trying to fill with myself, to allow being disrespected like that. I feel like such a pushover for not ending it sooner and allowing myself to be treated like that. Am I that desperate and lonely, I'll do anything, including being disrespected, to try and manufacture some type of relationship/partnership?  I don't like to think that I am, as I try to maintain some level of self awareness, and work through my insecurities, while keeping the ego in check. I have been both happy in relationships and happy being single. I have friends, hobbies and I exercise, but still relied on her for some level of happiness.

How do I search for what this void in myself may be, so I don't repeat this pattern in the future? How can I use being played to grow as a person? Was I just blinded by love in this situation?

I’ve (F23) noticed that whenever I start -actually- talking to some new guy, I get icks. Whether it’s about what they say, how they act, what they wear, if they do something bit embarrassing etc., literally anything.
