I only have 4 standards to be fair, and here they are.

-2. Not overweight (like I like the thick muscle/works out bit also maybe doesn't follow a super strict meal plan  look on guys so there's significant flexibility here.)

-4. Makes at least 70k a year or higher (basically within my tax bracket.) Or is in school to eventually make that much.

I do have friends but they are either abroad or far from where I live (live in a small dead town). I crave and enjoy their company but what I mostly need is romantic connection and intimacy.

When I can, I go to the capital city and hang out with a friend. I like her a lot and we usually have a great time together. We mess around and laugh together a lot, but also have deep/meaningful conversations as well. She's as lonely as me but only in terms of friendship and hanging out with anybody platonically... romantically I don't know.
I'm afraid of taking things forward, I'm not good at flirting/seducing girls or at least letting them know that I'm attracted to them without unintentionally looking goofy, weird, creepy or disgusting. Or too innocent/cheesy. 

I've been a loner that suffered social anxiety and crippling depression due to low self-esteem and physical/psychological abuse from other people, during my teenage years. I can say I got better compared to those times, but some of my social/speech skills have yet to be mastered.

I've been rejected a lot lately by other girls in the past 2 years and my self-esteem can only take so much. 

Tired of being rejected everytime despite trying my best and to start all over again with another girl. It just sucks and I'm afraid the same will happen with this girl. 

We have the same age (28) but she has more experience than me (I'm a virgin, despite having had a couple of flings and even a relationship that lasted a couple of months. None of these led to PiV sex and it wasn't by choice)

Before you say that there isn't anything wrong with being a virgin, you're right. But it doesn't matter what you and I think about it. Most people dislike experience, either because they don't want to teach me or because they wonder why I've never managed to attract a member of the opposite sex and fully have sex with them, so it becomes a red flag for them.
Besides all of this, I want love and intimacy just like everybody else. Constant rejections hurt, and the self-doubt/self-hatred that come out of them hurts even more. And I simply don't want to reach 30 years old or 40 years of age without knowing how it feels like to make love to a woman.

What's with all the stereotypes about taller men being more confident, stronger and well endowed(even though height and penis size aren't even correlated)? Is height really such a good thing if shorter people on average live longer? Women on average are shorter than men yet their lifespans are much longer, they're actually healthier too as obesity rates in women are far less than obesity rates in men. What's all this sucking off about height? I know I hate being insulted for something I can't control but if you tell me height is such a big deal, I can list many ways height isn't. For one, physiologically speaking, humans aren't meant to be large creatures. Yes, on average, we are taller than before , but that doesn't mean we are healthier overall. Pollution and microplastics can fuck up our genes and overall health so being taller ain't even a plus. Also if you think taller men are stronger or will better protect you, tell you 6""5 boyfriend to pick a fight with the likes of a prime Mike Tyson, rocky Marciano, Daniel Cormier, khabib nurmagomedov. Heck, even the drunkard Connor McGregor who beated up 6""4 machine gun Kelly (I'm not condoning violence against taller guys but come on, you really think a guy being taller means you'll have an automatic bodyguard? ) Why should I be insecure about height when dating? What's so great about height cus I don't get it. Confidence? There's many other ways to be confident. You can show off your skills as an intelligent programmer, be an artist, play the guitar, allure women with your sexy confidence and if you have a face graced by the gods , charm her with your looks. I mean...tom cruise is short but he's hot imo. Is tom cruise ugly? He still gets women. Will being taller make you any more successful? Why should I be insecure about something I'm not insecure of? If the girl insults you for your height, just remember that the ones who shame you for your body have nothing good to offer and she's also suffering. No one in this world has everything.

I can be chatty. I know I'm not overbearing, like I don't message constantly or anything of the sort, however when I like you - I want to get to know you. Shock horror! Therefore: I want to talk to you. That is plain and simple.

What is up with people playing mind games though? I've noticed men not texting back, despite being online or posting on social media a lot. A lot of posts on this sub I've seen, have been about similar things from men and women.

I wish the (applicable) dating world would quit the bullshit and just be honest. We seem to have adopted this strange sense of psychological manipulation and to what end? - i.e create anxiety for someone in not texting back for so long so that when you do they feel very happy and get more attached (oversimplified the process probably). What's the point though?

You end up with barely any conversation passing and you can't get remotely deep about anything. You barely scratch the surface, and you end up with one person romanticizing the dodgy outline of the person who they imagine the other to be.

You're two people trying to get to know each other... but with the culture that dating has cultivated... of course so many people are struggling with this! I just wish we could all collectively decide to cut out the BS and just... talk. Be open. Be honest. Be upfront. Tell me you like a finger up your ass, you know?! (Abrupt but I hope my point is clear...) Tell me if you feel apprehensive because of the way you've been hurt before! Tell me even though you are headstrong you're nervous at dating.

Don't just put a mask on and play some character built solely on the foundations of societal expectations and are playing that part to merely provide glimpses into who the hell you are as individual. &amp; for goddsake, if you're not that into someone - Tell them! If someone opens up to you, be respectful and honest.

I feel I could rant more about this and other aspects, but I really wanted to know if there are other folks out there thinking similarly? I'm starting to feel like I just can't swim with this current, not in a bad way, more in a 'meh, I'm kinda done with this' kinda way.

End of rant.. I'm sorry folks I just had to get this out there and I don't have anyone to talk to about these things.

I met someone cool by chance: they were one of a team of decorators working on my building and we had some nice chats on the stairs, found we had loads of fabulous stuff in common and were pretty obviously flirting with each other. 

I asked them if they had a partner and they said that they were in a 7-year relationship that was coming to an end, and asked for my number for 'down the line'  and if I'd like to go on a date with them someday. 

I said that if they were single I'd be up for it, but that I'm not looking to be anyone's bad news or to date anyone who would cheat. I have their number and we haven't seen each other since, but I have found myself thinking about them....

The options I am considering are 

1. Do nothing and keep them as a nice fantasy
2. Text them so that they have my number but not escalate anything, leave the ball in their court
3. Text them something flirty, see what happens

I don't usually engage in things there - I mostly like to have a drink, watch, enjoy music or performances if there is some. When we first started dating, I tried to introduce it to her but it quickly became clear she had no experience. I think I jumped in too fast and wasn't thinking of the long term...And quickly realized it wasn't really for her/us. She isn't really the ""type"" to be into this scene naturally and I could tell she had a hard time accepting some aspects of it, so I backed off. I explained to her that I don't think it adds anything to our dynamic but I think she has a hard time separating bdsm from sex (to her they are one and the same but to me there's more to it than just sex). Now it's been almost a year together and I can tell it's caused some resentment in her bc she keeps wanting to be more sexual with me but for some reason I can't bring myself to see her that way...And when I can't, she gets really aggravated and mean. Some of our fights have gotten kinda nasty with name calling and whatnot (like bordering on her being verbally abusive).

She did ask to come with and seems interested but it makes me anxious. There's a strict dress code and I don't know that she'd have something that meets it. And if she does, I'm feeling a little weird about having her there (someone so new to it) that it's almost like pretending? Is that strange? I don't know if I should continue to be with this girl and I don't know what to do. The event is coming up and I'd like to go, but she says she's not comfortable being together unless I start involving her in things. At the same time, I'm torn because I feel like she's giving me an ultimatum and doesn't trust me...

For context, in 2020 I ended a LTR (7 years) and really tried to stick things out for the sake of it. I mean it really wasn't working at all. This to date is the only relationship of any description I've ever had. After that, I kinda wasted the first year of single life. Other than a brief thing with a work colleague who kinda screwed me over, I haven't been on a single date or even messaged anyone in that last year and now as my 30s approach, I am getting slightly nervous. I am under no illusion that it is perfectly possible for me not to meet the right person which is terrifying to say the least. 

It seems pathetic to see it written down but I'm genuinely looking for some form of advice on how to make a start on the dating scene. I've recently started OLD which hasn't gone too well recently, I think mainly because these apps rely on projecting yourself in a good light and that's something I still need to work on. That and I'm struggling to find good photographs of myself worthy of uploading to a dating app. 

On the other hand, the old fashioned notion of cold approaching someone at a bar etc. just seems so creepy to me and I feel that these are the only two options. 

It's also not the case that I am reclusive in any way as I have a front facing role in my job and have plenty of friends etc. It's just that there isn't anyone in any of my circles just now that I am interested in and the idea of the perfect woman coming down from the heavens just isn't gonna wash. 

Any advice on the matter would be greatly appreciated.

There is a weekly profile review post pinned on the Tinder subreddit, and a lot of the profiles are pretty hideous (there are a lot of decent ones, but most are not good). You want pictures that you think would be attractive to the ladies you want to attract. Here are just a few bad things I noticed while browsing through their submissions (and a simple way to improve them)

\- hands in pockets (dont do it)

\- slouched / bad posture (dont do it, practice in front of the mirror on how to stand straight)

\- no smiling pics (this one is hard to improve if you dont have a good natural smile, maybe have a friend record a video of you doing some hobby, then take a frame from the video where you smile naturally)

\- unimpressive shirtless bathroom gym selfies (these might be impressive to your bros, but most girls think Chris Hemsworth and The Rock are natural; if you want to use a gym selfie, one idea would be to use a picture of you mid set of a dumbbell row exercise, make sure your pump fills your shirt)

\- too many sunglasses photos (remove some)

\- blurry photos (retake them)

\- low lighting photos (retake them)

\- other bathroom selfies (if you want to flex your outfit, google ""ootd men"" for more inspiration, and for mirror selfies, dont forget to clean the mirror first)

\- wrinkled suits (tailor them)

I said this 

“ Hey, I’m sorry I didn’t reach out sooner I got stuck in NY. How have you been? “ 

I will actually be back in a couple weeks and I know this is desperate but I thought about saying “I’m actually back if you still wanted to meet up?” 

And if at that point I still get nothing then okay.. I can say I made it to the area and I tried and I can move on. 

Thoughts/suggestions?

I’m in my mid 20s and because I immigrated to the US with my mom when I was younger, I only have her as family. I kind of lost contact with my extended fam back home because we never visited again. I’m an only child as well.

I’m single, good job, live alone, have about 2 good friends, a dog and my only dream really isn’t to have a better career or something crazy. It’s just to have a good husband and make my own family. Now that I’m dating, I feel insecure when I hear guys say they are “family oriented” or they do all sorts of stuff with their parents, aunt, uncles, nieces, nephews, cousins etc. You get the deal. I have no stories or experiences I can share about those because I only have my mom and our relationship suffered after she recently remarried. 

The big ironic thing is, roles reversed, if I were surrounded by family, I don’t even think I would date someone like me who’s pretty much alone. I keep thinking about what would their family think of me. Would they want their son to date someone with no family/good parents? I’m envisioning a wedding full of my partners family, and maybe 2 of my good friends there, which is kinda sad. I promised myself I would treat my partners family like my own when I do find someone. I’ve heard this before from an ex, “I felt like I had to be everything for you”. It was said in good faith as he really did love me and knew my situation. I know some guys would also say that if I don’t have family, I might be clingy as I didn’t grow up with good relationships.

I need a bit of help here, because I'm struggling.

I've recently started going out out in pubs/clubs again with friends. Yeah, I'm single, but the people I'm out with aren't on the same vibe that I am; they don't really have any desire to find somebody so they never accompany me in approaching women. 

Still, there are looks over in our direction or something and I'll really want to go over. Sometimes, I don't and I'll miss the opportunity for two reasons that I'll outline below:

* **I worry about looking like an idiot or something because they can't hear me due to the loud music;** you can't hear each other speak at first, so you have to repeat yourself**.** 
* **I don't know what to say.** Should I just go over and ask if they want a drink? Something else?

I used to be someone who would frequently initiate conversation with women in bars a few years ago, I had my brother and our mutual friends there and there was a shared goal among us of finding someone. The thing is, I would always make up an excuse to go over such as 'We look a bit stupid standing here on our own, mind if we join you?', rather than asking them outright if they'd want a drink.

It's like the knack of it has deserted me a little bit due to rustiness. What do I say? How do I get around the loud music/not being able to be heard thing?

I would really appreciate some perspective other than my biased ones on my dates with a girl I kinda fell for since the first moment I saw her.

So I had 2 dates now with a girl I met on a dating app. The first date was a few days ago and totally awesome - we vibed from the beginning to the end and the date lasted for 6 hours!
We immediately planned the next date also. She said afterwards she really looked forward to seeing me again for a second date and was extremely enthusiastic about it!

Today was the second date. It was way shorter than the first one and she seemed a bit distant from the beginning on. Also when I asked her if she is free in the next few days she said she would have lots of plans already and we would need to do it spontaneos and she would text me.
And what really puts me off is that she suggested that we could meet in a group of people. Kinda seems like she just wants to be friends or is she maybe seeing other guys too? Especially since she told me yesterday we couldnt meet because she has so much work to do, but today she told me she went out clubbing yesterday...

I am kind of confused about how it all went since she was so enthusiastic on the first date and now on the second date it seemed like I forced her to spend time with me.

Now, more than 2 months ago I decided to tell her that I liked her, because I did, so the feelings kinda got back again from that one time, or maybe they just showed up because we are so close together and we always talk for hours, and since some time ago we started flirting as a joke, then it got serious. Now that I had clear in my head that I liked her things were starting to get weird for me, so I decided to confess that I liked her and she did not say the same thing, neither that she did too, but I knew that she liked me. Later she made very clear that she liked me too, so we just started going on dates and talking everyday, but not as best friends anymore. I saw her some days in december, then we did not see each other for more than a month until yesterday. This whole thing of not seeing each other for some weeks really turned off our relationship and I thought I also lost my feelings for her, since she did not tried to at least send me a text, and I always was the one that had to start our chatting, and was leaving me on read. I'm not really sure what happened to her feelings for me, she said she wanted to take things slow, so we did. But I just don't feel anything for her anymore and I have been actively trying not to hang out with her at school. I feel bad, and I know I should. I really can't lie to her face and say that everything is okay, because it isn't. She came to me today and we just chit chatted a bit and she asked me what was happening with me, I told her I didn't know and she left after saying bye. I'm afraid I had or will have this friendship to end. I really don't have any feelings for her anymore, and that is something I don't understand. I'm gonna apologize, and just say that we should better stay like friends, that I'm really sorry and I hope she forgives me. 
Any advice on what happened or what to tell her?

I've never regretted dating her, it was only after the break-up did the regret unknowingly creep into me. When I texted her I tried my best not to blame her at all, after all we were kids at the time, what really gave me the closure was that she told me that she didn't know what she was doing either, I've always thought of her as someone who was more emotionally mature than I was and that I was just the dumbest kid in town and that was reinforced by our then collective friends being overzealous for her or other kids just being brutal for the sake of being brutal, I'm sad to say that some of those kids aren't even alive today and some of them didn't even see adult-hood.

when she first replied I had a brief flash of despair but quickly reeled it in because I had initiated this conversation, now I can say I can kiss the sun and it'd blush like a nun was told a dirty joke, my sense of self worth is almost whole now, I feel like I can live. I've been crying happily all morning, this is likely the best thing to happen to me as most of my life I've been given the short end of the stick.

Lots of thoughts here! I have always been open with my dates about not feeling chemistry, or not being interested in seeing them again. And I assumed someone who was a bit older would be more mature and up front with me about not being interested. So it’s really annoying he’s doing this. Agreeing to keep things casual isn’t a free pass to treat someone like an object.

Second, how do you disentangle your self worth from rejection? I know I’m hot and smart and kind, and most people would feel lucky if I looked their way. I enjoy my alone time and I’m very independent and have a solid friend group. And yet with a recent breakup, and this guy fading me out, I feel totally worthless.
