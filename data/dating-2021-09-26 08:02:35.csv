On instagram I asked guy a question about a drink that he posted about by replying to his story update. I asked if it‚Äôs really all natural and he went to look information of the product from their website for me and copy pasted to me. Then he was like it‚Äôs a really great drink lol.

Then I said to him that I don‚Äôt really believe companies own advertisements. Then he sent me 7 line of text how companies can't lie about those information etc. at the end he was like it‚Äôs a great company and he buys natural products from there. 

He sounded really smart (used big words and gave thoughtful replies)

Interesting thing is that he knows that I work in the healthcare field. He was talking about how other energy drinks are bad for your ‚Äùsystem‚Äù. Also he isn‚Äôt the type of guy that would buy natural products and really emphasize it.. by the way the company that he talked about was a superfood company.

1,pvtzaq,1632663405,Characteristics of a good (online) conversation,"After having numerous conversations on dating apps here is what I have learned are the properties of a great conversation:

**Depth**: Good conversation tends to have depth, meaning the replies from both parties are detailed and descriptive. They tend to be longer, have multiple parts, and are emotional. eg ""My morning was great! I just made some pancakes and they turned out to be perfect. Too bad I ran out of Nutella :(. How is your Sunday coming along?"" as opposed to ""Great. Just had breakfast. You?""

**Convergence**: A great conversation has replies that tend to converge when discussing a topic ie the time taken to reply by both parties progressively reduces over time eg she replies in 1 hour, he replies in 45 minutes, she replies in 35 minutes, and so on. This is obviously not hard and fast and can periodically diverge because we are all busy with our lives but some level of convergence shows that you are interested in them and vice versa.

**Media**: As they say a picture is worth a thousand words. Sharing pictures/audio/memes/links when used strategically takes the conversation to a whole another level, especially if is original content. 

**An anchor**: I have seen a great pickup line or icebreaker doesn't really cut it for me. It usually takes an anchoring topic that both parties dive into for a short while until they become comfortable with each other. It could be a shared like/dislike, current event, etc eg moving into a new apartment, getting a new pet, a recent celeb scandal - anything that gets both the parties talking freely.

**Humour/banter**: This one goes without saying but it is so important that it shouldn't be left out. I personally have never seen a good convo where there weren't some jokes/ribbing/sarcasm/jokes/lols. 

**Natural**: The minute you try to force a conversation you make it worse. Sometimes it is better to just let it go. Talk less, change the topic, change the rhythm, and if nothing works just stop. If it feels like an interview or interrogation you are doing it wrong.

5,pvufxd,1632664980,Got her number but leaving soon,"Last Friday I (23M) met this girl (23F) at a small party and to be embarrassingly honest I was too hyped up to have time to flirt with her or even talk that much to her 1-on-1. I did vibe with her a lot and we had a decent amount in common. I've never had to think about this in my life since I've had the same girlfriend all throughout college until now so I lack experience anyway.

I have her number when everyone passed their phones around for everyone else's socials as like a formality, and I don't really know what's right and how I should approach this. I definitely wanna get to know her more but I have absolutely no clue how she feels about me or dating or anything.  

I'm pretty bad with women in general and I've only really ever had one proper (bad) relationship; I can be manically self-conscious and opinionated so it's hard to be ""open and honest"" with some of my homies let alone a stranger that I'm tryna hit on. 

Big problem too is that when I leave town in a few weeks I probably won't be back. We're from the same hometown so we'll be able to meet after that but it feels a little pointless and irresponsible to see her a couple of times just to get into a half-assed LDR. It feels like I'm thinking too far ahead but I don't want her to see my ""endgame"" as just to get laid or have a fling before I leave because that's really not what I care about.

I don't wanna lay everything out there right off the gate like ""I'm leaving town, I kinda like you, let's go on a few dates before I leave and we can catch up again when we're both home"" (or maybe that's a good idea...?) Not like I have a huge crush on her after one party but I'm not about to deprive myself of opportunities either.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pvufxd/got_her_number_but_leaving_soon/

I've got a hidden folder in my phone full of half naked and full on nudes of myself. I'm a fit muscular guy who is moderately handsome, especially for my age in my 30s.

Lately, I've noticed an uptick in the type of pictures on Tinder profiles where 4 or 5 are focused almost entirely on the person's body (workout shots, swimsuit shots, lingerie shots, cleavage shots) and there's maybe two good quality normal daily life pictures. You read the profile, and it's a good read, the person will be something like a teacher or a marketing manager at a sizeable company, and the person expresses their desire to find a relationship and is not interested in anything less or more casual. To me, regardless of what your profile says, though, if your profiles are going to primarily market your body, then I can't really see how you're going to find success in matches who aren't interested in anything beyond superficial/sex-based. That is, unless you are hoping to match back with another superficially-focused profile, but I would think this goes for guys, too -- If I loaded up my profile with shirtless selfies and pictures of me in my boxer briefs, I don't think I would expect anyone to think I was there for anything but getting laid. One or two pictures like that could get that point across, but you're still inviting a certain kind of attention your profile indicates it wants to ward off.

Primarily I see it on Tinder of course, but I see it a lot more on dating apps, too.

First date was lunch,1x1, was great. I noticed she is very much a hugger which is nice. 

2nd date was last night, and it was intense. Crazy good Italian dinner, comedy club. Laughs and vibes galore! She had her hand on my thigh and on my arm. Very possessive and alpha which I like. At midnight she invited me back to her apartment (which she said she never does) and also has told me that I make her very vulnerable and it's very unlike her. I am flattered of course.

Nothing sexual happened, but we had both talked our love language being physical touch. As we sat on the couch, she put her legs on my lap and I gave her a massage, to which she  was very happy about. We talked for 2 hours and then she invited me to go to bed and stay the night. We hopped in bed and she put her hand on my chest and fell asleep on me - pretty much intertwined all night. I didn't sleep a wink lol. I was just riding that dopamine high. I genuinely enjoy every second I have with this girl. 

She's expressed fears about me going back to my ex-wife, to which I've belayed because there is no way in hell that would ever happen. But now I'm wondering, am I being love bombed? Or is this just genuine chemistry by two 30-somethings who have both been through divorce (hers being much less recent, \~3 years). The cuddling was very much consensual  and wanted on both ends, and it was only our 2nd date. I honestly felt 100% comfortable with it and didn't feel that there were any bad intentions. She is very sweet and open, and  seemingly smitten by me, and me her. Perhaps NOTHING is wrong at all, and this is just the  beginning of a blossoming relationship. One could hope! I can safely say on my end she checks all the boxes physically and emotionally. I am not in lust like I've been with other girls I've dated - this one is very, very different.

Now I dont know who actually started but it happened. I had to leave early so the chat ended. I only learned her first name. I saw her only once after that in a hall and we just said hello while smiling. 

I (think) managed to find her social media even though I dont know her last name. I found her through mutuals and school facebook groups she is most probably a part of. I dont want to message her because it might seem creepy that I found her even though it was easy. However my experience with her so far is that she likes me even though she knows nothing about me (so its probably just physical attraction so far). She looks good and from our short conversation she seems cool.

What do you think? How should I proceed? Should I talk to her next time I see her? Message her? Ask her to message me?

I have mild cerebral palsy and I'm aware that's not something women find attractive. I'm a bit upset about it, but I try to live with that. I have been rejected my whole life and it basically replaced my self-confidence with self-doubt.  


I have a stable job now and I'm looking good in terms of career prospects. I'm taking care of myself too. While dating, I'm trying to be nice to women I met, but I'm also aware that being nice doesn't build attractions and I feel like I'm a bit fucked up when it comes to dating.  


I feel like every woman I will ever met will always have better options  than me.  


You could say that my attitiude is the problem, but I'm enormously afraid of rejection and I'm working on that with counseling.  


Any additional advice for me?  


I know that probably I will need to gain some confidence, but its hard when you are rejected every time you try.  The last time was a week ago and now I'm going to rest a bit, but I need some advices for the future conquests. :P

I have only been on 2 dates because we both work M-F and she seems to be kinda hard to get her out. After our first date she told me she really liked me and  couldn't wait to see where things go. I told her i had fun and i was looking forward to seeing where things go. After the second date about 2 -3 weeks later she told she ""loved"" me and im an amazing guy. Ok so after hearing this i thought it was kinda soon but on the other hand im 36 and im tired of the bullshit girls play so i told her i really like her and i love where things are going. We Snapchat eachother alot and th as ts our preferred method she calls me on the phone on her way home from work and even texts me good morning and that she misses me and loves me and all that but its been 3 months we've only seen eachother 2 times but talk every day. So last week i told her im getting feelings for her and i could see myself being with you she agreed and told me she loves me so much and all this. But i been noticing she only shows me attention M-F during work and she will call me on her way home but when she gets home she pulls it back a bit leaves me on read til next morning and seems enthusiastic when she texts. The problem is on the weekends she seems to ignore me and take along time to text back or respond.  All theese mixed feeling and confusion i have i dont know what to do. She told me shes not used to being treated good and her last guy abused her but thats not me and im not like that and im afraid im being to nice but I really like her and wouldn't mind being her boyfriend but she doesn't act the same and doesn't show me the same attention during the weekends when were both off and have more time.. i dont know why she says things like i love you and my love is real and she is slow to respond latley and ignores me leaves me on delivered or read..

32,pvw34c,1632670219,Giving a relationship time to grow. Do you believe to be true?,"Long story short, me (29M) and this girl (24F) get on really well (dating 4 weeks), we're both attracted to one another, share the same values etc etc, but she said felt something wasn't 'clicking'. I said i felt the same and it's just an issue of timing the more comfortable we get with one another and we weren't at the point where we'd had too many deep convos. She said she expected to feel more emotionally attached (after 4 weeks) and i said it normally takes me 2-3 months to be fully emotionally attached to someone. Longest she's ever dated someone is 4 months and has never been in a relationship. We ended things mutually because i said my walls go up when someone is unsure. It's a shame really because there was nothing fundamental that was wrong and it's a shame things ended when it wasn't really given a chance to flourish.

41,pvwgls,1632671421,Troubles maintaining erection when putting on a condom after being a virgin for a long time - insights?,"So my problem is pretty common from what I read around but still figured I'd ask in case someone has some tips to offer. When we're making out with my GF, I have no trouble getting hard and when she does a blowjob or a handjob, my erection is 100% normal, just as I'm used to when, say, masturbating. It happens naturally, easily, the erection is strong and does not go away easily. When we're about to have sex though, no matter how hard I was beforehand, when I reach for condoms it starts getting flaccid basically right away. We've tried keeping the condoms right at hand, not doing that, her giving me a BJ while I'm fiddling with it, what have you - the result is almost always the same. The erection gets way weaker or disappears totally, I put the condom on and then we need to work at it quite a bit to get it up again - and even then, it's not _as_ up as it was without the condom. Enough to have sex but not nearly something I'm used to with my penis, especially considering how hot the situation is and how much we're obsessed with each other and how much I'd like to give her the best sex ever.

So in all honesty I think it's mainly just nerves. I've been a virgin for over 28 years of my life and she's my first GF so even though we've had sex on multiple occasions now over the span of the couple months we're together (probably totalling like 20-30 times over a few meetings) and I feel 100% safe and aroused around her, there probably still is some stress in the back of my mind which causes this. Still, maybe someone has some tips to offer? Is time the only medicine here and we should just progress normally, fighting with my penis most of the times, and wait till the act of sex itself gets so normal and everyday to me that it stops being such a big deal and it resolves on its own? Maybe someone was a virgin for such a long time too and can offer their perspective? I don't watch porn, stopped masturbating since I met her, and yet quite often getting my D ready for action feels like work. We did have a couple good encounters when it happened with no problems and my erection was strong as normal but these were few and far between sprinkled on the regular problematic sex.

50,pvx4do,1632673571,Why do guys in college only want sex/never want to date me?,"Almost all the guys I've been involved with have never liked me emotionally or cared much for me either. They always want to get with me physically and I always thought to myself that it was because I was a senior in high school scrolling on tinder so I stopped and told myself I'd wait in college to organically meet a boy. Now, I'm in college, organically meeting boys...who also definetely don't want to be my boyfriend or explore that but are very eager to have sex with me. It's not just random boys like on tinder either. My most recent was with a guy I considered a friend. Everyone thought of him as the good friend who could never be a douche and so did I. After a party he kissed me and we made out on my bed. We did the same thing the next day, but because we were going so fast (top off) I was very straightforward and asked him if this was a hookup or if he actually liked me. After giving me (many) nonanswers I straight up asked him ""Can I tell you what I think you're thinking and you can agree or disagree?"" He goes yes and I say ""I think you are willing to hook up with any girl but because I'm a friend it'll feel especially good to you and you want that."" He kinda hesitates but then goes yeah that's where my heads at. I say I don't do hookups and I think we should just stay friends and I let him out of my room and we don't talk much for a day but we get to becoming good friends throughout the week because I respected that we were just looking for different things. Fast forward to this weekend, I get kind of tipsy and he gets really handsy (I'm not drunk) and we talk about cuddling again. We go to his room and start kissing but I go ""No stop I told you I don't do hookups if you like me take me on a date"" and he goes (he's sober btw) ""yeah I like you so much we should do it we should go on a date how about sunday"", so I keep kissing him. However, the next day we go to another party and he's really handsy with another girl. I get super drunk and sad about it and my friend takes me back to our dorm and talks about how he told her that we had a history and I'm so confused about what's going on. Later that night after sobering up I ask him what his intentions are again because if they were to date me he'd be acting differently like planning a date or figuring out a time we'd go out (sunday is tomorrow and I haven't heard anything yet) and he talks about how eager I am to define things (kind of gaslighting me to say I overthink.) And I ask, ""Was there even any emotion and was it a hookup again last night?"" and he goes yeah there wasn't a lot of emotion and it was more like a hookup for me. That kind of devastated me because, unlike the first time, this time he blatantly said what he knew I wanted to hear to get what he wanted. This is just the most recent and most traumatic case because I know most guys in college are this way and it just came to a head.

&gt;she texts me, not to set up a date, but to tell me she isn't ready to date again because she's still recovering from her last relationship. She had mentioned this relationship before months prior, didn't go into great detail but implied that it was abusive.
&gt;tried to reassure me by saying she still wants to start something with me, but that she needs more time.
&gt;still continues to talk to me like normal, still gives me a kiss on the cheek when saying goodbye at the end of every shift 

Needless to say, I'm feeling pretty conflicted. On one hand I feel like I'm being strung along: first she used her mom as an excuse, then as soon as mom was gone she came up with something else. On the other hand, she continues to act the same toward me and the fact that she had brought up her past relationship months prior leads me to believe she isn't lying about it. However, even if she is telling the truth, how do I handle it? Wait around for a month or 6 until she's ready to date? Hold out hope for something that may never materialize and potentially end up wasting my time/emotional energy? At the moment I'm just trying to focus on my own obligations/goals and not think about her too much, but it's hard when I see her 2-3 days a week at work. 

Anyway, what do you guys think about my situation, from an outside perspective? Should I just give up on her altogether? Perhaps there's some users here who have been through abusive relationships and have a better idea of what she's going through? Perhaps she's just lying?

We had a pretty good first conversation. She said a had a nice handshake, laughed at stuff I said that I personally thought weren‚Äôt funny and kept brushing/putting her hair to the side. When I realized I didn‚Äôt know where I was when we were talking, she asked me what dorm I was in and offered to walk with me back, and so we did. She also said I could practice tennis with her and her friend next time we have tennis club.

We only have tennis club once a week and I was just wondering how do I get to know her more? How do I compliment her and how often should I do it? Also when is the right time to ask her to hangout or go on a date? She is always with a friend at tennis club. 

I really like this girl and I heard the best thing when you like a girl is to be friends with her first and get to know her. I never really had any friends until college and all advice is appreciated.

I matched with this woman recently. We chat A LOT on the app. I've never chatted with someone so much before. At first I asked her out for coffee (I usually just basic chit chat and then ask), but she said she wants to get to know me better on the app first. No worries.

I have this weird vibe from her. I know she's not a scammer or anything.

The thing about her is: if I don't reply quickly, she'll call me out on it. ""Hey I thought we were vibing, but it looks like I'm a little more engaging in responding.""

She says stuff like this even if she texted at 10 pm when I'm falling asleep, and I didn't get back to it until 10 am when I first start my day.

Or she'll say ""cat got your tongue?""

I'm obviously desperately lonely, so I know I'm not in a healthy place, but it's this weird vibe that I can't really shake.

I met her at a music class and she seemed interested in me. We talked and played the guitar together for a little bit and before she left, she asked me for my number and gave me hers. I figured I'd scored a possible interest and thought I'd message her in a day or two, only to receive a message from her later that same day, telling me how much fun she had with me. She said she'd love to see me again, she'd love to play the guitar with me again, and we talked for a couple of hours.

74,pvzggl,1632681059,Is Mental Health a good reason to break up with someone? Black Female (29yrs),"  **^(\*Asian men highly encouraged to reply with their experiences with self-hate/identity issues while dating.)**

  ***So I've going through quite a bit......***  I got into a relationship in June (*we met on Hinge and had been talking since May*), he broke up with me in August because he had self-hate issues and felt like he needed to work on himself (he's Asian and used to talk about how he struggled with his identity growing up in a white high school/being bullied but also not feeling apart of the Asian community due to the 'hierarchical' behaviors of some?) and he's been going through a transition, from being unemployed, to being employed at a job he hated, to moving, then me coming into his life ""unexpectedly"". During our relationship he got a new job &amp; quit the other one he hated, I supported him and cheered him on through it because he was visibly struggling.

  When we broke up we both cried because we really liked each other. I was shocked when he cried as hard as he did. I didn't know I had that big of an effect on him. I understood. Sometimes it's hard to heal yourself while in a relationship. It works differently for different people. In a way, I feel like he felt he didn't deserve me because he would constantly mention how ""maturely"" I would handle things and how his exes would've yelled at him or would've caused a big argument. It hurt me seeing him hurt. I think I took it harder than I thought because I was ready to set my commitment issues aside and give this relationship a chance. He also didn't want kids. I want to have my own kids OR even better, adopt. (2 weeks prior I probed a question about future goals because I was having cold feet with meeting the rest of his friends..... I wanted to make sure he knew I was serious about being with him and I wanted to make sure he felt the same.)

  We're still friends because we both value each other and don't want to pretend like we never met, even though feelings are still lingering on my end (lol I'm healing though, slowly but surely).

&amp;#x200B;

  **Fast forward a month later**, I'm in college for my fall semester. I had to drop a class because it was clashing with my other classes. During this time my uncle was sent to the hospital with liver failure. He coded twice, two weeks apart from each other. The first time they broke his ribs. I've always been in denial about his health. This man has had 1 aneurysm, 2 strokes and 2 heart attacks in the past 4 years. Each time I was like ""*he's going to live, he'll make it through.*"" and each time he did. This time I was more hesitant, it was different. I knew it was his time. I mentally told him it's okay to let go (since he couldn't talk &amp; I couldn't be there, I would have conversations with him and sent it out into the universe). He became stable and I ended up dropping the rest of my classes because it became too stressful due to a mix up with an academic counselor I had previously talked to. So what did I do to relieve the stress I was under?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

  **I WENT ON A DATE!** I was hesitant to date this guy in the beginning because my luck in dating apps hasn't been the greatest, but he convinced me and I was like eh, why not........  (I should've gone with my gut). The 1st date went well, 2nd date went well, 3rd date..... I started noticing some patterns. He would constantly joke about weird things happening to him whenever he was with me. Essentially blaming me for strange things that would happen to him. At first it was funny but then it was getting really old really fast. Second, ***he doesn't let opinions BE.*** If you have an opinion he questions it. Which isn't a bad thing at all, but when you start trying to ""correct"" my opinion or challenge my belief system that doesn't harm other people in any way (e.g. Marvel is better than DC, I prefer to give a homeless man food than giving him money.) that's when I'll start to have an issue with you. It felt like I was being talked 'at' whenever I answered a question. Almost like a child, it didn't feel like equal communication. Speaking of such. We had a debate about equality vs fairness in the car.........  \*blinks\* Lol......... the context was kids and how I wanted them to be raised equally or fairly or whatever, he felt compelled to say ""most people confuse equality with fairness and I don't understand *whomp whomp whomp whomp*"" lol, then he talked about how he wanted a maid to help out around his house, we got on the topic of immigration/slavery (e.g Haitians being whipped at the border)  **which eventually** **led to him** **asking me what the difference was between a slave and a maid............ AT DINNER.** When I tell you guys I saw a few heads turn in a predominately white space in my peripheral vision lmaoooo. In that moment I checked out mentally and got tense because I was uncomfortable with talking about that in public. It caught me off guard. I couldn't look at him. I was just looking straight ahead at the sunset while eating my food. I ALSO DIDN'T WANT TO DEBATE IT, IT'S NOT A DEBATABLE TOPIC. A SLAVE WAS TAKEN AGAINST THEIR FUCKING WILL PERIOD. It was like he was trying to seem smart by asking that. Everything I said he felt the need to philosophize. Even starting off with his responses with ""Well I don't believe in that"" and would explain why while trying to convince me to agree with him. Like okay cool, next subject. I don't like to keep talking about things if I disagree with the other person because ***I BELIEVE*** the conversation will go nowhere but in circles.

Last week I received a call that my uncle died that morning. (At this point I had no tears left since I was sporadically crying the first week I found out he was in the hospital). I felt peace because he was able to finally be at peace. Not only was I grieving but I was trying to get over my ex &amp; date this new guy. THEN this Gabby Petito case happened and I started looking for signs of narcissism in this new guy because he actually made a joke about narcissism on the 3rd date so that was freaking me out as well lol. I finally came to the conclusion that I am NOT ready for a new relationship. I honestly think I'm done with dating in general after this.

&amp;#x200B;

  **SOOOOOOOO WITH THAT I CALLED HIM 2 DAYS AGO AND TOLD HIM I WANTED TO STOP SEEING HIM!!! :D**

  **You want to know what his response was?  I told him I didn't want to heal into someone else and become co-dependent on him (which is true, I felt like I was still healing and I didn't want him to feel like he needed to carry the weight of that).** In a condescending tone he basically said he ""doesn't believe in that"" apparently mental health isn't a good reason to stop seeing someone. According to him relationships start off with co-dependency and that's how relationships strengthen. ***^(Note: His ex fianc√© left him without saying a word for an entire year due to her mental health and NOW I probably see why.)*** He said mental health is always going to be there no matter what (which is true, not gonna deny that). But for *me*, **starting off a relationship this way isn't healthy**, at least in my eyes. Do I have to explain why? NO. I should not feel like I have to over-explain myself ESPECIALLY to this dude. Which is what I felt like every time he questioned my entire existence lol. Before I felt really bad for discontinuing with dating him, but his response reminded me of why I was doing it in the first place along with me clearly not being ready.

  Plus with his tendency to talk to me like I haven't experienced life is annoying (he's 2 years younger than me) and I feel like his words will add onto my depression eventually. That sounds harsh, but when he spoke to me ***I didn't feel good***. He said ""we'll yeah if you want to do the things you want to do in the future what's the point in dating right now? What the hell are you dating for you know?"" **he seems like he always has to get the last word in most of the time.** He could be mentally stimulating to some, but not to me. At the same time I'm trying to make sure I'm not mistaking his possible bluntness for toxicity. That's why I had to leave because I couldn't tell if some of these were red flags or if I was being overly sensitive due to me being in a vulnerable state, but I didn't want to stick around to find out later. My therapist mentioned that our values may not just be aligned but, there's something else there, I felt it in my body when being around him.

  Anyway, throughout this issue I started comparing my past relationship to this guy, because with the first guy I dated we voiced our opinions, respected them and moved on to the next subject. Ate food and binge watched my favorite TV show without either of us feeling weird or endlessly debating over it. When we talked about complex subjects it was MUTUAL listening and responding. He was patient with me as I was with him. We both enjoyed silence together. I loved that we could do our own thing TOGETHER in his room. GREAT TEXTER. Good Morning texts every other morning. I looked forward to spending my days with him. Cooking together. Being goofy. Playfully flirting with each other. I miss that. I want that. Not as a honeymoon phase and not necessarily with him. I want it all of the time. Even when me and my partner aren't feeling our best.

  I actually told the first guy I dated something similar during our breakup and he made a joke saying I sounded like I was giving him a Yelp review LOL. I also know this post was very lengthy but I had to get this off of my chest because dating is frustrating. I JUST started using dating apps THIS YEAR.

75,pvzp1d,1632681803,"How to pursue this girl going forward, did I mess things up?","Hey guys, i'm a 23 year old college student who is currently talking to a 20 year old college student, and i'm wondering if I missed my chance with this girl.

Backstory: Back in April, I met this girl at one of my friends parties, we hit it off well and we ended up making out that night. Before the semester ended, she came over to smoke at my place and we made out some more. The semester ended and we both left to go home for the summer, so I wasn't able to see her for a few months, we kept a little contact talking to each other once a month or so. I usually only text to set up dates/hangouts but she initiated and I knew I wasn't going to be able to see her for a few months so I wanted to keep some contact. Anyways, the semester started a month ago and she came over once after a party for about 45 minutes, we made out some more, but she left earlier than I anticipated so I wasn't able to go for sex. About a week and a half later I texted her saying I wanted to take her out, she agreed and I took her to a place for sushi. The date went really well, and after dinner she came back to my place, and we started making out, and after a few minutes of this I asked her if she wanted to go into my room. She said yes but seemed a little shy and said ""I like kissing you"" which kind of threw me off a little. Anyways, we get to my room and lay on my bed, I start feeling her up and it starts getting a little heavy, but she keeps pulling away because she got a new piercing on her septum the week prior, and my nose kept on hitting it. After this happened a few times I said that we didn't have to keep it up if it was hurting her. I also was getting the impression that it was as far as she was willing to go. So we eventually stopped, but ended up making out a little more afterwards before the night ended and when I dropped her off at her place we kissed some more. I told her I liked spending time with her and she said she does too and had a really great time that night. Now here's the thing, I hit her up the next monday (our date was the prior wednesday) to see when she was free that week and she took a lot longer to respond to me than she usually does. She apologized and said that she was busy with school projects and that she had friends and family coming for the weekend so maybe next week, I said ok and the next tuesday after I texted her saying that I wanted to make her dinner over at my place, she replied a day later saying that she was heading to a musical festival for the weekend and couldnt do anything this week either. My question to you guys is, did I blow my chance with her by trying to escalate towards sex too soon? I don't want her to get the impression that i'm only after her for sex, I really enjoy her company. However, she knows that I want to have sex, so will she be more hesitant to hangout with me? What should my pursuit from here on out be? I was thinking about just waiting for her to reach out to me.

She said she had a dream last night that she dress up as Sami the guy she has a crush on she said in her dream he thought she was creepy and weird she's worried he'll think that her crush and obsessed with him is creepy. She and her friend roleplay as them on Instagram she pretends she's married to Sami in the roleplays and her friend is married to Razzle. Maybe she's just getting overwhelmed by it and excited she's gonna see her idol and crush in concert.

# 

I am a 19 YO male with ASD and I am currently in college. I've been trying to make connections with some females, but I think it is not going very well. I got their snapchats but I had to recently delete the app because I was not getting any more responses from any of the girls I was talking to. It seems like every time I try to talk to a girl it just falls a part before we can even have a friendship, I just want to know how I can maintain a healthy friendship with a girl and find someone who likes me for who I am and actually wants to talk to me.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pw0e33/how_to_find_the_right_girl_for_me/

I kinda complimented him on that just being nice and polite about it but it made me not find him sexually attractive, I guess I just liked him as a friend.

Usually I‚Äôll match with a guy and if the conversation is going well he‚Äôll usually ask for my number or give his number for me to text. As soon as we start texting its like I‚Äôm talking to a completely different guy. The responses get further apart, short uninterested responses, and eventually they stop replying all together. 

Why does this happen? Its happened to 6 guys so far and I‚Äôm confused of why. If you exchange numbers doesn‚Äôt that mean you want to talk more and there‚Äôs mutual interest?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pw0i5c/conversation_always_dies_after_exchanging_numbers/

87,pw0n1v,1632684769,After Date Depression,"Recently I found out that there are different attachment styles. Well I found out mine is anxious. So I had a first date and I really liked the guy and he even asked me on a second one. Even though it hasn‚Äôt been a full day yet he hasn‚Äôt texted me at all today. Which is a bit unusual for him. Right after the date, I instantly started thinking about how dumb I was to even think that someone would like me. Shortly after feeling this way I got a text and he had asked me out. Today I woke up to no messages from him and he didn‚Äôt even reply to the last one I had sent. Now I am feeling very very foolish. Like maybe he asked me on a second date to pity me. I ended up sleeping until 2 PM today because I felt so bad about myself. And I just have this overwhelming feeling of disappointment as if I was going to cry. When I really like someone I start to get really anxious and I need reassurance that everything is OK. Does anyone else have after date depression? I do suffer from depression and anxiety but after dates it just triggers a depressive episode as well. Then I start to overthink things, deleting dating apps and avoiding conversation with friends.

2nd idea is she‚Äôs never had a massage so I was going to plan out a massage for an hour that day, then go to dinner etc have cake later and hangout. 

I was planning on spending around 100$ but the massage plan is around like 200$ money isn‚Äôt really a good issue for me but I also don‚Äôt want to ‚Äúbuy‚Äù her love.

I have dated but sadly never went past a 5th date and I often take long breaks from dating because I find it emotionally exhausting. In fact about almost 2 years ago a dating failure lead me to having mu first and only panic attack and I have not developed proper feelings for another person ever since or even had a lot of fun on a date. I guess what im trying to say is being 23 and having pretty much no relationship experience has left me feeling a little hopeless (espessially since a lot of people I know my age are are relationships or have been in ones in there teens) and hearing success stories from people who entered there first relationship in there 20s would be nice.

93,pw15bn,1632686427,Myth: Women have a hard time getting noticed on dating apps - BUSTED,"I made this as a reply comment on someone else‚Äôs post but I think it‚Äôs worth its own post.

Average to above-average looking ladies claiming how hard it is to get guys to show interest in them on a dating app, put up or shut up. I can put up.

Just on OkCupid alone, since April, I have over 5,000 Likes. FIVE THOUSAND! I‚Äôm average to better-than-average in looks. A friend I trust says that with makeup, hair, outfit, etc. I‚Äôm a 7.

Many of the guys showing interest are on a higher attractiveness level than I am.

You have to pay money to see the numbers and I stopped my subscription awhile ago, but if someone wants to see a screenshot for proof of this, PayPal me $33CDN to re-subscribe and I‚Äôll take screenshots of my OkCupid numbers for you.

I‚Äôm not saying all, most, half, or even *quite some* are men I‚Äôd be interested in dating. I‚Äôm not saying I have 5,000+ ‚Äúquality‚Äù men to choose from. (By ‚Äúquality‚Äù, I mean gamer nerd dudes who keep clean and relatively fashionable. I want a gamer nerd dude, not a neckbeard. Not every gamer nerd dude is or *has to be* a neckbeard. You *absolutely* can be a nice looking gamer nerd dude.)

I‚Äôm *also* not saying that *anyone*, men *or* women, has to date *every person who clicks Like on them*. Shove your strawmen arguments up your chocolate whizzway.

Just *don‚Äôt for a minute* let some average to above-average woman *anywhere* tell you it‚Äôs hard for her to get attention on dating apps. 5,000+ Likes since April prove otherwise. What she *should* say is it‚Äôs hard to get attention from the *types of men she‚Äôs most interested in*. *That‚Äôs* a perfectly fine, fair, and realistic complaint.

I‚Äôm not saying any woman deserves or *doesn‚Äôt* deserve whatever attention she *wants*. You deserve whatever you‚Äôre truly worth and there‚Äôs no way I would know that nor do I *claim* to know that.

I just got sick of this bullshit myth that ‚Äúgirls have a hard time dating‚Äù. No, they have a hard time dating *guys they want*.

And because I know people would wonder, most of the guys I swiped right on either became uninterested in me because I‚Äôm too much of a dork and I‚Äôm too affectionate out-of-the-gate, which is *totally fair*, they can like what they want, they don‚Äôt owe me *anything*. Or they were Nigerian scammers. I have proof of that *too* for those who think I‚Äôm lying.

No, I won‚Äôt give out my personal identifying info on here or my pictures for judgment. I don‚Äôt owe anyone here that.

Want more of my dating anecdotes? You can DM me and I‚Äôll see what I‚Äôm interested in talking about.

But there you go. Myth *busted*. :P

Edited to add because I‚Äôm sure the Female Dating Strategy people will screencap this post to post in their subreddit and try to mock it:

I am not saying any woman must date *any and every man that clicks Like on her*. Having *any* kind of standards you want is *fine*. It‚Äôs *your* life and you shouldn‚Äôt be forced to date *anyone* you don‚Äôt want. Your standards are *yours* to choose and fight for. You don‚Äôt owe *anyone* your time and effort. You don‚Äôt owe *anyone* a date for *any reason*.
