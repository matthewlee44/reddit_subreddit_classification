Baseline, I’m very attractive and young looking. I also a good education, career and finances. I have no issues attracting men at all.

Personality type is INTJ-T. Thing is, I’m terrible at maneuvering through dating. I almost always give the wrong signals and tend to do even worse when I’m actually really interested in the person. I get in my head a lot. It takes a while for me to open up. This comes from anxiousness, and general distrust towards others intentions. 

I met this guy 2 weeks ago and went on 2 dates. I didnt have high hopes prior to meeting him since we barely spoke…. but unexpectedly, the first date went extremely well. We went for coffee and hit it off immediately. We had so much things in common, which is rare for me. And he sounds very intelligent and he had an important and demanding job (CIA background). He seemed extremely interested as well, asked a lot of background questions, and kept mentioning how very attractive I was, and how he thinks we have “potential”. So he asked me out on a second date as soon as possible. 

Second date came, he invited me to his place. I was extremely nervous because I havent gone to anyone’s place in a long time. Also, I was surprised how he came in very strong. Not in a sexual way, but in terms of flirting and the nature of personal questions, including probing about my personal life. Almost felt like I was being interrogated. I answered with honesty, more than I should have. He also seemed to put in a lot of effort and energy trying to entertain me. Which is cute but honestly everything was overwhelming. Couldnt keep up with the energy, flirting, probing, and my general nervousness. I got in my head and ended being unreceptive, awkward, and looking uncomfortable. Keep in mind that this was a person im interested in and wanted to get to know but ended up showing the most uninteresting and awkward side of me. I tried to drink to make it better. It didnt. We kissed. We ended the date cuddling and yes, it was terribly awkward. Because at this point his energy was drained as well. He asked me when we could hang out again so I told him im free during the weekend. He never followed through on that but instead, he asked me to message him on another platform. Which I did. 

Since I still like him, I messaged him and apologized about how off I was and that I was very nervous and tired. He replied after a day, saying thats it cool and that hes been busy. He says that we should “meet again once youre less tired”. I agreed. No communication after that. 

I’m not sure if at this point I should ask him out or just wait it out. I’m still interested in him but I dont wanna chase him at all. I simply want another chance, I think we could connect if I didnt get in my head and behaved how I normally would. 

Anyway, after that event…. I tried to talk to guys and keep my options open. The sheer ease of finding other people interested in you is baffling. Such is modern dating. Though honestly, I feel bad because I really just like this one guy now and I feel like the other guys are just alternatives. I havent felt this genuine interest in a long time. Ugh. 

Ive initially convinced myself he is uninterested but the reply surprised me, he shouldve just ghosted me and not asked me to get on some other platform and talk about meeting up again. Or I dont know. He seems pretty mature and straightforward to play games. Is this what 35 year old guys do?

I routinely see posts on here from ""chubby"" or ""fat"" women who say: ""I am chubby/fat and only date slim and fit men because that's what I like."" I have never seen anyone call them hypocrites or put them down over it.

I see women are very commonly comfortable having standards they can't remotely meet themselves:

* Wanting to date a white man even when they're not white. Eg. At least half the Asian women I see in my city are dating white men.
* Wanting to date tall men even when they're short.
* Wanting to date handsome men even when they're average or ugly.
* Wanting to date rich/richer men even when they're poor or average earners.
* Wanting to date fit guys even when they don't work out or eat healthy and are in bad shape.

These are common things for women, and women seem to encourage each other to do all these things.

I'm only 24, I know it seems really bizzarre, but ever since I was 16 if I wanted a relationship with a guy I HAD TO chase him. I have this pattern when it comes to shy, anxious, really emotional and even antisocial guys. Almost always they are younger than me too. 

It's always the same situation. They either cant figure out whether Im actually interested in them or they do kinda get the message but they dont take action until later on. Does anyone relate? I really dont understand their psychology at all. What should I do? I know that most of people would tell me to dont chase at all since that turns guys off, but how else should I show them I am interested?

I also have to deal with my own mental health issues, self esteem being a huge downer here. I seem to be attracted to few people.

A few days ago I told him I felt a little insecure after all his recent comments about “you’re lacking of a sense of humor”, or “I’m taking it back a little as pretty and cute, not pretty and smart haha” sort of thing. His reply was “I’m sorry for making you feel insecure… if you thought that me being serious and you can’t laugh at yourself, I’ll be honest that you’re not gonna like me in person.” 

I answered as “I was okay with the teasing, but saying that I was from pretty and smart to pretty and cute made me feel like I’m… dumb. Also maybe you’re not gonna like me in person either.”

I haven’t heard from him after that. I don’t feel much bummed out or anything like waiting for him to reply. Thing is I felt like I wasted both my and his time when it came to this after more than two months of talking. I don’t like ghosting, as I don’t expect people to do it to me. I want to say something to end, maybe to make it clear and he’d move on? But should I? Or just leave it like that?

About a year ago I was dating someone and he ended it. To keep a very long story short we eventually reconnected and agreed to be friends. He did make it very clear he would like a FWB situation to which I said ""as much as I'd like to, no because I'll catch feels"". Our friendship was actually really really great and I was toying with the idea of hooking up with him again because genuinely nothing else going on and I became more comfortable with the idea that actually I have no desire to rekindle this. 

Just as I made the decision that he may actually ""get some"" without me catching the aforementioned feels, he began pursuing me identical to how he was before we were dating. For context when we dated it was quite serious, I had met friends, family etc. all at his request. Super caring, interested, spontaneous and it caught me off guard. I was like oh wow shit now he wants to give this another shot. Anyway, I was really sad this past weekend as I had a death in the family so after a few drinks I decided why not, might as well watch a movie with him and see what happens. 

I went over with the entire logic of genuinely just wanting to hang out with someone I am super comfortable with, have fun, and maybe (physically) more. I did not go with the intention of rekindling our old relationship. I made this very clear. Some would say the idea of FWB grew on me. The night was super chill, laughing the whole time, he was extremely affectionate like he used to be, gets me an Uber home and so forth. 

Anyway the next day I send him something I would normally send him before we were hooking up again (friendship level), and I no longer get a response. He's just shut down, silence. 

**And here's what's an incredibly irritating realisation** (and please feel free to tell me if I am wrong), I think he crafted and pursued the entire friendship to regain my trust to eventually, what, hook up with me again? It seems absolutely ridiculous to me that someone would invest *that* much time and effort just for some sex?

I (25f) started dating someone (25m) about a month ago. It's still very casual but I've really enjoyed getting to know him and I've stopped talking to other people to focus on him. The problem is, while I do like him, it's very obvious that he likes me WAY more. I feel this immense sense of guilt every time he starts to talk about how happy he is with me, how I'm way out of his league, how glad he is that we found each other, etc. I just can't respond with the same level of enthusiasm, and that makes me feel like a horrible person.
Maybe it's still way too early to tell, but I just have this sinking feeling in my stomach that if we were to end things, it would be me doing the breaking up and he would be heartbroken. And I absolutely don't want to hurt him. But I don't want to lead him on either. Right now I don't feel like I'm leading him on because I do genuinely like him and I've been honest since the beginning that I don't know what I want yet with regards to a relationship. But the more we keep seeing each other the more pressure I feel to make a decision. (He's also been married and divorced before, and has told me that he wants a relationship).
At this point, I've been having intense anxiety before and when we meet up, and I find myself silently wishing he won't start talking about how much he likes me so I won't feel that guilt. I haven't been sleeping well either and it essentially feels like a long, drawn out panic attack. 
I definitely have an avoidant attachment style and I've been trying to work on that, I just don't want to ruin things between us before I've even given it a chance.
I should also note that he hasn't been pressuring me at all to make a decision or do anything I feel uncomfortable doing. Which also makes me feel guilty because he's being so genuinely nice and I can't even reciprocate the same magnitude of feelings. I've always been slow to develop emotional attachments so I'm hoping it'll just take time. But again, that makes me feel guilty to keep him waiting until I can (potentially) meet him where he is.

So he’s a really nice guy. Like honestly super sweet. He talked a lot on our first date because he was nervous. He has great manners. He only made me pay for what I ate Bc I ordered less than him. He made his intentions clear that he wants a serious relationship. 

Here’s the thing though. Although he’s perfect on paper, I’m not so sure if I’m attracted to him. Not like physically. He is cute but meaning personality wise. He’s kind of the quiet sweet guy and I always thought I’d be with a more masculine outgoing guy because I am very outgoing as well. But then i talked to my friend and they think that with social media and everything people always think they should go for the more outgoing guys Bc that’s just what’s seen as attractive in mainstream but usually those guys tend to hurt their partners feelings more.

The guy I went out with is definitely a keeper on paper. He’s definitely the type of of person who will be there for me and truth be told in society these days based on what I’ve seen, it’s hard to find a guy like that.

Over the last few months I have met with and hooked up with a handful of men after meeting them on online apps (Tinder and Hinge) and talking for approx. a couple weeks before meeting up.  


I have met with 4 guys so far in the last month, I know not the biggest sample size, but I am genuinely confused (I could very well be naïve since I haven't dated in 7 years due to being in a relationship) at how much of a ""game"" this feels like?

ALL of these men have come on SO strong at first- the point where I am questioning how they like me so much given I am on a screen online? - and then talk to me DAILY, constant messages, being so sweet, trying to get to know me, persistently asking me to hang out and telling me about all the wonderful things they'd like to do with me. Because I am looking for fun, I am doing my best to not overthink it and just go along with it, and meet them because I am attracted to them enough.

When we met, it was great &amp; fun. I have had 2 hangouts with 3 out of the 4 men, because I did not hit it off with one of them. I had sex with all of these men on both hangouts. I did not sense any weirdness from them, or disinterest, as they were all pretty open about how much they've enjoyed our time and hookups.  


I am finding now that all of them have SIGNIFIANTLY reduced their communication with me. Like going from texting me DAILY (always asking me about my day, etc.) to non-existent OR very very dry in comparison to how they were texting before. It is honestly like they are a different person all together. Of course at this point, I am now SLIGHTLY attached (I know it is partly due to my hormones after having sex and also partly because I am used to being in a long term relationship).

Now, I have made it clear to these men I am NOT looking for something serious, because I am not, and they have been on the same page. I know these men owe me NOTHING especially because we agreed it is a casual thing (aka no obligation to text, check in, hang out more). BUT I can't shake the feeling of feeling like they've gotten what they wanted and are moving on. Is this common/normal?

 I don't feel sad or anything like that, heck I barely know these men. But I like them enough physically and personality wise to hang with them again and do the deed a few more times. After all, I am hoping to have casual sex/fwb situation instead of sleeping with a bunch of random dudes and not getting maximal sexual pleasure because one time hookups don't usually please me as much as regular occurrences when you get to know the person's likes/dislikes, etc.

But it seems like that classic ""men like the chase and once a woman is interested they run away"". I have not been clingy or anything (I don't think?) I don't text them all the time. BUT I have noticed when I do message them, they take much longer to respond, and sometimes won't respond for days. Nor are they eager to hangout again. Seems like they are keeping me on standby for when they are horny again?  


I understand a lot of this is my ego talking - wanting the attention and validation - which I understand is not going to come from these men, nor do I want it from these men. But it is still there because, I am human after all! And part of me is annoyed, like we had a decent enough connection and clearly had great sex (not to toot my own horn, but I know I am great in bed and I am a very sexual person) so why don't they want to keep it going?

Now I have tried a bunch over the years and so far nothing really works but then again I am in the southeastern US were people are far far more conservative. 

Apps I have tried

* Tinder -- Out of all the apps I use this one still seems to be the best an trying to meet people but not too many kink friendly or LGBTQ+ folks here. Also, can't search.
* PoF -- was good in the beginning but seems trash now
* OkCupid -- Seems to be the closest to what I am looking for but holy shit the bots and fake accounts are numerous. As soon as I create an account I have nearly a 100 likes. That's not possible.
* Hinge -- Didn't much care for it
* Coffee Meets Bagel -- Same as above
* Bumble -- While I like it and it does have search features there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of people in my area that match with what I am looking for. Plus it would be nice if matches weren't limited to 24 hours. Also, allowing guys to message first would be hella nice.

So I’m newly back on the dating scene after a long-term relationship and would love some advice. 

I’ve been talking to this guy on Tinder. He seems like a really nice guy, and is a bit older (34m) than what I (27f) usually go for. He’s asked if I’m free on a certain date next week and happy days, I am! So, he’s messaged offering to book somewhere for dinner. 

Now, I’ve always been hesitant about dinner on a first date. What if we meet, there’s no spark, and we then have to sit through a long meal together? What if he sees me and thinks ‘ugh, no thank you’, but the poor guy has to go through the motions of the date? See, my ideal first date is drinks for this reason. You have the social lubricant of booze but either party can leave pretty sharpish if it’s a no-go from early doors. 

My issue is, would it be rude to suggest drinks instead, since he’s offered to book somewhere for a meal? How would I phrase the drinks suggestion without coming across dismissive of his idea? Also, is this maybe an age thing? I’ve never dated a guy in his thirties but maybe it’s more the norm for that age, whereas your twenties are more ‘let’s meet in a bar and see what happens’?

Ultimately, should I suck it up and do the meal and see what happens? For those who have done dinner dates as the first date, would you recommend?

I’m a girl in her mid 20s, and I just never had good luck with dating. I’ve asked out guys only to get rejected and have them treat me badly, I’ve gone on dates with dudes from apps and 9/10 times they tell me that while I’m smart and fun they just don’t “feel it”, I have gotten unmatched out of the blue several times on Bumble after sending that first message, I send likes in Hinge only to rarely get matches, and on Tinder dudes never send me a message and the few times I have I only ended up getting used and taken advantage of. 

Obviously it gets you, and talking to friends and family never helps cuz no one ever has anything to say beyond, “Don’t worry you’ll find someone one day!” 

Also I notice that whenever I go on the dating or dating app subs on Reddit and try to find some threads on dealing with rejection when you’re a woman, there just aren’t any. Or I see a couple here but not much beyond that. If anything, I constantly see comments and posts where it seems like the women on these subreddits are constantly rejecting dudes, never get unmatched, always get second and third dates, etc. And any rejection comments and posts from women are usually in the context of breakups or a long dating period. But never in the context of the “getting to know someone” process. And then there’s the fact that dudes make it sound like making a first move always works. 

Anyways, I’ve been really sad about this lately. I feel like like I never got to experience that in my formative years for some reason and I just wanna experience “young love”. Does anyone have any words of comfort or advice?

im 24 years old and live alone

What im looking for: a relationship with mutual attraction. A family 

the way I see it, being this height and having an average face puts me at a significant disadvantage. So my solutions are either to 
-get more exposure
-get more attractive
-go somewhere where i am more attractive

all while lowering physical standards to healthy levels (having attraction for partner)

1) In order to get more exposure , id have to spend the next few years socializing and trying to market my self as much as possible as a 5'2 guy.

2)In order to get more attractive id have to forgo socialization and work overtime 3 years to get enough money for limb lengthening which would bring me to 5'6/7 whivh is still short. Then i would start socialozing at 27

3) last option is to save up, take time off work and go overseas to a place where a 5'2 guy has a better chance. This seems like a logistical nightmare with work and culture but it doesnt seem like banging my head against the wall like option 1 or as scary as 2

I won't name them due to privacy. 

Woman 1 was my first option. I'd known her remotely (online only) for over a year and I'd been crushing on her for months. I asked her out at the start of this year. She actually agreed and we went out on 2 dates. The first date was magical, the spark was there and we connected on so many levels. The second date was her idea and it went great, albeit not as magical as the first. Third date was my idea and she stands me up after I had already gone there. I call her up and she tells me she just wasn't feeling it anymore.

Woman 2 was my second option. I'd known her for a bit as well, but she came up with an excuse when I asked her out and she never bothered to reschedule. We still talk and she mainly initiates, but she hasn't brought the date up again and everyone I've talked to tells me not to ever ask her out a second time. The ball's in her court, they say.

Woman 3 was my third and final option. She was the one who actually asked me out and we met over a cup of coffee, so it was more of a casual/platonic date. She was super cool but it turns out she had a boyfriend and was looking to make friends.

So that's it really. As I mentioned before, I'm introverted so the circle of friends and especially the circle of the women I'm interested in is extremely small.

Late 20s

Holding hands, Complimenting me, kissing me being really lovey Dovey. 
We ended up hooking up and I slept over. He said he felt a little bad bc he hoped he didn’t push me to do anything but I assured him he didn’t and that even though I usually only do that with guys I’m exclusive with, I just really felt attracted to him and things got carried away.
After we hooked up he cuddled me and kissed me all over and on the lips (even in the morning). He was holding my hand in bed and all these romantic kinda things. This went on all night. I’m not really used to that especially on a first date. But I loved the intimacy. It was Nice to have someone be that intimate with you without trying to persuade you to have sex. Usually in the morning if a guy does that type of stuff it is to try and go into sex but instead he just wanted to cuddle and kiss. 

A week later he kinda last minute asked me if I want to come over and hangout with him at his place and I could spend the night. I already had plans and told him it’d be later in the evening if I came. Then he fell asleep bc he stopped replying. I ending up drunk texting random stuff like 15 texts. They didn’t say anything of substance but still embarrassing. 
The next morning i Kinda brought up the texts and then I said some thing like this week we should try to get together. He didn’t reply. Then a day later after not hearing from him I reached out asking if he wanted to hangout that Monday evening. he said that he couldn’t that evening but then he said “what about this Thursday?” Then the next afternoon I replied that that works. 

So then Thursday rolls around and I hadn’t heard from him yet so I go drinking on the lake with my friends which is about 30 minutes away. I end up simply sending him a “what’s up” text message around 6 PM he replies about an hour later asking me what I’m up to and that he just got home from a meeting. I told him that I went drinking on the lake about 30 minutes away but that I should Be back soon. He then tells me that he has to get up kind of early the next morning so he is just going to lay low tonight. 

I  wondered if he forgot that we made plans for Thursday so I straight up say to him “do you still want to hang out tonight?” He says yes and that I can come over and that he is just watching a movie and then he sends me his address. I tell him that I could come but it wouldn’t be until  after 10 PM. 

He then tells me let’s just reschedule for next week and then I say OK let me know. So the next week I don’t hear anything from him but then I reach out to him Friday around 10 PM and I’m trying to keep it cool and I tell him that “if he wants to hang out for a little tonight to let me know.” Then he didn’t reply so the next day I text him basically just saying that “I would like to hang out with him again and to let me know whenever he wants to.” He replies that he definitely does want to see me again he is just out of town this weekend and that he will hit me up next week. So then a whole week goes by again and he hasn’t hit me up yet so I’m a little upset. 

Then around 11 PM on the weekend I basically drunkenly send him a text that says that “I had a great time on our first date and I am interested in you if you want to see me again and go out tonight. But I wasn’t sure if you wanted to hang out again”. He replies that “he definitely wants to but that he is at a wedding tonight but let’s do it next week for sure.”
So I go 2 days without replying to him but then eventually I reply that “I’m down and that I am free Monday Tuesday Wednesday.” 

He didn’t reply to that and it’s been Two weeks. 

Should I reach out again? Part of me thinks that I shouldn’t because I have made it clear that I am interested in him. I also wonder if he is just being nice by saying he wants to hang out with me and offering days for us to meet.  And if he really wanted to he would try and make a plan with me in advance. 

I get where I am kind of last minute with him myself but I’m still showing some effort on my part. 

That Thursday when we had plans is kind of difficult to decide on, because he did give me that day in advance but he didn’t give me specifics and I had to reach out at 6pm.

Some people are saying that he is just trying to hook up and I get that perspective but at the same time when I tell him that it’s going to be 10 PM he then tells me that that’s kind of late and he’s going to bed, I feel like if he wanted to hook up that would be the perfect time for me to come over? 

Not sure how much this matters but he also has followed me on Instagram and has watched every single one of my stories. He is a little awkward and I can tell he hasn’t been in a relationship before or had a lot of girls.  but I also don’t wanna make that an excuse.

I decided that with a lack of opportunity in my life to meet people between having older friends, being self-employed (One man band) and lockdown that I should give them a go. I've had two dates in 4 months. I do get matches here and there but both times the girls said they were quite happily surprised how much better looking I was than in my photos. Which to be honest was a bit of weird thing to hear but they both didn't go further than date two so no biggie. 

I'm aware I really struggle to get / be in candid scenarios with friends where I get a decent photo of me just out and about. They just never fall quite right. My friends would help with that if I pushed for them to but I don't really know what I should be asking them to do. Selfies are really not my thing but I'd be willing to put that aside if they are something I should be trying. My dating profile consists of a couple of shots of me on holiday taken by a friend (standing), one kayaking, two sitting down in a bar (Not the most flattering) and one group shot with a couple of friends outside a bar

I'm 5'10 half South Asian / half English, have a decent head of hair, short on the sides and a full beard but kept very trim/short. Switch between glasses and contacts (only Some of my current photos have glasses). Have nice white straight teeth, however I think my smile is terrible. My glasses are round, give off a little bit of a nerdy vibe but are stylish. My photos are from a couple of years ago where I'm really actually quite skinny. I'm a bit stocky now after lockdown, have very broad shoulders and a big chest especially relative to my photos. Not yet in overweight territory and friends have commented how I've ""filled out"" for the better but I would be lying if I said I didn't have a small podge. My posture took a hit with my desk job + lockdown but it's getting back to a ""good"" posture. My style is pretty generic I would say, I generally go for a biker look. Dark jeans, leather jacket, leather boots, dark shirt. When it's warm I tend to go for light chinos, a loose linen shirt, tennis shoes. Always accessorised with matching accents like a watch, belt, shoes. So I feel like I'm 90% there with my appearance and presentation

I'm not really sure how I can show myself off best. I'm not a particularly vein person who has spent much time getting comfortable with themselves in the mirror. But maybe that's something I should? I don't get that many opportunities right now when being dressed up and out on the town. It may also be worth mentioning that although I like to put in a fair amount of effort into my style and self care, the girls I have the biggest sweet spot for are ones who tend to put quite little effort into theirs. A ""plain Jane"" if you will or even a bit of a tomboy. Which I'm not sure if I'm doing the best job at marketing myself for.

I really need some help here as my head is just all over the place and I genuinely don’t know where I stand! 

I’ve had this on and off relationship with this girl for the last seven months now, we made it official in July and everything was incredible, then out of no where a week later she says that’s she’s not in the right place for a relationship as she is depressed, so we then become distant as she won’t let me in to try and help. We then met up again a month later and we had sex and spent the evening together then once again we would speak every now and then or every other day. The problem I have is she keeps coming back into my life every few days but then will disappear again and what I struggle to deal with the most is I want to know if anyone else is sleeping with her because she has a high sex drive so I just don’t see her not having slept with someone since me but at the same time I don’t want to ask/know and I guess some would say I don’t deserve to know. The problem for me is she’ll text me randomly or call me just to update me with her life etc… I am really struggling because I feel like I should tell her to just leave me alone because it’s not fair on me because I’ll try and move on then she’ll come back..


I just do not know how to deal with this situation as I feel like whatever I do will be wrong but it’s driving me mad as I want her so badly but feel like maybe she’s just keeping me on hold?

I met this girl a couple weeks ago, we hit it off things were going great and she ended up asking me out (I was gonna ask her but she beat me to it) the date went great and she even said “we’ll have to do this again sometime” well we continued to talk a lot got to know each other better and planned on going out again but there was a sudden change.

All of a sudden she left me on read I gave her space a few hours later I asked how her day was going she just responded “fine” I asked her when she was free and she said she didn’t know with work she college she’s really busy and I said ok I understand well I’m looking forward to seeing you again and she just responded with “ya well I gotta go got a lot of work to do sorry”

So I just said no prob have a good day. Later that evening I asked if everything was ok (I figured it couldn’t hurt to ask) she said yeah why and I said because she’d been so quiet. She then told me she’s just really stressed with school and work so I said I’m sorry is there anything I can do to help? If she needed space I understand snd she said yeah I need space I’m sorry and I said no problem if you want to talk hmu anytime and that’s the last thing that was said I haven’t text her since and respected her space.

Anyways fast track a month and we try to organise a date, we actually tried twice. But unfortunately where I live our government loves to lockdown (Australia). So the plan to meet up failed but we came to an agreenment that once lockdown ends that we would set something up immediately as we were interested in each other.

As the month progresses our conversation continues to develop and there was no sign of disinterest from either one of us, gauging from our conversation she seemed really invested in talking to me. About three weeks ago I send her a message and I realised she had seen the messages. So I gave her the benefit of the doubt as she was extremely busy working at a pharmacy whilst studying, which is completely understandable. 2 weeks fly by and I thought that maybe she wanted the easy way out and has someone else or isn't interested anymore.

So I thought to myself, right it's whatever because after all it's online anyways. So to not think about it, I unfollow her from Instagram as this was our way of talking. Then this is where I am confused and annoyed. She messages me after three weeks of ghosting me. With a small apology of 
"" hey!!! I am SO SORRY I am so bad at keeping up to date with my notifications""

To this I am sort of annoyed because I saw her on Instagram liking photos and that the fact she has seen my messages but blames her notifications. I don't want to sound petty or feel like I'm over thinking things but I feel betryaed about this whole ordeal.

I needed a place to put these thoughts, so excuse me if this isn’t the right one. 

I (23M) recently moved to NJ for work and was separated from all of my friends and family back home. I’ve felt utterly alone and this is not normal for me. I used to date a lot and have had success with relationships before, but due to my job, I unfortunately have moved around the country a lot recently. Despite now living in the most densely populated state in America (for the foreseeable future thank god) I feel like my dating life has been crushed, and it doesn’t help that I’m by myself. 

Now, I’ve done a little inward reflecting on why I feel this way, and noticed a few things. 1. That I have a lot of time on my hands now that I don’t have friends or family to hang out with, 2. That I do a lot of things that SEEM to be for myself, when in reality they’re to make myself better for the potential people I’ll meet or date, and 3. That honestly I’m just fucking bored because casual dating has been a void I dump my time into in the past and now I just don’t seem to be having much success with it (despite again living in the most densely populated state in America)

I’ve also always struggled with the need to keep a good reputation, and I’d consider myself a people pleaser. I’m sure many people identify with this. This works out well for my job but in my dating life I’m not sure how it does any good for my prospects. This sort of factors into the end of this novel I’m writing. 

So, I’ve told you all of this but what’s the point? The point is that I feel like I have been going about this whole dating thing all wrong. Before, I’ve focused on being a good potential prospect for someone. Now, I’ve focused on what’s beneficial for ME. Not going to the gym so I can look good for my tinder pics, or doing a hobby so I have a good story to tell others when I meet them at a party, but doing all those things simply because it’s what I want to do. I’m not doing them for any outward reason now, but inward ones. (See: being a people pleaser)

I also try not to feel so bad about myself or angry when people don’t want to meet after talking over a dating app or texting. I understand people run busy lives but If you’re too busy to make time or don’t want to make it work, sorry but ill have to pass. If you’re flaky, i’m done trying to make it work on my end. I don’t really care anymore for people who either don’t seem to have their life together, or just aren’t interested and don’t know how to say it. I know it’s trivial, but I’ve decided I’ve stopped wasting my valuable time on those kinds of people. I will continue to do things that make me feel happy. I know if I do that I’ll probably find someone at some point… whether it be years from now or this weekend, who enjoys that about me. 

Living alone in a new place for the first time is difficult. It’s wreaked havoc on my mental health and especially my dating life.

I've only ever been on one date and I've been rejected by 2 other women. 

If it matters at all, I generally keep myself appearing smart- I like nice clothes and regularly get my hair professionally styled. 

I also use good aftershave and generally maintain a positive appearance to those around me.

Be that as it may, I suck at attracting women and have no idea where to even start. I regularly go to my local book store but that's hardly a good place to approach women is it?

I so doubt approaching undergraduate or postgraduate students is a good look either...

I have often pondered this and quite frankly i cannot come to a resolute answer. So far my observations &amp; experiences have been that a shared unconditional love between 2 people for no appearent reason does not exist. Men seek the comfort of women, and women seek the provisional comfort of men. To clarify, men seek the emotional release and comfort that can be provided by a feminine counterpart, and women seek the provisional support and emotional stability a masculine counterpart can provide. From what i can tell, a healthy 'love' is a symbiotic agreement between 2 partners that share intimacy each for the sake of their own comfort as individuals. It is an ebb and flow of give and take but for no true altruistic purpose and therefore 'unconditional love' for romantic partners does not truly exist as i see it. 

However, paradoxically, i have often felt compelled to offer a romantic companionship to a few women i found a multifaceted attraction to, who were also less than desirable women by most mens standards, simply because i had known them so well and understood through empathy their flaws, found forgiveness for them, and could not bring myself to judge them. This, i imagine, is the epitome of unconditional love because it is in an altruistic sense, because i had the capacity to love them, however expected nothing in return but reciprocal loyalty and faithful monogamy. I am positive i am missing one or more things to this whole concept, or alternatively, i am a statistical outlier in todays modern dating atmosphere.

(ps: This is about POF not tinder but there wasn't a POF option just 'Tinder/Online Dating') 

Anyway, I had a tinder and POF. Had a better experience with tinder but POF was filled with a bunch of fakes. Like it's crazy. This is about a year ago. I no longer use POF  but one person I still kept in touch with. We texted for a year but not very frequently.

The thing is we started talking on POF. She seemed like a real person compared to the actual obvious catfishers I saw. She gave me her number and we spoke on the phone a few times. Didn't think she was fake at this time and we just texted mostly. Recently I asked if she had a fb. She sent it to me and we spoke on there for a while as well. Shes never asked for money or sent me any weird links and the conversations seems normal. Over the year her stories still match up. Nothing really contradicts. 

Shortly, after meeting her on POF I actually ended up moving states so never ended up meeting her in person. Recently, she said her friend moved to the same state and she would be visiting soon. Said we could meet up. I asked where and basically the city of the area code for my number..what are the chances. (I dont actually live in that area code) but I let her believe I did. Cause at this point I was already a bit sketched out. Im just thinking.. a catfish would probably just looking up the area code of my number and say that.  

I started noticing the red flags. She had pics there that was posted since 2010 but all pics even the current ones seem to be of bad quality (like 480p) looks like a lot of cropping was involved. Most pics didn't have any likes. Some did. Maybe she doesn't use fb often? She is about 10 yrs older than me. (or so she/he says lol) Pics sent to me from text were similar quality which is weird right? Not all but most. I feel like Im being paranoid. I heard her on the phone and she seems real. I asked if she wanted to facetime a few days ago and she says ""later. normally I would."" I asked again a few times yesterday and she said later and never called. For a second I thought shes probably shy about it or something but she just kinda disappears whenever the word 'facetime' is involved lol This is the biggest red flag for me. No facetime? 

Today I decided to ask one more time. She said later after work. I started getting worried and realizing its very likely she's fake. I just said 'why do you always disapear when I ask to facetime?' she just read the message. I double messaged her saying 'yep. you're fake af' she just read it. I just blocked her on everything. Im thinking of just facetiming her when she gets out of ''work"" and just seeing if she will pick up or not. Either way.. this stuff is new to me. Im asking if anyone had a catfish similar to this? 

Was I being paranoid or should I just continue with what my gut is telling me? A part of me feels kinda bad if she was real... Although, honestly, if she is a catfish I'm a little embarrassed I let it get this far.
