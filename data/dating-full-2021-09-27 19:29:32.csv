So I met a girl on a dating app, we we're going to get dinner on a Sunday night but due to circumstances we ended up rescheduling earlier in the day to get coffee instead. I thought it would be pretty cool to bring a small picnic, nothing crazy just some cheese, and crackers real simple stuff. Well that went over super well we had coffee, I mentioned the food she was super hyped, we ate on the lakeside then later on she laid back and relaxed then slowly worked her way towards laying her head in my lap, we ended up sitting there and watching the sunset like that. We then hung out for a bit after dark, until I finally took her back to her house. We then sat at her house for like another 2 hours talking. Long story short that date ended up turning into 8 hours.  


We then texted consistently for a couple days after that, she told me that night that it was the most fun she's ever had and easily the best date she's ever been on. I was trying to setup a second date the plan was to go to a small local zoo, then come over to my friend's house where I'm staying temporarily (I'm in between cities right now.) I wanted to get his opinion on her, he's my best friend and I hold his opinion in high regard.  


After that failed due to her being sick, she was on painkillers due to that the situation that caused previously mentioned rescheduling which were making her sick or at least that's what she told me. I tried to reschedule for the next weekend we kept talking very regularly on the phone like a couple hours a day. When suddenly she asks why I want her to come over to my friends house asking if I just want to fuck her, I explain that's not the case there are three kids in this house my friend and his roommate and I'm sleeping on the couch even if I did want to do that there would be zero chance. And we could not go back to his place if that made her uncomfortable.  


She then asks me how I would respond if she said she was asexual, I was honest and said that I couldn't date someone if there was going to never be a potential of sex that a healthy relationship needs a sexual element. She then says that then it's not going to work. This is after she specifically told me she wasn't asexual on our date after mentioning a guy who was that wanted to date her, and mentioning that she wants kids one day. I mentioned that I thought she was cool and would still love to be friends and she said that she can't be friends with someone that doesn't respect her choices and to not message again.  


I've been running this through my head for like a week now and I can't get past the feeling that I sent the wrong message to her by wanting her to meet my friend and she just said those things to break my interest. It sucks since this was only the third date I've ever been on with someone and I felt there was some serious potential.  


Any opinions? I'd love to get some third party input on this one.

So, I recently started talking to this guy, R, in our mutual friend group. He had been interested for a while so we started casually talking. Nothing serious. I also made it clear that I wasn't looking for anything serious. We would go out together with our mutual friends (maybe 3 times total) and just talk to each other and dance together. We kissed here and there, but it never went further (no other reason, then unfortunate timing and place). He was always trying to go further, but again unfortunate timing. Last weekend, he told me he wasn't going out, but then showed and said he ""wanted to surprise me"". He drove me back to my friends house (50 min drive) where I was sleeping for the night, even though he lived 10 mins away from where we were. He chose to drive me there and we talked in the car the whole ride. I told him I liked him as a person and he said he wasn't looking for ""commitment"". We brushed, laughed it off and kept talking. We cuddled in bed for a little bit before he went to the couch and slept. Then that was it.

This weekend, I hit him up asking if he was going out and got no response. I brushed it off. I annoyingly drunk texted him again and got no response. I texted him this morning apologizing for the drunk texts, telling him i got the hint, and wished him well. No response. Whatever. I hate that I got no response because I think it is the least you owe someone. So I go to check my instagram to see what I had posted on my story and saw he watched it. My story was just a selfie with my best friend, who also happens to be his close friend. I click his profile and noticed he unfollowed me. WHAT???

I'm so lost. When we started talking, we both agreed that the friendship would come first. That it would never be weird between us because we share the same friends. All our friends said that he was coming out just to see me, that they could see by the way he looked at me that he liked me. I'm guessing he's not interested but I don't get why he unfollowed me. Ik its not a big deal, but it is definitely saying something nowadays. I really liked him. Can someone please provide me with insight? Is there something I'm not seeing?

I've been to a party quite a few months back and I met this awesome girl through a mutual friend. At the time I had a girlfriend so even though I found her quite cool and attractive nothing more than bad jokes and repelling the occasional creepy dude happened. We just sat on a chair drinks in hand talking about our lives, relationships and future plans.

After the crazy party was over ,surprisingly we started chatting daily, quite a lot (during this chatting   
period my relationship ended). One of the topics discussed was the bad state of her current relationship and how she wants to get out. I intentionally avoided saying things alongside ""you should breakup"" or give any advice in any shape or form to not influence her decision. After these talks I didn't hear too much about the boyfriend and I think our daily conversations got even lengthier.

Now, this boyfriend talk happened last week so it is quite soon and I know they were living together working abroad for the past month.

This brings us to today. They got back home last Friday, she moved out from her boyfriend's house and she told me (I am quoting and translating): ""Now that I've gotten back home we should go out for a drink"".

So, my problem is pretty much what the title says. But let me give you the whole point of view.

I started a new job a couple of moths ago, and this man has treated me well and made me feel welcomed since the very beginning. We get along well, and have had some nice conversations.

A few weeks ago he asked for my number, I gave it to him and that weekend we saw each other. Everything was great. I never suspected that he wanted nothing mure than just hang out. Las Saturday we saw each other again. He invided me for dinner and we spent a great night. But as the hours past, the conversation took a spin and he started talking about his past relationship and how he'd life was. At some point he mentioned that he wanted me to know him, he wanted me to introduce him to my brother, that he was nervous and so on. Here I started to suspect that maybe we were having a misunderstanding. But I didn't say anything at the moment.

On Sunday we had a small talk on the phone, nothing serious. But some things he said, made me think that he was talking about an ‚Äúus‚Äù as in a growing relationship. You know what I mean? Like that period of time where you are knowing someone prior to formalized a relationship. Although he has never been straight forward and directly tell me he wants something with me.

Today we will have lunch together, and I really want to clarify our situation.... But I am scared to tall. I don't want to hurt him, he's amazing and such a kind and sweet soul. It's just that I'm not into him and I have my reasons:

We have a huge age gap. Like 30 years or so. 
We are coworkers. I see him almost every day. 
I can't see him in any romantic way. 

So, I want advice on how to bring the issue? How do I talk to him without hurting his feelings? I don't want to make an awkward environment between the two of us. But since he hasn't been direct with what he wants, maybe is all in my head? 

I really enjoy my time with him and honestly I'm kinda terrified of confrontation. Although he has never been rude, in fact he has been nothing but nice to me. 

What can I do? üò£ I don't want to have such an awkward conversation.

We talked for like 2 hours and she was very nice and smart. However i never felt the moment to make a concrete move to push things forward. I felt it was almost only a friendly date. Otherwise i didn't fucked up anything but clearly i wanted to learn more about her and probably see her in an other context. When i asked for a second date she said she would think about it (i took that as a no and went home with a mix of sadness/proudness)

Today she confirmed very politely that it won't go further. At first i was proud of how it went but now i'm in retrospection of how the date could have been instead and i feel like literal shit. 

I respect her honesty and i can't be mad for that. I just feel like shit but i guess it will fade in a couple of days since i barely know her.

Context: So I(26f) was in a relationship with my ex (34m) for 8 years, from when i was 17* to when i was 25. He was my first and only sexual partner and things were‚Ä¶ not bad but definitely not exciting. I think i was always relying on him to guide me as he was the more experienced partner but instead of exploring things together, we just settled into a bare-minimum-that-works routine. I tried to address this issue multiple times but it never went anywhere and i never quite felt comfortable enough in my skin (weight issues, general self esteem issues) to just go for it and bring anything new into the mix. 

*(before anybody screams about it - 100% legal and absolutely fine in the country i‚Äòm in. He was basically a mother-in-law‚Äòs dream.)

Now i‚Äòm single at 26 and feel like i know nothing and have zero experience and it really freaks me out. I desperately want to finally get out there and catch up on everything i‚Äòve been missing but i‚Äòm just really terrified that i won‚Äôt meet people‚Äôs expectations or embarrass myself - even though i rationally know that that‚Äôs stupid. 

Now for the situation at hand: 
I went out for drinks with a close friend (50f) and a group of her boyfriend‚Äòs friends and there was this guy (early 50s) who very unmistakably expressed his interest in me. He isn‚Äôt a complete stranger because he‚Äòs been a regular customer at my place of work for years but we never had much opportunity to talk. Anyways, he was very much all-cards-on-the-table flirting with me all evening without it ever feeling creepy or uncomfortable (at least not beyond the element of surprise and the ‚Äöhow on earth did that happen?‚Äò aspect of it all haha. In the words of my friend ‚ÄöHe kind of behaved like he‚Äôs never seen a woman before and made a complete fool of himself but in a weirdly endearing way‚Äô and i agree with that assessment) and without him ever even attempting to initiate any physical contact. I ended up going home with his business card in my pocket and the knowledge that i am 100% in control of what happens next. 

Now this is where i need help. I want to text him. I really do. I don‚Äôt necessarily see it going anywhere emotionally but there was a great vibe. I think we could click very well on a casual level and i believe that he sees it in a similar way. The thing is, with all the baggage i‚Äòm dragging around with me, I‚Äôm completely lost on how to approach the texting thing. Like, how do i communicate ‚ÄöHi, i‚Äòm here and i‚Äòm fun and flirty and definitely interested in *something* happening there but also, i have massive reservations about all of this that have absolutely nothing to do with you and i might actually unleash all of that information on you in some way because that‚Äôs how i‚Äòm built.

I‚Äôm going to change minor details of the story (and I'm sorry in advance, but it's probably going to be long).


For reference, I am a 26 F.


Almost a year ago now, I decided to try online dating. I talked to a few guys but didn‚Äôt really connect with any of them. However, that changed when 28 M came along. It was nice talking to him, and we seemed to have quite a bit in common. Two or so weeks went by, and he suggested that we meet in person. I blew him off the first few times he did this because it felt too soon to me, and I was busy with work. After a month or so though, I agreed because I didn't want him to feel like I was leading him on.


A couple of weeks before the date, we decided to add each other on one social media site. I was fine with that, because it gave me access to his profile to make sure there wasn't anything alarming. However, he took it a step farther and ended up finding me on a few other social media sites too. I know I should have expected it, but it caught me off guard. Not only that, but he began messaging me frequently, and I couldn't pretend to not see the messages because he knew when I was online. If I replied after a few hours, he would reply literally within seconds - always. It was always like that, no matter the time of day.


Literally hours before our first date, the topic of sex came up. I don't judge anyone, and I think everyone is free to do what they want. But, for me, I'm waiting for marriage. He didn't agree, and it felt like he was trying to convince me as to why I was wrong for thinking that way (and I'm a Christian, and he used the Bible to try to sway me). I was upfront and said that if sex was important to him, then he was wasting his time with me. He said it didn't matter if we had sex or not.


The date arrived. He was kind and respectful, and we had great conversations. But, afterwards, I just didn't feel anything towards him. I figured it was too soon to tell though.


The next day came, and the messaging resumed. I became a bit shorter and colder in my messages and eventually I told him that I just didn't message people like that. I had to work and do things at home. It's not that I didn't have time for dating, I just didn't have time to entertain someone 24/7, and that was what it felt like. He said that he wasn't used to that.


We ended up planning a second date. By this point, I was feeling really cold, but I wanted to give him one more chance just in case, and my mom and friends said I needed to give him a chance. We met up again, and it went okay. I could tell that I just wasn't that into him. But a few things happened on this date and after that felt like red flags.


I mentioned being unhappy at work. I was looking for something where I would be treated as an equal despite whatever position I had. He expressed interest in this and told me that I should find a job close to where he lives. I remember just kind of looking at him funnily. He told me about how easy it would be for me to find a roommate (that felt a little suggestive, like he meant himself). He went as far as to show me applications for jobs.


A few days after the date, I was honest with him. I told him that I just wasn't feeling it, and he said he totally understood. He was cold after that point, but I was okay with it. He'd message me occasionally just to ""check in.""


Months went by of this. Then, one day, he messaged me that he was getting something in X county. I work in X county, and X county is over an hour a way from him. I asked him why and he said there were none of what he needed where he lived. He also started posting cryptic messages on FB, things like ""You deserve someone who won't treat you like an option."" It felt directed at me, and this confused me because we had only gone out twice. It made me feel like I was the villain. Not only this, but he began to follow the accounts that I would share. It didn't bother me so much at first, but, after awhile, it got weird.


Another month or so went by, and I got a direct add on Snapchat - it was the kind of add when someone knows your handle. I thought it was weird, so I decided to look the person who added me up on FB. He wasn't anyone I or my friends knew, but we had one mutual friend: 28 M. I declined and, the next day, 28 M messaged me to ""check in.""


More recently, my friend and I decided to run a test. I shared an account and waited to see if 28 M would follow it. Days went by, and he hadn't. I felt relieved. Then, one day, I clicked on his story and there it was: he had shared a post from that random account.

For context, I'm a 25M who's been single for a few years after a terrible breakup from a toxic relationship. I've got hobbies, I play DnD often and I work as an entertainer for kids and adults. I'm pretty good looking, in shape, got a nice deep voice and I've been told I have a great sense of humor. All in all, I feel pretty good about myself in general, and I'm relatively fulfilled in my life. 

However, I've been struggling with finding a gf ever since my last breakup. At first I wasn't feeling ready to date anyone, and the past year has been rough with COVID, but finally I've been feeling it again and I've tried to get back into the dating world. 

A few months ago, I met this girl online, let's call her B. I play video games and we just happened to play some Rocket League together. We ended up teaming up after the match and continuing for a couple hours, having a lot of fun through chat and joking around. 

I left my discord in the chat after talking to her, and she added me a couple of days later. Over the next few weeks, we met up once every few days, spending most of the time just chatting in lobbies instead of playing. Turns out, we had plenty of things in common and crazy chemistry. We started flirting pretty heavily and even got to some ""sexting"" over the weeks. 

Everything was going great so far and I was honestly stoked about how the events had unfolded. I made it very clear I was interested in her romantically and started setting up dates, which we had a couple online. I asked her if she was interested in trying something between us, and she said she was up to try. We also sent each other some pictures (not sexual). 

Now, about three weeks ago, we had a great date. We talked about where we lived (she lives in the Netherlands and me in France), and we mentioned the desire to maybe meet up IRL at some point. She told me what city she lived in and I did the same. We ended the night on great terms, and I was starting to really feel things at this point. That was Sunday.

I had my own things going on the next couple of days so I couldn't talk to her, but that was normal relative to our usual rhythm. On Thursday night I asked her if she'd be there the weekend for a date night. She said she wasn't there on Friday and Saturday, didn't mention Sunday. She also didn't propose any other times to meet. That wasn't any problem as I understood she was busy, so I told her to just tell me when she was available as soon as she knew. 

Fast forward to Sunday and I haven't had news. I send her a message, asking if she'd be here that night or not in the end, assuming she was busy. She told me she was hungover from last night and had to study, so not tonight. Once again, I let it go, but it was feeling a bit odd that she wasn't giving any other times we could meet. 

A few days later, I once again send her a message, asking if she'd be there that night. She answers that she's going to the movies, and once again doesn't try to reschedule. At that point I was seriously starting to question what was going on. 

A couple of days later, with no message from her, I send her a message, asking her to talk a bit about why she was so distant recently and why I was getting these hot and cold vibes. I told her I was into her but if we wanted to keep going I'd need her to also participate. 

She tells me she just came out of a long relationship and needs some time to process things. She says she loves spending time with me and she finds me amazing but she couldn't give me a ""Fuck yes"", at least not yet. I said I'd slow down on setting up dates for the moment, and I'd try to leave the ball in her court for a bit. The conversation didn't go much further than that. 

That's when I realized just how much baggage I still had left from my previous relationship, as I spent most of last week eaten by anxiety and wondering what to do. I really like B, and I haven't felt anything like the chemisty we have in a very, very long time if ever. I realized how badly I was already attached and tried to stay away to deal with the feelings of need, so that I wouldn't do anything unhealthy or stupid. At the end of the week, I finally managed to get over my terrible feelings after spending some time with my sister, and got into contact with her to talk. Note she hadn't contacted me yet, not sure if that was out of respect or because she didn't want to. 

We talked about what had been said and what we felt, and she apologized for sending me mixed signals the week before. I apologized for pushing a bit much, and we agreed to take things slow for the moment. We both said we felt much better after talking to each other about it. 

We ended up spending some time together that night. During that time, she once again told me she really liked me, but we didn't flirt nearly as much as we had gotten used to. I assumed that was because of the weight of the feelings, and I personally wasn't really feeling like it either. We ended up having fun, bantering until the very last moment she had to leave with friends for a birthday party. 

It's now been three days, and I haven't talked to her yet. I'm better than last week, but I still feel a lot of anxiety and I think about this way too much. I can't figure out what I should do. 

On the one hand, I'm really into her, and I want to try to make something happen. She's been flirting with me for weeks and sexting so there was definitely something there, but I'm questioning everything since she's so distant that last week and a half. I could have sworn on my little finger she was into me and also interested, which she even vocally said. 

On the other hand, I'm feeling serious anxiety for the last ten days and I've been really struggling with my negative feelings. I feel like I'm waiting for a sign to prove that she actually wants to be with me, and I've told myself I would wait and see if she talks to me first, but it's eating me alive. It also doesn't help that most of the work I do on my computer involves seeing discord, and I keep waiting for something. 

Thinking rationally, she might very well have been cold for non-related reasons, and everything's still the same. However, it could also just be a sign of her not really actually being interested, and I'm only now realizing it. Surprisingly, I even felt some jealousy and fear she had met someone else and that was why things were going this way, a feeling I hadn't had for a very long time as I'm generally very confident in myself. 

I don't want to stop talking to her abruptly and lose the amazing chemisty we have, but some parts of me also keep telling me I should stop being attached to someone who hasn't shown the same interest in recent times.  I also don't want to be in a one-sided relationship. I've had my experience with ""waiting"" for someone with my ex, and I know there's a 90% chance she just meets another guy or loses interest in the time it would take.

I told myself I would wait two weeks and if she hasn't contacted me by then, I'd just move on.  At the same time, that's a long time and the anxiety of waiting is eating me. 

I literally cannot decide and I can't see where my rationality stops and where my unconscious hopes begin. 

So what is your take on this, reddit ? Should I give her some time and see if she contacts me ? Should I talk to her again before that and just ask if she actually wants something with me ? Should I just let it go right now and tell her I'm done ? 

Tl;dr : Met girl online, everything was going great until a week and a half ago, things got cold and now seem kind of fixed, but I'm anxious she's no longer into me.

Like what did I do to deserve someone like you?"" I thought it was really sweet. Later that night, he opened up to me about what he is going through (work, family, etc).

I was being an active listener and really trying to be there for him. He all of a sudden shut down and told me that he did not want to talk about his feelings anymore. I respected his wishes and didn't push . I reminded him that we're in this together, I'm here to listen and I don't want him to feel alone with whatever he is going through, he restated that he didn't want to keep the conversation gong.

Friday night, we had plans to go watch a movie. He told me that he was not up for seeing the movie anymore and told me that he did not want me to worry or stress about him because I have a lot going on (I'n currently a full time student getting my masters degree and also working part time) already. He reassured me that things are fine between he and I. We still send each other good morning, how are you, etc text throughout the day.

I am trying to be really respectful of his space. I just feel like like as his gf, I'm letting him down because there is nothing I can do to make things better. I don't know if I am doing something wrong and he feels the need to shut down once he starts opening up.

This is my first time posting in this group which is surprising because I‚Äôve had a lot of dating issues prior to this one. Anyways, I(27f) have been dating this guy( I will call him.    Shawn)since July, but we matched on Tinder and have been texting since June. Back in June I was honestly that into him. I got out of a 7 year relationship that I was in from 19-26 last September around this time and I‚Äôve dated four guys including this current guy. The first guy I met just days after my breakup and I became very attached to him and I think I fell in love with him. I was just so lonely after my break up, but he was very back and forth and just not good to me. The second one was kind of the same, but I wasn‚Äôt as invested in him. Now the third guy I met around  the same the time as Shawn, but I actually met him in person before Shawn, I didn‚Äôt met Shawn until July. I was really into the third guy, but he would go days without talking to me and claim that he was busy. After only going on two dates with him and hooking up with him he ended up somewhat ghosting me. 

After that I decided to actually focus and give Shawn a chance since he was actually trying and giving me the attention that I wanted. We met close to the end of July and went for dinner which was good. There was clearly an instant attraction and physical connection, but when I got home I was drunk and mentioned that he was looking at the waitress a lot. He denied this saying that he was not and would admit it if he was. He also spent a good about of dinner talking about acid and shrooms which didn‚Äôt really bother me, but I could tell it is something he is really into. We went to the movies the next date and then I spent the night the third date and we ended up having sex. We‚Äôve hung out maybe 7 or 9 times and I slept over his place a couple of times. Everything has been great, but I do not drive at the moment and we live about 35 minutes away from each other and he has been picking me up and dropping me back home. I have offered though to take the train or Uber/Lyft there as well and there was one time I did do that. Every time I offered he will say it‚Äôs okay and that he will pick me up. I haven‚Äôt been working since the end of July because I quit a job I was very unhappy with, but I am working now. He sometimes complains about the five day work week and says that he wishes he had more time to do things and more alone time. This comes into context later. 

I noticed maybe two weeks ago that his texting patterns with me changed. So, the day we were supposed to hangout I text him while we were both at work and asked if everything was alright because he had been quite recently. He said it all was fine. When he got out around 3 he messaged me and asked If we could hang out another day because he was only able to get an appointment for the barber the next day at 12:30pm and he did not want to have to pick me up bring me back to his place, wake up early in the morning to drop me off, and then go to the barbershop which is also kind of a ways away from his house. I said this was fine and then he kind of went off and said that he is  fine, but is Just tired of working all the time without any time for the things he wants to do. He also said that me not driving makes things difficult than it has to be and that he vowed a long time ago to never date anyone who doesn‚Äôt drive, but made an exception for me because he likes my authenticity. I told him I have no problem taking the train like I‚Äôve often before. I then straight up asked him if he is still interested in getting to me. He said that he likes me but doesn‚Äôt feel that spark or isn‚Äôt feeling that feeling that he is looking for. This was a shock to me because I think we connect very well. He then said he doesn‚Äôt know if we have longevity because of all the things in between such as me not driving money(because I was not working but am now) he said that he‚Äôs been in a lot of relationships and does not want to waste my time or his time. I got upset as expected and he said that I don‚Äôt love myself and need to love myself to the point of needing no one else. He said this because I mentioned that I want someone to make me feel special and brought up how he said he said his ex is one of his soulmates at dinner because we were talking about how we believe in multiple soulmates. He said that he hasn‚Äôt been dating anyone else and that he gave me a fair chance. We got through this argument and he said that he never once said he wanted to end it he just wanted to be honest. He said that he doesn‚Äôt want to end it because I‚Äôm the first genuine person he‚Äôs met in a while. He also mentioned in the past that He does not like my negativity and that he‚Äôs been with energy vampires before. So now I never vent to him when I‚Äôm going through things, but I can admit that I have been depressed and have been venting a lot to people and have been been down. 

The last time I saw him was Friday that just past and I took the train and he picked me up from the station. I spent the night and we just watched movies and talked and had really good sex while high on weed.  I noticed at one point when I asked him about a bad trip he had  on acid his voice seemed annoyed. I noticed these instances of him sounding annoyed or looking annoyed before, but I only notice them when I‚Äôm high on weed. I also noticed that he was on a his phone a lot more than he usually is while with me. In the morning while we were still in bed I asked him about us not having a spark because that has been lingering in my head. He said that he doesn‚Äôt always feel a spark all the time which is why he doesn‚Äôt know if it will last between us. He said that this is okay though because acid and shrooms have taught him that certain things are just for a moment and that‚Äôs okay. I‚Äôve been thinking about it since Saturday and I‚Äôm not sure if I should cut things off or not or keep my options open or just be single and take time to heal from him and everything/everyone before him. He still texts me good morning and goodnight and if I don‚Äôt respond sometimes he will double and or triple text me. I‚Äôm so torn because I do like him a lot, but I‚Äôve been in situations where I‚Äôve stayed far too long and ended the one being left when I wanted to leave way before   but just didn‚Äôt for some reason. I am not sure if we will get into a relationship or if he sees me as someone just for the moment. I don‚Äôt want to get more attached and continue to have sex with him if he thinks nothing long term will happen between us",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1030226,public,self,Is he just keeping me around for the time being?

Background: I‚Äôve only been on hinge a couple weeks, but have arranged several dates that have been fine, just a bit platonic.

Anyway, I spoke to this guy yesterday on hinge and the convo was great, so I gave him my number at the end when I was going to bed and he asked to talk again in the morning. Well this morning, he messages me again and says: for full disclosure I have a date this week with another girl - so I won‚Äôt be speaking to you until that‚Äôs over. Just to be transparent and give everyone the ‚Äúfull attention they deserve‚Äù. 

I can‚Äôt decide what I think about this‚Ä¶is it nice to not even be messaging more than one girl at a time. Or is it a bit weird? I feel a bit off about it but I can‚Äôt really verbalise why. I mean if he only wanted to sleep with one person at a time, that‚Äôd be great. But to only talk to one person? I feel a bit second choice about the whole thing?

My dad's track record with relationships. She said she's been cheated on. We both be hurt. So trust is the game. Thankfully, cause dating is so boring and awkward.. I pulled a fast one and said we can't gain trust (atleast that kind) over text so we should go to the art museum. She agreed but couldn't. That day which was unreasonable anyway. And threw out tomorrow which is also unreasonable. We'd only been texting like 30 min babe.... She couldn't make it which, fine. It's less than 24 hours away so, why again is did you trust me that fast even after I said we couldnt? Didn't say that but I wanted to.

Said no biggie cause it isn't, plenty of fish anyway, I'm not gonna hound her. Left her be for the night. Asked her today to go to lunch tomorrow and got no reply so I called after work and left a message. She texted back saying it couldn't work yet on her end and I said I get it cause unfortunately I do. Then *i* asked *her* to be friends cause she's awesome, corny dating sex carrots or not. And then got a yes and we both opened up more. I found a good one and I'm gonna try my best to be good for her. If all she wants is trust I came from lies and deception and abandonment. All I want to give is trust and love to someone who needs it and sees it. 

To me this is all hilarious and perfect, I've never even had a girlfriend and all my friends either ghosted the group or moved or paired off and did their own thing and I've just been depressed learning to cheer myself up. Truth be told I just got bumble for some hopium while I'm getting my shit together(too?). The absolute last thing I'd want to do is cheat on a good catch like her and ruin one of the few women that piq my interest as much as her I've talked to. She's cute af too.

After 2 months of no contact I went on a date with my ex who we only dated for a few months, an ex that we had a peaceful and positive break up, beak up was that timing was just off not that we didn‚Äôt have feelings just timing was just off. Definitely his feelings ran deeper than mine. Some things I would like people to give their thoughts on: 

1. When I was scheduling our date via text it was a Monday. I was telling him my availability for that week. He then responded ‚ÄúWell what about tonight instead?‚Äù I thought it was interesting he wanted to see me that night instead of scheduling it out.

2. The day prior to the date when we confirmed what time we would meet up he asked me a weird question: I texted him ‚ÄúPerfect tomorrow at 7 it is, in my calendar!‚Äù His response was ‚ÄúAnything new in your life?‚Äù It felt odd that we were meeting the next day and he would ask that question. I believe he wanted to see if I was dating or seeing anyone with that question before meeting up. 

3. Date went well we had dinner, laughed and caught up. He was quiet at first and as time went on he became happier. They took a picture of us at the restaurant and printed it out (it‚Äôs something they do at this restaurant). He asked if he could keep the picture and when he got it he was very excited and you could see how happy he was. He said he was going to add it to his fridge and that he really loved it. You could see the happiness in his eyes. 

4. He asked me if I was on the dating/hookup apps and if I‚Äôm using them frequently.

5. He told me he has noticed that on Instagram I‚Äôm not posting a lot lately. 

6. When we departed he gave me a quick kiss on the lips nothing super romantic. But on the lips nonetheless. He then said ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to see you again this weekend.‚Äù

Great signs right? So I follow up to hang out with him this weekend and he never responded. I will say I think he‚Äôs depressed. He told me he has stopped talking to his father because he‚Äôs abusive. He‚Äôs hating his job and hopes to get fired. He also stopped working out ever since we broke up. I also know our break up really hurt him. 

Part of me me thinks he‚Äôs conflicted. I also think he‚Äôs really scared. What do you think?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1030412,public,self,Did my date with my ex go well?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pwvjyv/did_my_date_with_my_ex_go_well/,all_ads,6,,

I just thought I‚Äôd give an update on this situation. I texted this guy and I said that it was nice to meet him but I didn‚Äôt think he and I were compatible and I wished him luck in his search for the right person. He never responded at all. 

My friend that set us up did call me late last night and asked what the problem was and I told her that I just wasn‚Äôt feeling it and his show of temper was really off putting. She‚Äôs aware that I have an abusive ex and that I get really uncomfortable when people start to get angry, or when they start to yell and argue. She said she was sorry for the way he acted.

But I also had a boyfriend who just used my body for sex (almost zero romantic/emotional attachment in the bedroom or out of the bedroom) almost every day for like 3 months before we broke up in June 2020. For this reason (in addition to being almost completely isolated for about a year), I don't crave sex as much as it seems other people do. I literally masturbate once every other month. I'd just rather eat mozzarella sticks.

All jokes aside, so far I'm thinking either:

* I'm not over the physical/emotional issues from my ex violating me (I'm in therapy but I have no idea how to heal this). 
* It's not that uncommon to not want to be touched until you build a bond with someone
* The guys I've been on dates with I'm really just not that attracted to

She can offer me pretty much any experience in life and it's nothing to her. Anything I can do to re-pay the favour seems miniscule.

I met this guy on Bumble who's also living Boston (he's a foreign student from Luxembourg doing his PhD, just moved three months ago and planning to get a job here). We were texting rather sporadically... Several hours between.

I asked him out on a first date to grab coffee. We met last Friday, I paid for our drinks and desserts (he did offer to pay). After that, we couldn't think of what to do so he said he had some errands to run and asked if it was OK if we did that, but we could do something else. I agreed and we went to get some home decorations for him.

Afterwards, I asked him if he wanted to leave, and he suggested dinner and treated me. I drove him to the subway station afterwards and he texted me once he got home, thanking me, saying he had a really fun time and mentioned one of our running jokes. I was tired so I replied a bit short and our conversation died there - it's been 4 days since we texted. His last message wasn't something I could reply much to, and he never said he wanted to see me again.

It was a pretty good date, I felt we connected and I like him a lot. Yeah, I asked way too many questions, but it was still overall okay.

I want to ask for a second date, but I'm not sure if I'm acting a little bit like a doormat? I initiated, and after thinking about it, it seems weird that he asked to run errands instead of suggesting another activity we could do together after coffee, like walking around. I took him extending our date with dinner as a positive sign, but that could just be him wanting to pay me back for coffee. Thinking about it now, he's also really attractive, so he probably has way more options than me.

Men, if you don't initiate a second date or leave an opener, does it mean you're not interested? I'd ask, but I don't want to get burnt unnecessarily or that I don't know how to take a hint.

**TL;DR Asked this guy out on a first date. He hasn't asked me out on a second date. Should I take it that he's not interested?**
