I’m [23M] from and have lived in the DMV all my life, so I’ve got, while very limited (started going out to bars last year), some experience. From what I have experienced, women in the DMV can be pretty unapproachable and if I do muster up the nerve to approach them, they have a condescending attitude and/or can be cold. A lot of the women in the DMV are college educated and a good amount are pursuing post graduate degrees. However, it seems like because of this, they tend to turn their nose up to me until I reveal to them that I am a college graduate with a career in IT. Even then, despite having a seemingly good conversation (based o them breaking the physical touch barrier and other body language) the interaction never really goes past the bar and if I do manage to get the number, it rarely ever results in hanging out or the text exchange doesn’t last long enough (stop texting back) for me to get to the point where I can schedule a date.

The problem came when one of her friends started a baking page where she makes a new cake every couple of days tbh they look good and she followed me with that page and I followed her back i left a comment on one of her posts saying the cake design resembled a sunflower nd her friend replied with a reply completing my observation and texted me thanks with a blushing emoji this one 😊. 

Now a while later my gf texts me saying wtf have u done ur a fuckin idiot 
And telling me to unfollow her friend and immediately delete my comments 
I did well cause I don’t like fights and tried to defuse the whole situation.  

She’s already forgotten the whole thing it seems and even when i tried to hint at it she was like eh forget it nothing big. Any other day I would have been equally lenient 

But today it feels just bad. Any help as to how do i work on this little situation. 

All advice is welcome 🙏

For some reason tho I’m getting less matches and most people I do match with will respond to like one message and then stop responding.  Any advice?  At one point I deleted my bumble and redownloaded it which allowed to have a fresh account and get matches again so not sure if I need to do that again?  Any advice will help!

I've  started to like her one year ago, but, because of Covid, and because  of my personality, I got to actually know her only in the past few months. Earlier, she was often the one to initiate conversation and I still think I ""owe"" her something.

**I  believe a strong friendship is the base to a genuine and durable relationship**, however, I've just learned from one of her friends that she likes another guy from another class. Of course I respect her  choices, but I know I will still have to spend a lot of time with her, hence I would never want to end our friendship. We see each other almost every day, if not more. **I don't really know what to do**.

I don't know what to do because it seems impossible to like someone else as much as I like  her; big part of my mood used to depend on how well our friendship was  going, and now I feel so hollow.

I regret not taking matters into my own hands instead of over-analyzing every sign she may have sent me.  **I waited too long and fumbled the bag**; also, the fact that I didn't know about this until someone else told me has  been disheartening, as I realized that I know very little about  relationships.

Although I've seen some signs that made me think she might like me, now **I'm getting into a skeptical vibe**. Actually, I don't even know if someone can like more  people at the same time. She probably doesn't  know her friend told me, am I completely out of the game?

What do you think? Even though I've looked on the internet, **many were the conflicting answers, resulting in 3 main ideas:**

**A)** Should I go all-in, risk everything and avoid making the same mistakes?**B)** Should I handle this with discretion and try to develop a stronger friendship?**C)** Should I just accept the fact that I've missed my chance forever? If so, how?(Points **A** and **B** imply that I might still have some possibilities, while point **C** says otherwise)

I wouldn't be so sensitive if I was not pregnant, but this whole thing got to me. Why was he being so rude and calling me out just because I turned around to look. So I got up to go to the bathroom and cried. Honestly it felt good but I just kept replaying the whole scene in my head. It hurt. I don't feel good anymore, I feel unwanted and not attractive. 
A couple days passed by, and my dad called me saying he has some of my paints and if he can bring them with him when he visits next time. I said sure. My husband overheard and got mad AGAIN! This time he told me he did not want the paints in the house because it is a stupid hobby and not worth it because no one would want them and he finds them ugly. He said that I should find another hobby like working out or reading. I told him no. That I wanted to continue my hobby eventually and that I wont be painting everyday because of the baby, but it helps me relax. He did not understand and started yelling at me saying I am being selfish and that there is no place for any of my paints. I walked off. 
I don't know what to do because I tried talking to him, but he does not listen, he always cuts me off and just tells me no.

I’m [23M] from and have lived in the DMV all my life, so I’ve got, while very limited (started going out to bars last year), some experience. From what I have experienced, women in the DC area can be pretty unapproachable and if I do muster up the nerve to approach them, they have a condescending attitude and/or can be cold. A lot of the women in the DC area are college educated and a good amount are pursuing post graduate degrees. However, it seems like because of this, they tend to turn their nose up to me until I reveal to them that I am a college graduate with a career in IT. Even then, despite having a seemingly good conversation (based o them breaking the physical touch barrier and other body language) the interaction never really goes past the bar and if I do manage to get the number, it rarely ever results in hanging out or the text exchange doesn’t last long enough (stop texting back) for me to get to the point where I can schedule a date. Ultimately, I think a lot of DMV (DC-Maryland-Virginia) women tend to have much higher standards than women in other areas of the US.

The tipping point was when he blurted out ‘if I had had a better feeling it would have shown by now’. Straaaaaaange grammar, but ok. I was upset and a bit drunk so assumed that was the end of it (my expectations are very low with dating based on past experiences). Blocked him on everything but then woke up with a hangover and my mind full of questions, namely, if he was having doubts, why was he so nice to me and why were we on a date in the first place? He proceeded to say he didn’t mean it, did have feelings etc. We went to make a plan to meet, yesterday, but were both a bit too scarred. He wanted to meet today... I was a bit weary (all my walls are back up now) and once I’d kind of got my head round it he said he didn’t want to meet after all as this weekend had been ‘too up and down’. 

I think it had only been up and down because I’m kind of surfing his mood changes.

-if I were to approach a lady in say the line at a store or a coffe joint how should I go about starting a convo. Off the top of my head I feel like I’d say “Hi I’m marcos, how’s your day going today? Can I grab u a cup of coffee or something off the menu” but then again idk I feel like whatever I say it’ll come off as creepy😓
-If you were in my shoes how would you like to be approached?
-If things go well and we end up talking do I ask for  phone number or is an Instagram weird?

I can’t help but let this bring my self esteem down. Most people I know my age are seeing someone or if they’re not, they have previous LTRs. The longest I saw a guy was for a few months back when I was 23 and quite frankly, I should have stayed single and a virgin. He had a decent personality but he wasn’t my preference physically and it felt like settling.

I just refuse to settle, I only have used dating apps but it’s worked for a lot so that shouldn’t be a deal breaker. How could someone go this long being single? All I can get are the ones that I’m not really into, if they check my boxes physically, they lack in personality or they’re the ones that aren’t into me.

Then when we got back to work things were good. I would leave in the middle of my shift drive down the street buy her food and come back in time for lunch. Majority of the time I didn't even get myself food I did it simply because I care about her and I like her.

So after she ate we were walking g and talking g and I asked her what she thinks about these different hairstyles because I was about to get a haircut and she just says why would I care.

&amp;#x200B;

I moved from the east coast to Minneapolis about a year and a half ago - in the middle of the pandemic and everything, I know, great timing. I'm vaccinated and boosted, but I'm also at very high risk of complications and other problems, so I've mostly been staying inside and avoiding people... Always great for meeting someone, I know. But, I've run into a couple of problems with trying to date here. 

&amp;#x200B;

""Minneapolis"" - people will say they live in Minneapolis when they're an hour away. I get the whole ""MSP metropolitan area"" thing, but I mean, shouldn't someone put that somewhere for clarification? I'm unable to drive due to disability, which is part of the reason why I moved to an area with good public transportation (trust me, it's not bad here). But when someone lives out in the middle of nowhere, it's not much help. I literally live in the center of Downtown west. I know there are a bunch of people here... would be nice if I could find someone.

&amp;#x200B;

Also the fact that I'm working remotely. It doesn't exactly make it easy to meet people. I have piles of free time, more money than I need, looking to buy a condo in the near future (staying in MSP) etc. But none of that is much good when my daily life involves little interaction with other people. I've tried online events, and they haven't been any help. I've been on dating websites for years, not much luck there either. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 39, and concerned I'm going to hit that ""creepy old man"" category, if I haven't yet. I'm divorced (5 years), no children (either here or anywhere else). I'm originally from the east coast, so I tend to be fairly straightforward and to the point - which apparently weirds some people out, but whatever, life is too short.

&amp;#x200B;

That you deserve better anyway.
When things were good, you were able to melt in their arms and feel safe and loved. You were able to just be. It was sweet &amp; peaceful.

Yet the reality is people and relationships unfold. People show you who they really are. It's hard to reconcile a huge difference in who they were then vs. who they became in the last part of the relationship. Its painful to accept that you enter a state of cognitive dissonance - having two opposing &amp; contradictory aspects of the same person exist in your mind.
Your emotions are always stronger when this happens - meaning you will struggle to let go of what was &amp; to accept what is cos it's just so painful. So you will be patient &amp; keep loving &amp; giving, waiting &amp; neglecting yourself for that version of them at the start to come back (that version was not gunna come back). 

While you remained consistent in how you showed up &amp; loved them, they weren't. This is most likely due to them using you to fill a void &amp; take what they can get &amp; need from you at a certain point in their life. Once you've served that purpose, they rationalised their lack of effort &amp; investment, excused their mistreatment, blamed you for it &amp; took you for granted. That version of them at the start, while so soft, gentle &amp; lovely, no longer exists. Was it even real? 

This is a painful reality for us to accept. Our pure, loving hearts get shattered while they, on a high from the validation, ego-stroking, love &amp; support they received from you move on like it was nothing. Fxck. It hurts when that happens. 

Become aware of the signs of people who use others to fill a void, to leach off them &amp; essentially use them to build themselves up only to discard them when no longer needed.

One year ago, I met one of B's best friends and we lived a great passion. However, one day B told me that his friend was talking to another girl, so I stopped talking to him because I didn't want to get hurt  and his friend lives 2 hours away by plane from me (however, he didn't owe me anything because we weren't on a relationship and a few months ago I met that girl and he didn't seem very interested on her).

 7 months ago (1 month after I stopped talking to B's friend), B and I were drunk and slept together and we have been together since that day. On that night, B told me he was in love with me but I wasn't. I was afraid of losing our friendship so I decided to be with B. On the first month, things were great so I didn't think too much about it. But then, I started to get annoyed... B is really different as a boyfriend (compared to what he was as a friend). Here are some things:
-when I used to hang out with B and his friends, B would got mad if I answered to his friend (with whom I had that ""relationship"") or if sometimes I looked at his friend (just look, as I look at other people!)
- if I went to a party, he wanted to know every people that were there. Once I told my boyfriend that I said 'hi' to a guy I hooked in the past and he got really mad
- B was really jealous. However, once he wanted to have a drink with a girl he dated for 1 year (he really liked her in the past, I Saw that) and he used to text everyday a girl he had a big big crush some years ago (I got mad and he Said that it was her that was texting first and that he had to answer, however, they didn't have a friendship since the girl refused to have a relationship with him 4 years ago). I used to talk to that girl 1 year ago and she told me that she regretted not having a relationship with B so... It's normal if I don't want them to talk!! B and I had some arguments about it and he stopped answering her
- 1 month ago, B got really mad because I posted a picture on Instagram (usually I don't post anything). I said that it was an obsessive behaviour from him and he said it wouldn't happen again. However, 1 week ago I posted another picture and he said to one of my friends that now I post pictures and that I want to get boy's attention.
-he lives 2 hours away by plane. When I visit him, he just wants to Stay at home and he says that he just wanted to be at home because he was sad because of his grandmother was dying BUT when he came back to my city he was always hanging out with his friends. I think that he was jealous of me and his friend being together.
- when B argues with his mother, he starts to punch things and he said to me 2 times that he would like to hit his mother (???)

So, after all these things I decided I didn't want to continue to have a relationship with B. Besides, I feel that something is missing, I feel that I don't have that connection with him... I feel that I don't have the passion..

For the last month, I'm trying to get some clarity so I got more distant from B. But, 5 days ago, his grandmother died. I called B on the day she died and on the day after and we talked for hours... However on the next day (the funeral day) I didn't talk because we use to talk at night and he said that he was with his friends and didn't he didn't say much more. HOWEVER, he said to one of my friends that I didn't talk to him when his grandmother died!!! I asked him why he said that and he Said that he didn't explain himself well and that he meant that I didn't talk to him on the funeral day. I Said that he was with his friends and he said that I should have asked what time he was going home.

So... Because of all his jealousy, my lack of connection and these dramas I decided to get more distant and breakup in a few days (I wanted to wait because his grandmother died 5 days ago). However, yesterday he asked me what was going on and I couldn't take it anymore and I called him and we broke up. It was sad, he was crying a lot. It was a pacific break up, I said that I wanted to break up because I don't want a relationship, I don't feel the passion and I want to focus on my studies (I didn't want to blame him). BUT he said ""oh you don't want a relationship because you want to fuck around!"". So it means that he continues to be jealous!!

Today he sent me a big message, saying that he is really sorry, he knows he was obsessive but that he is like that because he had a very very codependent 3 year relationship that ended 1 month before he started dating me. He said that he was like that too because his grandmother is dying and know he feels much more free... I don't know if I should accept him back... Even if he changes I feel that I don't have that inexplicable love (that I felt before, including with his friend). He says that I seemed in love at the start of out relationship and that I lost it because of his attitude but now he is changed. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO!! I don't want to lose him.

Anyway... I didnt communicate that I was hurt bc I didn't want to seem like I wasn't confident or controlling... but I was hurt.  Besides not getting to see her now, anyone else who i could have made other plans with was already busy.  So now I'm stuck at home doing nothing.  

Is there a better way that I should have handled this?  Should I have said yes, it would bother me when she asked about canceling, and been more communicative?  I would want her to go if she wasn't feeling it, but I'm pissed i this came about last minute for no reason other than to have a lazy day at home.

Anyway start time we also hooked up also just saw his house the whole time third time was just two days ago and we hung out at his house and got dinner and then went back and we hooked up but this time he was just telling me that he really liked me and that he cared about me and stuff like that. He’s also moving out of state for his job but he said that he can fly in and out usually on the weekends or whenever he gets time off and when we were just talking I said that my birthday was coming up it’s next month in February and he was saying that he wanted to take me out for my birthday and stuff. Anyways I was out past curfew that last time we hung out and I got in a lot of trouble when I got home. My parents had locked me out. He had texted me the next morning saying “are you ok” we had been drinking so I guess just to make sure I was home safe. I’m (20) he’s (26).

Just seemed a bit odd with her getting aggressive sexually through text messages and willing to have me come to her place just for sex.  

In life I am generally wanting more than sex.  I’m looking for friends also.  I probably could’ve handled the situation better but I felt like I was purposely being blinded by sexual aggression.  And there wasn’t enough other substance to convince me it was a good idea.  

She got upset when I asked her if she had been a female her whole life and she got a bit upset about that.  I told her why and since I couldn’t shake the suspicion that she could easily be lying to me through texts and hiding it by keeping me blindly horny.

We went on many dates, and slept together many times, but he ultimately said he wasn’t interested in an actual relationship. Just a friends (with benefits) situation. So I decided to stop talking to him in December. Soon after that, I started seeing another Hinge man (23M), “guy 2”. We’ve been on 1 zoom date and two in person dates. He says he really likes me. We have not had sex. And we are not exclusive yet.

Last night, guy 1 asked if he could come over and drop off a (belated) Christmas gift he got for me. I hadn’t seen him since I ended things in December. I said ok. This was around 1am, by the way. Once he got there, he started touching me and telling me how much he enjoys spending time with me. So it turned out he didn’t just want to drop off a gift. We ended up sleeping together.

Today, I’ve been feeling guilty about sleeping with guy 1 when I’ve started going on dates with guy 2. I felt bad enough that I felt the need to confess all this to guy 2. (He had told me before that he’d be uncomfortable with me being friends with a guy I’ve slept with if we were in a relationship, so I knew he might disapprove of this, and therefore thought it important to let him know). He said that hearing this made him uncomfortable and that he has to think about whether or not he’d like to continue seeing me. 

That is fair, I mean, he can choose to end things for whatever reason he wants. I’m just wondering if it’s common for people to react in this way to hearing you slept with someone else before you were exclusive with them. How bad it is that I did this? I’m afraid that I did something morally wrong or obviously hurtful. I shouldn’t have been stupid enough to allow guy 1 to visit me. I’m questioning whether or not I am actually a good person, given that I did this. Does this make it seem like I’m not ready for a relationship? Or that I’m not over guy 1?

Ok so my bf (25M) and I (24F) have been dating 6 years. I love him so much and our relationship is generally pretty great. We talk about marriage a lot and I think that is where we’re headed, but I want to work out a few of the communication issues we have before then. 

My bf comes from a family where there is a lot of yelling. Everyday tasks (driving and needing to give directions, ordering take-out, packing and unpacking the car) can easily result in screaming matches between the whole family. I typically just keep quiet during these situations when we are visiting with his family, and while it does bother me I never really have to get involved. Also I know his parents are amazing and love him to death. This is just their way of communication and they’ve been doing it this way for 25+ years. They are all type A people, so there is bound to be some clashing.

However I come from a very laid back family, where there’s barely ever yelling. I can’t remember my parents screaming at me like that since maybe freshman year of HS. We just talk and use our words to communicate any issues we are having. So naturally this kind of yelling really bothers me and stresses me out. When it is between him and his mom, it’s annoying but I can deal with it because it’s not directed at me. But when he snaps at me I get very anxious and upset and typically end up crying and he knows that. So usually he is able to calm himself down enough before he comes to me with issues. 

However, I would say about 3-4x a week he does still snap at me. And it’s for small inconveniences (today for example: we had TP that was supposed to be delivered today but it got stolen from our front steps, and I had used the last of the toilet paper still in the bathroom. But I figured it wasn’t emergent as we still had wet wipes and I told him I would go to the store this afternoon. But he ended up screaming at me when he had to go to the bathroom before I got a chance to go to the store.) I explained to him that I am not his emotional punching bag, and he doesn’t get to speak to me like that just because he’s frustrated about the delivery. He apologized to me about it about 30 mins after, but I am still upset because we had this exact conversation about another small thing only 2 days ago. He said that he knows and he’s sorry, and that he’s working on it. But clearly it’s still happening.

I love him so much but I am not okay with communicating with me like he does with his mom. He knows this and is ok for the most part, but it still really sucks being screamed at over toilet paper or a phone charger that I didn’t return to the right spot. And don’t get me wrong- I am by no means perfect. I am very laid back and I often lose things and can be a bit messy at times compared to him. I’m totally okay with him coming to me with issues, it’s the initial screaming I have an issue with. I’m also ok with his type A personality, I think that’s actually a good balance for me. I just hate the yelling.

I really want to be with him but I’m worried that if one day we ended up having kids together, he would be even more frustrated and the snapping would get worse. I want to ask him to go to anger management or some kind of therapy with me so we can work on communication together, but I think he would get really sad/offended if I asked like I’m not acknowledging the work he’s already put in. He also sees his behavior as normal because this is how he grew up, so he doesn’t see why it’s such an issue to me. 

TLDR: my bf is generally amazing but gets frustrated and snaps/yells at me over little things. Can this be fixed with therapy or do I need to just get over it?

One year ago, I met one of B's best friends and we lived a great passion. However, one day B told me that his friend was talking to another girl, so I stopped talking to him because I didn't want to get hurt  and his friend lives 2 hours away by plane from me (however, he didn't owe me anything because we weren't on a relationship and a few months ago I met that girl and he didn't seem very interested on her).

 7 months ago (1 month after I stopped talking to B's friend), B and I were drunk and slept together and we have been together since that day. On that night, B told me he was in love with me but I wasn't. I was afraid of losing our friendship so I decided to be with B. On the first month, things were great so I didn't think too much about it. But then, I started to get annoyed... B is really different as a boyfriend (compared to what he was as a friend). Here are some things:
-when I used to hang out with B and his friends, B would got mad if I answered to his friend (with whom I had that ""relationship"") or if sometimes I looked at his friend (just look, as I look at other people!)
- if I went to a party, he wanted to know every people that were there. Once I told my boyfriend that I said 'hi' to a guy I hooked in the past and he got really mad
- B was really jealous. However, once he wanted to have a drink with a girl he dated for 1 year (he really liked her in the past, I Saw that) and he used to text everyday a girl he had a big big crush some years ago (I got mad and he Said that it was her that was texting first and that he had to answer, however, they didn't have a friendship since the girl refused to have a relationship with him 4 years ago). I used to talk to that girl 1 year ago and she told me that she regretted not having a relationship with B so... It's normal if I don't want them to talk!! B and I had some arguments about it and he stopped answering her
- 1 month ago, B got really mad because I posted a picture on Instagram (usually I don't post anything). I said that it was an obsessive behaviour from him and he said it wouldn't happen again. However, 1 week ago I posted another picture and he said to one of my friends that now I post pictures and that I want to get boy's attention.
-he lives 2 hours away by plane. When I visit him, he just wants to Stay at home and he says that he just wanted to be at home because he was sad because of his grandmother was dying BUT when he came back to my city he was always hanging out with his friends. I think that he was jealous of me and his friend being together.
- when B argues with his mother, he starts to punch things and he said to me 2 times that he would like to hit his mother 

So, after all these things I decided I didn't want to continue to have a relationship with B. Besides, I feel that something is missing, I feel that I don't have that connection with him... I feel that I don't have the passion..

For the last month, I'm trying to get some clarity so I got more distant from B. But, 5 days ago, his grandmother died. I called B on the day she died and on the day after and we talked for hours... However on the next day (the funeral day) I didn't talk because we use to talk at night and he said that he was with his friends and didn't he didn't say much more. HOWEVER, he said to one of my friends that I didn't talk to him when his grandmother died!!! I asked him why he said that and he Said that he didn't explain himself well and that he meant that I didn't talk to him on the funeral day. I Said that he was with his friends and he said that I should have asked what time he was going home.

So... Because of all his jealousy, my lack of connection and these dramas I decided to get more distant and breakup in a few days (I wanted to wait because his grandmother died 5 days ago). However, yesterday he asked me what was going on and I couldn't take it anymore and I called him and we broke up. It was sad, he was crying a lot. It was a pacific break up, I said that I wanted to break up because I don't want a relationship, I don't feel the passion and I want to focus on my studies (I didn't want to blame him). BUT he said ""oh you don't want a relationship because you want to fuck around!"". So it means that he continues to be jealous!!

Today he sent me a big message, saying that he is really sorry, he knows he was obsessive but that he is like that because he had a very very codependent 3 year relationship that ended 1 month before he started dating me. He said that he was like that too because his grandmother is dying and know he feels much more free... I don't know if I should accept him back... Even if he changes I feel that I don't have that inexplicable love (that I felt before, including with his friend). He says that I seemed in love at the start of out relationship and that I lost it because of his attitude but now he is changed. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO!! I don't want to lose him.
