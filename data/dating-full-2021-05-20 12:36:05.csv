They just want to complain. 

Complaining and venting is an important coping process, but at some point if you're not making effort to change your circumstances, the problem is YOU. 

What gets me the most is the sweeping generalizations about how women only date guys who are 6ft, make 6 figures, and look like models... Even though everyday I see couples at the grocery store, the park, walmart, average couples who aren't models or rich doing average things with eachother.

Yes, being conventionally attractive will give you an advantage in the dating market. But getting so hurt/frustrated at this fact is like a broke person blaming their lack of money on trust fund kids. Because trust fund kids are a small % of people who actually have money; The majority of people who have money are working for it.

My theory is people like this defeatist attitude because if they can blame external circumstances or things they can't change, they don't have to go outside of their comfort zone to change.

**I know because I was doing the same thing.**

I have the interesting experience of being a bisexual woman who dates both men and women, so although I don't have the male experience, I do think on average the struggles are the same: difficulty meeting/attracting women, and difficulty keeping the men I was interested in. 

I would blame the dating market. I would blame modern dating culture. I would blame my location, the fact people just want attention/the chase, I would blame anything I could blame as long as I didn't have to blame myself.

Then it hit me: *I wouldn't even date myself.*

The people I'm attracted to are *nothing* like me. I'm insecure, timid, care way too much what others think about me, and am a people-pleaser. The people I'm attracted to were all confident, charismatic, didn't care what you thought of them, took chances and didn't internalize rejection.

I'd go on a date, and it'd either be an interview or I'd be fumbling over what to say so concerned their perception of me. I wasn't being happy, giggly, flirty out of fear. I was so concerned over what some random ass stranger I might never see again thought about me, and it showed. I would look at my friends who are successful in envy. I would go on dates where I didn't flirt or make any moves, and then wonder why I was consistently getting friend-zoned by women I was meeting off dating apps. 

I started asking a few of my friends, both men and women, how often they get rejected. The ones who I know constantly attract new people told me they get rejected OFTEN. My best friend (she's bi) is beautiful, intelligent, feminine, thin, young, and even in LGBT+ spots where she approaches women she gets rejected MOST of the time. But she's also VERY successful with women too. 

Last night, I matched with a woman on Bumble. I don't get many matches with women. I told her lets be spontaneous and get drinks. We had barely even had a conversation, and she said fuck it and agreed. I had no expectations. We met, I flirted, I made the first move and guess what? It worked! We made out. 

I did mention dating apps, but I'm also taking steps to be more proactive in approaching people in person, which is what ya'll need to do if apps don't work for you. Seriously. Sitting there swiping endlessly and not putting yourself out there IRL is likely not going to work for most. Most of the guys I know who are successful with women don't use apps, and they're not supermodels either. They just approach women a lot, and they get rejected a lot, but they also get success a lot too.

I hope this might have helped some of you. Be the person you'd want to date. Take risks. Before you blame everyone else for your situation, look internally. You WILL get rejected. Early and often. Stop internalizing it. Stop putting so much stock and value in people who literally don't know you, don't care about you, and don't deserve to live rent free in your head.

So I met this guy on a dating app and after a week of texting i asked if he'd wanna hangout and he seemed really into it, asking what I wanted to do etc. Long story short we start making plans and when I followed up a few days before he said he ran into his ex earlier that week and wanted to be straightforward w me. Although I was disappointed, I understood and appreciated that he was kind and held himself accountable for not letting me know sooner. Anyways I just wished him luck and let him know that if his situation changes and he wants to hang out to let me know. He responded apologizing again and being like sounds great you seem really cool w some emojis etc. So I just read it and moved on with my life.

Anyways fast forward to a month later, he adds me on snapchat and likes my instagram post from like 3 weeks ago. My immediate thought is 'fuck boy vibes', so a week after that he snap chatted me something random and im kind of like, you have my number why are u snapping me this seems so sketchy.

So I played along to see what the vibe was (like is he looking for a pen pal or just adding me to a roster of girls he snaps for when he's bored). Anyways we were snapping on and off and it was just casual but he would like ask me about my day and stuff and comment on specific things I sent him. Then when I sent a pic of myself he was like 'you're so cute' sorta thing, and in my head I was like 'aw that's sweet' but also whatever bc you probably say that to everyone.

**ANALYSIS:** I don't think he's fuck boy, he seems like one of those harmless time wasters who don't know what they want.

**OBSERVATION:** his snapchat score is less than mine and he sends/receives less than 10 snaps within a 24 period (some of which are to me) &amp; he also has less than 500 instagram followers/a private account. I'm not citing this as evidence of him NOT being a fuck boy (bc idk what his dms or text messages look like) but it's an observation that these qualities don't fit into the typical fuck boy demographic, usually their snap scores are a good indication lol.

Basically I'm just at the point now where I don't want to waste my own time and I'm kind of curious about why I felt inclined to come back. I hate playing games and if he has no intention of asking me to hang out I don't want a pen pal lol but I obviously am not gonna ask him to hangout again since we know where it got me the first time around. So I'm seeking advice on what I should do next:

***1)*** *Try to find out his intentions (ie: is he just fucking around or is this him coming back for redemption to actually hangout sometime)*

***2)*** *Just roll with it and use it as practice since I've been out of the dating game for a while bc pandemic life.*

***3)*** *Ghost entirely bc fuck this*

**SIDE NOTE:** If you select option 1 please feel free to include how you think I should go about finding out intentions. I don't wanna come off as too forward or whatever but I also feel like it's a fair thing to want to know considering he was the one who inserted himself into my bubble. I also just believe you can say anything as long as you deliver it in a chill way?

I was tempted to text him since he just felt free to bypass the entire ending of our last convo lol maybe thats a bad idea though. Also let's keep in mind he's like a couple years older than me so he should be a mature enough of an adult to handle this.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,785749,public,self,Confused about this guy lmao and looking for someone who speaks boy to translate for me,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nh2vf6/confused_about_this_guy_lmao_and_looking_for/,all_ads,6,,,,,

I'm a late twenties cis Male Engineer who has returned from silicon valley to my hometown in the southeast to work at another nationally recognized Company. In my hometown I lived in a high rise apartment overlooking the baseball field downtown among many shops restaurants and bars. Night life was great times were good I did fairly well on the dating scene (looking for serious relationship). When the pandemic happened I thought why am I living in this expensive apartment still???? 

&amp;#x200B;

So I moved out of the city and started renting the 2nd floor of my parents house. for about 1/3rd the cost. The 2nd floor is it's own studio apartment complete with a full kitchen bathroom bedroom etc, I do share the washer and dryer downstairs and I don't have an ice maker up here. Moving on... I'm a 5 min walk on a private trail away from the lake but the night life here is non existent. But my rescue dog loves it here.

&amp;#x200B;

I mostly use bumble and hinge and get a date every one or two weeks but I tend to lose a lot of traction when I inevitably end up explaining that I technically live with my parents. I could buy my own house but I'm waiting because I'm concerned of a in a housing bubble and living here gives me a lot of flexibility if a great job opportunity comes up in the mean time (not sure if I'm going to stay at my current employer). I would rather pay $ to my parents than $$$ to some real estate mogel.

Hi All! I seem to have fallen for this girl. We haven't had much interaction ( only on zoom, never met her in person). I would like to show my interest in her, beginning tomorrow. Would kindly request people to tell me what should I text her that sounds polite, friendly, isn't intimate at all, and gives her a small feeling that I might want to talk to her. I would like to keep it slow for now, develop a friendly rapport with her, wait for the lockdown to open up (which will take 2-3 months) and then escalate a bit more. Please help guys.

Anyways, I have yet to add this guy officially (which I like because it feels like we're getting to know each other not through just liking a new pic) but I do somewhat stalk his public IG account (don't watch his stories) and I've just noticed that almost daily he fluctuates between gaining and losing about 3-6 followers a day as well as he himself unfollows 3-6 accounts daily.

The rest are hard realities about dating as a man. Let’s put it all together.

1) I am generally unwanted. It’s fine, it’s just what I am. Plenty of evidence to support this statement. My odds have not been good at all apparently.

2) Women don’t owe me anything. That’s the way the world works. We all live in our own worlds and we only involve other people in our worlds if we choose to let them in. We don’t owe anybody an entrance into our world. Except children probably unless you want to be that hardcore about this “I’m free!” shit. But this is the reality. So don’t expect women to give two shits about any struggle you have. They have no reason to. You aren’t a part of their world and they don’t want to let you in if they don’t want to. And they are well within their rights there.

3) Dating is not fair. There’s no system to regulate dating to keep it fair or anything like that. It’s the wild west. You may be completely screwed. That is possible and if you are there is no protection. Good luck.

4) Dating is complicated. There’s a lot of different types of men and women out there and as individuals they can each be into anything they want to be into. Trying to understand and control the process, short of basic things like having good hygiene, are likely to have very limited influence over your outcome. You can subscribe to any philosophy you choose but there’s no guarantee it will be right and anything generalized and simple almost certainly is not.

5) Feeling entitled is not cool and will not be appreciated by anyone. Nothing I do or am earns me a date or anything. Another reason to avoid getting too excited about the “better yourself” frame of mind. There’s a fine line between thinking like that and feeling entitled about your “successes” while bettering yourself. You may or may not be a commodity but no one is compelled by anything to necessarily see any value or worth in what you are selling unless they happen to feel that way. And they’ll know if they do. Just because a friend or family member does doesn’t mean anyone else will.

So when you put all this together, if trying really hard doing the basics for a reasonable amount of time didn’t work at all, it may just be best to stop trying hard, keep meeting new people, but stop caring so much about dating. Just be open to it if you run into a good match. But start to figure out how to be okay being single the rest of your life in case you have to.

I am in love with this girl (and she knows that I like her )and I've been talking to her since last year . 
Since it's lockdown so I couldn't meet her initially but after 5-6 months of chatting I asked her out one day . She hesitated at first but when I insisted she agreed to meet me . 

So we agreed on a date and decided to meet that day. I was really excited to meet her . I was patiently waiting for her we decided to meet at 6pm but there were no signs of her till 6:30 so I called her but due to weak connection the call couldn't connect.  

Later that evening she texted me Sorry as she forgot that we had to meet that day. I said it's okay and decided to meet the next day .
Next day again in the evening she texted me that she couldn't turn up and assured me that she will definitely meet me day after tomorrow.

I was very calm and composed till now and once again I waited for the day........the day was already over and it was night this time she didn't even text me I was getting very furious by now . So I straightaway asked her if she was interested in meeting me or not .....to this she replied that she was very much interested in meeting me after that she again apologized for her behaviour. 

Then next two days I didn't talk to her on third day she called me and asked about me when I was free as she wanted to meet me .
Since I was very busy that week I told her that as soon as I'm free I will inform her then I hanged the call and again I didn't text her for 2-3 days . 


After 2-3 days I thought to wish her good morning but to my surprise I noticed that she had blocked me on WhatsApp . So I immediately called her but she didn't receive my call. 
I texted her on Instagram but she didn't reply .
After this I realized that she was just wasting my time and that  I deserve better . So I didn't try to reach her for straight 2 months and even she never replied to my texts .


Then last week I was at this electronic shop with my friend we were buying some stuff for laptop meanwhile a girl entered the shop she was wearing a mask and even I didn't pay her much attention then suddenly the girl said Hi to me it was then I noticed that she was the same girl I'm talking about I also gave her a smile and then I left (ik I shouldn't have left.) 

Then for next whole day I was just thinking about her . So I DMed her asking the reason why she blocked me to this she replied that she was sorry and that she didn't have courage  to tell me the reason . So even I didn't insist her and ended the convo. 

Now I'm very confused as to what she wants?
What am I to her? 
Should I again text her ?

It makes perfect, rational, obvious sense to hate yourself with a passion if this is your position in life. It makes sense to spend every night begging God to either give you answers or your destruction. I do not know what is the point of existing as an ethnic man in this hellish world created by European colonialism. 

Every post on this subreddit by an ethnic man has comments full of gaslighting and mockery, all because the posters, being redditors, *refuse* to say the obvious truth, *that women hate non-white men passionately*, that the only emotion other than hatred they can feel for them is indifference, that most women of *all* races want their family to be as white as possible, and that things will only keep getting worse for ethnic men; that you hate us, want us to feel we deserve to be hated, and want us to be silent and feel that you don't hate us and we are just inherently inadequate. If every ethnic man died tomorrow no tears would be shed by Saturday morning, I do not believe so.

&gt;Oh you are being racist!

I am myself a black man cursed to live in this hell, merely relaying my own experiences and personal perspective built through bitter wisdom.

It is so frustrating that nearly everyone I think is somewhat interesting or just has a nice presence on social Media is directly assuming I want to flirt and just find them attractive. Like commenting on a Instagram Story: ""you have an interesting opinion on theme xy"" answer: ""I'm taken""
Even worse if I really want to date, like on tinder: the answer rate on tinder is extremely low and needs lots of time if there is any answer at all (in my experience).
What is the matter with a social Media presence if people dont want to Connect with new people? Why do you have Tinder if you are not interested in getting to know people? Even if its just for physical fun?

On the fourth date we agreed to go for another date, the day after she texted me that it wasn’t going to work because she had no feelings and I feel absolutely devastated because I had the feeling she did.
