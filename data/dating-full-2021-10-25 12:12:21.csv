I said I went out to dinner, and he was like ""OMG, a date?!""

No...it was with a friend.

We hooked up before, but ended up doing distance for nearly two years. He wants to come back to Melbourne (he got stuck in Perth) but doesnt know when he can come back. I know he wants to come back (his best mate is here too), but the rest of his band is in Perth and its easier to do shows from there. Covid/border situations dont make it easy rn. He was meant to come to Melb a couple of times this year, but borders closed/lockdowns happened and he couldnt.

Talking to him through 2020 was hard with distance, and I was keeping him at arms length really. I wasnt sure if it was just fuckboy behaviour. We shared photos etc but I wasnt letting him in.  I was having a hard time with other stuff all year, and he knew about it (not from me, it was our circles), and it all just came to a bad tipping point where i questioned him, and thought it revealed feelings at that point honestly.

I dont really want to get into what happened, but he ended up saying ""You have to talk to me more"" and that he thought he was annoying me. So i was like  ""woah, okay, i thought it was just sex? But I can talk more"" He reassured me.

Cause knew what I was dealing with (separate from covid) he was saying things like “Are you ACTUALLY doing okay?” “Were you crying this morning?”   “Sorry that i hurt you” He seemed genuinely concerned. He sounded so upset, it sounded like I was stabbing him. I apologised to him too.

He was also like ""I think you’re wonderful, i obviously wasnt treating you amazingly” and ""I think this has brought us closer"" 

I was wary all year in 2020, and now he knows that, but after that conversation he made me feel at ease.

He kept checking on me after that. Since then, even started admitting when he doesnt feel okay either, or tells me when he's sad too. We both work in the music industry in so he's really done it tough too. 

I moved to my own place this year, and he was asking if it was okay or if it was lonely. I work with him (not directly, with his manager) and every time i make a poster for his band, he messages me separately to tell me how much he likes it and thanks me for it. 

Why is he talking to me like this and then…. asks if I had a date.

For some reason, i thought things changed after we talked. I thought when he was so upset that he wanted me to talk to him more, i was getting the signal that i was okay to come closer.

I think because the other way around...I cant stop him doing what he wants. Cause we havent started anything official. but i dont want to HEAR about it. And thats cause i like him?

I  dont know how to bring it up or what to say. Should i just try and say flat out…”Did you want me to be dating?”

""Is it just sex?"" ""Why are we supporting each other?"" 

 ""I just thought maybe we were getting closer? Are we?"" How do you ask this while it’s still distance, in this limbo state? But i also cant be doing this emotional connecting stuff if he doesn’t care that this might go nowhere...

I dont know how to bring this up? Are these things I should ask?

This feels HORRIBLE. Like, I gave him a chance to walk away at the beginning of the year. This feels like a year down the drain if he wants me to be dating other guys.

I was investing and letting my walls down because i thought he cared. He found interests in common that really make me feel like myself, I thought we were bonding over them. Last year was when he noticed, this year I was talking about them a lot more. I thought i had someone to share them with.

&amp;#x200B;

Should I just tell him that maybe i feel invested at this point? Is it a stupid thing to admit if I still haven seem him in person? Is it stupid to admit I feel like we have a connection, its only been texting? 

But its a lot of talking, a lot of emotional support, and it's a lottt of sex, like the way he still gets excited over me after nearly two years feels so nice.

It's also a lot of questioning, because I know we havent seen each other. SO i dont REALLY know what wed be like in person. I really wanted to ask about where were stand in person. But that hasnt been able to happen when he couldnt come here. 

I'm not saying be exclusive while we are not int he same city. It doesnt make sense to start something if we've not even seen each other in person this whole time.  I think it's more…would he care if i ended up with someone else? I think that's what I care about?

I feel like these conversations should be had in person anyway, over text is too much possibility for misinterpretation. But since he couldnt come here, it feels like no end in sight when that could happen with the borders.

I never wanted to be just waiting around...before covid, I honestly never thought it would be possible to keep up something long distance like this. If I wasnt stuck in lockdown, i would have for sure been able to just got out and live my life and forget about him. Instead, it ended up being nice that I had someone to text (and sext). 

Why is he talking ton me like this, and being so supportive and understanding?  He had been talking to me about his new understanding of mindfulness. I brought up how I noticed even someting like watching  Studio Ghibli can even count as mindfulness, cause youre looking at all the details and focused on the present. (Which is literally already a view I had! So it was nice to share)

THEN later that day, he msged telling me he was watching Studio Ghibil.  (my favourite one too, and he knows its my fave from a previous conversation). Like...he's following up this stuff? If that was the other way around, if didnt care about the guy, i wouldn’t do something like that. So why is he doing stuff like this?

In all this time I haven’t really developed any romantic feelings though, but she has started too. A few weeks ago she asked if I could see a future for us together and I told her I honestly couldn’t, I could see the next few months but at this point I don’t see her as my “person”.

I met this guy traveling to my city to explore it, because he was thinking about moving there. I live in Seattle, he lives in a tiny town on the Eastern seaboard. He works remotely for one of the big consulting agencies, now he’s looking to buy a house. He’s about a year older than me.

We connect immediately. He’s super excited to spend time with me and we spend four to five days together. 

I told him I won’t have sex unless I’m in a serious relationship, which makes him a little upset. He talks to me about how he wants to move to Seattle. I tell him, terrific! He says he’s coming later in the summer. I tell him, great!

Still won’t have sex with him. We talk about our dating lives. He hasn’t had a girlfriend since college (and he is 29.) 

Basically, IN HIS WORDS, what he does is hook up with women who exclusively hook up with him. He likes it better when they’re friends and emotionally intimate. About six months into fucking around with him, the girls ask to date him seriously, and he says no.

He says it’s because he’s “dating for marriage.” That means (in his words) he won’t even date someone exclusively for a month unless he believes they’re his true love.

We've never had sex, and I don't think we ever will.

I've never pressured her into anything, and I've always backed off. She'll do things like agree to sleep over at my place on a saturday night (I think, to simply avoid the topic by agreeing quickly), and then cancel on me at the last minute, simply saying ""she can't because *insert convenient excuse*"" - repeat.

We've gone on heaps of dates, and she's always avoided intimacy with me. We've kissed, but nothing more than that - and not for a lack of trying on my part.

I've stuck with it for this long because I really like her personality, and her as a person. I initially thought that maybe she was making sure that I wasn't an asshole that was just going to use her for sex.

But I've come to think that I might be dating an asexual woman. The thing is, I've attempted to communicate with her about the absence of intimacy, but she refuses to communicate with me. If I bring it up, she changes the topic or ignores me.

If I ask, prior to a date, if she wants to sleep over on X night, she'll agree out if convenience, and then cancel on me later.

We always split the bill, although I've paid for a number of things, she always feels bad when I pay and tries to insist that we split.

It sucks, because she's a great girl, but I won't get to have a sex life or intimacy with her (you know, what almost everybody wants). This situation has messed with my head as well, and I really should have ended it earlier. I realise that. I won't make the same mistake again.

Or maybe it's something I said that turned her off? Any way I told myself not to worry about it and continue to live my life.

Six months later, yesterday, she texts me to apologies for not being honest with me during the break up. She broke up with me because she, I quote: ""wanted to live my life to the fullest in France (...) I wanted to see if this old (guy) friend of mine wanted to date me. (...) My door is still open."" 

Altought I do appreciate the honesty now, I'd like to knew this earlier. I told her that I'm busy with college and projects and I don't have my mind for a romantic relationship. But likewise my door is still open. 

Since yesterday, I'm thinking to give her a second chance, but a couple of things bothers me:

1. I've moved on, and by doing this, I'm moving backwards;
2. She wasn't honest with me since we met and that's a red flag;
3. I realised I'm not that attracted to her... (yes she's cute, but I'm not attracted to her anynmore for some reason).

So I (23M) have never done something like this before. My first relationship just naturally grew from a friendship so i never really experienced asking a girl out before.

So theres a girl (18F) I have an interest in at a small restaurant where i work and we've interacted a bit. I want to ask her out for a date where we get to know each other more (thats a date right?). Even though i'm 90% sure im gonna get shot down/rejected, i wanna give it a shot.  ""You miss 100% of the shots you don't take"".

I've asked the business owners for permission as to whether I could do i before/during/after their business hours and they told me to do it during off-peak hours such as after lunch. They even told me that they will let her know for me that i have something to ask her (which is real nice of them). It seems that they are supportive of it so i don't have a worry about that.

Anyways, I have never asked a girl out who've i had limited interactions with. What the hell do i do?

I've been planning a lot of scenarios in my head, thinking about what to say, what to do, how to dress, what to bring etc. The only thing i know is how to handle the rejection. I absolutely have no idea at all.

Any suggestions, ideas or tips would be highly appreciated.

I (22F) ve been dating this guy (24) I met on Tinder for a month. We have been on multiple dates and even to his place where stuff happened. When he is talking about us he brings up the word ""relationship"". So my question is: what is the reason for him to match with my best friend last night on Bumble (also it said that he is looking for something casual) ? Why would someone do that in the beginning of a relationship and more what do you think I should do? I am aware that the trust I ve managed to build will never be the same again.

We pretty much discussed about everything like about the future, what we want and all that stuff. We were meeting like once a week and we had sex on the 4th date. In the morning, the next day it felt like she was even more into it, just more clingy, grabbing hands and wants to do stuff together so we went out to eat during the day and I had to leave after and said goodbye. We texted a bit after that, just normal conversation but the next week she was having the exam week so when we went out to eat she said something like don't talk to me, don't text me, don't meet me something along those lines, so before the exam week started I just texted her if she was ready and stuff and she replied pretty quick. And then on Monday I just sent her a good luck message and nothing else, since I figured she just wanted to be focused on the exams. But she replied on Wednesday, saying that she is done and I replied with a few words and that's it but she haven't read the message. So I messaged her again on Sunday to see how she's doing and haven't read the message on FB as well even though I have seen her go online a few times. So I waited the next day and texted her directly on messages if everything was okay and still nothing. We pretty much texted everyday and she usually responds pretty fast, the latest would still be the same day.

last night I ask out the bartender (had dinner at a bar while high, she rejected so after that I went for a walk to my favourite spot to vape my weed it's a park overlooking the river valley by a bridge in my city, I was chilling for 10 minutes feeling high when I saw a cute girl with headphones on walked pass me, peaking my interest I looked to where she was walking to she sat on a bench about 100m away so I walked to her.

on my approach I decided to walk in front of her since it was 9pm and very dark but not too dark to where we couldn't see each other's face, when I was in her line of sight I enjoyed the scenery then turned around and waved at her pulling out my vape since I noticed she was smoking weed oil.

she took her headphones off and said hello after she saw me wave that's when I decided to come closer and say "" good evening it's a beautiful night tonight"" and she agreed after which I asked her if I can join her on the bench to which she said yes.

we talked about the scenery and how photogenic it was that's when she brought up that she's a photographer and her clients of course we talked about the worst ones she had dealt with, I asked her if she ever work with kids and those happen to be her favourite.

we talked a bit more we brought I up our families she brought up her cousins and I brought up my nephews, I felt a connection something I haven't felt in a long time so I made my move, I told her the reason why I approached her is because I made a rule to ask out a girl once a weekend, she responded "" wow that is very very bold of you! I've tried but my anxiety gets in the way""

I laughed and said "" yeah I've been looking to get out there and build my confidence back up after being on dating apps since my early 20's"" (I'm 29 male) she then replied ""well I'm sorry to say but i'm not looking into dating since I've just gotten out of a relationship you were very smooth though"" I said ""all good I knew the odds were against me but I wanted to try anyway because had we met on a dating app this amazing conversation wouldn't have happened, maybe we can exchange numbers and get to know each other see where it goes in the future?""

she then gave me her number now I know I'm supposed to wait before texting but I couldn't wait this was a major accomplishment for me so I texted her and said ""hey ..... it's me ...... it was a pleasure meeting you, you made my night tonight. you are cute  :)"" she replied when I was sleeping ""it was nice to meet you! :)""

this was life changing for me I wasn't nervous, no anxiety, but most of all we were laughing and having fun!!!! I left smiling the entire way home yes I was high but I was proud of myself and meeting her made my night.

We text all day long, every day. Goof off, tease each other, flirt a little here and there. We have a lot of fun together when we hang out, he never turns me down to hang out when I ask him, but he does necessarily make plans to hang out. He just asks me to play video games with him, which involves either facetime or talking on the phone when we do for hours and hours. We just really mesh and get along so well, we just click. I am very interested in this guy, but I've also not really indicated that I wanted more out of fear of losing the friendship.. (and there's the background info). 

A couple of weeks ago, he was talking to my friend and mentioned how blunt and honest he is with his friends and how he tends to be able to get a good read on people. So, I turned to him and asked what he thought about me and he just kind of clammed up. Then I said in a kind of joking/laughing way, ""I mean, if you're gonna be mean and super blunt, and hurt my feelings, then don't"" and he laughed, ""no, no, I wouldn't. I can just be blunt about things is all."" Later that night, I texted him and said, ""So, I really do want to know what you think of me, what you're 'read' on me is."" and he responded something like, ""it's too much to text out, I'll tell you next time we play a game or in person. but I promise you, it's all good things, except you tend to hide your feelings. but other than that, it's good things, don't worry."" So of course I asked him what he meant by I hide my feelings, and he refused to answer. For weeks, I've been trying to get him to tell me and he keeps finding excuses! Finally, a few days ago, I saw him in person, it was just he and I standing there alone, so I asked him. He got this huge smirk/smile on his face and laughed and said, ""nah."" I practically begged him, and he hesitated and all he said, ""you're a very outgoing person, social with others and you start talking more when you get nervous."" I told him he was right, but I knew there was more by the way he looked and because there's no way he avoided telling me that for weeks or couldn't type that out in a text. He added, ""and you're an extremely funny person."" I said that I knew there was more, he laughed and smiled and said, ""oh look at what that sign says.."" and tried to change the subject. I asked him to please just tell me, and he said that he would next time we play video games. Mentioned it through text last night, jokingly because he mentioned being blunt, I said ""speaking of being blunt.."" and he just said, ""hmm. I seem to have not read your last message, what did it say? weird."" He's just avoiding it and won't tell me.  
Sorry for the book, but I felt I really had to give the context for it to make sense. reddit.. what on earth could be the possible reason he is avoiding SO incredibly hard just telling me his opinion of me? My thoughts are either he's avoiding because if he tells me, it will reveal how he feels about me OR he knows how I feel and just wants to try and avoid the subject completely so I don't say how I feel.

I’m the type of person that doesn’t really want to know about your past, just expect him to be respectful if an awkward situation arises and not message your ex’s. The first two months of us dating I saw that he had been messaging his ex. It was nothing scandalous just sending memes. I thought It was not appropriate and he said they were just friends. I said I’m not comfortable with it and if you are going to continue I have to decide if I want to stay or leave.  He stopped messing her but she still follows him and his mom on Instagram. It bothered me but I let it go unit about 5 months ago when she started liking his moms picture of me and my boyfriend with his fam. I told him it make me feel uncomfortable and he just didn’t get it and said he doesn’t contact her so why does it matter. He told his mom it bothers me and she said “I’m not going to block somebody because somebody told me to” she is the type of woman that didn’t like when she is told to do something and said it’s her Instagram she can do what she wants to. And my boyfriend agrees with his mom. She took a pic over the weekend and my feet looked funny because the way I was sitting made them look crooked and I joked about it in the group chat and posted a meme making fun of my feet and cropped the pic and said much better. Everybody in the group chat laughed and liked my meme about my feet and how embarrassing it was. Of corse she posted the pic with my feet in it not the cropped one that night. normally I wouldn’t care About what she post but I know his ex is going to see it and it just makes me uncomfortable. Am I being sensitive, just seeing her like pics of me with him and his fam makes my blood boil.

I had another date planned and figured id humor it since I told her I would and we ended up walking right past the first girls front porch and went to a store she goes to.

I wouldn't expect there to be if she's feeling the same way. Or was. 

I told her how great she is and then went on a walk with someone else right past her porch. That doesn't send the same message. It says it's I'm untrustworthy and slimy and I'm not. I feel terrible about not canceling the date to begin with let alone walking right through her neighborhood. That wasn't planned but still. How the fuck does that even happen.

I am in my mid 30's and I will be traveling to a major city (2-3 hours away) for a concert in a few weeks. I will be hanging out in the city for a few days (turning it into a mini-vacation). I am seeing an artist who is on my bucket list to see live and I have 2 tickets. I bought the extra ticket simply because they were inexpensive and I figured I could take a friend with me if they wanted to come (or a girlfriend if I happened to have one at the time the concert rolled around). However, I have no friends or family able to make this journey and no significant other at this time. I also have the added complication of being an incurable cancer patient (hence the ""bucket list"") with a form of disability. It is a bit of a risk to go alone, but the venue will have ADA accommodations and the venue has both vaccination and mask requirements. I am also perfectly capable of traveling about on my own as long as I take some precautions. I am fully vaccinated and will be double masking and the venue requires being vaccinated for entry.

The question:

So here I am... planning to travel 2-3 hours to another city for a concert with an extra ticket and a health condition where it wouldn't really be terrible to have another person along for the ride (even if it's not required), and no date or friends to take.

What would you do? I have been considering creating a tinder or something JUST for the purpose of finding a potential date (in the city where the concert is) for the evening (providing them a ticket to the show and perhaps taking them out for a meal afterward if they wished). No expectations or anything. It could be a bit awkward perhaps since I don't live in the area and there would be requirements (like they would need to be vaccinated and potentially be up to help me in the rare rare chance I have a flare-up of side effects).

Quite honestly I am not sure what to do. Would you just forget about the 2nd ticket? Give it away that evening? Use tinder to find a date taking into account the additional circumstances? Some other course?

We ended up hanging out for a few hours after our game and had a great time. She even found an excuse to get my number. 

I texted her a couple days later and suggested we meet up for a drink over the weekend to which she replied “that’s really sweet, but I’m busy this weekend.” 
The fact that she didn’t suggest an alternative date was enough for me to think she wasn’t interested so I didn’t push.

I saw her the next week at skee ball and we ended up staying at the bar pretty late again together. At one point I mentioned that I hope I didn’t make her uncomfortable asking her out and she replied “not at all, I was actually just busy.” I then jokingly said something like “so is it a never gonna happen or a maybe.” She replied saying “it’s a maybe.”

I know pushing any more will lead no way so I let it go and stop thinking about her until this weekend I get a text from her at 12am on Saturday night saying she was at a bar near my apartment. The text also included a selfie of her and our other friend from skee ball. I just responded with “very cute, looks like you two are having a fun night.”

I'm early twenties, he's late twenties. We've been on 6-7 dates. He asked me to be his girlfriend weeks ago, but I haven't given him a straight answer. Basically told him that I will be his girlfriend if my parents approve of him, because their approval is very important to me. 

He lives an hour away and makes the drive to come see me every time he has a day off work---which is only like 1-2x per week. He's very busy with work at the moment. So any free time he has he wants to spend it with me. He's a very sweet guy. A few times a week I'll wake up to a good morning paragraph where he'll talk about how he is so lucky to have met me, and how God answered his prayers, and how I'm his dream girl. Today he sent me one basically saying his intention is to marry me one day. 

But I can't tell if I truly like him. I have basically been single most of my life, and I have always wanted a relationship. This is the first guy has been 100% into me---I've dated other guys but I've always liked them more than they liked me. With this guy, I can't tell if I'm just not used to this type of situation and I'm giving it a chance, or if I'm just not that into him. Part of the issue is that I may not be 100% attracted to him---maybe only 60% attracted...he's tall and athletic, but it's little things like the fact that he's starting to bald. However, people's looks tend to grow on me the more I like them---just hasn't happened in this case yet.

Everything was going well. I was planning on asking her to be my girlfriend in the next few weeks. 

We couldn’t see each other for 3 weeks due to some schedule conflicts and then me falling sick. We communicated everyday as usual though. It was during this time that I realised how much I missed seeing her. I enjoy the physical presence of people I date. I like to touch them, so there’s no surprise there. I was if anything excited by my growing feelings towards her. 

We finally met last weekend. I thought there’d be sparks flying, lots of passion, and what not since it had been a while since we saw each other. Nothing. Felt like she was trying to maintain a physical distance. For example, if I held her hand, she did nothing. No tightening her fingers around mine. She paid more attention to her phone than me. The little that we did talk, I paid extra attention to what she was saying. One of which was her looking for houses even outside the state we live in. I wanted to process it first before having the talk. 

When I deeply thought about everything we’ve talked about, I realised that it’s likely she’s looking for something casual because of where she’s at in her life. I think I overlooked all the obvious because of how excited I was by the prospects of a new relationship.

So after that, I asked her what she was looking for in terms of the outcome of us dating. Her response was as expected. I’m glad I know now and can keep my feelings in check. I guess I’m just a bit afraid by the fact that it’s easy to say but in reality super hard to control your own feelings. Before her, I just wasn’t able to get myself interested in the people I was going on dates with. With her I felt chemistry very instantly. I genuinely look forward to spending time with her. Last weekend was the first time I was bored. I guess the second albeit smaller fear is her trying to make it super obvious that it’s casual (through actions like constant texting while on dates) is just not going to make this fun or worth it anymore. Which makes me sad. I’m okay with an expiration date, but only if it doesn’t feel restrictive in terms of natural progress and bonding.

There are a lot of people in my life telling me that the woman I have been hanging out with likes me, but I am not so sure. Maybe the opinions of others that I don't know could come in handy.

I've missed signs in the past from other women, and I'm also making an attempt to move on from someone who passed away in 2018. It's been a tough few years.

Here are some signs that people suggest she might be into me:

* I've called her about five times in the last few months (most of them to make plans). My calls have never made it to voicemail or beyond three rings (she even answered when she was feeling unwell, and she sounded unwell).
* I don't text her very much. But when I do, the longest response time to date has been a whole six minutes and this was during a time when she'd be working.
* She's started copying my slang, jokes and ethnic jokes. She laughs every time I make any of these jokes as well.
* When I interact with her on Snapchat, she often sends a selfie with her message, instead of just typing it like most people. I quite enjoy this, as I love seeing her face.
*  I called her twice one night. The second time, I said I would have texted her the details for the next time we'd hang out, but I wanted to hear her voice again. She giggled with a higher tone than usual.
* She recently attended a wedding and she sent me pictures of herself and her family almost a week before posting it on social media.

I saw a post, just now actually, about the monotonous nature of this sub. The way that people will consistently complain about the same issues they have, the same complaints about dating or girls or boys in life that have hurt them. Each shouting out another failure into the void, each with the same reasons and asks. I'm not above this myself, I made two posts on this sub and both asking for support for a recent breakup I had. While I didn't get much response here, I did find it elsewhere and am doing 10x better now. Minor hiccups here and there but that's not for this post. I want this post to be about that relationship and why, despite it ending, it was a resounding success. I'm 5'5 and slightly overweight with a beer belly that a middle aged dad that goes fishing every Tuesday would be proud of. I'm 20, I don't have hobbies past playing games, I worked at Target's drive up department, I didn't even have a car, I was a virgin and I lived with my mom. Every girl I had met at work that I even had a remote interest in either had a boyfriend, wasn't looking for one or was interested in someone else. It sounds like a classic hopeless redditor who frequents a certain sub. I had even thought I wouldn't find a partner for YEARS past then, although the thought didn't depress me. It just felt like a fact. Out of the blue, or red in this case, a new girl had just been hired and was assigned to my department. Her name was Mary (not really but privacy and all that). Now Mary is cute and beautiful, taller than me, energetic, funny, sociable. She's the essence of a go-getter, always wanting to do more and be more. She had just gotten out of basic training actually after doing so well that instead of being kicked out for an injury that really should've just excluded her they tried to have her recycled (which is also why she left, didn't want to go through BCT again). I could go on for centuries and still never get to even 1/4th of what makes her amazing. I was assigned to train her for drive up and so I was with her for two days in work. We hit it off amazingly as friends, quickly getting to texting and even hanging out outside of work. I was definitely the one to ask to hang out a lot though. Anyway after all this, she had gotten the idea that I might've liked her, which was completely true. I did just like her at the time, an interest of some kind but I wasn't 100% sure just yet. So with that in mind one day at work, this was when covid was starting to go down a bit, I got a little touchy with her at work. Nothing crazy just a bit of poking her side or giving her back a pat, small things. I'm normally an extremely touchy person with friends and since covid was going down I was getting comfortable doing it again with everyone, but that also meant her. She took that and later that day called me. This call was one of the most important ones we had and it all started with: ""Hey did you get touchy with me cause we're friends or cause you like me?"" Now I was in shock! I wasn't ready to admit it just yet, I couldn't tell if she was even remotely interested in me at the level I was with her. So I panicked and said ""Oh yea that's for friends it's normal."" Trying to play it off all cool, horrible idea: Remember lads, just be honest.  Anyway, we chatted a bit after that and she sounded a little disappointed. After the call I freaked out, I called my friend, I texted my work pals, I talked to my step-brother, I stared at my phone, at the call log. I was a wreck thinking I just blew my chance with someone that might've actually liked me! The next day, I buckled down and decided that no. I can't just let this end this way. So with the anxious weight of a thousand ""what ifs"" I called her and told her ""Heyyy..so what if it was both?""  And that's how it started. We started working on our relationship, I met her mother, she met mine, we hung out daily and got to know each other so well. She loved watching me play Apex (despite me actually being more of a fighting game fan, I played FPS' just for her.) and I loved going on these insanely long walks with her. She started teaching me to drive, I shared with her a board game called Sequence that she absolutely adores even to this day. We progressed, holding hands, cuddling, being close with each other, revealing demons to each other, she even started trying to have me be more open with myself. I would hide burps, be worried about how I looked with her, do all these small things out of fear of the small things being judged and she told me that none of it mattered. Cause she loved me and I loved her. We kissed and we even got so far as to start having sex. She took my virginity and I could never have asked to have lost it any other way. The best thing she ever did for me though wasn't the sex, it wasn't the rides she'd give me, it wasn't all the driving lessons she had her mom help me with, it wasn't watching me play Apex for however long. It was her care, her love and her drive. Especially her drive. She had motivated me to become better. I have no passion, inherently. I've never really had one. I never had motivation, a hunger or a yearning for something more. But she pushed me, there was a new and better job that I could work and she pushed me to take it. I wanted to do both but wasn't sure if I could handle it, she pushed me again knowing that I could. I was ready to keep putting driving off, to be okay with my getting my license ""whenever it happens"" but she said that it wasn't good enough. That I had to try harder. So I did. I practiced with her more and more, I looked nice and went to kill it at the interview, I took a bus for hours and then went to work right after a physical after having already missed it from someone else messing up a couple days earlier because of the force that she gave me. The momentum I've built up. Mary is a shooting star and I was the flame that surrounded her, burning brighter by the speed at which she sped through the sky. Of course though, the ending was already known for this tale. I had done some pretty big slip ups, I risked my job after smoking weed, my mom had backed out of practicing with me since Mary was doing it so much, I had some ditzy mistakes with the job that made it look like I didn't care, I pushed myself so hard for a friend that didn't even warrant my effort despite the protests from Mary. All of this built up and on one trip that we took together with her family, she finally saw the truth. You see earlier on in the relationship, because of past trauma, she had lost her ability to love herself. She was in a horrid, dark place in her mind. But then I came along. I came and shone a light of childlike, immature wonder, of unconditional love, of a down to earth, day by day viewpoint that she didn't have because of that go getter attitude. She was always looking too far ahead to see the present but I could bring her back to it. All of this, for her, gave her a new breath at life in the way of loving herself again. But even if all of those qualities that she loved and adored about me, that helped her out from that wretched headspace, were something she did love. Her new thought process let her see something new, let her reevaluate her wants in a boyfriend, her wants in her life, in her future, in what would make her happy. I'll shorten this part since I do have the breakup in another post, but yes. She ended it. It tore me apart for a while, two months now. But now I can see that despite that pain, despite feeling as though I suffered a great loss, I had actually come out better. So did she. We both improved as people because of each other. I now have a car, have both jobs, have a want to be better in some way, I have a stake in the fight for myself now. She loves herself, she's gotten a whole host of new and supportive friends, she's on track to pass her college career from the tutoring I gave her and she feels so much more whole than she did before. So yes. This is a success story, even people like me can find love that will change the course of your life. People like us. Short, fat and with no hobbies. Yet here I am, tearing up at the memories of a love I'll never forget.

I have a pretty good career and some hobbies/interests. I do yoga and am fit and probably above averagely attractive for my age. 

My life is very very solitary though. I probably have undiagnosed high-functioning autism. I was ""selectively mute"" as a child and basically still am. I am very socially avoidant. I haven't had a real conversation with another human being in years. In general I prefer thinking and being in my head...but ideally I would like to have a boyfriend/husband. I feel like a freak at work (everyone is married and has kids...I don't fit in a relate to people). 

I do not watch tv or movies at all because I feel like they are brainwashing. I am anti-vax and see myself as an alchemist/gnostic. I am open to a lot of conspiratorial ideas. I also have a masters degree and am ""educated"". I have some trashy tattoos from earlier in my life when I thought it was funny to disrespect myself in this manner. I would now be embarrassed to get naked in front of a new man and show him my tattoos, as they are not a reflection of who I am now. It'd be very expensive to have them removed and I don't have anything I particularly want to get tattooed over them to cover them. 

My lifestyle is unhealthy. I go to work, do yoga, smoke pot and watch youtube. Marijuana and youtube are my addictions. And sometimes I get addicted to masturbating and porn and sometimes exhibitionism (showing myself on camera). 

I feel like a total loser that nobody would want to date. Last time I put myself out there, I had a one night stand and then he wouldn't talk to me again. I assume I was too weird but I don't know cause he wouldn't tell me. I don't want to use a dating app again because I feel like this is a typical dating app scenario and it is not good for my self esteem to be used and left like that.

I told her who told me and of course, she was mad but not at me.

I'm a late bloomer, I'm in my late 20s and only started putting myself out there recently. I met someone also late 20s, we've hung out a few times and have been intimate. we've been seeing each other over a month, once a week/two weeks. He has made it clear that he does not want something serious, he's focusing on his career right now. As for me, I'm open to both casual and serious. I think. I like the fun and intimacy. I don't like it when he doesn't reach out for long periods of time though. I know myself, I can get needy (although I don't show it and stew in my own neediness) and I get in my head when he mentions his women friends, one of whom he's sleeping over at this week . I know I really shouldn't feel like this because things are casual. He's very respectful though, he buys dinner and cooks for me, and always reminds me that I don't owe him anything.

I'm trying to figure out if it's a good idea to keep this thing going, especially because some of my needs aren't being met- consistent communication and caring if I'm even alive those days we don't talk to each other. At the same time though, I do like spending time with him when we do, and it's nice to have some fun and intimacy in my life right now. Ultimately I'm seeking a long-term serious relationship but since I can't find that right now, this set up seems pretty good? In the back of my head though, I'm asking myself if I'm wasting my time. I dunno. To add, I'm not good at seeing multiple people, though I probably should get better at that. 

I know I have to talk to him about how I'm feeling, we're pretty open and talk about anything. In the beginning he told me he won't be sleeping with other people once we start but I still don't know if that's the case, I'll bring it up. I think we just both need to be explicit, especially me.

I’m also studying for a masters degree. My friends describe me as caring and ambitious. However, whenever it comes to guys I haven’t had much luck yet. My pattern usually looks like this: 

A guy I’m not really attracted to approaches me - I want to give him a chance because looks are not everything and personally matters way much more to me - he starts chasing me - I’m careful because I don’t want to get hurt again - After a while I let my wall down - and he’ll slow fade or ghost me (for another girl). 

Does any of this sound familiair to you and if so, how did you break this pattern?

She followed me on Instagram first, and I accepted her request. I did not who she was, but she knew, probably she saw me in a class at Uni. Anyway, I messaged her first and we started speaking.

Fast forward, few days later I asked her if she wants to go out, and she instantly asked me when I was available. We set a date, went out past Friday for a drink. All went good for a first date, got to know each other and everything. She looked interested too, at least from what she was saying. She even said I did very well for messaging her first time. I like her. No physical contact btw.

The next day after 1st day I message her asking how she is etc, we just talked a bit that's it. The following day she messages me first asking what's up etc. So we both initiated first afterwards.

Fast forward again so I don't become tiring, I asked her few minutes ago ''So when do you wanna go out again?'' and she asked me when I was available. Which means we will go out again pretty much.

My question is, can her agreeing to a 2nd date it be out of politeness? How frequent is that?

I tend to overthink such things despite this not being my first date ever. Things like why did I message her for the 1st and 2nd date and not her? Maybe because I am used to girls showing more affection (past date for example I had her messaging me everyday nonstop), so this looks a bit odd to me.

She was in love with me, but sadly I wasn't. I just couldn't, and I hate myself for it. She was pure love and affections. Perfect in many ways but I just couldn't see the quality time we were supposed to be sharing. I enjoyed being with her, but I wasn't seeing the things I saw in other happy couples. 

We had fun together, but I feel the activity we were having was the main thing that interested me. For example, watching a movie together? The movie itself was my interest, not sharing quality time together (do I make sense?). We also played a lot of videogames.

I have to be honest, some part of me didn't think we were meant to be together, and I believe I unconsciously self sabotaged the relationship, eventually achieving the purpose. Mainly by ignoring her and focusing on my job and hobbies.

This is not the first time it happened to me. It was the same story with my last two GF. They loved, I didn't, I sabotaged, and it ended. 

I don't know why I can't be in love. I never had, and I don't know if I ever will. 

Obviously I don't expect any of you to get all psychological because this is just a post and none of you know me. 

I just want to know your opinion on this: When you sabotage your relationship, or if you feel like me and think you can't love, is it because you have a problem or your partner just isn't for you?

That is the big and head hurting question I can't answer. I don't know if I should have worked on myself and just learn to love this beautiful girl that loves and admires me, or just accept that if she didn't spark me, it meant that we were not supposed to be together. 

I always thought that when you find the right person, all your insecurities are casted away, and the relationship would be easy (at least at first). I know it shouldn't be forced like I felt right?
