He is super caring and loving, cooked for me and respect me- just great in general. However, when we don’t spend time in person he just disappeared.

So I called him and expressed I feel rejected and feel kind of disappointed because it feels like he doesn’t care. He was very open communicated that he knows but he wants to take things slow because he only got out of long term relationship for half year.

We were supposed to do it today but two days ago we were trading messages and out of nowhere she started talking shit about my hair (for reference i usually style it in an elephant's trunk pompadour or something similar). She called my hairstyle weird and lame, saying i'd be far more handsome with a ""normal"" cut.

I felt so disrespected that i didn't even answer, i just blocked her. I felt so relieved after and didn't feel any guilt at all. I mean, it probably wouldn't be a good experience to have my first time with a girl who doesn't respect my hair.

My friends, however, don't think the same as i do. She told some of them i blocked her and they asked me why. After i explained why they started calling me all sorts of names and saying i'll die a virgin if i don't compromise.

Used to promise to share socials in past and even share passwords. Concerned I’m getting played?

I made a friend online about half a year ago, we connected really well and it later sort of shifted to us now being basically together just without the labels. We’re taking things really slow to really get to know one another before we make it official.. But we’ve both agreed to be loyal to each other too. The thing is we have only texted. This is my first ever long distance ‘relationship’ and I have some rules about this all for my own protection I guess.. I refused to date him until I received a few calls (just to make sure he’s who he says). But there’s been a lot of other bumps. 
Many times over in the beginning he’s kind of made me insecure about his loyalty.. But we talked it all out and I grew more trust for him eventually.. But, at the beginning he would talk to his very toxic ex still and this made me uncomfortable, so he agreed to stop talking to her (since she was always also trying to seduce/manipulate him as well). I trust him when he said he would stop talking to her, but I’ve also seen her socials, she posts a lot about exes and I’m scared some things are about him.. He does tell me when his ex hits him up though, or has, and he doesn’t like my ex being around either, so I hope he’s respecting me as much as I do him by not giving our toxic exes attention.. But anyways, I think he has something related to calling coming soon as a surprise, so I’m more concerned he’s actually just playing me.. He tells his friends and others about me, so I’m not a secret or anything and he’s done some very sweet things.. But he lied about something recently. A while ago I asked if he’d post me if we were official, on his other socials (I only had him on discord and reddit and our texts). I don’t really use social media much, and he said he didn’t really either, and I believe that. Back then (a few weeks ago) he said he would and if I really wanted he would literally give me his passwords, I declined that, but I trusted him about that all (that I’m not being hidden). But recently, I asked if I could have his socials now (because I have pretty much everything else, including his address). The socials being things like his instagram and twitter, etc. But recently he said eventually, so to be patient, and I was ok with that but it was sketchy to me (Because why can I have an address and not your socials??). So I said that was ‘dumb’ but that I would accept that, then he blew it up saying I was overthinking again (which was an issue but I told him I would trust him more). But I did start to overthink due to his reaction after that.. He told me before he had alts and then some socials with his real information (real name, etc). But i’ve never seen an account with his real name w photos of him (yes I looked him up).. He’s literally sent screenshots of chats from socials. But with this recent argument he said he “didn’t have socials,” that his other socials were deleted when he graduated high school. This led to a big issue and eventually he just sent me an alt. He basically said I didn’t need them because he never used them, just to chat with people (But I just wanted to feel more in his life and to feel more comfortable and trusting). But the thing is this was an issue because another ex showed up recently, via his socials. He doesn’t consider this girl an ex because he didn’t take her ‘seriously’ but they were intimate.. So knowing he’s talking like a friend to someone like that is bothersome, but I let it go. But the thing is, since she’s been around he stopped being as intimate w me.. But this could be coincidental, because he has been under a lot of stress from college work recently which can be a mood-killer. But he says shes now a “friend.” But I have a hard time accepting that (he used to be a bit of a ‘ho’ I might add, but not for a few years). He says he wants a serious long term relationship with me and he does give me plenty of attention and care and reassurance. I’m just scared I’ll get my heart broken.. The other day we had a stream on discord (not call, just stream), and he kept acting overly cautious about me seeing his discord.. I think he was trying to hide the chats so I’m concerned he’s been talking flirtatiously with many women really. Or maybe its even his serious ex in there. I have no clue. I’m trying so hard to trust him but he’s not really granting any room for trust. And I know if I bring this up it’ll be a big issue, because I’ve already stressed him out so much from my overthinking already and I don’t want to stress him anymore.. But this all feels too illogical for me to trust. I just want a second opinion, is it obvious I’m getting played?

Kinda confused. But let me stress that I had no real expectations nor am I owed anything 

For the past few months I’ve been talking to someone online through ig. I guess things picked up to a significant weekly frequency within the last 3-4. We were at the point of sending effort text paragraphs to one another. I was enjoying the effort because flowed well and we have mutual interests, which obvious kept it going over the months. Just gradually increasing over time, monthly to eventually weekly with some down time here and there. I didn’t act on it sooner just because I wasn’t too sure and hesitated due to multiple factors, covid, her being super beautiful and smart lol. 

But once we started sending long walls of text I told myself I can’t keep doing this indefinitely, right?
And it really amped up this past couple weeks. Like multiple days of this. Even like them going as far as saying “I didn’t forget about this ive just been busy, wanna put effort into my reply” which I thought was awesome and thoughtful. I’m trying not too over emphasize it, but it just seem more effort expended than your typical interaction online. So I assumed there was interest. 

Thought we were vibing to a level worth exploring. Then came vday and she posted a photo with her (presumably new) guy. Guess I waited too long to ask her out? I don’t think they’ve been a thing for long, or how serious it is, but who knows.

I’ve had a friend tell me I should still try to ask her out, which immediately sounds like a bad move lol, but I’m not even sure if we’ll still be talking in the same capacity now. I don’t wanna ghost her on future convos. But I’m not sure if I should put in the same effort considering she’s taken. 

I know it’s not a big deal. I just have No clue why someone would engage me with that much effort if they’re dating someone? Like an unusual amount of effort that you’d put into getting to know someone you might be into at least initially, when typically someone who’s already seeing someone tapers that off?

We shared some intimate chats, and we both told each other that we liked one another, he told me that we had a great connection and I felt so good after I left.

How and when exactly do you like/want to be approached?

First things first, I sympathize with the fact that the majority of you are probably very strict with your preferences on this due to the sheer amount of unwanted creepy ""come-ons"" you all receive on a daily basis. 

Is it safe to say that public social events/areas are the only avenues for us to approach and introduce ourselves to you? I get it that it's definitely the ideal case because no one wants to be bothered when they're out shopping for groceries after a long work day (for example). Of course there are countless stories of couples meeting from disjointed random encounters where a conversation was started and it all flourished from there. So I'm really just stumped on what me, a guy, is supposed to do.

I'm asking because not only is there the fear of rejection that plays into the nature of approaching women for myself (I think it's safe to say every guy goes through this).

I’m a straight guy, so to produce this theoretically, I would want a straight guy in a loving relationship to strap a GoPro to his head and film, from beginning to end, a successful date with their loving girlfriend. (Obviously an absurd concept.)

If you watch porn, you only get sexual gratification. If you watch romantic comedy movies, you see intimacy from a third-person perspective. With relationship porn, you don’t have to try and visualize what first-person POV intimacy looks like; you have it and are fully able to perceive it. And replay it.  

I would contend that this would have pros and cons just like regular porn. The pro is that lonely people, probably mostly lonely men, have an outlet for their fantasies that reality can’t give them. That’s no different than porn or video games. Or movies or books. You can understand that some people would see this as their only option, i.e. dying people, disfigured people, or disabled people. 

If you can understand why people like drugs, you can understand why people would like this. 

The significant downside to this is that it would act as a pacifier to these lonely men. They no longer have the incentive to actually interact with women. Thus, they never achieve full intimacy in the realm of reality. However, it’s better than nothing. Millions of men die with nothing. At least with this, they have memories they can recall vividly. I’d pay money for a guy’s memories of him being on successful dates and spending time with a loving girlfriend. If I get that and form a relationship, cool. If I just end up with the memories, that’s better than nothing.

So, i agreed to it and went ahead and booked everything, we were speaking non stop for a good month and, at some point she mentioned her friends (who were a couple) were also in town and, wondered if i wanted to meet with them for some drinks which i agreed to &amp; we were excited and, kept talking about the things we were going to do.

At the beginning, it was just casual/fwb terms (we hadn’t done it yet just the vibes we gave &amp; discussed) for me to grow on her. But, i wanted to see how the date went to see how i felt. Just unfortunately she managed to break her ankle a week before but, still was determined to go ahead until she said couple days before the date it’d gotten unbearably worse &amp; had to drop, but offered to meet in couple weeks time if her ankle was better then. 

Ironically i bumped into her friends and, they said she was being genuine and she had said she likes someone but, couldn’t tell them who it was, for the guy to say “now that i know it’s you” &amp; i should go for it as im “a good looking lad” 

So i jokingly messaged her about it afterwards for her to deny it, and so we were texting talking about our weekends, wishing each other happy valentines &amp; saying that we missed each other until she suddenly replied to a message 5 hours later (when we’d usually been replying half hour at the latest) with a vibe that felt off but it contained ‘baby’ &amp; ‘babe’ and she hasnt replied since. This was Monday evening

But she posted on her snap yesterday saying she was on way to Newcastle, then my friend saw on her snap map that she was in a hotel, and she’d been there for 2 nights since, including with stories at this restaurant with food &amp; drinks.

We are both student workers at a restaurant on our college campus. He's really friendly, but also kind of nerdy. For the first several months, we would talk frequently. At first, I was the one always having to initiate the conversation, so I stopped. I only stopped for a day, though. That day, I said good morning to him when I came in, goodbye when I left, and I'd talk to him for work related stuff, but I didn't go out of my way to speak to him about trivial things. The next day, he came right up to me and started talking to me. He started initiating for a while then.

At work, he would frequently help me, even when I didn't ask for help. For example, we were both at the registers when one of my customers ordered a beer. Even though he already had his own customers, without even asking, he got a beer out from the fridge and opened it for me. There was one time when he asked me what I was doing that weekend (we asked each other that question frequently). I told him, and asked him what he was going to do. He then said that he was going to visit his friend at work. He said ""I'm not going to say no to bothering someone at work. I already bother you enough. Or maybe I should bother you more?"" I didn't know he was flirting then, but I do now.

Two weeks later, I invited him to my birthday party. I figured what better way to show him that I'm interested than by inviting him? I messaged him on Instagram. He messaged me back saying he wasn't sure, but that he'd let me know in a couple of days. That week at work, he was acting kind of distant. He wasn't necessarily cold, just not quite as receptive as he had been before. He told me later that he wasn't able to make it. For the next couple of weeks, he was distant. I never knew what I was going to get with him. Some days, he was talkative like always, and other days, he was avoidant. Keep in mind, the same week that I invited him to my birthday party, he accepted a promotion at work, so he has the title of department lead. Department lead is basically like assistant manager.

After about three weeks of the behavior, he's been acting somewhat back to normal again. Because of the new semester, our schedules don't match up as much anymore, so we see each other less often at work. However, he's been friendly like before. Today, I said hi to him, he said hi back, and I had to go sanitize tables. When I came back, he gave me a hi five and asked me how I'm doing. Today is Valentine's Day, and it could be a coincidence, but he's never done that before. We usually just say hi and that's it. In fact, he doesn't like touching people in general. At least, I've never seen him voluntarily touch any other coworkers.

I've really taken my time because you know how the story about the turtle and the rabbit goes (Spoiler alert: the turtle wins).

However, i have absolutely no idea how this whole dating thing works. I'm like a fish out of water. I have no friends of the opposite gender, and no idea how to get to know them. I do have male friends though. Homies, if you will. I have hobbies, but none of them are of the kind where i would get to meet girls. Also the hobbies that i would be interested in (but do not take part in) are very male dominated. I think i'm ready for a relationship. So, how do i meet girls? Any specific activities?

He made a b-line towards me, took me on dates, he’s very funny and charming, initially he was extremely nervous around me, couldn’t look me in the eyes when we’re at dinner and during sex etc. I’ve been weary of him because of how he’s treated other girls so I felt I couldn’t be myself around him for a long time, coupled with the fact that I felt very attracted to him so wanted to play it cool - so I found it hard to be let go.

We were at a party New Years eve, and I was in a room by myself. He’s tried to find me but he couldn’t, I came downstairs and he completely ignored me and wouldn’t talk to me. Eventually I gave him an ultimatum and he confessed that he thought I was getting with someone else. The next day all I wanted was a sorry I was being a dick but it took a lot of me pushing him away before he gave me a proper apology. 

Things became more consistent in January and we talked everyday and spoke about things we wanted to do, he asked me to spend his birthday with him. We planned to meet up last weekend of jan, I texted him on the day and he said he couldn’t come bc of family issues and tiredness etc. Then I waited a couple days and he didn’t text me so I text him asking if he still wanted reschedule and he ghosted me for a week. He came back apologising and gave various excuses and asked me to dinner. After this we spoke again but it was starting to fizzle again. 

Last weekend it was his birthday and I went not knowing where we were at, he greeted me with a kiss, told me I looked good, was introducing me to his friends (generally acting very boyfriend). The night continued until 5am, at which point my memory is very hazy. I think I asked him to come to the toilet with me, where I took my dress off to wee. Our mutual friend (boy) happened to be there washing his hand. He looked at me in disgust and said why are you naked to which I replied well I have to take my dress off to wee. I can’t remember what else was said but I think I must’ve felt pretty rejected so I said well it’s not like we’re seeing each other anymore you don’t get to see this (in a light hearted way) and asked him to leave. I went outside and went to hold his hand and turned around and said “let’s end things here it’s not working”. He was pretty angry, I accepted but asked him to please just tell me why he’s so annoyed. He refused and said I was being annoying, essentially shutting me down.

 I know he is someone that shuts down at the sign of weakness/conflict/challenging conversation. It’s ended and he hasn’t text me and he won’t. I’m having a hard time letting it go, I have anxiety over what I said and what he thinks and not having the chance to explain. I also feel so enamoured by him, he’s physically attractive charismatic and funny boy who I felt mutually liked me and that’s difficult to let go of.

Alright so I don’t really know how to start this, all I know is that I need advice and lots of it. So my boyfriend and I (f) started dating 2 years and a bit ago. In the beginning I was pretty clear, open and honest with him about my past relationships. I really liked him and wanted everything out on the table so that he felt comfortable knowing what he was getting into per say. (Side note: I am very aware you don’t owe your partner any explanation or answers to a time they weren’t in your life.) He was pretty honest with me as-well (at least so I thought). I ended up meeting one of his girl friends early on. Let’s name her Rose. She looks completely different to me for the record, dark features and colouring whereas I have light features and light colouring ( this is important later) anyhooo so we got along well I guess, I was being very kind and trying to adapt to his friends and fit in you could say. Then I find out him and rose actually had a thing like a week before he met me. One of his guy friends slipped it to me at a party assuming I knew. Now having a girl friend is one thing but having a girl as a friend who you’ve hooked up with and had a moment with is a completely other thing to me and honestly made me immediately once finding out uncomfortable. They clearly weren’t JUST friends in their time of knowing one another. I got mad, confronted my boyfriend at the time and he said he didn’t think it mattered because “he chose me” those were his words. Now many could say yes he chose you so don’t feel insecure and I agree but then why keep her around with me unaware of anything that happened between the two especially since I was so open and honest about my past partners and relationships. I’m not ashamed to admit I wanted her cut off. Turns out they didn’t even have a deep friendship. My boyfriend explained to me that Rose was just the girl all the boys invited around and that she got with everyone in his friend group. So I asked him out of respect for me to stop contact with her. He agreed seeing as he wouldn’t appreciate me keeping contact with any of my Exs even though him and rose didn’t make it to a relationship stage. ( funny enough he mainly says it’s not the same thing since they didn’t date) anyway so now she’s out of the picture and I’m getting my hair done a few months later and my boyfriend is walking around the mall getting some errands done whilst. Turns out he saw her and she ran up to him and gave him a huge hug. This in general pissed me off, I know for a fact if I saw any of my previous exes in person and let them into my personal space like that my boyfriend wouldn’t be happy. I saw this as double standards. After she hugs him she proceeds to ask if he’s still with me and he replies he’ is and says I’m getting my hair done at the moment. She replies where and asks my boyfriend if she can pop in and say hi to me. With this he sheepishly responded how he didn’t think that was a good idea. So tell me why I see Rose and my boyfriend entering the salon while I have several foils in my hair (not my hot girl moment since I was getting a full head of highlights) She comes up to me and goes on a speech about how I shouldn’t feel intimated and threatened by her and honestly her audacity pissed me off because I could tell she wasn’t being sincere by her tone of voice. She was more clearly trying to stir something in me and if I wasn’t in a salon I probably would’ve snapped. She said and I quote “I know me and (my boyfriend) have memories and history but you don’t need to be worried I’ll take him away” my response was immediately cut throat and shut her down. “Rose, I’m not worried, I’ll never be worried.” 
And then she proceeds to stand up, walk over towards my boyfriend - and say to him “ you know, you don’t have to be afraid to hug me in-front of your girlfriend…” and then goes into giving him a big hug and he HUGGED HER BACK.  This made me furious and I’m honestly surprised I got over it. I feel like my own boyfriend disrespected me and didn’t have my back. And when I said I didn’t appreciate what happened at the salon or prior he simply said he didn’t want to be mean and how it wasn’t a big deal. Fast forward to last year November. (November 2021) my boyfriend and I had a pretty big argument where we actually broke up for a day. First time ever. We made up afterwards but come to find out he messaged Rose the night of the day we broke up. And when I wanted to read his conversation with her over text he deleted it in front of me before I could see it. At that point I was seeing red but he sheepishly told me how she’s had a boyfriend for the past few months and how nothing in that chat was important. To this day I’ve never seen it and I have these moments where I remember and I get filled with anger and just feel so betrayed. Do I sound crazy? Am I the bad guy? And the one thing I know for sure is I can’t even go to Rose for the “truth” because she’d lie for him. Never the less, he hasn’t had contact with her since. But I just don’t know. To give more sense to the story the salon encounter was like 4 months into our relationship and the second encounter (phone texting ) was a year almost 2 years into our relationship. None the less I feel insecure when it comes to her and like she has some hold over my man because he’s never told her to back off for me. I also sometimes sit and wonder what he said in that chat with her…that was so bad..I couldn’t see? I really need advice. She’s not in our lives and I don’t think she is secretly but I feel like there’s a piece of the puzzle missing when it comes to those two. And honestly? I think there’s something I don’t know about. (Side note: I am aware I’m a jealous person, I find it easier to get jealous more than others…which is why i need another’s opinion on this) am I being jealous and crazy?

I'd sworn off online dating, but the pandemic is still in swing, making it harder to meet new people. So I tried again for online after a long time.

Like many others, I used this site a good decade ago when you could actually meet people on it. Now if you go for a free account, you sit there while the app tells you your profile is getting ""so many likes"", but you're not allowed to see them (and you get a whopping 10 likes a day).

Then you pay for the subscription and what ""likes"" do you have? Well for me, none of my ""likes"" were even in my state, and half of them weren't even in my country.

Are you gay and don't want to seen been by straight people? Well there's a setting for that, but it doesn't work. You'll see straight guy after straight guy unless you pay for the filter.

The interface is crap and weird to navigate. Once upon a time you'd just see a list of everyone in the area. Now you can ONLY see people via the Pass/Like feature which is simply a copy of Tinder. I've also yet to see a way to undo a ""Pass"" if you click the wrong button for someone.

Also, are you monogamous and only into monogamy? Too bad. You're going to constantly see non-monogamous couples and married people. Even with all the possible features unlocked, I've yet to find a way to filter them out in my preferences.

Right now I'm just glad I only paid the one month subscription instead of signing up for several months at once. Because it is absolutely non refundable. Yeah, I was duped because I'd remembered this awesome site where you could meet singles and trusted they wouldn't do me dirty like that.

And leaves me hanging because he made plans. Am I settling for someone who is too self-involved? Or am I overthinking and expecting too much?

I (25f) have been with my boyfriend (29m) for about two years now. In the beginning, everything was perfect. I had to move away within months of dating for grad school and we did long-distance and it went pretty well. He then moved to my city for half a year before moving abroad a month ago.

Since he has been abroad, and since our relationship has gotten more serious, things have been popping up that makes me feel like I am settling. One example is an argument we had the first week he moved abroad. He initially hid who he was hanging out with because it was a group consisting always of only females, specifically one girl and her group of friends. He says he hid this to avoid conflict with me. Logically, I understand but I also made it clear to him it was still wrong and he needs to do something to fix it rather than just say he realized and continue the way he has been. And this was leaving me hanging during the argument because he had plans with the same girls (to go to the beach, that he could not cancel apparently and already postponed for me). This went on for a while: he went out for dinner with the same girl two days later after I said I didn't feel comfortable with him going out alone so soon after finding out he hid her. To which he said he will not let me get in the way of his friendships and that I should stop controlling him and I should not judge her (which I did not even say btw) and he insisted that I was only uncomfortable because I was jealous, hung up, and went for dinner. Till the end, he never actually apologized and just said that he'll try to tell me the truth more often and instead put the blame on me for ""pressuring him"" to update me when he makes plans all the time and that he cant spontaneously decide to go to a club for example because he felt controlled, (the day before the beach he told me he was going to dinner and I didn't hear from him till 2am and texted him to check on him, to find out they ""spontaneously ended up in a club"", which I found super inappropriate considering the circumstances. He disagreed and said he was just being spontaneous and having fun and by being mad, I was making him feel bad). I explained time and time that I wasn't trying to control and the only reason I asked for updates was because, after what happened, I felt it was necessary to build back the trust, to show effort from his side. In the end, I basically gave up explaining my side because I felt it was driving me crazy not being understood and having it turned on me. Don't get me wrong, I do understand that it might be perceived that way by him, but I also explained why it was necessary so he understand. Things then eventually got better, he did update me more, but I still didn't feel understood and frankly felt manipulated. This is a point where I felt for him, he needs to be able to do what he wants, the way he wants to and I need to be okay with it, and only then he'll consider doing something for me, so long as it doesn't get in the way of his life too much..

Situation number two. Two days ago I got an IUD. This is something we've been talking about for months as he doesn't like using condoms and insists I don't take the pill to fck up my hormones and kept pushing the idea of an IUD. I did agree and brought up the cost multiple times but he said nothing to it. Let me point out in advance that I am in no way expecting him to pay for stuff for me and we have been splitting costs since the second date because I decided it was fair, he never said anything against it. So after I got the IUD and paid for it myself, he still hadn't offered to split the cost. So I end up asking him but in a nice manner (i jokingly said that I could give him a contract if he needed, so he can get his part back if we break up) to which he asks it is a joke and when I said no replies ""Oh it's not a joke. Yes sure if that's what you want, we can split it. But next time, talk to me first before spending money if you're planning on splitting it"". And honestly, this pissed me off so much. First, I think normal human manners would mean I shouldn't be the one to ask, but he should actually have offered. Second, I was only asking to split, if he was willing. I did not say he had to. Third, the fact that he turned it into a lesson for me, instead of just accepting and saying yes of course. Fourth, he has been aware of all the appointments I've been making and the fact that I was doing it. Fifth, I am a grad student surviving on scholarship and he has an insane amount of inheritance he's living on that he was once ""afraid"" I'd find out about. His thought process honestly baffles me. I then say I need to leave to calm myself and once I return, he never mentioned it again, goes out all night, and pretends like nothing ever happened. so I still covered the complete cost myself, which shows even more that he actually doesn't really want to? Or can someone be that forgetful?

some context; the initial spark between us was something out of a movie, and it ended rather poorly. the breakup dragged on for maybe 2 months, mainly because of both of us, and we don't talk anymore. i realized it was going to continue into an exhaustive and toxic cycle, and i made sure to end it in such a manner that there was never going to be anything to come back to.

firstly, i think the ways you and your partner deal with conflict should be the same. being a vocal and assertive person, my conflict response was always very communicative and conversational and my partner was a lot more avoidant and ""give me space""-based. although there is nothing wrong with that, i would try making sure that the ways your partner and you deal with conflict are similar. if they aren't, problems often will stay unresolved because a proper conclusion was never really reached. another thing i would suggest doing is analyzing how they react in conflict. do they use your insecurities against you? do they stonewall? i found myself stooping to this person's level, often engaging in negative, cruel, and insulting communication. although one person can be willing to communicate in a healthy way, you must understand that not all people have the maturity to do so as well. insulting, stonewalling, and being passive-aggressive is often easier and will be resorted to by these individuals.

secondly, pay attention to how their apologies are framed. oftentimes, when something was bothering me, my partner would instead invalidate or automatically assume a very defensive position.  remember, in a relationship, you both are fighting for the same team, not each other. make sure that your issues are heard and not disregarded. my partner justified their bad behavior on the premise that ""i \[me\] was acting poorly before."" be aware of those that justify their toxic behavior and use your past as the means to do so. in some sense, it is a form of gaslighting and sheer manipulation. to this day, my partner refuses to put their pride aside and never once commented on the weaknesses i pointed out in their character. remember, its easier to criticize others, but it takes strength and humility to realize your own flaws- this person had neither. you must make peace with the fact that some people **would rather point out flaws in others' character than make any attempt to analyze the faults in their own.** 

be very careful of those who refuse to admit their own faults. these people have often have never come to terms with their insecurities or other areas in their life where they lack control. in doing so, they lack the self-reflection or insight to respond to weaknesses in their character. this is a sign of emotional immaturity- don't mistake this for narcissism, this person just hasn't reached a point in their life where they are open, willing, or mature enough to analyze their behaviors to such an extent. 

remember that if someone blows up an issue to an extreme level, it could also be due to the fact that they lack security in that area of their lives, and take that issue as a personal attack rather than facing reality. i realized that i closed off many areas of my life as a result of this person, and couldn't speak to people that were in my circle as a result. i messed up my sleep schedule and oftentimes found myself giving up parts of myself to deal with this person's issues and found myself stooping down to this person's level in terms of toxicity. for example, this person had the capacity to recognize their destructive response to conflict, yet lacked the self-control or intelligence to adequately find a solution.

mind you, i did have many faults in this relationship and made many mistakes. i will be taking a lot of it as a learning process and am doing a lot better. i started focusing more on my professional life and reconnecting with those that my partner had made me get rid of for unwarranted causes. i don't think my ex was sick, but rather feel she was immature and lacked the simple understanding that you would need when involved in a relationship. i wish them the best and hope they work on themselves for whoever has them in the future. i did cross many lines in the relationship, but i don't regret it. if the line was here, i would be on a different planet, and in a weird sense, i find some comfort in that. it hurt ending it in the way i did, but i knew if i had let it continue, it would be worse for the both of us. in conclusion, be very very careful of those who lack the self-awareness to handle relationships. it will end poorly, and be horrible for both of you.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1159366,public,self,advice for those hopeless romantics,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/suamta/advice_for_those_hopeless_romantics/,no_ads,0,,,

I’m a medical student planning to pursue a surgical residency. I am always working, and I love it. 

Prior to medical school I dated a lot (with good results). Im decent looking and I have good social skills. After I started school everything changed. I became completely absorbed in the world of medicine and some days it’s hard to remember that anything else in the world exists. It’s brutal and exhausting but I love it. Im planning to pursue general surgery, which is notoriously brutal (80+ hour work weeks with 24 hour shifts every 3-4 days). 

I do have really incredible friends (also in medicine lol) - but I’m finding now that I really miss romantic intimacy. Someone who is “your person”. Someone to text throughout the day. Someone to share a bed with.  

I realize that you “don’t know until you try” but I just can’t imagine the kind of person who would want a partner with my lifestyle.

I've been dating for about 5 years now with little success. Only have had one serious relationship that crashed and burned. 

Now, at 25, I'm trying to find someone to be consistent with. They don't have to be serious, but I would like to have someone I can fool around and have fun with. 

However, a lot of guys I meet end up pulling away or saying goodbye after we've hit it off. It's frustrating because sometimes a guy wants a full-blown relationship, which I'm open to, but then just tries to hook up with me. I don't even talk about sex or sexuality much or if at all in because I don't want  people to get the wrong idea. I withhold that conversation for men I am interested in as more than FWB. 

Also, the guys who want a FWB consistently don't fulfill that or are open to doing it with me, then pull away. I keep pondering why this happens. I'm respectful, provide good conversation, and have my own separate life and provide for myself.

Read below for context*

&amp;#x200B;

* Around late December last year, a girl I dated very briefly last year hit me up out of the blue and invited me over and we've basically become regular FWBs since.
* I usually go over to her place multiple times a week (at least 2-3x) in the evening, we hang out and talk for quite a while, then have sex, and then keep talking in bed for a while afterwards. I usually stay the night (unless I have somewhere to be early in the morning).
* Recently I've had the chance to sleep with a couple of other girls and it just didn't feel the same as it does with my FWB, meaning connection wise (nothing worse on the physical aspects of things)
* I also enjoy spending time with her even when we don't have sex as we click well conversationally and in the intangibles I can't explain.  Time seems to fly by and I'm never in a hurry to leave when I'm with her.
* However, that's only when we're together in person. I'm not like thinking about her outside of when we're together.  While I enjoy meeting up with her, it's not like I have a big urge to see her or anything.  I also feel zero urge to do anything romantic with her or anything beyond our current arrangement of we hang out, have great chats and have sex.
* She hasn't said she wants more than just FWB; however, I'm not sure if her actions match her words (e.g. 9/10 times she's the one hitting me up and inviting me over, she's the one who's super cuddly and affectionate in bed after sex and doesn't want me to leave etc). She's also not inviting me to do anything else besides that. She's also the type to keep her cards very close to her heart with anything feelings wise.

So in a nutshell, my dilemma is that I don't know if I like her as my FWB (meaning the **friends** part of FWB) or if I really actually like her beyond that, like feelings wise.

It feels different than my normal casual sex hookups or even previous FWBs (more regular and a better connection).

It kind of feels like how I feel when I'm around a really close friend (just with added sex as well) but I'm not quite sure if my feelings go beyond that.

And it's just for class-related stuff, not casual stuff. And, ever since I was interested in her, I never showed signs. So, I feel like it will decrease my chances a little bit if I start late because since I never showed any signs of interest to her, she will probably be very surprised when I do.
