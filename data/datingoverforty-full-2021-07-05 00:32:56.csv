So, I'm new to this. Making plenty of mistakes already ;-) I've stated I'm a widow and looking for friendship. (Open to more but I still get triggered by day to day things, so I don't think I can offer anyone a fair relationship yet). Point being, I don't want to give anyone romantic notions.

Anyhow, I am curious about something here. 

When someone talks to you, saying they're a single parent, then mentions their job, hobbies etc. - is that an invite to ask about the family? I mean, if they mention a dog, I have no hesitation, but kids?

I feel asking about family indicates an interest beyond entry level friendship. And asking about kids is testing out a future?

Am I overthinking it? Do people like to talk to random strangers about their kids? Or is it more an early disclosure to see if the other person will cut and run?

Tomorrow comes, and I messaged her later in the evening. She responds pretty quick and we go back and forth for a while. She finally tells me to just text her and gives me get number. I text her when I get home and we text each other until about 1 in the morning. Conversations good, not to flirty but some innuendos from both of us.  Conversation ended with a good night and her saying she'd text me the next day.

Next day comes, and nothing. I knew she'd be busy because she had kinda a full day planned so I don't text her, wanting to see if she'd text like she said. But still nothing

Me: I'm good and you?
Them: What do you do for work?

Them: What? Why don't you work? How do you support yourself?
Me: I'm disabled. 
Them: What's wrong with you?
Me: Actually I would like to know a little more about you and if we are compatible first before divulging my personal medical history with a complete stranger.
Them: Well it's my right to know!!!! You have to tell me now!!!! 

Yea they freak out usually and even if I tell them they still want to know more.  How? Why? What am I doing about it? 

For the record,  I'm not in a wheelchair or paralyzed, maybe that's where people's mind goes.  But I would be in a mobility scooter. I have chronic pain,  fibromyalgia, peripheral neuropathy, sciatica, chronic low back pain due to injury, diabetic and anxiety/depression due to the physical pain/ limitations and loneliness.   

I cannot get past this block in conversation. It happens right at the beginning after hello,  what do you do for work. 

And I've taken this a bunch of different ways.  If I say no they freak out and can't get past this until I give them the info they want. If I give it early they still don't like me and ghost after I tell them,  and I'm mad at myself and feel like a fool again.  Damned if I do damned of I don't. 

What is the etiquette here? Do I have to tell complete strangers who have spent no more than one second talking to me my entire medical history?  And I've met people who after I disclose my issues,  say oh I have a health issues also.  So they don't feel the need to tell people anything, but I have to? Help!!

Like I really don't owe anyone this information.  It's private between me and my doctors.  But I feel I should tell them to weed out people who won't be interested or ghost me.  It's just the absolute fucking rudeness about the way they go about it.  Like I'm selling an item on ebay and I need to disclose everything about it.  I'm a person, not a object. Like I feel if they don't even care who I am as a person,  I'm immediately turned off by being treated like a piece of meat. 

So as you can tell,  I get very upset and have given up online dating again. ☹

Don't know of any other place to ask advice here.  There was a post I saw here where a woman says she meets men she thinks are gay.  It sort of sparked this post.

I am single.  I date when I find someone that I find suitable.  But I'm not a bedhopper.  I don't have parades of women in my life.

I have had high stress, high responsibility jobs until the Covid reset.
My last long term partner was also high stress, high responsibility.  To facilitate having free time, I hired a male valet.  He took care of my house, my clothes, my errands, and personal care and attire.  He also happens to be gay.  He is a huge help and she adored him for his giving spirit and time he opened up for me.

We broke up.  I have the same need for free time and have kept the valet.

So now to the dating scene.  I dont't pressure a woman to get to bed.  I mean maybe we sleep together by date 3 but there would need to be great chemistry   I can date for months before sharing my bead comes up.  

I am not a great cook but I can cook.  I do all of my homes colors and interiors.  I also put on a tool belt and boots and tear them down and rebuild them.  But women seem to focus on the fact that I cook, do my own interiors and have a male valet taking care of all he does.  And I don't pressure them for sex.

I am not sure how to proceed when a woman starts asking me about my life.  I am not ashamed of my life.  If I say I have a housekeeper that doesn't seem to cause a ripple in the flow.  If I say I have a male valet, the brow lift, the sudden processing of info, I can tell it's being processed in a different fashion. And they begin to pullback. 

If I don't disclose he is a gay male and they later learn, I feel like it would be worse.  If I don't bring it up, it will come up soon enough. 

So I want to hear from both men and women in this dating genre how you'd feel something like this gets meshed into the conversations.  I mean in dating you exchange things about your life.  But deep things come in time.  I don't think a valet should be something I keep for later like I'm trying to keep a secret.  If I was considering a LTR as things progressed and she didn't like it, I'd terminate him.  But I don't think keeping it a secret helps.

Met this lady online, we got along really well and quickly moved to texting.  We're both pretty busy so it was difficult to find a time to meet and after about a week of back and forth she left a text hanging so I just let things lie.  

A month later she texts me out of the blue, apologizing, saying her daughter had some health problems but all was good now and she wanted to arrange a video date.  I had some reservations about the video date but in the end it went really well and she was cuter and cooler than I expected.  

However I had some doubts because she's in a club that does these realllly intense, competitive athletic competitions that can take hours of a weekend day, and in the summers they compete a lot.  And it's co-ed.  Gotta admit it made me a bit self-conscious.  I go to the gym and am in good shape for my age but I'm also not some super ripped health freak.  Not to mention the time commitment she makes.  So after the video date I didn't contact her.  

A week later though I figured, wth, got nothing to lose and texted her and kind of told her about my hesitations.  She responded positively and we exchanged a few fairly banal texts until I texted her ""let's stop with the texting foolishness, how about a real date?""  And...silence.  

Then this morning, a month later, she texts me saying ""sorry I had some family problems but I'd like to find a time to have a coffee this week if you're up for it.""  

From the very beginning I was wondering if she has enough time to date, for reasons I won't go into here.  And my suspicions have sorta played out.  

But let's be frank, over the past 9 months I've been on dates with maybe 15 women and (I know this is gonna sound bad) she is in the top 3 in terms of attractiveness and intelligence.  Only problem is she's gone dark for a month on two occasions, although it may have been for good reasons.

I am 40, and lately I have been feeling dread that I will never find the person I will spend my life with. 

I gave up on online dating several months ago, hoping to meet someone in the real world. But it is more difficult than I imagined. Here is why. 

I am finding that even when I find people I am interested in, it requires such a perfect set of circumstances to open dialogue, that I can’t seem to find a way to take that next step. 

Right now there are two women who have caught my eye, and I would like to know better, but I haven’t figured out a way to engage them in such a way that it will not be taken in a bad way

The first is a neighbor who lives several doors down from me. She sometimes walks her dog, or checks the mail, but it is very rare that I catch her in time to chat. In the year I have lived here, I have had maybe three conversations with her, but nothing in the last several months. I don’t want to knock on her door, because if it turns out she is not interested, that could make living in such close proximity very awkward very fast. 

The second woman is at a place where I am working. I took a summer job, and I will only be there for a month longer. The thing is, she is technically my supervisor, so trying to approach her with romantic intentions can turn very bad if it turns out she is not interested. 

So here is the dilemma. Yes, there are plenty of fish in the sea, but what does it matter if even those swimming in your pond, you can’t find a way to approach them?",True,False,False,datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,52471,public,self,Ready to Settle Down,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/of8px5/ready_to_settle_down/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The problem I have is that if I agree to a second date men react as if I’ve said I want a relationship with them and become very full on. This is really off putting.
I feel under a lot of pressure to decide if someone is right for me after just meeting them for a few hours. After so many of these experiences I refuse to go on a second date unless I feel very sure of my feelings for them, which rarely happens as that’s not how my attraction works. 
How do you have a second date with someone without raising their expectations that you’ve decided they are the one?

With only one exception, every woman has done this thing where I’m not sure how to react.

It’s always later in the date after the conversation and laughs have been flowing a bit.  They stare intensely at me for an uncomfortably long time.  No talking, just staring.  It happened again tonight, hence the reason for this post.

My go-to move is usually to avoid eye contact and laugh awkwardly.  I have to do this 2 or 3 times before they stop.  I’m 92% sure that is not the reaction they are looking for.

These are first or second dates and many times, there are things going on afterwards (need to pick up kids, babysitter is only there until 9, etc.).  So, there is no chance for me to stare back and say, “want to get out of here?”

It’s either a good thing where they are showing interest or a bad thing where they are imagining drugging me and stealing my kidney.

My semi-serious question is not on the motivation behind it, but what reaction they might be hoping for.  

If we were a few dates in, had already kissed on prior dates and neither of us had plans after the date, it would be pretty clear to reciprocate and ask her back to my place.  It happening on the first or second date has me at a bit of a loss.  

So far I have tried staring back until it got weird, asking “what?”, and saying “I have degenerative kidney disease” (just in case), in addition to my aforementioned awkward response.

Nothing happened and nothing probably will. Just glad I finally got the guts to say what I think.

This is a person (42M) on a co-ed sports league with me since last September. I am pretty sure we can keep going on being friends, but will update you all if there's anything interesting to update. I basically got tired of having a crush on him and figured there was nothing to lose.

From what I understand, nothing usually comes out of these things (crushes and their declarations), but I figured I'd go for it. I had made the decision earlier that day to tell him and we had a few drinks, but drinks are not what made me say it. 

I feel so weird being a woman, thinking or being led to think that men need to make the first move. Sure, maybe I could have been more slick and asked him out on a cool date or whatever, but I had a fantastic time last night - and I'm not that slick of a person. I've already asked him out to enough fun things before. He's agreed to a few.

Here's what I said - I have something awkward to say. I have a crush on you. I don't expect you to have anything to say right now, but if you don't feel the same way, we can just keep going down this trajectory of being friends because being friends is awesome. 

He was beyond shocked - and said I had had some drinks. That he was flattered and that we could text about this some time later. I'm not hurt and I hope he's not too embarrassed.

At this stage of our friendship, I honestly can say that I'd be happy to be just friends. He's awesome and if he wants to date someone else, I'd be happy for him. However, he'd make a fun, reliable partner, I think. I don't want to live with regret.

I have found that I have dated essentially the same person over and over again my entire life. It’s always people who go from meeting to boyfriend in about five minutes, who tell me they’re in love with me by the fourth date, and who want to lock down a very serious relationship as fast as possible. I get into this pattern again and again and again. While this is happening, I find it offputting because I am actually not a super-emotional person. I’ve never had my heart broken, never been dumped, and I’m not sure I’ve ever really been in love. 
 
I’d like to say that I am really awesome and that’s why these guys feel this way. I know that’s not the case. I know what’s happening is there some sort of weird dynamic that I’m attracted to that brings me to the same kind of guy. 
 
So here’s what I’m here to ask: do any of you have any relationship advice or recommendations for books on this particular topic? I’ve come to really respect this community. I would actually like to have lasting relationship that is healthy and meaningful to me one day – though not soon. I’m a big reader and would love book recommendations or anything else you have to throw at me regarding this. I have been to therapy.

I love tacos. I love people watching. I love this. I love that. Thankfully, I say this word so much that I wouldn’t think it was a big deal, but it slipped out when I was talking to the guy who isn’t my boyfriend because we haven’t labeled it, but he basically is my boyfriend (we are exclusive and have had that talk, we just aren’t labeling it yet).

It was on the 4th of July and I can’t stop feeling weird about it. He doesn’t particularly like fireworks, but I LOVE them. He doesn’t like going to the lake because there are a lot of pretentious people at this particular lake, but I LOVE going to any lake. So to make me happy, because that’s just the kind of awesome guy he is, he took me to meet his daughter and her boyfriend and their children, at the lake, to see fireworks. 

We went to another lake neighbor’s house. They had food. Tacos and hot dogs and potato salad. He was eating potato salad, and he is so particular about how he eats - which most people would probably find odd and be annoyed by, but I also eat in a particular way and his habits are fine with me, I actually find them quite funny. We were talking and joking and I was watching him take his fork and do his thing with it, and I said, in a string of other things that we were talking about “I love you.” Meaning I love the way you eat, but that is NOT what came out! He heard it and whipped his head and just looked at me. Stared!!

Panic sets in! I just said “what?!” He said “what?” And I just restated that I love the way he eats. Oh my gosh, dying!!!! We both heard what I said.

Neither of us has mentioned it since, but I cringe still thinking about it. Thing is, I do have love for him. I’m just not IN love with him...yet. I can feel it on the horizon. I can tell he also has strong feelings for me. Who takes a girl to meet his daughter/grandson and see fireworks on a lake when they don’t care for either of those things (he loves and adores his daughter and grandson)?

I think it's been hard lately dating for me because no one ""moves"" me if that makes any sense or takes me by surprise. And anything they do or say I've seen it all before. 

I also feel like things they say or do sometimes is a little lacking and the romanticism isn't there.  It's hard to explain.

Apologies in advance if I'm over-stepping in posting this! I am potentially working on a short documentary about the keys to happiness as you get older, and since one of the most important things to happiness is dating and relationships, I wanted to try and find some 45+ women or men (based in the US for now, since we'd potentially have to film an interview) who might be open to talking about their experiences dating as they got older. Did you get into apps for the first time? Are you exploring same-sex relationships for the first time? No stories are off the table, because I want to try and capture as real of a picture of what it's like to date or have found love when you're older. All of this is still very much in the early stages, but if you'd ever be open to telling me a little bit about your story, feel free to message me and we can talk some more.

This really sweet guy messaged me, but his name was the same as my late husband's pet pookah (an imaginary dog he blamed for raiding the fridge at night). And it just gave me a really bad reaction.

So, I replied to him that he sounded sweet, but his name was the same as my late husband's (figured going into explanations was not going to be helpful) and I was not equipped to handle talking to him because of it. Then wished him all the best.

While I miss my old partner a lot and miss many aspects of being in a relationship, my single life is SO MUCH BETTER. I feel so much more whole, comfortable with myself, and in control of my world. I'm eating healthy, doing yoga, meditating, exercising, spending time with friends... 

It's not that my ex kept me from these things or was necessarily a bad influence. It's more that I've come to realize that I THRIVE on structure and routine. I know that I'm going to bed at 10, getting up at 6, going for a run, doing meditation, eating breakfast, going to work... All that structure and routine helps my life to feel proper and directed. It frees up energy to be loose and present on evenings and weekends, which are basically my unstructured times. 

I've always known this about myself on some level, but it's become even more pronounced as I've gotten older. I'm positive I have ADHD and pretty sure I'm a little bit on the spectrum too. 

So while it's wonderful to really fully understand this about myself now... It also has me worried about my future. I want to find love. I would like to be in a comfortable long-term relationship. My trend is very much that I do well at dating but once a relationship starts to set in, I really struggle. Spending more time with the other person throws off my routines. I get agitated. I get easily exhausted. I gain weight and don't get enough sleep. All my healthy habits fall apart. I don't feel like myself... 

I've had people tell me I need better boundaries, but I've never felt like my partners were unreasonable in their expectations. They just wanted to spend time with me. It's just that I only have a limited number of unstructured hours I can give without falling apart.
