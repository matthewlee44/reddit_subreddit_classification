0,ogizm9,1625786311,Does anyone need anyone anymore?,"Hi 20M and I’m just wondering about this. I used to be a Disney movie relationship kind of guy and I think it can happen but looking at the way things are going, I wonder what the future of our generation will be like.

Sex? Apps/Nightclubs 
Money? Work 
Fun? Friends and Hobbies

Are future humans ultimately going to be single most of their lives?

I don’t mean this in a negative way but most of the women who like me, I never like back (I think it’s common as a man) and no one likes to lower their standards and settle.

1,ogj1mf,1625786504,How to keep a girl interested on snap?,"I've been on 3 dates with a girl and feel the need to slightly dial it back to keep her attention. We have a 62 day streak. We usually chat on there everyday and text/FaceTime other times too. I feel the need to dial back because I need to keep my options open since we aren't exclusive. We talked about our feelings the other day and want to continue to feel it out. 

What's a god way to dial back? (On social media at least)? I sent a streak snap to all my streaks with morning and she opened it 2 hours after sending and I haven't heard from her today. I've never double texted or tried overstepping/appearing needy but I don't want to get in the habit of it.

2,ogjbhj,1625787433,Weird dating experience,"So back in March I met this woman through tinder. She was a single mom to a little girl and had left an abusive relationship over a year ago and said she was ready to date again. So we chat a little bit but because I had planned a trip for mid March we didn’t meet up in person. So my trip comes and goes, we talk consistently and even FaceTime. I try to plan dates in advance because I want to respect her time as a single mom and she’s in school. A month passes and i get tired of being blown off so I tell her I just don’t see it progressing anywhere. After that conversation she stops responding for about a month. She comes back in June and is like “I haven’t responded cause I’m pregnant “ and then laughs and says she’s kidding, she’s not doing anything with anyone. We try to talk but out of the blue she stops replying again. A few weeks pass and she tells me she’s really pregnant. So sarcastically I say “so I guess doing nothing can get you pregnant “. Well a week ago she text me wanting to apologize saying how she just felt lonely since I told her I didn’t see us going anywhere and how she got with someone she knew and it was supposed to be a one time thing. I essentially told her that I hope this guy is a better father than the last guy she let get her pregnant and apparently he’s not. Is it bad that I laughed at that? Like I didn’t show her I was laughing but internally I laughed. 
The way I looked at it was she wanted to lie in my face and make me seem like the bad guy and then think she could guilt trip me into playing step daddy and I wasn’t going down that road.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ogjbhj/weird_dating_experience/

5,ogjgu7,1625787952,I’ve been thinking about our movie nights,"I’ve been thinking about our movie nights. Well we never met in person so back then we had to Skype each other. Play the movie at the same time and settle up with out pop corn and snacks. A concept that is archaic these days but cute if I’m being honest. 

I think that life is about time. How we spend it and taking the opportunity to spend it how we please. There were plenty of times where we’d sit there and be really excited about this movie and everything had to be perfect so we’d count down on 3 and press play. Sometimes freaking out about every half second we were ahead because it did not line up with our perfect date. This was a whole life to me. I lived it and it was perfect. 

Recently I’ve been told abt how as people we go through 5 personality changes in our life but I feel like that’s not inherently true. I mean it only makes sense as a trauma response and even then. No, I think that was one of the five lives I was meant to live. Coming to a terrifying home and finding a way to peel back the terror with someone in an equally terrifying home far away. After all that we healed or started to heal causing us to live our next life. It reminds me about a Grimm story about how humans got to live so long. Basically stating that all the other animals only wanted a small life but humans got greedy.

My next life was still hectic but getting put together still. I hadn’t healed so much as wanted to heal. I wanted to heal so bad that I never got around to it. It was like watching a train get derailed in slow motion or like a car wreck. That life ended with everything crashing and colliding together. Not knowing how to handle everything was the direct factor in mishandling everything. 

Now I’m in my fourth life. I don’t know what to do with it and I don’t know how to describe it. I feel like I learned a lot this life. I feel like it’s coming to an end and I feel like I’m not ready for the fifth.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ogjgu7/ive_been_thinking_about_our_movie_nights/

So the thing is I like a girl but I'm hesitating to tell her. It's not like I have been completely shy, I mean I can converse well with everyone around me, including her but a lot of thoughts go in my mind, like what if she has a bf or what if she says she wishes to remain single etc.

In my past I had approached two girls (both of them during different phases of my life, first one during my 8th grade and the second girl after I finished my high school) and I was cheated by both of them because I was naive and very young to exactly know how to date someone.

I'm 25 today and I haven't yet properly dated any one. This has been shattering my self confidence and has made me really hesitant to approach someone I like.

So my bf of a few months is extremely close to his friends, and tbh i think it’s starting to take a toll on me. I’ve only met them once or twice, but i generally disliked them. We’re in our early twenties and a few of them are out there dating 15 year olds and openly fetichising asian or black women. I find that very disturbing, so i’ve come to dislike them and try to stay away from them as much as i can. However, they’re still my bf’s closest friends so, naturally, the free time we’re not together is spent mostly with them. At first i didn’t care, but overtime it has started to affect me more. My insecurities probably amplified that feeling. They travel together all the time, they hang out and party multiple times a week. I think my resentment is also probably due to the fact that my friends, on the other hand, have also become my bf’s friends. So, now it feels like, when i go out, my bf is always there but when he goes out im never included nor asked to go out, because he’s with the group of friends previously mentionned. I haven’t talked to him about this feeling, as i feel like it’s probably mostly the insecurities on my part that make me so sad. Has anyone else experienced that feeling?

20,ogl8r5,1625794292,Horrible date tonight,"I've (39f) been pretty busy at work lately but trying to date so I haven't been fully engaged lately. I've been talking to a guy casually for a few weeks now but not super actively as I've been pretty busy and tired when I get home. He's seemed like a decent guy through our minimal contact. The other week he said he was at a local hangout and I told him that sounded fun and he said I should join him and his friends. I turned it down because I was already home doing stuff but I liked the confidence!!

I remember from his profile that he was a divorced dad with adult children that liked going to his cabin every weekend. 

*Red flag number 1*:. I don't have time during the week and he doesn't have time during the weekend.  This doesn't look like it will work. But lest I persisted. Haha

So he did ask me out again but on a normal date and to a fairly nice restaurant that I liked and I accepted. 

I texted him that I was leaving work 30 mins before our date and that I was on my way. No response. Well, I wasn't going to show up to the restaurant since he went silent. 

*Red flag number 2*

But it's close to my house so I pull in a near by parking lot and answer emails. Then I get a text that he got us a table. Oh ok. I tell him I'm almost there and I drive to the restaurant and park. 

Seems nice enough. But honestly I forgot to check his name on the app before walking into the restaurant and I'm starting to think I didn't even vet this man and I can't even remember his name. Like wtf am I doing. I'm being dumb. 

We say hi and stuff and something about alcohol reminds him of the joe Rogan podcast and he tells me about it. 

*Red flag number 3* more times than not they are going to be a libertarian. And I realize I didn't even ask that basic question before hand. I always ask it. 

Conversation is descent. I talk to strangers for a living so I'm always fine in that department. He's a bit more socially akward and fidgety. He might even be in the spectrum. But that's fine, none of that bothers me. Then mask talk comes up and guess what guys?! Of course he's a libertarian. 

*Red flag number 4*: That's a huge deal breaker for me. 

He's not a horrible person though so it's not like I get up and leave lol. I can still enjoy my dinner and company. I don't even disagree with many of their beliefs but they always just end up being this certain type of guy. 

The discussion is a little political but nothing crazy in my eyes. There are a few times a say ""I get what you're saying but I don't think it's always that simple"" I might have given an example or two. I'm not even aggressive or confrontational or argumentative. It actually seemed like a normal, healthy conversation but I could tell that he was getting a bit frustrated because I was challenging his thoughts. Because he would give up his point in the middle of making it. I wasn't even interrupting him either I actually was interested in his point of view. 

*Red flag number 5*: he doesn't seem to like woman challenging his point of view. 

So the check comes and he lets it sit there for a few seconds. As he is reaching for his wallet I ask if he wants to split it and he said that would be perfect in a really irritated voice. 

*Red flag number 6*: he asked me out, he picked the restaurant. I'm sorry did his mama not raise him right. You don't only pay for a date if you like someone... You pay for it because you asked them ou. There isn't conditions with dating. You ask someone to dinner your treat them. My whole family is that way. My dad will invite the fam out to dinner (extended family and everything) and he picks up the entire tab. If I ask my friends or a date out I pick up the tab. 

But then he gets up and just leaves. He left me at the table as I was putting my card away and gathering my belongings. He was out of the restaurant before I even had a chance to get up lol. 

Before I got to the car he had already unmatched me. Which honestly; all of that is ok. I'm really just mad at myself. I didn't screen this dude at all and this is the result. I wasted an evening and $45 for this. I never do this. I normally don't waste my time because I would have asked all these pressing questions before the date. At least when I typically screen my dates better, the worst I've experienced is no spark but still a super fun evening. 


So moral of the story. 

1) vet/screen before the date. Don't waste time on a date to feel their vibe. Ask all the pressing questions first then go out to see if the chemistry matches the compatibility. 

2) have standards/deal breakers. Stick to them. I never would have dated this guy knowing these things. Yet the consensus on these advice subs to women tend to be ""give the guy a chance before jumping to conclusions"". No thank you. I know exactly how this would turn out and it turned out exactly as I predicted if I knew these things about him. 

3) trust your gut. I was so close to bailing. Deep down inside I didn't want to go on this date. I was tired from work and I knew I didn't invest much into screening him before. I was thinking... What the hell, why not. I thought it was weird that he didn't text back to let me know he was on his way too and I almost drove home because of it and I should have.

22,ogld3q,1625794736,A moment of silence for all of us who’ve been unmatched when there was a really great thing going. He thought I ghosted him and unmatched me :(,"My fault really, but still hurts when you lose out on what could’ve been a great person. I matched with a guy a week ago on Hinge, we had good conversation and great banter. He sounded really genuine and seemed very interested, I expressed the same. He was everything I’ve been waiting for whilst mindlessly scrolling the dating apps these past months – funny, good looking, has a great career and very sincere. We seemed to have a lot in common, we shared some private things that I literally have never talked about when I match guys on apps. I’d say we sent each other 5-10 long messages each a day, so have gotten to know each other. He even said that he's never been so excited about anyone in awhile.

So here's where it goes downhill.... the night before yesterday, shit hit the fan with my work and we were struggling to resolve a conflict up until now. I had to work overtime almost 14 hours total each day, physically and emotionally exhausted after work, I passed out in bed and didn’t bother checking or replying to messages. I was basically on autopilot robot mode, my phone battery has never been more full these past 2 days. 

Well, work finally slowed now as we have things under control and suddenly I realized I never replied to his last message, which was the day before. So I open my Hinge app, and of course, our chat is no longer there, which means he unmatched me. He clearly must’ve thought I was ghosting him or lost interest, when I am actually head over heels over this guy. From what I know, seems there’s no way to re-match and he won’t show up ever on my deck again :( I'm feeling terrible and I know my emotions may be overblown considering I haven't even met him in real life but... still sucks.

Key take-aways so you don’t experience my mistake, on either end:

* Always send a quick message if you’re going to be away, don’t assume the other person will be there waiting for you no matter how great the chemistry is (\*tears\*)
* Don’t unmatch people for “ghosting” you, you’ll never know why they’re not reaching out to you – it could be an emergency or yeah simply they just don’t like you, but no harm of keeping the chat open
* Don’t let work get in the way of your personal life and happiness (not really dating advice, life advice)
* After a couple messages, if there's chemistry, ask for their phone numbers!!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ogld3q/a_moment_of_silence_for_all_of_us_whove_been/

Even  am 30 years old, I haven't experience on dating, or online dating, so I am not sure what I should do to keep her interested and move forward.  


Even I don't even know if it will be the case, I am under the impression It would be more natural and easier if we were speaking in front of each other in person, but I am not sure I should ask on on a date, after exchanging message in a 3-4 hours period. On top of that, she wrote on her dating profile that she is looking for someone who is ready to follow her rhythm (in a way of not going too fast).  


Is that a normal situation, and have you an idea of a way I can launch a discussion without been trapped in a series of questions and answers?  


Should it be a good idea sharing this directly with her and be 100% honest? Telling her that I am really fond of her so far, that I am looking forward continue to learn more about her, but even if we don't know each other a lot, it would be nice to meet? Is this too soon?

Was just in London for 2 months and got  so many  more matches than usual I ended up going on 10 dates, some of them being pretty fun and which is unheard of for me. Now I'm in Chicago and have literally gotten barely a handful of matches after a week of insecure endless swiping. I think this is cause I'm sort of an artsy, hippie looking guy with real bi energy and Chicago is squaresville, at least in coparison to London. Am moving to New York for grad school and put my location as that on Hinge and got more likes than London and Chicago combined (apparently NYC has a real guy shortage haha). 

Let's not be so hard on ourselves boys, sometimes we're literally in a location where we're a square peg in a round hole, or there's a bad girl to guy ratio. It's so easy to take everything so personally in online dating, cause of how much it sucks, but you have to remember sometimes, if you're portraying yourself honestly, you might just be a bad fit for the people in your area.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oglsz3/did_not_realize_until_now_how_much_location/

31,ogmd9t,1625798421,She lied about everything...,"A couple of months back I (20M) met this girl (22F) on tinder, and we really hit it off. In the beginning, we were only looking for something casual but our relationship eventually became a lot more than that. I had developed feelings for her, and she knew about them. She told me that she felt very similarly about me but was afraid of commitment due to bad experiences in the past and enjoyed her independence too much to enter a relationship, but within a few weeks,  we were basically in a relationship just without the title. Understandably, that's when things got too serious for her and she couldn't keep going, but she felt that we couldn't keep things casual and that we would just end up there again, so we broke things off. I wasn't too hurt about it but I just could not stop thinking about her, I felt like she was the right one at the wrong time. I tried my best to move on and even talked to and went on dates with a couple of other girls but I just didn't get that same feeling of connection I had with her. About 3 weeks after she and I stopped talking my friend convinced me to text her. The idea was that I was never going to see her again unless I took that risk and let her know how I felt. Maybe I could get her to reconsider or at the very least get closure. So I did, I texted her. And you know what she tells me? That she had started dating a friend from high school and that things were going well for them. That was the LAST thing either of us expected to hear. This was far worse than if she had just not responded or said she didn't feel that way about me because this means everything about our ""relationship"" was a lie. The reasons she claimed she couldn't date me were fundamental issues that don't just change overnight. She also told me that she wasn't talking to any other guys and wasn't looking for anyone else at the time either. But the idea that only a couple of weeks after she and I stopped talking she changed her mind about everything and started dating some friend from her high school is ridiculous. That doesn't just happen. She had to have been lying about literally everything. About what she was looking for, about her commitment and independency issues, how she really felt about me, etc. She should really take up acting because she sure had me convinced. I am far angrier about the situation than I am heartbroken. I didn't respond so I didn't get any explanation from her, but my theory is that she just didn't want to hurt my feelings. Every time a girl does this they end up hurting the guy's feelings even more than if they would have been honest and upfront in the first place. Two months after my ex and I had started dating she lost feelings, but instead of coming to me and saying ""Hey, I'm so sorry I'm realizing that I wasn't really ready for a relationship and I just don't feel the same way anymore,"" she dragged it on until our relationship fell apart and I simply couldn't handle it anymore. Had she been honest with me it would have hurt, but far less than what I actually experienced. I'm sick and tired of putting my heart out there and getting hurt. I know that I'm just emotional right now, but I feel so angry and bitter.

Because recently the idea of dating and relationships just seems hard, too much work and too much time for very minimal payoff and I sometimes wonder why anyone would ever want to be in one if they’re so much work.

I sometimes like the idea of a relationship but that’s where fictional characters come in, embarrassingly enough but for me it’s easier than finding someone in the real world. 

Im also a complete virgin, never had sex, never kissed anyone and never held hands which is….. ok. I plan to keep it that way because I feel like they should be reserved for someone I care about but I dunno… the entire idea of it all is just starting to wear me down.

40,ogn204,1625800981,(25m) Ex recently reached out again and is trying to reconnect but I’m not sure there is a point,"So little bit of backstory. Met her on bumble about a year ago at the start of the pandemic in the spring. We talked a bunch and went on a few outside dates and were super compatible. Started dating in September after she moved back to college making us closer in terms of distance and made it official end of October. We were dating pretty seriously and met each other’s families. During this time I was finishing pharmacy school and was doing 40 hours of rotations a week plus working another 30ish operating cnc machines in the evenings. In January I started supporting myself financially by playing poker once casinos opened up. I was getting exhausted with my work schedule and only could see her after I was done work at 10 pm or weekends. Poker allowed me to make my own schedule and I was very successful making around 18k in 2.5 months. I did not tell her about this at first because I wasn’t pursing it as a career but rather as a short term gig until graduating in a few months. However she was aware from early on that I enjoyed playing poker so it’s not like this was completely new information. So she confronted me about it eventually in late January after noticing my snap location a few times. I explained everything and although she wasn’t thrilled with it I think she tried to understand that it wasn’t straight up gambling and it was ok for a while. 

Breakup: One weekend early March I decided to make a trip down to Atlantic City rather than my usual Cardroom. On the drive back next morning I was rather sleep deprived and ended up getting in an accident by nodding off a second and swerving into the median. Car needed some work but I was fine although that seemed to be the final straw for her. The following week she tried an intervention on me telling me I needed to see this therapist and I needed to stop. I was pretty ticked off by how the therapist had made a diagnosis and recommendations without ever speaking to me first. I was willing to compromise by cutting down the amount of hours I was playing but I wasn’t willing to stop completely. We said our goodbyes through tears and that was the last time we saw each other. I reached out a few more times often while a bit drunk but stopped around early May. 

After about two months of no contact she reached out to me this week. I’m on vacation for the week so wasn’t thrilled to have to think about this all week. We have one phone call and have been texting. Tells me she misses me and asks if we can be friends. I say ok but am pretty hesitant bc why now if nothing has really changed in terms of why we broke up. I expressed my general hesitancy, say it will be hard to be just friends, and asked about her expectations. She says can we not put a label on anything whether it’s friends or something else. She just can’t be putting labels on things atm. All she knows is that she misses me. But doesn’t want to think about the future rn. She also asks to meet up at this point which I agree to and we also agreed that we are not having sex. However I feel like it is inevitable especially if we continue to meet up. I would appreciate some advice or insight as I’m not entirely sure what I want to do in this situation.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ogn204/25m_ex_recently_reached_out_again_and_is_trying/
41,ogn57m,1625801307,The thought of trying online dating again TERRIFIES me. I am so scared to do it again. These are the reasons why,"I’m not planning to date again, online or otherwise, until early October at the earliest. The reason I picked that timeframe is because there’s a video game tournament happening in the first 2 days of October that I will be competing in, so qualifying and practicing for that will take up a lot of my time. Also, by then, anything that makes me childish like watching age-inappropriate shows such as Spongebob will (hopefully) be faded out. I will also hopefully have a permanent job by then (I am currently a summer intern but I could potentially be on for the long haul later) and move out of my parents’ house (when I can afford to). I’m also hoping to adopt a more optimistic personality and maybe work out a bit harder. All of these things (and did I mention I’m 6’3”?) should give me an advantage in online dating, and dating in general, but I still have my fears and they are real and scary.

Firstly, I’m afraid of being hurt again. Let’s get the obvious stuff out of the way first. I’ve had crushes before. We all have. But there was one person that I shared something really intimate with. We lived out a lot of fantasies through text, and it made me develop a really close emotional attachment to her despite us never meeting in person because of COVID and distance. But then, she got herself a boyfriend, who she met while we were still talking. I reestablished contact with her again a little while after that, and she also started giving me some mixed signals like wishing she was with me, calling me cute, etc.. I tried being friends with her, but I couldn’t do it, especially when she still allowed the text roleplaying with me even though she had a boyfriend. The feelings didn’t last long on her end and she knew that what she was doing was wrong. It ultimately did not end well and I’m still healing from the hurt, and it’s been 3 months. I’ve deleted everything about her and blocked her on everything but not a day goes by where I don’t think about conversations that we had, sexual or otherwise. I really don’t want a repeat to happen and I’m scared that it will.

Second, extending on this, I don’t know if I will ever share the level of intimacy that I shared with my ex-crush with someone else. I know that I have to move on, but I have developed a bit of resentment towards her. I don’t think she had any bad intentions but I do believe that she shouldn’t have done what she did.

Thirdly, online dating is expensive. I don’t care which dating app you use, Match, Tinder, Bumble, PoF, they’re all going to charge you Premium just to use basic features. Why do I have to pay a monthly fee for something that is supposed to help me find love? I hate that the companies behind these apps are basically exploiting a basic human need for money. It’s almost evil in a sense.

Fourth, online dating in general has been, for me, a miserable experience. I tried online dating in the fall of 2020, which was not a smart decision on my part as the pandemic was at its worst. I got few matches and when I did get matches, they sometimes turned out to be scammers and they end up ghosting you. Also, pretty much every match I got wasn’t exactly the most physically attractive. I’m also autistic even though I’m really good at hiding the fact that I am. I’m basically trying to become as normal as possible and then maybe disclose that information. But I can also do things that some autistic people can’t, such as driving and holding down a job.

Fifth, I’m scared of taking advantage of someone whose love I don’t reciprocate, just so I won’t be lonely. Sometimes I don’t feel all that comfortable in my own skin and this often results in desperation to be with someone. But I’m not making that mistake again.

Well, that ended up not being as long as I thought. But these are the reasons that I’m really scared to date again, even though I do (or will) have things that do give me an advantage. Can anyone else relate to this, and if so, how do you suggest I overcome my fears?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ogn57m/the_thought_of_trying_online_dating_again/
42,ogn89g,1625801623,Should I wait for her message or reach out myself?,"Hey everyone,

[This post follows on from an incident yesterday - see link.](https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/ofxcne/sent_screenshot_to_my_date/h4fvkhk/?context=3)

Basically, I've been on 2 dates with this girl that I have been set up with through a mutual friend.

Date 1 was great, we agreed to see each other again, and we marked Sunday evening to see each other. We had some drinks, then agreed to grab a bite as we both were having a great time, held hands on our walk back, and just had an overall nice time. When i texted her the day after the date, she offered to meet up early in the week, or otherwise tell me asap if she can do Sunday because her parents/brother were visiting. I usually see this as a bad sign, but in any case, she messaged me the next night and offered Tuesday/Wednesday as she was having her parents over.

Date 2 was set in stone for Wednesday night. We had a 2 hour dinner, and at the end, I invited her to come hang out with me and my puppy on the weekend. She immediately said yes and would message me to organise when. I then jokingly mentioned how an idiot friend mentioned a theory about how when girls say 'I'll let you know' they never do - she laughed and said I should tell him he's an idiot, and she re-confirmed she would message me to organise.

Now in between date 2 and right now, the incident above happened. I sent her a screenshot of our conversation, which was intended for our mutual friend who wanted an update. The screenshot had nothing that would be deemed private. She doesn't text a lot, is very short/forward with everything, so our messages were just setting up logistics / saying we had a good time on the date. Nothing else.

She ended up replying to my message with a **crying/laughing emoji** and said '**its ok**'. I didn't reply as I have previously initiated conversation and whilst she reciprocates, she clearly is not a big texter (our mutual friend confirmed this too). She's very brief with her responses, takes hours, and we haven't texted a whole lot between dates, just because I don't want to come off as over the top.

It is currently Friday afternoon, and I have yet to hear from her about the weekend. I obviously know her plans for the weekend, and she knows mine. I'm a bit of a planner, and like to organise. I guess not hearing from her is giving me slight anxiety (which I know is my problem). Our mutual friend has given me the advice that I am overthinking every single detail and trying to plan this out, and just need to chill.

So my question now is, should I still be waiting for her to message me about this weekend? Or should I reach out myself if she doesn't message me by tomorrow (Saturday). Its currently Friday afternoon just after lunch, and I know she's got plans with work colleagues tonight (same as me), so I sorta dont want to ruin the vibe, but also feel like finalising our plans would be nice?

I guess if she doesn't message, I'll know. If I message and ask, her response or lack of may also answer my question.

Here’s my situation; I dated this guy a few years ago, we didn’t work out cause I was suspicious of him messing with his ex. I was correct. 

Fast forward to sometime last year, we started speaking again and began to be fwb. I called him out on his actions. He took full responsibility, apologized, and asked me if I could start looking into us moving past that and me forgiving him to see if we could be serious. I told him it would take some time, but that I would try. I also informed him that I would continue to date as I saw fit, and that I didn’t trust him yet. A few months ago he got drunk and told me he loved me. We discussed it later when he was sober and he stuck by what he said. He also said 


Here’s where I’m struggling. I don’t feel as if there’s any intimacy in this situation. There’s no romance as far as I’m concerned, and it doesn’t feel as if we’re dating. It literally still feels as if we’re fwb and we just spend more time together. I don’t feel like I’m a woman he loves or wants to actually invest in a future with.

47,ognvgp,1625804012,Please Help! What is love suppose to feel like? (M23) (F20),"I started talking to this girl as a friend about two months ago online just by random chance. At first I had no interest in her but she apparently had a crush on me after our very first conversation that lasted after a few hours. We started slowly talking more and more and more and about a month in I started to fantasize about being in a relationship with her. 

Once our friendship started to heat up she started saying “I love you to me” in a jokey flirty way… and sometimes I would say it back in a similar tone but most of the time I would laugh and just ignore it. Eventually it got to the point where she was saying it kind of serious and I wanted to say it back but was simultaneously trying to subconsciously not be in a relationship because I was scared (separate issue), and also nervous about telling her my true feelings. But eventually about 5 days ago I did tell her about my true feelings. I developed an interest in her romantically, and she reciprocated it. She said “I love you” and I said it back but I had a bit of doubt of how i loved her. As a person? A friend? In love? The next night I asked her what she means when she tells me this and she told me she just loved me as a person. But over the next few days of us talking more our feelings for each other strongly intensified. 2 nights ago we confessed to each other how strong those feelings were. The problem for me is… I genuinely don’t know if I meant it in a romantic way. But in the moment I definitely believe I did.

Usually people describe romantic love as getting butterflies and stuff.. or things like “commitment”. I have never had butterflies while thinking of her. I’ve never had those moments while talking to her that make me go “Wow” or anything. I just love talking to her because we fit so well together. I am a huge overthinker and she is crazy smart and thankfully not an overthinker so we balance each other out. I love her presence, and I deeply care for her. She is so patient and understanding with me when I explain to her my anxiousness about our relationship (I have terrible relationship anxiety and terrible anxiety in general)… Yet every time the “I love you” thing gets brought up I say it… and mean it… but I don’t know in what way. But I know the way she interprets it, and I feel like I can’t explain this to her because I don’t even know how to interpret it. 

Last night towards the end of us talking for about 6 hours straight.. the last 60 seconds on the phone call I had the weirdest thought that just popped into my brain and said “you don’t love her as much as you think you”. I immediately felt a hot flash and was sweating and could feel the anxiety coming on. I hung up on her and just kept telling myself to sleep it off. I woke up this morning with the same thought intruding into my brain and eventually I calmed myself down after a couple hours. But I was so scared. I want to love her romantically so bad but I feel like there’s something in me that won’t stop doubting it or just won’t let me and i don’t know why. I don’t know what to do and I’m so confused. Is it because it’s long distance? I haven’t FaceTimed her yet… could that help? What am I doing wrong? Are my expectations wrong? Should I even be concerned over this?

49,ogo04h,1625804504,A strategy for any man to get women.,"
If you want to be successful in getting women, hooking up, ect... do not give in to them, they thirst for attention, so if all single men around the world started to not pay attention to women, im telling you now women would be so frustrated to the point that they'd do anything to get a man's attention... Hell. even pay maybe. So yeah If all men started to ignore women I'm telling you that you'd get more women. And then when you'd decide to let them meet up with you... don't be too easy, make it a challenge for them cus that's what they do to us men right now and most of the time we get rejected... especially men that don't know how to properly flirt. If you do that strategy, even you guys that can't flirt for shit can get girls, because they would become desperate for both attention and sex. so if the tables turned, the women would finally chase after us instead of us after them. But I wont think that will happen because you idiots like being rejected and masturbate at home more.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ogo04h/a_strategy_for_any_man_to_get_women/

She seemed really really into me when we walked together she kept bumping into me when we sat together she got really close to me she laughed at me a lot and at the end of the day we made out for like 10 minutes. She commented positively about my appearance . 
Anyway since then she’s been messaging me a lot and initiating contact but I asked her today if she wanted to get together again and she made some silly excuses as to why she couldn’t. When she text me she talks about a lot of things that are not really romantic and seem to be more of friend type stuff. She told me how she just broke up with somebody that she did it for two years and I’m sure she’s not fully over that but now as to me I want to have a relationship with this girl and I don’t know whether or not she is just bored and wants to get her mind off of that relationship so she talks to me or if she is just trying to get to know me better or feels comfortable with me. I’m really not going to try as hard to go after her now I’m going to see how she responds to that but can somebody help me as to whether or not a girl who finds me attractive funny and was willing to make out with me, talk to me all the time yet seems very hesitant to get back together in person.

I texted her and she asked me if I was free tuesday night this past week which I said yes and I planned a date for the two of us.

I offered to pick her up from her apt which she said would be great. After picking her up I took her to a open mic night where we spent about 2.5 hours there eating and drinking as well. We sat 1st row got picked on a little by the comedians but she was laughing a ton and seemed to have a good time. Afterwards we walked up the street to another bar where we spent another 1.5 hours. All night she was super chatty and would grab my arm/knee, sit in close and other subtle signs talking our compatible zodiac signs and other stuff we both like.

I drove her back to her place at the end of the night where some people were outside in the car next to us so I gave her a hug in my car and we talked for a bit and as the people walked away I gave her a final hug while trying to kiss her she kind of turned and I just caught her cheek.

While leaving she told me to text her when I got home. She then texted me like a half hour afterwards ""thank you for tonight, I had a great time :) i'll see you soon!!! goodnight"". I later responded anytime, I really enjoy spending time in your company. And next time we have to checkout a certain movie we both want to see and she hearted my message and responded forsure :)

54,ogocx7,1625805952,"Had my first date today, how to follow up?","tldr: 30 years old, never been a date before today, and finally crossed it off the bucket list. Date experience is outlined below. Not sure what to do from here, do I message her again? Plan a second date? Wait for her to text me? I got home a few hours ago and haven't heard anything even though I told her to text me so i know she got home safe.

Experience:

I've been talking to a single mother on a certain dating app for the past week. She's a bit older than me (35) and has two kids. We'd have conversations throughout today, although if i'm being cynical it was mostly her just messaging me ""hey what are you doing"" every couple of hours and then that mini conversation dying out because i was too busy or there was not much to talk about. but she seemed interesting so anyway, asked her out and turned out tonight was her only free night this week. appreciated her making time for me on short notice.

i venmo'd her some money so she could take the subway out to my part of the city. it was pouring so i picked her up. didn't really know where to take her and she was nice enough to say she's fine with anything, so we went to a white castle and got a crave case. i had a few burgers and we talked. mostly about what we wanted from a relationship and i think we were on the same page. i can't tell if it was the excitement of it all but i dont know what else we spoke about. idk if it is awkward to ask a girl her birthday, last name, and all that other identity information if it's a first date.

anyway we drove around my hood for an hour and listened to music. it was nice to have company. i'm trying to be more accepting and thoughtful but she was also on her phone most of the time and would delay in responding to questions i asked because she was texting. idk if that's a red flag or something i should ask about and maybe she can improve on? maybe it's too much to improve on?

i ended up dropping her off at some hotel she said has a shuttle she can catch to get back home so i gave her some cash for that. i probably pussied out on hugging her so we shook hands and that was that. been home a few hours now and i'm absolutely thrilled to have met a woman who is interested in me. i dont want to come across as too desperate or i'd have shot her a text by now but i figure if i dont hear from her by tomorrow i will call her",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ogocx7/had_my_first_date_today_how_to_follow_up/
55,ogohlp,1625806490,Is the guy I'm dating into me or not? Why didn't he flirt back?,"I matched with this guy (24M) on June 19th and we been texting and talking since (im 24F). We have already been on 2 dates and I am wondering how into me he is. I think both of us are new to dating because on our first date (lunch) there were moments when we both didn't know what to talk about. He asked me out on a second date via text after the first date and we went to the movies night before last. I had a really good time and we hung out by my car joking for about 30 minutes. We made plans to hang out at his place when he gets back from his trip.

But idk how into me he really is because I tried to flirt with him and he doesn't flirt back. Like he didn't make a move at the theater (maybe he couldn't because the chairs were the reclining kind so it would be awkward to maneuver?) and just said he loved me hair and offered a hug as we were saying goodbye (we did a handshake on the first date lol)

Tonight I sent 2 flirty messages but he didn't flirt back. The first one he mentioned that one day he might take me on one of his trips up North and I said that be nice we could find a romantic spot with a winky face. He just said we could crash at his friend's place. Later he sent me a picture of him on a train and it really was a very handsome pic of him and I told him that with a winky face and he just said it was old and not really into it. He didn't try to flirt back.

Idk im feeling kinda down and wondering if I'm pushing it or if he is losing interest. The last guy I talked to we got really into dirty talk for 2 weeks and planned to have sex but then I chickened out about not wanting to get a hotel room and he got mad etc so that it was awkward afterwards and he asked me to be his girlfriend but the next day he said he was drunk when he said that. We slowly stopped talking afterwards.

So I didn't want to mess up a possible relationship with this guy and I really like him because he's sweet and adorable and chill and we have similar goals in life. Therefore, I haven't said anything sexual and 90% of our conversations are about our pets. He sends me pics of his Yorkies.

But why didn't he flirt back?  It was obvious I was flirting I think anyway and it seemed like he kinda...deflected it tonight. Does that mean something in the dating world?

Im under the average male height in the US at just 5'7"", Im overweight at 175lbs, I have a sunken sternum, Im on the autism spectrum, I have severely low vitamin D and b12 that leaves me constantly tired, Im just not that handsome, and I have no interesting qualities or hobbies. 

Ive been trying online dating for over a year now and that one date has been all that's come out of it. Nowadays the rare occasions I do get matches are just because the girl wants to sell her premium snap. I know I should just delete the dating apps cause Im just one of many guys who end up in the trash bin, but I dont have any way to meet girls in person. 

I dont go to college, all the girls my age I work with have boyfriends, my only hobbies in life are listening to a cappella music, watching Marvel movies/shows, and playing a very narrow selection of video games. I don't have any interests that align with public gatherings where I could meet people, and I have terrible social anxiety so sitting at a coffee shop and striking up conversations is off the table. 

In these 17 months, I have heard many different ways of saying ""you're cool, just not boyfriend cool."" Most notably, an old coworker told me that I was ""adorable in the same way a kitten is adorable."" 

One of my new coworkers said that ""we dont have any attractive guys here"" during a conversation we were having. She then realized what she actually said and apologized to me. 

I will note that there has been exactly one girl who's shown genuine romantic attraction towards me, but quite simply I just wasnt attracted to her, neither physically nor emotionally.

i (26f) have decided to call it quits with my bf (37m) after 6 &amp; a half mostly miserable years together.

the decision to do so came to me in less than a day.

i sat on the phone with my best friend &amp; cried about how miserable i am with him. how terribly he makes me feel. how unwanted &amp; worthless he makes me feel.

i told her how i, a female that’s almost 27 years old, am losing my hair because of the unnecessary stress he’s caused me over the years. i’m losing CLUMPS of hair every time i brush it. i lose multiple strands when i simply run my fingers through it.

it used to take me an hour &amp; a half to straighten my beautiful thick hair. now? 20 fucking minutes.

i saw my scalp while i was casually looking in the mirror the other day. once i saw it, i cried. cried like i had just lost a child.

when everything looked disgusting in my eyes, my hair was the only thing that made me feel even an ounce of beauty.

now i’m losing a lot of it &amp; it’s been hell trying to wrap my head around all of it.

but now i’ve decided that it’s time for me to stand up for me.

it’s time for me to choose my own happiness &amp; choose me for once.

*no more worrying if i’ll say the wrong thing &amp; upset him.*

*no more walking on eggshells.*

*no more avoiding addressing issues for fear of him blowing up.*

*no more fake apologies.*

*no more wondering if he broke another promise.*

*no more begging him to be an actual boyfriend.*

*no more crying myself to sleep wondering what i did to deserve this.*

*no more wondering if he’s going to keep his word today.*

*no more repeatedly broken promises*

*no more accepting his gaslighting &amp; abuse.*

*no more wasting my time.*

after allowing depression to take a strong hold on me for years, i’ve finally mustered up the courage to go to the doctor &amp; address the hair loss.

i deserve love.

i deserve happiness.

&amp; most importantly, i deserve the right to choose who i want to be happy with.

78,ogqm9g,1625815932,Relationships...,"You may have clicked this post because of the title, you expect a long post complaining about how relationships suck or something about a horny moment. But no. This post simply talks about being in a relationship, some ""tips"" I hope can help, and my opinions on relationships as far as I can tell. (Cause I've never actually been in one before lol)
To start, it's obvious relationships are no easy task. Especially as a teenager. Most of the time you and your significant other are being what I like to call, ""hormone bashed"". This can make it hard to cooperate in most relationship situations, such as decisions. Now, already I hear some of you saying, ""If you've never been in a relationship before, why are you acting like you know so much about them?"" Well, to be honest, I don't know much about them. This is simply just speculation based off of relationships I have witnessed around me (I've witnessed more than I think I should).
Second, why is it so hard to find someone? For most people, they date around until they find someone they wish to settle down with. But if you're like me, you DON'T want to date around. Now, I'm not saying I don't want to meet woman, cause yeah, I totally do (lol). But what I'm saying is I don't want to officially be with someone unless I know they're the one. Some of you are probably thinking ""so, you wanna screw a bunch of women until you feel satisfied with one to call a girlfriend?"" Well, no. I don't even want to get touchy feely in any way until I know this person. Not like, ""what's your name?"" And ""What's your favorite color?"" But a majority of the details like, ""what do you prefer to do on your free time?"" And ""How do you normally dress on a daily basis?"" The last one may sound odd, but there is a good explanation. 
Most women now a days are... Eh... Very showing (which can lead to trust issues)... And in a day and age were we use technology to communicate most of the time, it's guaranteed that most people hook up on the internet. Especially with Covid still lingering around. Some of you are probably asking, ""what's wrong with revealing women? They're hot!"" Now, I'm not saying they aren't pleasing to look at, what I'm saying is most of the time, they aren't dating material... Most women would probably be outraged by that type of comment, saying things like, ""How does how I dress affect my dating skills??"" Well, while most women won't admit it, they dress like that because they don't have any other ""skills"" besides there body. So to make up for this lack in ""skills"", they show lots of skin in hopes of becoming a dude magnet. And of course, it works. Why wouldn't it? Most dudes, especially teens, are horny as hell and will f*ck anything that moves. And most of the time, those dude's they get with, are also not dating material. Which should be no surprise... So by knowing most of the details about someone, it allows you to determine who they truly are as a person and can help you avoid people like this. Of course, you would also trade off things about yourself, It'd just be weird to ask someone most of everything about them and NOT tell them anything about yourself.
 And third, trust. In a relationship, you and your partner are equal. So it's important that you know them, and they know you. No hiding anything serious about yourself from them (and vice versa, if they hide something from you, that means they don't truly see you as who you are claiming to be OR they're scared to lose you. Which is good, that means they like you). In a relationship, the old phrase "" treat someone like you would want to be treated"", is more important than ever. You should always treat your partner with absolute respect and love. Doing violent things and cheating, is some of the worst things to happen in a relationship. Doing everything I've said so far should be a damn good way to avoid it. (I hope, I haven't gotten to try it myself)

With all of that being said, I hope I helped some of you a bit, even with being as un-experienced as I am, and hope I got to talk a little about who I am and who I'd prefer. For all of you currently in a relationship, I wish you luck on your magical love life (lol that actually sounds really cringey XD)",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ogqm9g/relationships/

Then after a few months I found someone that I really liked and I told him about it when the topic of dating came up but he seemed so surprised and then he was sad but he said he's happy for me.

Did I miss any ques or something??? I thought we were clear that there was nothing between us. I feel a bit guilty coz I'm not sure if I ended things with him clear enough?

I have anxiety and he said he can't date someone with anxiety coz his emotional strength isn't strong enough to handle (which is a totally valid reason not to date someone) that's why now that I'm dating someone, i'm really confused why he's sad about it.

82,ogr6mq,1625818770,I've seen alot of posts about people who feel either down on themselves from being used or abused. And I felt there is something important these people need to know.," I'm  sure we've all seen these posts. The ""How could I have not seen this  coming?"" ""How Could I have let this person do this to me?"" All of these  posts have one thing in common. It's people who think that there is some  magic bullet that if they had known sooner, would have stopped them  from being vulnerable to abuse and manipulation. And this is the part  that might sound depressing, But there is no magic bullet. EVERYBODY is  vulnerable to manipulation. While some people (Specifically people who  were raised in good homes and have very little trauma to cope with) may  be more resistant to falling into an abusive relationship. It is  IMPOSSIBLE for anyone to be immune from it.

I  will provide a link in the comments(Dating doesnt let me put links in  the post for some reason) to a website that lists alot of the different  forms of manipulation, and their names. This is really important because  while you may instinctual know that something being done to you is  wrong. But without a name added to it as validation, most people will  doubt themselves wither or not they \*should\* have felt like they were  being manipulated. When there is a actual name added to it, you can gain  the confidence to know that the reason it feels wrong is because it IS  wrong! I know it helped me tons when dealing with manipulative people.

HOWEVER........ more bad news

Even  with knowing all the offical names of manipulations you will still not  be immune from it. And this is because of a certain quark of people who  are predators. These people have more or less spent their entire LIFE  literally obsessing over how to manipulate people. Which means by the  time you are in your late 20's, you are facing off against someone who  has been practicing how to manipulate you for nearly 2 decades. Ask  yourself if you would feel bad if you were to get into a competition  with someone with 2 decades more experience than you and then you lost?  Maybe a tinge of sadness yeah, but then you tell yourself it just makes  sense. However when most people are manipulated by someone who has been  practicing the art for decades they will often degrade themselves, tell  themselves they should have been \*better\* or \*smarter\*. They don't often  realize that them being victimized was not a reflection of their own  competence, but a reflection of just how good some people are at  manipulation. (i will provide a link in the comments to a video of the  interrogation of a serial killer, the video shows how easily the  sociopath controls the conversation. And while it might seem obvious to  you when watching the video, to the people who were there, they didn't  realize it was happening until they later reviewed the tapes and  realized just how much the sociopath controlled the situation and these  are people who are literally TRAINED to spot it.)

This  might come across as a weird mental health post in a dating subreddit,  but my heart aches whenever I see someone degrade themselves as if them  being victimized was their fault. Cause while yes, there are things you  can do to help you spot it and pick up on it to protect yourself. No one  will ever be immune. And if you then proceed through your life being  paranoid about figuring out how to spot these people before they can do  damage, you will only make yourself more vulnerable to it.

I  suppose my real point is to stay safe, do research on how to spot toxic  people and be proactive about your own mental health. But realize that  if in the future you are taken advantage of, its not because there was  magic tactic you should have known, its because we live in a world that  only cares about who survives, not what they did to survive. You being  cheated on wasent because you are lesser, it because the cheater was a  predator who knew how to target you. You being abused wasent because you  deserved it, it was because the abuser was a predator who knew how to  make you feel like you deserved it. And honestly the best tool you can  have to combat them is self love. Because the more you respect yourself,  set solid boundaries and take care of yourself, the more resistant you  will become to manipulation. But it will never be foolproof, and there  will always be someone who knows exactly how to get to you. It's kinda  like the idea of being struck by lightening. Yes it can happen, yes  there are things you can do to mitigate the damage, but no amount of  obsession over preventing it can truly protect you if a freak accident  occurs. So it's best to give up on the idea that you have total control  over it. And instead just concentrate oh the things you can control.

Stay  safe out there my friends. I hope you all find loving relationships  that show you that holding onto the good in humanity was the best choice  to make. It's really the only choice to make if you want to actually  live a life that brings your contentment, happiness, and peace.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ogr6mq/ive_seen_alot_of_posts_about_people_who_feel/
83,ogr805,1625818955,"How do I (24, f) manage the pain romantic rejection?","
Stupid question I know but thought I’d try anyway. 

About three years ago I developed intense feelings for a truly wonderful man I worked closely with. It grew over the course of a year or so and it took me by surprise when my fondness and admiration one day became something like love. 

In my mind, at the time, the connection we had was off the charts, the “chemistry” between us was palpable and electric (at least I thought) in a way I’ve never ever felt before or since. We had so much in common it was at times eerie. Like “soul mates” if I believed in them (I don’t). But it felt like a meeting of minds and I thought there was a mutual intensity and attraction . 

But I was mistaken. I built it all up in my head apparently. It was all professional and he didn’t love me and was in fact even in a relationship. I had misinterpreted everything. 

I can’t get over him though. I feel embarrassed, humiliated, rejected, and like I’m not good enough for him (I’m not truthfully, as he has been much more successful and distinguished and he is quite a bit older than me). I feel a deep sense of loss and heartbreak too even three years later. I still work with him a bit though less than before and things are good. We get along great but it’s not like before or how I thought it was before. I always leave netting him happy and admiring him but also very embarrassed and rejected. luckily he
Handled all of it very well and didnt make a big deal of it. And luckily I never made things too awkward or *explicitly* addressed my feelings but he got the hint and made it clear I had misinterpreted him and he feels nothing close to that way towards me. 

I know he’s not perfect and there will be others and I’m focusing on myself as much as I can. It’s going fine and I know should be happy with my successes in work and progress in other areas but he’s still all I want and I still cry (including as I write this). I have finally made good friends , and I tried dating and meeting people but so far I’ve had so many things that go no where and a great difficulty feeling attracted physically or emotionally to anyone for long. I’m afraid I can’t/won’t love anyone. Maybe I’m too picky but I’d much rather be alone than with any of the men I’ve tried dating. 

I know there probably is nothing that will help much, and that this is as common as it gets and not anything special. Im just amazed at how humiliating and how much it hurts way, despite rationally knowing it doesn’t really mean anything about me. Still it feels like it means I’m just not as attractive or good or loveable enough. I only care what he thinks. Nothing else matters much  (in terms of how much I *feel* about myself or life in general ) as irrational and pointless as that is,",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ogr805/how_do_i_24_f_manage_the_pain_romantic_rejection/

But a lot of times at night, he will just stop messaging me around 12-1 but i’ll post a snapchat at maybe 3am and he’ll watch it. But then he won’t open the last message i sent him. He has done it probably 3 times in the 4 weeks we have been talking. 
In the morning he’ll then say something like “oh sorry. i passed out.” I hate being lied to. Maybe he just woke up in the middle of the night and didn’t text me but that just seems super weird. 
We haven’t had the relationship talk yet but that doesn’t mean i should be lied to. 
I sort of want to call him out on it. He just did it tonight. So in the morning when he says he fell asleep i could say that “but you watched my snapchat afterward” but also i’m very confrontational and would rather say “I can see who watches my snapchats, you know.” I could also just message him now and see if he replies but i don’t really have anything to say right now.

Around 4pm he started suggesting to come to my house after, we have had the conversation on our first date as to what we were looking for and I said I want a relationship. I said to him again I’m not in a rush to jump into bed and asked him what his intentions were because I’m starting to think he just wants something casual. He got really annoyed that I asked him this again after we discussed it on the first date and said that I really annoyed him and he did not want to meet. He asked me on the first date to pick between him and the other men I’m seeing and said he would not see other women but I think he was just lying. So he cancelled on me 3 hours before the date saying my attitude over the phone was bad - I think it was because I didn’t want to sleep with him and I kept questioning what is really was that he wanted. I did say to him I would not cancel on someone like that and he said we will talk over next few days and perhaps meet up but I think it’s a big fingers up to me and not sure how I get past being cancelled on like that.
