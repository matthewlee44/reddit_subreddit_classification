We had a good time so I asked her if she was interested in seeing me again.

Second time around, we went to an expensive restaurant outdoors, facing the water. We were both dressed up really nice (nails done, make-up, nice clothes (spring dress, button shirt, name brand Chelsea boots), etc.). We had steak, seafood, and 2 drinks each. The bill with tip came out to around $160!!!!!! We split the bill so I winded up paying $80!!! She picked this restaurant after I had suggested another one but she said it was too expensive. We definitely spent more money at this place than we would have at the place I suggested. I most definitely thought this time around was a date because of how formal and expensive it was. I don’t think I spent this much in a single restaurant besides the one we went to in my life!

While we were eating, I asked her her opinion on a controversial topic related to her career. She was hesitant to answer and was like “well…well” and then told me how her coworker went on a DATE with someone and then the date walked out on him when he expressed his viewpoint. I told her I am not going to walk out unless it is really immoral.

After this meetup, this woman I’ve been talking to for a month, who I met on a DATING app, told me she never thought we were dating. I asked her what she thought she was doing and she said hanging out and chatting. This is nonsense!

to make a long story short, i met this guy on this dating app approximately two years younger than myself. i am not usually attracted to people younger than me (24f), however this guy was so insanely attractive that i couldn't help but to give him a chance. he is undoubtedly the most attractive guy i've ever encountered on that cursed app, hell, perhaps anywhere within my area. the dark eyes, the alternative style, the piercings, they all got me. 

red flags made themselves known to me from the jump in the form of the short responses, the lack of serious conversations brought to the table, the overall joking demeanor of the conversations. however, the terms of endearment came flying out almost instantly, along with little remarks such as 'i'm going to win your heart' and an assortment of other flirtatious remarks that should preferably reserved for someone that you are serious about. 

we ended up meeting up on a friday, which presented a whole host of red flags within itself, yet i still went through with meeting up with dude the following wednesday (after a whole weekend spent flirting, exchanging terms of endearment and expressing clear romantic interest). that whole afternoon was spent cuddling, making out, engaging in a variety activities (which were admittedly limited seeing as i was on my period, thank god), and just overall enjoying a vibe together in his room. he held me, he played with my hair, he kissed my jawline and neck, i felt attractive and wanted. at one point, he admittedly asked me if i would like to ""use my mouth on him"" (i've never done anything of the sort and i refuse to with someone that i am not exclusive with), but at the time, i just kept it pushing. i kept it pushing for the sake of feeling safe and wanted in his arms, that was the first time i've ever cuddled with someone like that and it just felt.....it felt perfect. 

until it wasn't. and of course, i knew it wasn't. towards the end, i knew that that would undoubtedly be the last time that i would be in his room like that, i just had a crippling feeling. it was only confirmed a couple of days later once i asked him what his intentions are, only for him to tell me ""i don't know, i don't know what i want at the moment and i don't want to put you in the middle of it.""

by doing this to someone, you're putting someone in the middle of it. you're literally selling them a pack of lies for a chance to get inside of them, only to throw them away once you either got what you want or they don't comply and you decide to move on to the next. 

i feel as if i have been stabbed in the heart. i am not attracted to his mind, to his intellect, to who he is as a person. i don't know who he is as a person, he is emotionally detached and mentally gone, i could feel that even as he was holding me. however, i still can't shake this feeling of being used like a disgusting mop. i can't shake the recent memory of him holding me against him, almost a week ago, kissing me and biting my lower lip. it fucking hurts. i knew this would happen, yet i still can't shake it. i'm not religious but at this point i am inclined to believe that it was a gift from god that i was on my period and couldn't go further with him, because part of me genuinely believes i would have, which is terrifying within itself. 

please, if you can relate to any of this, guard your heart. guard your heart and guard yourself. i hate that i feel like this, i hate that i miss his physical presence, i hate that i keep thinking back to our brief time together. i hate that i am wasting time on this whilst he's undoubtedly already on to the next. my heart is bleeding.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,755172,public,nsfw,lovebombed and brushed to the side like garbage.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n5482q/lovebombed_and_brushed_to_the_side_like_garbage/,promo_adult_nsfw,3,,,,

 I think it is because of the fact that women nowdays have so many options due to dating apps and social media even the average ones that even if you are a good looking guy with almost everything that a woman would be looking for in a partner they still would want more or to keep talking with 5-7 guys at the same time.

I also have come to realize that I cannot stand compliments, this ones more toward dating than my family. If a guy tells me I’m pretty, I’m smart, etc it makes me want to cry.

Although we hadn’t spoken for a year; the night before he dreamt that something awful happened to me and called for peace of mind. He was out of country at the time visiting family with his girlfriend. We got to chatting about life and eventually he suggested we catch up in person when they’re back. 
At the time, none of this made sense but I’m confident that the subsequent series of events that followed were divine intervention. I know this sounds crazy but hear me out! 

I won’t get into the nitty gritty details but essentially, 
my “partner” of seven months left me to deal with a life altering event by myself (that directly involved him.) We were still together but at that point, I might as well have been alone. In desperate need of an escape -even for a night- there I was, with my ex and his girlfriend. In the year and a half they spent together they: rented an apartment, travelled internationally, met each other’s family and recently got engaged. Then there I was with my “partner” who refused to publicly acknowledge me as his girlfriend; let alone provide emotional support in my time of need or plan a future with me. The crazy thing is, I didn’t even realize how bad things were until I had to speak about them out loud! Thankfully, less than a week later he sealed the deal and dumped me. 

I truly believe that whatever is up ‘there’ orchestrated this all: dream, random phone call from my ex after not speaking for a year; meeting my ex and his gf, hearing about their relationship; the callous way my ex dumped me, so I could wake the hell up and get on with my life!!!

I was absolutely crushed. After that summer I didn’t speak to her like at all. 


Fast forward to now, my dating life has been rough to say the least, so I figured why not and DM’d her on Instagram to see if she wanted to get drinks and catch up. She said yes, and in the process of figuring out logistics she asked if I still talk to one of our old coworkers and to see if she wanted to come along too. She’s still at college thankfully, so I had an excuse. 


It sucks that I’m still in the friend zone though. I was hoping that me asking for drinks with the tiny bit of history we have was enough for her to get the message that this was more of a date. I’m still gonna go and feel things out, I was planning on just catching up instead of making moves and plus maybe I’ll more so like her as a friend anyways. But does anyone have any advice on how to handle this? Should I be straight up with my intentions or should I just go with it for now?

I’ve posted on this sub before and mention my 0-170 or sum like that record before but I must of miscounted that time, plus I’ve been dealt a few more rejections and just being ignored because atp with the total combination of my dming girls as well as approaching in real life I’m at 0~240 lowballing. I don’t understand how I can’t try with this many different people from different backgrounds and different personalities and fail again and again but like it says in the title I’ve figured out why.

It’s become especially apparent with a somewhat newer coworker of mine who is around the same age as me as I turn 18 in a month and he turned 17 a couple months ago, but anyway although we are at similar times in our lives our experiences are extremely different. He’s already been able to have sexual intercourse with multiple women, and has a girl right now, meanwhile I’ve never even had my first kiss. As well as this when we went to the gym on our break time in a neighborhood he was familiar with like 5 of these girls who were hanging out outside, and has many female friends as well as being a guy who gets a lot of girls meanwhile I’ve pretty much no friends and definitely not any female. 

He’s never had any trouble gettin girls and has girls hitting him up consistently meanwhile whenever I try with a girl it’s a 90% chance I won’t even hear back from her. More evidence of this was his constant reminding me of all the girls I could get from Snapchat since a lot of them use that, and his evidence of this was a claim of getting 100 snaps a day and a couple thousand story views. I myself tried it and of course got no girls to add me, I added one and shockingly got added back but ofc unshockingly she left me on delivered like it seems prone to happen to me so it was pointless. 

It’s not just online of course I’ve had many a irl failure as well and again he does not experience that either in fact our whole social lives are completely different as he’s someone with a lot of friends who goes to parties and is having a typical fun high school life, meanwhile along with getting no girls I’ve just been an all around loser who sat at home all day doing nothing and have never been more depressed in my life. The thought of ending it is frequenting more and more. I wish I could say oh maybe it’s just him but nah even before this at my other job there was a similar guy who again, no homo, is pretty good looking and likewise is the same and the aforementioned person I’m referring to, which explains everything.

The pain doesn’t end and at this point it seems like it won’t I’ve had hope for college but that’s pretty much gone especially since In the past having hope has done nothing for me except make the disappointment worse. It’s insane how much the quality of life and level of happiness is out of your control. I already know y’all gon say oh you’re young there’s still time, but that’s just an excuse cause these guys are the same age as me or younger already gettin everything I’ve ever wanted, there is no oh you’re too young no this is the time where things should be happening and when they’re not obviously somethings wrong don’t even try to give false hope it’s pointless.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,755338,public,self,Looks are all that matters,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n566st/looks_are_all_that_matters/,all_ads,6,,,,

Purely in my personal opinion, I find thin eyebrows a lot more attractive and feminine. 

Also because of the current trend of huge eyebrows it makes women who wear thin brows seem more like they think for themselves and don’t just follow the trend of what the current fad is. This shows strength and individuality. (Even if this isn't the case it comes off that way to me)

For the first few months, it has been just fine. I was still living at home and she had an apartment very close by. So, we had privacy when we wanted to hang out and such which was nice. 

After our first date I knew I wanted to start seeing her more. After about a month of dating, we made it “official” and I was going over to her place almost every other day and even staying the night more often. 

About 2 months in, we meet each other’s parents and friends etc. and all has been good. And also around this time, she moved back home to her parents house. 

Around month 3 though is when it starts getting concerning for me. We both want kids at some point, but I obviously don’t know if she’s who I want to have them with. But, she’s dead set on marrying me and talking about “our kids” and just a general future together. I kinda just shrug it off and let it go. But over the course of month, she keeps inserting it into conversations, overly saying “I love you” etc I do say it back, and I mean it, but I think she means it waaay more than me. 

So, now we’re in month 4 and I have recently moved into my new apartment. I was excited to have my own space away from my parents and just to kinda be my own person. I did offer to my GF that she could stay over from time to time to cut down on her commute on days she’s works. Well, ever since I moved in (April 15th), she has stayed over every single night. Every one. And, when she talks, she says things like “we” and “our”. And to me, it’s just a little off putting because my name is the only one on the lease and I’m the one paying for everything. 

And all this time, she is still kinda mentioning marriage and kids etc And honestly, it’s just so damn overwhelming. 

Mainly, because this is my first real relationship and I’m a people pleaser so I don’t always convey the way I’m feeling to people. 

A few weeks ago we did sit down and talk about a lot of these things. While we were having this discussion, she did get a little upset and started crying claiming her insecurities about being alone were causing her to talk about marriage and kids etc 

Idk if she changed her ways about any of them really though. And since we have been together, she’s gained some “comfort weight” and it’s not terrible but I feel like she’s not taking care of herself now that she has me. So, my attraction to her physically isn’t what it was when we first met. 

So, what do you think? For me, only being together for 4 months is not enough time in the slightest to be basically living together and talking about marriage and kids etc And I’m never the one to bring it up or mention it at all. She’s the one that does every time. 

I don’t necessarily wanna break up but I’m almost feeling smothered by her since this is the first time living on my own and my first real relationship.

I'm not a hopeless prospect, it's just that I'm so damn awkward and polite that none of the ladies ever get to know me. Do I have hope? Or are there no girls left, who would meet my rather reasonable (if high) standards: kind hearted, honest, maintains a healthy bodyweight (which means she isn't anorexic or obese), doesn't smoke, doesn't do drugs, isn't a criminal, likes movies, likes me, and doesn't mind having long conversations about our future.

I fear that love will come first, and then relationship, and finally conversation. But relationships are so damn stressful that I feel like I'll never be able to handle those first steps. :-(

First things first, we’re both women. 29F each,

We had our first date on Monday afternoon. It was really nice and we shared some laughs and there was some chemistry I think (for a first date I mean). It was easy and fluid and I really enjoyed her company.

I asked at the end if she wanted a second date and she felt a bit pressured I think, also because of curfew the police was pressuring us out of the park

I asked if she had any ideas and she said ‘none, you?’ and I said maybe a movie at my place?

She said ‘it’s not like we have many options’ (because restaurants and bars are closed)

I said ‘would you like for us to cook or order?’ 

And she replied ‘we’ll see then no?’ 

Which makes me anxious because it shows she’s not as enthusiastic as I am to see each other again 

I asked when she wanted to do it and she said ‘I’m very busy this week and probably out of town next weekend so...’ and the conversation ended there and it failed to confirm a firm date 

Then after we left we texted a bit on Instagram about me going home (there were some issues with the metro), I told her I had a great time and she said
‘Yeah it was cool I liked our discussions :)’ 

Then I said 
‘I’m taking a break from Instagram so I’m giving you my number if you want to talk a bit before we see each other again’

She replied ‘oh okay it works!’

But never texted me... it was two days ago

We just drove around, got ice cream, and eventually found a spot over looking town and hung out the rest of the night. I'd didn't kiss because I'm akward (never kissed lol) and she's kinda reserved so I want to respect her boundaries. Ever since I tried to schedule another date but she said she was over at her family's for dinner or has been busy working.

My friend introduced me to this guy she thought I’d get along with. He’s 28 so a little older. We have been talking for about a day. The responses are literally within minutes and sometimes seconds. We’re so alike and I can be myself with him.

Normally I don’t text anyone back, I’m a horrible texter but it just works with him. I’m not sure if I’m going too fast. I’m someone who wears my heart on my sleeve. I played it off cool but if I’m honest during the conversation, I was on an emotional rollercoaster. I went happy, to excited, to overly enthusiastic. 

If I’m honest he was really authentic and I could relate to everything he was saying. I did not make any of this obvious because I don’t want to ruin things and scare him off. I know I’m an intense person and I connect with specific people. My friend got it so right.

I knew he had to get up early for work the next day (today) so I pretended to sleep. I’ve been awake. The adrenaline (or what ever hormones) kept me up. I realise this sounds insane. Minutes ago I had fucking happy tears (excuse my French). 

Should I stop talking to him? It’s only been a day and I’m jumping in head first. I’ve never been so sure of someone in my whole entire life. I’m very private at first but wanted to share. It’s not specifically about him, it’s his mindset and passions. I’ve never had satisfying conversations like that ever. He got lost in his own mind and I was gone.

Friendships do not come easily for me. If a girl is attracted to me, it may very well be my only chance due to my difficulties interacting with other people. I’ve had crushes on girls in the past but it never really went anywhere. I either moved on from them naturally or found out they had feelings for someone else.

My first relationship ever happened when I was 23 years old. That is super late, and it’s quite embarrassing when you consider the fact that I started doing most things in life later than my peers (I didn’t masturbate regularly until I was almost 19! That’s how far behind I am!). The relationship only lasted 20 days because I was attracted to everything about her except for her looks (but I will admit that she did look slightly cuter in person than she did in her photos), and I didn’t want to lead her on further. She is still occasionally active in my life but we don’t talk to each other much anymore.

I entered this relationship despite not feeling the physical attraction because I was getting frustrated with how online dating was working for me in the fall of 2020 (bad timing I know), and unfortunately she was a backup. For a month. Also, I feared that I would never get the chance again. Someone called me a defeatist on another post for saying this but I think this is me being realistic because I have a hard time simply making connections with people because of the fact that I am autistic. Even if I do make myself more attractive both in terms of looks and in terms of personality, my autism is always going to be there and it’s going to be hard for people to deal with despite it being less noticeable than that for others who are also on the spectrum. The fact that it simply exists already turns a lot of people away unless maybe they’re also on the spectrum.

Even though the relationship didn’t last long, I’m glad it happened because I learned about how dating and relationships work, but I was so far behind my peers that it’s embarrassing.

Their relationship was very rocky and every time they were on a break or broken up, he would pop into my life.

Eventually their relationship came to an end for good and a few months later, we started spending some time together (against my better judgement). For some reason (mostly my own naivety) I gave him a chance and we dated for a few months before he realised it was too soon and he needed to be single for a while.

Fast forward another few months and *ding* he re-appears. He’s being overly nice and sweet, telling me all the things he likes about me, and that he wants to be my friend. That he’s not ready for a relationship but he still wants connection. But THIS time, for the first time, I shut him down and said the following:

“Dropping in and out of my life for the past two years, and then coming back saying you want to be “friends” is not fair and I don’t deserve it. I wish you the best in life but I can’t be your friend. Goodbye.”

And that was that. I finally realised that for the past couple of years I have been filling in the gaps for him. When he’s having girlfriend issues, when he’s healing from a breakup and not quite ready for commitment but still wanting connection etc.....and you know what? FUCK that. Fuck him. Haha.

Now I've been on dating appa lately.  I dont have a lot of photos of myself but  ya know I've come to notice something crazy.

So apparently less is better? 

I wasn't getting many matches for a while.and well My pictures weren't cr*p quality.so it wasn't that. 
But turns out my bio waa the issue.
It had a bit about me like what i do, what im into, and important things like..ya know, im with child. 

You'd think people would read that and swipe based on that.

But noooo.


I wrote something vauge and removed 90% of everything..but photos and boom..ive got 4 matches on bumble and 3 on tinder..and 1 of the 4 bumble matches actually messaged me.

At the very least, I'd love to preserve it so that this story will never fade nor disappear as she walks away.

This story begins kinda like a fairytale story. I met this girl online through a discord server and she lived on the other side of the planet. She lived in Australia and I lived all the way in Canada. We kind of just clicked since day one of talking to each other and we had those classic 12 - 16 hours non-stop discord calls during our first week of meeting each other. With each and every call, we got closer and closer and I just had that special feeling she was the one. Long story short, she felt the same and we decided to embark on a long-distance relationship and tried our best to make it work. She was the first person in my life who loved me for who I was, and I could always be myself without a mask in front of her. She really taught me how to love, and in her eyes, I had no imperfections or flaws.

After six months of long-distance, she flew halfway across the world to Canada and we spent three magical months living together. She met my family and a close friend of mine and we ran across the city embarking on adventures without a care or worry in the world. Just a 20 and a 19 year old running free and deeply in love. I still have so many memories and magical moments along with the precious photos and videos we took. Obviously, when she had to fly back home, you could imagine the tears and sorrow that ensued. 

Everything was great and fine for the next year even as the 2020 pandemic hit, causing me unable to fly to her. We were obviously upset with the border shutdowns and restrictions but we cheered and comforted one another through the pain. We knew that each day that passed, meant we were one day closer to being united. She told me I was ""the one"" for her and the best thing that happened in her life. I felt the exact same way, I really thought and knew that she was the one I wanted to build a life with and have a family together with. She told me I'd be a great father one day, and I knew that she would be a fantastic mother even if she disagreed with me. 

But, I guess all good stories have to come to an end. I really wish it didn't, I wish I had the story of Queen Elizabeth and Prince Phillip's 70+ year marriage story. Unfortunately, I guess I am no prince, nor did life treat me fairly. About three months ago from this posting, she decided to break up and end things permanently. We had a no-contact period of around two weeks which was the most miserable time of my life. I'm not proud of it, but I had suicidal thoughts and that was when I first reached out for help. I called crisis lines, counselors, and reached out to every mental health resource available to me. I always knew she meant the world to me, but only when you face the loss of someone do you feel how painful and agonizing it is.

I reached out after two weeks to reconnect and we actually got back together. But like all things, there was a catch, things were far from normal and it felt like it was declining again. I understood she was dealing with a lot of stress and family issues so I did my best to compromise and accommodate her. I did my absolute best to give her space and I put 110% effort into the relationship. Ironically, the harder I tried, the more effort I put in, the more she drifted away, and the colder she treated me. It got to a point where I could no longer bring up my feelings or talk about how she was hurting me with the way she was dismissing my needs. I would always send her a nice sweet text asking about how her day went or offering help, but I'd get a one or two-word response saying that ""it's fine"" when I knew things were far from ""fine"". The more I tried to reach out, the more pushback and distance I got.

Fast forward two months of things declining, we talked one day and she told me she was done for good, and couldn't do this anymore. Her reason was that she had too many obligations, responsibilities, and things going on in her life. She needed time to work on herself, and said she wasn't ready for any relationship right now. Obviously, I trusted her, I always gave her the benefit of the doubt and I would never think she had bad or malicious intentions. Nor would I think she was being dishonest or lying to me.

But four days later, I see her out eating on a date with another guy. I found out through his social media posting, and that really devastated me. I tried not to think of the worst-case scenario and told myself he was just a friend. I mean, there's no way she could move on from a 2.5-year relationship just like that right? Turns out I was wrong, couldn't be more wrong actually. About a week later it was her birthday, and I see them hugging and kissing through his social media posting. They took pictures in a photo booth and the way he wrapped his arms around my partner of 2.5 years absolutely killed me and crushed me. Of course, I was confused, she told me she wasn't ready for any relationship, she said she had not moved on yet, and she said there was no one else in the picture and she wasn't dating anyone. I guess she lied even until the very end, yet I hate myself because I still love her even now.

I thought things could not get worst but it did. Just last week, she flew to another city half way across the country in Australia on a vacation with him. And he posted on his social media yet again, of them together standing inside a love heart sculpture at a theme park. They then went dancing and clubbing together the very next night.

I don't know what to think, I have a million questions. Yet when I reached out to her to clear things out, she refused to call or talk to me, and she won't answer my question about her and him. When confronted she simply left me with a ""why does it even matter"". I really don't know what to say back to her because she removed me after that message on Snapchat. The truth does matter, and I guess I just hoped she had the decency to show some compassion and basic respect towards me.

One of the biggest questions I may never ever get the answer to is, how does someone you've been with for years move on so quickly to the next person in a matter of days? Why can't she be honest with me even at the bitter end? What happened to that girl who fell in love with me and told me I was her future husband? How did we get from day one of us meeting, to here at this moment? Did she mean those thousands of promises of always staying by my side? 

How much did she really love me?

I started and built this relationship off of a few main values and I told myself to never break them. Those values are honesty, trust, and compassion. I can say without a doubt that I always tried my best to uphold those values and even the last few months I showed nothing but compassion to her. But I don't understand why she couldn't show me any one of those three values she agreed to on day one.

You might call me naive or dumb, but there's a part of me that's still hopeful. Hope can be a beautiful thing but also dangerous and painful because it may never come true. But I'm hopeful that one day she'll change back to that compassionate and kind girl I knew for years. I'm hopeful that with time she will realize how much I really do love her, and how perfect we really were for each other. I'm hopeful that once this pandemic is over, and when I get to fly over there to hug her, she will feel that passionate young love that we felt during our magical summer two years ago.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,755813,public,self,"Story of young love, magic, heartbreak, deception, dismissiveness, confusion, depression and loneliness",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n5bww5/story_of_young_love_magic_heartbreak_deception/,all_ads,6,,,,

I have been chatting with this guy recently (strictly online we have never seen each other f2f) assuming we were just talking as friends. Today, he told me he wanted to confess something, he has been secretly crushing on me very hard. Naturally, as a straight man, I was taken aback, but wanting to be understanding and non-judgemental, I didn't shut him out. He told me he is bisexual and proceeded to drown me with obscene and outrageously lewd sexual talk. I mean it is flattering to be THIS desirable by someone, but something he said was shocking and eye opening. I asked him what made him think this would fly with me, he said I give off a gay/bisexual vibe. Come to think of it I have been hit on numerous times by gay dudes.

I have been mulling over this all day long, and its not sitting well with me.

Context, here is what i look like: http://imgur.com/a/kekFyYT

Appreciate any help guys, and if I do give gay vibes would like advice on how not to, thanks :)

Why don't we prioritize our goals and dreams the way we prioritize guys?

Is it because a partner make us feel happy emotions and euphoric? Our careers and goals can do the same.

You have one life to live. One life to make your dreams come true. They can't happen again. Time will pass.

But you have plenty of guys to choose from, who come and go. Saying bye to one does not mean saying bye to all, but saying bye to time you have now may mean saying bye to your future and dreams forever.

Never had a girlfriend, never been on a date etc. Never had many girls at all show interest in me. Hear all this stuff about women making the first move with guys, being super flirty with them, wanting to talk to them wanting to see them. That’s all completely foreign to me. Never used to talk to girls, only just recently started. Gotten a bunch of rejections, a few numbers, one led me on for weeks only to keep flaking on meeting up to the point I had to cut off contact and the others all ghosted me fast. 

Just feel like being liked by someone is such a foreign concept for me, like maybe I’m just one of those guys that wasn’t meant to ever have kids or start a family. When I see couples together it makes me wonder what they’ve done in their lives to deserve that that I haven’t. It just feels like my brain/body is crying out for intimacy and I just can’t give that to it and it’s making me feel like less of a man. Even when I feel like I look good I don’t get so much as a glance from girls.
