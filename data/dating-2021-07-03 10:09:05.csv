I‚Äôm so hurt by his actions but I still care very deeply for him and love him. He‚Äôs having a really hard time coming to the realisation of what he‚Äôs done and who he is and he hates himself. I truly believe he is a good person. I want to be there for him as a friend whilst he tries to overcome his addiction, but I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôm being too nice about the situation and should run.

I want to know if anyone has had a similar experience.

It‚Äôs all about the chase for the guy.. I notice and can predict with 100% certainty that once I text a guy back sooner than 30 mins.. he just ghosts me or I can tell he isn‚Äôt into me anymore.

It‚Äôs like this each time.. a guy will beg and beg for sex but the moment I even just begin to flirt, he starts explaining on a long tangent on why he doesn‚Äôt want to sleep with me (??)

It‚Äôs so frustrating.. I haven‚Äôt been with anyone in a long time because I just don‚Äôt have the patience to pretend for so long.

It‚Äôs really messed with my head since I used to get so much compliments and offers from men (when I was under 18.. I was the most popular at 14).

I kept hearing people tell me it wouldn‚Äôt last long and that I would miss it once I am 30-40 but I am already in my early 20s and the attention has stopped. 

I feel very undesirable because I feel that it has to do with my personality scaring people off since it‚Äôs the only thing that has changed about me since then. 

I stopped eating because I do wonder if looking even younger might help as it did before.

I haven‚Äôt been intimate with anyone in a year now because the moment I agree to - even despite the guy begging or trying to figure out ways to convince me.. he starts putting me down and giving a million reasons why he doesn‚Äôt want to.

There is a specific type of man I prefer; similar tastes and background, good personal grooming habits, etc. like I‚Äôm not into sports‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd rather do art shows or sit around the beach. Kinda a metrosexual type of a guy to be honest.

I tried POF. I put up. Couple pics, no major skin showing and wrote a very detailed bio and was pretty specific about a couple things.

So I got these‚Ä¶ can someone enlighten me? I haven‚Äôt dated in almost 20 years!

A)young guys that try to chat up women my age, they start with ‚Äúhey‚Äù or ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs up sexy, want to go on an adventure?‚Äù
‚Äî&gt; ok 1, I need more than just ‚Äúhey‚Äù‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs kinda a low bar right there and then discussing adventures or anything else gives of serial killer vibes. I don‚Äôt know you, you don‚Äôt know me. And why is a 20-30yr old guy trying to message me?!?!
Go bother women your age.

I‚Äôd delete, delete, delete yet they‚Äôd keep messaging me.

2) then I‚Äôd have some low effort men telling me they work, they get off at 1030‚Ä¶ then just leave it at that. Ok, uh. So what! So do they actually think im going to rush right over? Im 41, im an RN, I work a very stressful job 8-430. Like so what. Nope, pass‚Ä¶ again that gives off serial killer vibes.

3) I had a couple guys that seemed similar to what I was looking for, professional, 40s, divorced, kids. Seemed groomed‚Ä¶. They‚Äôd message me, we‚Äôd chat. I felt I put a lot of mental effort into that‚Ä¶ even though I was mentally drained from work.
They‚Äôd either‚Ä¶ eventually stop messaging me back or message me weird stuff at 3am or would ask if I‚Äôd like to talk ‚Äúoff app‚Äù and I‚Äôd say no, we‚Äôve only talked for a few days, they‚Äôd then stop responding.
Are those guys also only just looking for a booty call?
Call me shy but I want to talk for a good week on app prior to going off app and maybe another week before we plan to get together say: cocktails in a public area.

Am I just a prude or old fashioned? Lol

24,od276q,1625332578,My(21) gf(20) got a second tattoo,"Quick disclaimer: i actually love tattoos and am planning on getting one soon so it's not a ""oh he just hates tattoos"" problem.

Okay so about 8 months ago my gf of 2 years got a small tattoo on her right forearm (10√ó2 cm). Back then she asked me beforehand if i liked the tattoo she wanted and i tried to be honest and said that i didn't. I told her those words exactly: ""yh i don't really like it but this is your body so if you like it i'm not gonna stop you. You can do it no problem"" and she got the tattoo. I didn't particularly like it but it's just a tattoo i don't really mind even if i don't like it, as long as she's happy i'm happy. 

Fast forward to 3 days ago, she tells me she's getting another tattoo (5√ó5 cm crown with the word ""love"" under it). Again i thought it was very dull and hated the placement (under her left collarbone) so again i said and i quote: "" yh i really don't like it but again you're free to do whatever you want. If you like it go for it"".

Keep in mind that in both occasions when i said i didn't like the idea she would tell me half jokingly things like ""so you're not gonna find me attractive anymore?ü•∫"" or ""you won't love me anymore if i do it?ü•∫"" (those are actual messages she sent me during our conversations on whatsapp) and each time i would tell her that i will obviously still love her i just won't like the tattoos. When she got from the parlor, she asked me if i liked the new tattoo (even though she knew that i didn't. I had literally told ther multiple times that i didn't like it hours before she went to the parlor to get it) and being the nice guy that i am i told her ""yh sure i like it"" and didn't say anything else. I just didn't wanna burst her bubble because she looked so cute being so excited like a little kid who got a toy for christmas. I just couldn't look her in the eye and tell her that it looked bad. But for some reason ever since that day i've been irritated (unlike the first time she got a tattoo). It's been 3 days and i'm still mad.  I don't even know why i'm mad and she doesn't know that i am.

Am i being unreasonable? I know that if i told her not to get the tattoo she would not have gotten it but i didn't wanna restrict her since i know she really wanted it and now i feel super guilty for being mad.(i'm not ghosting her or anything, i haven't seen her since that day because we have both been busy so i doubt she knows i'm mad)",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/od276q/my21_gf20_got_a_second_tattoo/

Everyone always says that personality matters more than looks but that obviously isn‚Äôt true anymore. I know that since I‚Äôm going to try to defend myself, everyone‚Äôs going to call me a nice guy but whatever. 

I think I have a pretty good personality. I have a lot of girl friends and a lot of friends in general so there has to be something that makes me a person worth being around or talking to. The thing is I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8 and I‚Äôm just ugly. I haven‚Äôt had a tinder or hinge match since April and I‚Äôve never not been rejected. My standards aren‚Äôt high.

I apologize if this is self-indulgent but I (29M) just deleted my ex-fwb (32F) phone number and text messages and felt a huge wave of validation/peace. 

I was definitely the one who caught feelings first, which were not reciprocated. In the beginning (and tbh even to this day), the majority of aspects about her are what I considered to be my ‚Äúdream person‚Äù. She is one of the smartest and most beautiful human beings I ever had the chance to know. With that being said, she would constantly nit pick my values/beliefs and my personality as our time together progressed. While she absolutely is one of the most intelligent people I know, I always felt she showed a lack of empathy/basic sense of human respect to myself. I felt like she always looked down on me (is that a weird way to phrase it?)

When we ‚Äúofficially‚Äù ended things a few nights ago, I apologized for catching feelings (maybe a better way of saying it is trying to change the dynamic of a FWB to a relationship). She apologized for her past trauma that she projected into our situationship. I told her that there was no need to apologize for that and that I meant it when I told her that I‚Äôll love her through that. 

I brought up some specific comments, during our time, that I said really hurt me. She then proceeded to gaslight me saying ‚Äúoh I never said that to you.‚Äù That was extremely hurtful but, in a weird way, really helped me distance myself emotionally from her. 

Today I finally deleted her info and feel like the final weight has been lifted off my shoulders. I have a date as well and I feel a very gratifying sense of peace. 

I‚Äôm definitely not perfect and I absolutely played my own part in the failing of whatever we shared but please, if you read this, do not ever let someone else dictate your own self-worth.

42,od571i,1625342354,Trying to date without my parents knowing(Dating advices?),"So here's my whole story.

I recently joined to Tinder to find my partner as I've been lonely. Meanwhile, I've got a kind of like 'Helicopter Parents' require their children 'always' to meet 'religious future spouse', and matching their criteria as a future daughter-in-law.

However, turned 24 who just dated 1 girl a long time ago in secret, I feel this suffocating(I'll be honest, I feel desperate to find a right woman due to the loneliness and keep fighting againts academic workloads). I've been envied the couples loving each other and hold hands on public. and realising me doesn't have one, my self esteem has been lessened.

I've made dating websites/apps and wanted to interact with women. But those connections required me to pay(I feel like these include scammers). This ended up landing to tinder, after thinking that this is can be trusted at least.

I've tried to pay tinder using paypal, in order not to reveal this behaviour to my parents and direct Debit payment is not acceptable on Tinder. So I've made TD debit card account and linked to Tinder to get Tinder Gold(as I don't have credit scores. I know i can make credit cards. but I've seen lots of others fail their financial budget and get doomed) I got 4 likes and 2 matches! :D(but I haven't purchased Gold so i cannot send messages/ unblur their profiles yet)

The problem I anticipate is, my parents gonna think this kind of dating is ""Vulgar"" and ""Voluptuous""

Since I'm studying in Toronto as an int'l student, I'm kinda happy that I could avoid my parents' influence in terms of dating.(who due to the failing of S.Korea's SAT entrance exam that made me throw 3,4 years away just to enter the decent uni. In fact, I realised I cannot do this anymore and went to abroad, decided not to come back. Now I'm an undergrad 3rd year student)

Being honest that I'm satisfied to my educational level(university I'm attending to), I feel left out and feel like i'm falling behind than other students, lead me to not finding my future spouse.

However, as I'm living in a rent with my sister, I feel like my parents want to report(?) how's the other one doing. They might think this is the right way of parenting, I feel this uncomfortable to meet other woman to build the future together.

I feel like i'm not independent as I'm not working, depending on the budget(includes the tuition fees, rent, and other budget to buy groceries)

I know this can be seen as a complaint(why don't you work and earn your own money - the reason is that my current academic workload doesn't allow me to balance my work and study)

Here's the short info, this might not be the huge one, but yeah.

I've been feeling extremely down about the whole situation, and I don't know if that's normal? 

For context, I had a crush on a girl and obviously, things did not work out. We met at a party, hit it off and became great friends. After a while of talking, we both admitted that we had feelings for each other so we went on a date. The date was great, but it came at a cost... My friend was no longer in my life. I didn't hear back from her for ages. After many weeks of feeling confused and down, I eventually heard back from her. She explained that she has feelings for me, but she's emotionally unavailable and her feelings for me made her confused. Although it wasn't what I wanted to hear, I was glad she told me; being left and the dark prior was slowly digging away at me. However, I feel extremely down nonetheless. I'm obviously down things did not sad that we didn't work out, but I'm more upset that she's out of my life completely. Our friendship will never go back to what it once was; she no longer wants to talk to me because it makes her feel confused.

We ended up not studying at all and we talked about all kinds of stuff and the talking never ended, i had such a good time and we went out like 3 more times

We usually sit in a cafe that our friends hang out in, and occasionally my ex shows up.
She showed up the last time i saw her and she got super jealous, she and my friend sat with us, my gf started acting in kind of an aggressive way with her
She started acting weird raising her voice telling inside jokes and telling the girl that she would never understand these jokes and overall just being obnoxious and the girl got confused and scared

When i got home i apologized to her and she acted like nothing happened

The next day she got sick and i couldn't go out with her for like 4 days.
When we met afterwards i sensed that her behaviour changed abit, we still talked alot but after like two hours she said she wanted to go home so she could study better, we usually stay for like 4 hours, i felt like she lost interest ,did she?
How can i regain the interest once again if i did lose it.
Was it because of my ex girlfriend?

64,od7vwu,1625351655,Ideas for a second date?,"Hey everyone!

25M here - so a few nights ago, I went on a blind date. One of my close friends set us up after I told her that I found her work friend cute. 

For the first date, we organised to meet at a bar in the city after work. We met up, had a drink, then another. The conversation and banter was flowing well, and it felt like we both were having a good time. I‚Äôm a pretty forward/direct person, so I asked her ‚Äòare you having a good time‚Äô? - she said ‚Äòyes, i definitely am‚Äô. I then asked ‚Äòare you feeling hungry?‚Äô - she said ‚Äòyes, I could eat‚Äô. I then asked ‚ÄòI have a few places in mind, lets fo get some food?‚Äô - she agreed. We decided on a place, walked there and had a quick dinner. The jokes and chat kept going superb. We then took a walk to the train station, we held hands, and I told her I‚Äôd like to see her again - she said she would to.

She‚Äôs since offered Tuesday/Wednesday night after work for the next date, after a few texts to organise this. Now I may be overthinking it all, but we both work corporate, so a date after work gives us minimal time. E.g. first date, we met at 6.15 and were on our way home by 9. 

So I want to make this fun for us both in the limited time, and am thinking of maybe booking us in for mini golf and then dinner? My only concern is that mini golf is sort of a very basic / popular activity in the dating scene in our city (I have almost taken every girl to mini golf on a 2nd/3rd date).

Has anyone got date ideas for a work night that are usually fun/successful?

TLDR: had amazing first date after work, planning second date and not sure of the best idea that will be fun! Need advice.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/od7vwu/ideas_for_a_second_date/

68,od885l,1625352883,Guilty or tricked? And how to move on?,"
I (F26) was in a 5 years old relationship with this guy (M32) when I started having feelings for this another guy (M35)

Guy 1: The relationship was falling apart and I was feeling suffocated. He was trying to control my schedules, what I wore, how I behaved and he would not accept me how I am or really listen to me. He convinced me about starting to open to other sexual experiences.

Guy 2: We started to talk a lot at parties and I immediately felt a connection. We would finish each other‚Äôs sentences and we always thought the same way. I started flirting very subtlety when I caught myself having feelings for him, so I told my bf at the time, guy 1. I was not sure about Guy 2 feelings for me, but he kind of implied being sexually interested in me.

The three of us were good friends and we had sex one or two times.  

I talked with guy 1 about having an open relationship and he gave me an ultimatum, either monogamy or break up. I knew I couldn‚Äôt shake those feelings, and I thought guy 1 would accept the idea of being open.

Guy 1 got aggressive, insecure and clingy. I felt I had to stand my ground, the relationship was to a point of rupture anyway and I know I couldn‚Äôt shake those feelings, so I stuck up with the idea of being open. We broke up, both got really hurt. Guy number 2 gave me advice multiple times on how he was a jerk and I deserved better.

Since I didn‚Äôt have a place to go, I moved in with guy 2. Things were amazing, sex was great, intense. We‚Äôd watch porn together. My feelings for him got bigger and bigger, so I started to disregard the idea of non-monogamy. He was always very supportive and a sweetheart, but he has a problem with being in control and sometimes I felt that if I did something different from what he wanted, he‚Äôd be upset. One day I started to feel he or something was off. I knew he always have had open relationships and wouldn‚Äôt possibly give up on that, so I started to grow the fear of being cheated.

One day, I sneakily looked into his phone and found all the dating apps. He had notes of the people he was with, which looked like dates. On only fans or another app like that he was receiving those ‚Äúwoman/member invitations‚Äù which made me think that he was still or planning to be with other people. The fact that that could happen behind my back made me very insecure.

I confronted him, he felt offended and was somewhat aggressive, because he had a previous jealous freak gf. He goes to the room and doesn‚Äôt talk for hours. He forgave me, but avoided the issue and never gave me any explanation. My ‚Äòvalidation cup‚Äô was left  empty. He was the best at complementing me and give me advice though. But I unfortunately couldn‚Äôt shake those feelings. 
One day, I looked into his computer, which was just next to mine and I found a paraphernalia of folders with porn videos and some folders with sensual photos of his friends, inclusive one or two photos of me taken from ig, also some videos with the faces blurred and sound modified. Also, he had accounts on porn websites. So I assumed, ok this guy is addicted to porn. 

I had to confront him again‚Ä¶obviously he didn‚Äôt like it, he starts saying I‚Äôm like his previous crazy gf and shuts me off and gave me silent treatment. He left for 3 nights and didn‚Äôt anything.
But we still got back together. Although one more time I didn‚Äôt have any kind of explanation. He decided to give a password for all the websites and built couple accounts on his previous single dating accounts. 
One time when we were watching porn I asked him if he ever did any video and he said no. Other times he also asked me if it would be something I would do. While having sex, he started to put some videos where you couldn‚Äôt see their faces, no sound. To me it looked like it was him. I started to be paranoid, but every time I asked him anything about something he said no. But my intuition believes he was lying. The other day, I saw he was deleting stuff from his account and he reset it. Am I being paranoid or is this guy a compulsive lier? Would he do that because he knows I‚Äôd be more unsure if I saw it?
He always made me the issue around me invading his privacy, but never tried to reassure me. Instead, he focused on the fact that I‚Äôm such a insecure and jealous person, when I‚Äôm not like that, unless I feel many coincidences are starting to happen. And I am very open sexually, I just hate lies and cheating.

One or two days after, I noticed my phone is acting weird and start having problems with it. I thought it was being hacked, I would change settings that would go back to the previous one or deleting apps and having them again the next day. He offered to help, by resetting through his computer and iCloud. 

One time after, when I connected my phone through his iCloud it says that it is his phone and that I‚Äôm using familiar sharing. I thought, is he trying to manipulate what I do or see in my phone? 

Days ago, I passed the whole night and didn‚Äôt sleep to figure out what was happening with the phone, he offered to help and I said I want to do my own things by myself and that I don‚Äôt want people to do things for me. He got upset, went to sleep and broke up the next day focusing on all the bad things I am and that it was because of a build up of things. He was cold and aggressive like nothing happened.

72,od8xh7,1625355480,"Daily reminder to practice these things! Because despite what you think, there is a reason you aren't getting the women!","1.  Practice your social skills, not just with women.  Practice confidence, find something that works.  Because at the end of the day, there's something good and if you want to make 10/10 impression you need to be charismatic, not with just that girl but the ""waiter,"" ""clerk,"" etc.
2. Hygiene and style!  Last time I got scolded implying guys who can't get women are cavemen, unhygienic, nasty creatures.   That's not what I'm saying.  Never was it.  Get a good scent, always wear deodorant, get a hairstyle that fits your face, and a style that fits you and goes for who you're trying for (don't be tattooless trying to get some gorgeous beautiful full  body tattoo'd girl).  Get cleansers, get sleep, moisturize, smell good ALWAYS.  
3. STYLE, STYLE, STYLE... not sure why but I don't care what you say, you can always improve.   
 This is how you kill it with random encounters.
4. DON'T BE BORING!  If you're doing EVERYTHING POSSIBLE, and still walking away with nothing, getting burnt out.  I'm sorry it's not the girls my friend, it's you.  If you strongly believe you're a 5/10 and can't even land an average girl for a date, something is wrong.  
5. Again, I'll be honest the most beautiful girls I know are dating guys with okay-decent jobs but do shit like motocross, bands, etc.  Something fun and are semi charismatic.  Don't just be sitting at home playing games, wondering why random girls are standing you up.

\*\*\*I'm a gamer, but I have other hobbies.  So before some girl comes in and trashes me talking about how she doesn't mind it.  I don't care.  I'm not talking about the 1/100 girls that absolutely go nuts playing video games.

So therefore being the friendly person I am. I start to ask questions to get to know them. Every reply has been one worded almost. I tried asking complex replying questions to maybe have them open up. But nope.

75,od98ta,1625356690,I understand how people become heartless now,"I never understood how some people are so cold, but after having my heartbroken and being abused, I find myself becoming colder day by day. Before she took my virginity, then cheated on me multiple times, my heart was filled with only love and seeing people in such a positive light. Seeing people in a positive light is what allowed me to take her back so many times, knowing she had her heartbroken many times before me and all she needed was for me to love her a little harder. Foolish me, that never worked and eventually I realized after two years of misery that I had to break all ties with her. 

At first, it was a relief. It felt like a huge weight was lifted off my shoulders. No more stress, paranoia, and constant tears. However, as the months have passed and the love has slowly faded, hatred has taken it‚Äôs place. Anger has continued to build within me thinking about all the times she did me wrong and abused my love. The anger always seems to be there now. Just below the surface of my skin. My walls continue to get taller and thicker as my trust for people continues to fade.

I never wanted to be this guy, I don‚Äôt want to be this guy. However, I don‚Äôt know how to turn off the anger and resentment. I don‚Äôt know how to heal the pain. I refuse to be one of these hurt people that hurt people though. I refuse to hurt someone in the same way she hurt me. I refuse to create the anger I feel now in someone else. I refuse to try and bandage my pain through promiscuity and playing with others hearts. Until i‚Äôm healed, I will not allow anyone to get close because no one deserves to feel this pain.

78,od9k98,1625357924,I'm 24 and have aspergers - how do I pursue a relationship?,"I'm a 24 year old guy and I was diagnosed with aspergers as a kid. I grew up poor (like living below the poverty line) and was pretty severely bullied at school for that and my 'tism.

I dropped out of high school and taught myself for 4 years, I did pretty well at it and got a scholarship to college and law school. I lived at home during college and commuted there. I did well at college and law school and graduated summa cum laude in both degrees. After a lot of trouble in job interviews I finally landed a good job and have gone from poverty to being materially comfortable.

I had always kind of assumed that, having grown up poor that money would solve all of my life problems.

It's solved a lot of them tbh, renting my own apartment instead of living at home is quite nice, as is not having to count pennies all the time, but one problem remains. I've never had sex, I've never kissed a girl nor have I ever asked anyone out.

I've always assumed that I was too ugly and too socially awkward and generally weird to really get anywhere, I thought that if I wasn't, someone would've asked me out, which has never happened. I started a tinder and bumble about 3 weeks ago and average a few matches a day with attractive women on each, so perhaps I'm not as ugly as I thought (or my pictures are excessively flattering, probably a bit of both). The conversations never really go anywhere, especially on tinder where I never get a response.

A lot of people are virgins. And a lot of people are fine with being virgins. Not necessarily the majority of people my age, but more than thousands. Enough to where I'm chill with that. 

I follow the advice on this sub to a Tee. If your plan is to offer the standard tips as a starting point, you don't have to worry. Therapy, meds, exercise, gratitude, focus on building my character and traits, hygiene, extra hygiene like skincare/cologne,  job, social network, creative and social hobbies &amp; mostly the general desire for self-improvement. 

There's the half of my brain that thinks I'm cool and collected in my journey through life. That an opportunity to date will come to me when it happens. 

Then there's the negative half of my brain that I have to actively work hard at to stifle, but it's very compelling and hard to dispute. 

Primarily speaking, being a virgin will *LOGICALLY* cause women to reject me. Women who MAY have happily dated me otherwise and who aren't ""the wrong woman for me"" just for their stance on this. They could've made for awesome partners if I had this experience, for all we know. Key phrase, FOR ALL WE KNOW. It could go either way. Hard, but not impossible.

Here's the *CRUX* of my issue. It's IMPOSSIBLE (0%) for me to EXPECT a woman my age (I'm turning 23 next month) to tolerate, AND WANT TO BE WITH, a man who's never KISSED a girl before. I see how it can make any woman ask, ""What's wrong with this guy that caused him to be kissless at ~23?"" I see this as the UNFIXABLE turn-off. 

I'm asking for support. I'm asking for hope. Some advice that would help is: How can I defeat the belief that I'm defective as a human since I lack *ANY* evidence that I am capable/worthy of being liked/loved in a romantic/social context by a woman? (To the point where no woman has ever considered kissing me.)

And: How can I reconcile with the fact that any chance of affection/approval/positive perception from a woman will take YEARS of hard work, patience, and struggle while I witness time passing me by and many other men finding romantic success?
