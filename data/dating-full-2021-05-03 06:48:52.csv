There is a lady I'm hanging out with in the last month. Everything went amazing, but after the last time we met she gone cold and I haven't heard from her 6days ago . She asked for break when I asked if she wants to come over the same day's night when I left her place. I said that's fine and I left it there. From the next day I sent her for 3 days, each day a message to carry on with the chat that we had before. Reading back what I sent her made me realize it was quite unnecessary to message those things, but I lost control this time... I didn't ask to meet to, just a casual chat.  She replied only Tuesday after her last exam. She said she'll do a short term plan on Wednesday, I asked what's the basic idea, but she gone silent. I'm having a hard time holding myself back not to text her and ask hows she is doing... I really like her, she isn't like others for sure. I would like to get her back. What should I do?!

He said he is open to a relationship but not with anyone (same). I ended up thinking that he was a bit too forward in the kindest way and I had gotten out of a relationship a month or so beforehand. We had some really great chats. I think he took it a bit negatively and blocked me on social media. I had noticed that he unblocked me on social media so I reached out saying it was probably a miscommunication. He responded positively and we had our first date. Said to me to come to his which we did, we ordered food to his (very gentlemanly sort of guy), attracted to each other, great chats again and we went on a little evening picnic. We both have similar interests in academic stuff. We only kissed that night. I got to his around 6 pm and left almost 12 hours later. He offered that I could stay the night but we could sleep in separate rooms or he was happy to drive me home but it was late, so he ordered an uber for me. We both are quite busy and we had our second date a few weeks later. He said it would be nice to hang again.

Anyway, the second date comes, I got to know him a bit better and he mentioned that we're quite similar. Joked that we both mumble a lot. Ended up sleeping together, not a selfish person, cuddled afterwards and had our good chats. The date went really long like last time and I got an uber home. He messaged me asking if I was okay and to send me the details of the driver. We have been in contact via social media a bit since.

I'm just unsure whether he should be the one that expresses what he wants in person or do I mention that this is what I'm after. He works till the evenings throughout the week and weekend so it seems that I can only see him after work hours.He reached out asking how I am, days went by and I started to think that I didn't like it how I wouldn't know when I was going to see this guy again and that if it's not meant to be, it's all good. Immature but I sent him a text saying that I didn't like it how our two dates consisted at just his house and that I'm often left not knowing when I would see him again, I said I don't have expectations around texting.

He said he would talk to me the next day as he had a lot on his plate and he is sorry for not mentioning when he would like to see me again in the manner it deserves. I knew the answer wouldn't be good so I deleted him off my social media. He sent me a very rude message the next day saying I was immature, we ended up calling and he said that he thought he would be open to a relationship but he thinks he cannot provide what I would like. I then said to him that I've only met him twice and I'm unsure myself but I do like to know when I'm with someone if they would like to see me again such as 'this was great, when are you free next?' and weirdly he said he felt the same with me. He also said something along the lines of that he doesn't hear from me for days and is unsure of how I feel. He said forget the relationship talk, that he likes me and thinks I'm cool but he asked what my expectations were regarding texting and said he would like to see me again. He said we don't also have to be sexual when we catch up, we can be friends or anything. He told me that he's meanest to the ones he likes the most. He jokingly said that I'm so annoying when we were bantering over something.

The next day I said I would like to see him again but I would not pressure him but I understand if he doesn't as I don't want to waste my time. I apologised for blocking him. He rudely responded and said ""I don't want to deal with this f\*\*king bull\*\*\*\* right now, name. I said I've been accommodating enough and to not contact me again. He replied saying 'f\*\*\*\*\* off, mate' and blocked my number and on WhatsApp.

TL;DR guy that I would have liked to have seen again has proved to be quite unstable. Unsure whether I've done the right thing but not ever going to talk to him again. We unfortunately are very similar and have similar interests. I've noticed that he's been blocking a lot of people on his Instagram. Unfortunately, we get along really well in person but do have a habit of overtalking each other and that was evident in the last phone call we had. I had to resort to saying 'I'll give you 30 seconds' and then you can talk etc.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,751645,public,self,Unsure how I (26F) should proceed with this person and how he (35M) feels.

So basically I have a bad history in my dating life. This year a girl asked me out about few months back in January. She seemed really genuine at first and she is obviously really good so we both started dating. Last week we shared our social media accounts (instagram). I kinda wanted to know a bit about her past life relationship so I tried to find the message box of her ex. I got in and it was pretty ugly. Now here interesting things come up. She admits to be really into me and wants to have a serious relationship with me and I wanted the same too rather than just hooking up and go away. 

In the ex's message from way back they were asking questions each other and the guy asked her how many relationships she was in by now - she said casual relationship - 6 and serious - 0. Interesting thing is she told me she had 2 relationships only. My insecurities grew. I also found another guy chat which seemed like a pretty serious relationship texting. Nothing more than after that.

I looked more and more and I found more lying stuff as in she told me I was the first guy she kissed ( I didn't wanted to buy that but she assured me) then I found a text where they were talking about a truth or dare kiss and she said to the guy that it was annoying and get lost and whatever.

One particular thing I notice is she practically texted everyone (I want to justify this a being very social) I did find 2-3 pics which seemed like a date with some dude but the chats were contradictory.

Now comes the juicy part - there was a particular guy who was considered as friends with benefits shit about an year back (my gf told me about him) and I found some bad sexting and shit. What interested me was the guy called her a ""playgirl"" as in a girl who parkours out of relationship really fast. 

She did lie to me about having less exs. But her defence might be she shared her social media to lemme know her history or something. And my past relationships (particularly one resembles the same kind of situation but the girl was really fucked up in that one.). Something in the back of my head says ask her and she must have some good justification which can relief me from my over thinking insecurities and I shouldn't be insecure too at any cost.

I never really put forth much effort into dating because of constant rejection and poor self-esteem.

This is going to get downvoted but whatever i feel like it needs to be said.

Because of how different dating is for men and women, women usually are very bad at giving dating advice to men. In dating women are allowed to be passive. They aren’t expected to ask guys out, make plans, pay for dates, et cetera. 

Men are expected to make all of that magic that happens in the early stages of dating happen. Whether this is fair or not is irrelevant. But this objectively is the way things are today. This isn’t to say dating for women is effortless but it takes significantly less effort than dating as a man.

Because of this I don’t think many women understand how dating as a man is. Most men slog through constant rejection (which in a lot of men leads to other issues), the pressure of being the one that has to make things happen, and the feeling of being replaceable because, let’s be honest we are to most women when it comes to dating. Most women could find a date every night for a year, so they really can just replace one man when he doesn’t meet their standards, guys don’t have the same luxury.

As an example I like to use some commonly said dating advice that I typically see coming from women.

“You’ll find it when you stop looking for it”
This is so untrue for most guys, as most guys need to be the ones making the first moves for a relationship to happen. If they just stop looking for it they’ll end up single

“Work on yourself and you’ll find someone naturally”
This isn’t bad advice I just don’t think it’s true for men. Men need to work on themselves but most won’t find someone through that. It’s the same as the previous example, if you work on yourself and put no effort towards dating, you’ll be ignored for the guys that are actually giving women attention.

Both of these are great advice for when you can just wait around for a guy to ask you out, or when you go on tinder you get 99+ likes, but that really only happens to the top .1% of guys. So this advice really isn’t useful to most of us.

When choosing a partner we have a tendency to have a checklist of prerequisites that we look for before even considering whether or not to date that person. We also have a tendency to refer to these prerequisites as ""standards"" when in fact they're ""requirements"", and yes there's a difference and it matters. 

For starters it's good to have standards. We all have standards for ourselves and it's good to want those standards in a partner. Is it good to have requirements though? Well it depends. Too many requirements can reflect how shallow or narcissistic a person is. If you don't mind being shallow or narcissistic then have all the requirements you want. But if knowing that you are shallow or narcissistic bothers you, then you need to take a hard long look at your requirements and ask yourself if it's worth it to have these requirements at the expenses of your own self worth and reputation.

So the easiest way to tell the difference between a standard and a requirement is to pay attention to the language you are using when you say what you want from a partner out loud. If you say that you want a partner who believes in a certain concept, or you want a partner who thinks a certain way, those are standards. However if you're saying that you want a person who ""is"" a certain way or you want a person who ""has"" a specific thing or status or position, then those are requirements. 

Some examples would be saying ""I just want a partner who thinks love is more important than sex"" is a standard. Saying ""I just want a partner who's body is in good shape"" is a requirement. Saying ""I want a partner who is willing to talk about our problems before walking away"" would be a standard. Saying ""I want a partner who has at least a bachelor's degree"" is a requirement. Saying ""I want a partner who believes in the same religion as I do"" is a standard. Saying ""I want a partner who makes good money"" is a requirement. If it serves a physical or functional need, then it's a requirement. If it serves a principle or belief, then it's a standard.

Once you recognize the difference you can stop labeling your requirements as standards and hopefully recognize that what you want are a list of conditions that must be met. Now as I said before it's not necessarily bad to have requirements, but having too many can make you seem too superficial. Is it okay to require your partner to have a job? Well that's up to you to decide but if you require that your partner hold a certain title at their job or make a certain amount of income, well now your requirements can be viewed as shallow. It's up to you if you care or not if you are perceived as shallow or not, but if it bothers you, try recognizing that you do have shallow needs and decide how much are you willing to change yourself. If you have certain requirements and it bothers you that you may be shallow for having those requirements, try relaxing those requirements a bit. Recognize that the more requirements you have, the less attractive you become.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,752123,public,self,Please recognize the difference between having standards and having requirements.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n3w8zn/please_recognize_the_difference_between_having/,all_ads,6,,,,,,

My bf and i got into an argument the other day and he told me that it must be hard for me to date a guy who is insecure with himself. I wonder, will this relationship be worth it in the long run. I love him to death and will do my best to support him and make him feel my love and attention but I mean, if he is that insecure, i am scared if he will flirt back to a girl who gives me the slightest attention or flirts with him you know.. anybody could do that without actually breaking up with their partners, to have his self-confidence/self - esteem glow.

(Sorry kinda long read but I want to be as detailed and objective as possible for context)

I've been seeing a girl (23F) for 3 months (3 irl dates rest is through video chat because we have the same intense graduate and internship program on top of distance between us)

We had fun in the beginning but right now it's crunch time for the finish line for grad school and I think that and the whole covid affected our energy dynamic. I am more low energy, awkward, and monotone (basically can't be myself) and she's the same and more venting. So basically that's how we were in the last irl date. At the end I asked how she feels about dating and she replied with basically with our dynamic/personality she sees us more of friends. We talked a little bit about how things might have been different had it been non covid and we are on campus together and our dating approaches. She is very old fashioned and needs alot of time before opening up on top of me being the first guy she's dated past a couple weeks. I walked her to her car, she asked for a hug and we said goodbye. 

When we got home I called and communicated to her how I felt. Basically I needed to focus on school and some personal stuff and I couldn't put the energy into dating and also asked if she was willing to try again once we graduate. She said this wasn't an answer she could give on the spot because as of right now it would be a no but she will really think about it and text me. We talked a little bit (awkwardly lol), she said that it took alot of courage to tell her that, and said goodbye. My approach right now is to give her and myself space. But maybe after 1-2 weeks I would like to text her something light hearted or wishing her well because this program is pretty intense and stressful.

To me it just seems that he is just very insecure and acting jealous, but I would be curious to hear what other people think and if this is normal?

I really don’t want him dating our friend to affect my relationship with him and with her but I feel like that’s actually what’s gonna happen. Or him acting insecure might push her away and make her end their relationship and in my brother’s eyes it will be my fault.

We both had crappy partners in the end and have been each other's first in a lot of regards. She says I'm easy to communicate with, we don't fight, show each other affection and much more.

Heres the hard part, and why I don't want anyone to feel bad for me. I'm the asshole in this relationship. I dont treat her poorly, infact quite the opposite. I shower her with quality time and affection. But, I got into it because I was lonely, and the pandemic really cut dating and sex out of my life and i truly felt desperate. Other than the fact that Ive now spent 4-5 months with this girl and developed some level of emotional attachment, there is so much lacking in her and in the relationship, that I know I wouldnt put up with if i felt more secure with my prospects outside of her and I together. 

I am an objectively good looking guy, and have recently really come into myself socially. But my anxiety with new women is still crippling, and I don't have many friends in the city where I live. I don't know what to do. 

I am just so sad, and feel guilty. This girl is falling in love with me, and here I am just going through the motions.
