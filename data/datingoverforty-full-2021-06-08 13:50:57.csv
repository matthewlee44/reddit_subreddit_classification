I have been with my partner for a while now. He's in his 50s (12yrs older than me) and has been married twice before he met me. I am also divorced myself so not really in a position to judge others but somehow it bothers me and makes me worry that he's a bit emotionally unstable and has issues with long-term commitment. He has brought up the subject of us getting married a couple of times and just the thought of being ""the third wife"" is kind of embarrassing and degrading. I don't want to be the ""third time lucky"" or ""third time's the charm"" or all the other things that get said about women in that situation. I've always just brushed it off with comments like ""Given our past history with marriage I don't think either of us are much good at it"" and eventually he stopped bringing it up. Now he calls me his ""not-wife"" which makes us both laugh.

Obviously I love him and enjoy our life together. But sometimes I am sad for what we can't have. It seems like I could have the ""wedding"" if I wanted but I don't see much point given we've both done it once (or twice) already with other people (and this is no disrespect to people that get remarried, just me personally I'm kind of over it). We can't buy our first house or get a first pet because they are all things that have been done already with other people. I suppose we could travel to new places together once Covid is over. Neither of us have children and we talked about trying for that but given our ages I wouldn't be very confident (although I did get pregnant early on in our relationship... 39 and 50, talk about a shock, sadly not to be but you know... maybe still possible...) but a baby is a whole other new human being and probably not something ""to do"" just to tick off ""a first"" with a partner. 

Anyway this was just kind of a rant crossed with a reflection. When I think of my ex-husband and the excitement of us getting married (first time for us both) at 26 and buying a house and traveling and all the good years before it went bad I feel a bit sad that my partner and I don't really have that sort of fun exciting history to draw on. We were both pretty jaded when we met and we kind of saved each other and pulled each other out of black holes so a lot of our relationship has been propping each other up rather than reveling in the fun of life, then Covid hit and our plans to go to Europe and North Africa for 6 weeks didn't happen, and now I'm in my 40s and everything seems a bit... like what is left to do? It seems unfair we only get to do all the good things in life once.

Hope this made sense anyway. Maybe I'm being a bit maudlin! I have a lot to be thankful for.

Which takes priority? How much time do you leave aside for each? Who gets the coveted weekends?

I'm (41M) recently on the dating scene again and having all these flashbacks to all the time spent on boring dates that weren't gonna go anywhere. Or if I did meet somebody I liked, having to choose between them and hanging out with friends and doing other things that were important to me, especially on weekends.

A big part of the reason why I ask is because as I'm getting older, I'm getting a lot more jaded about dating and trying to think consciously of who's REALLY gonna be there for the long haul. It just seems to be a much more judicious investment to spend time with the people that value me now vs random strangers that might turn into a love interest, and even then it might only be a short-term love interest. The intimacy is nice, but sometimes I really wonder if it's worth the trouble.

How do other people in this sub feel about this question? How do you address it for yourself? I'd be curious to know. 

Note: I'm not asking for advice here. I'd specifically like to hear other people's thoughts and experiences and how they address this for themselves. I share my struggles to set the stage, not to get advice. A lot of these subs need to cool it with the internet psychoanalysis. Yeah, I go to therapy. Yeah, I'm aware of my attachment issues.

As a refresher: I dated a woman in my early 20s for a few months. I cheated on her, and, to no one’s surprise, she dumped me and walked out of my life.

Now, 20 years later, a few weeks ago, I saw the girlfriend I cheated on at a party at a coworkers house. It turns out she is good friends with my coworker, his wife and their kids. I’m divorced, 40M. She is 42F, widowed as of two years ago. I asked about apologizing to her / asking her out.

Anyway, here’s the update: My coworker invited me to a barbecue at his house and she was there again. I apologized for my behavior all those years ago, she was gracious and called it water under the bridge and said she’d forgive me if I kept her Bloody Marys refreshed all night. I did, she mostly just wanted more pickles and olives and I was happy to oblige.

Some of you advised that I not ask her out. Some of you advised that I shoot my shot and ask her out.

In the end, I invited her, and her kids, and my coworker, his wife and their kids up to my lake house next weekend for a party. I promised my coworker months ago a trip on the boat once we were all vaccinated, plus since she and her kids are friends with my coworkers family, this just seems like it will be fun for everyone.

There will be 4 other families up there next weekend too, and my son, who I pick up on Friday. 

So, it will be a fun weekend.

I’m not sure how much I want to persue this.  Apologizing to her was really the primary thing I had to get done. That was weighing on me. And, I am interested in her. She’s easy to like. She’s also a single mom, and I’m fine with hooking up with single moms, but I’m not into a relationship with one, but hey, people change, right?

I figure, the party will be a fun chance to get reacquainted, in a no stress, no pressure way (I love playing host to be honest so this is always fun for me) and maybe there’s something there, maybe not.

Contemplating getting out there after divorce (48F) and read that some folks have enjoyed meetup groups. I’m in a big city so I think it should be fairly varied in options. When I signed up, however, it was a little underwhelming at first glance. 

There were what looked like two singles groups. Ok, so I guess that’s an option. I’m unfortunately the age cut off, so I can’t sit at the kids’ high top table at the bar. Probably ok, but still a factor. I wish it was a more open age range given I’ve met many interesting people across their forties vs just my age plus 20 years. 

I love love games and trivia, but the trivia grouped looked much younger. And the games were… more “European strategy games” or role playing. I guess not everyone wants me to kick their ass in Scattergories, Sorry, or Boggle. Lol. 

Some wine groups - I could consider one of those. Do people Uber to those? Just not sure I want to mix my anxiety about being single again with liquid courage. 

I found a True Crime Book Club but it’s 10 women. (Might also scare away my future lover…🔪)

SO, those of you who enjoy Meetup dot com, could you please share some successes and strategies? 

Please know my comments above aren’t intended to be a way to look for an out. And I do not see it as a dating app - I know it’s just to get out there and meet people. That would be particularly helpful for me because a lot of my life here was “couple driven” before our split. I’m fairly outgoing, feel like I can have broad conversations, but it’s still hard to make new friends as an adult. 

I just like to try things with a bit of a strategy in mind, so I’m already trying to put myself out there.

We are not in an established, exclusive relationship, and have discussed this as much at end of April.  Almost 3 weeks ago, I noticed she suddenly had not been initiating texts as much, while I was, almost daily. I also came to the realization I was the one initiating the date plans, never her. The last date I asked her out on, for Memorial Day weekend, she was non-committal to an answer for a couple of days before I followed up. She turned it down, said she might have family plans the night that worked best for me, and also cited a reason about being uncomfortable with her teenage daughter  being home alone while we were out some 25 minutes away (not really an issue in the past). I decided to leave the ball in her court saying,""Ok, you tell me the the next time you'd like to get together."" To this point, I've yet to get a proposal to see each other again.

Since this realization I made weeks ago, I've cut back initiating texts to every 3 days (she's initiated every 2 to 3), cut down on the length of responses and exchanges, made sure to not prioritize responding to her texts right away since she's always been slow to respond. I also have not suggested a new date, and am meeting other women since we're not exclusive (though my feelings for her are quite strong). 

Take us to today, she surprised me with a mid-day text she has a sudden job interview for a position she told me about applying for the last time we were together. She is panicking, nervous, etc and asked I send some ""calming, positive vibes her way"", making sure she mentioned the time the interview will take place. Naturally, because I care A LOT about her, I sent her words of encouragement and sprinkled in some humor. I truly want to see her get this job; it pays more, will allow her to more comfortably afford her new home and support her kids. I truly was touched by the fact she reached out to me for some support. She wound up shooting me an update as soon as the interview was over.

Does this text today indicate the possibility that maybe I've misread what's going on here between us? Would this be the type of message you'd send to a guy who is a ""Plan B"" you're just keeping around as you search the dating pool for other men? Before one says, *why don't you just ask instead of asking us here?* Well, unfortunately, it seems to me that as the guy, if you become the one to bring the ""what are we"" discussion to the table, you've set yourself on a path towards ghost-ville.

But before that question, I wanted to see how we would do on our second weekend together, the drive was good, a few hours to truly chat about things, she opened up more about her ex, and how they still chat a few times a week even though she said he was her past and she did not really hear from him. I asked what really happened when they lived together because for someone to live with someone that does not mean much to her, she had to put up with him for 8 years, again, I am going on what she shared to me, it did not add up, for one, I would walk if the women was not into me anymore, I would find a job and a place to call my own, and not leach, she said he stood around and really did not work, he would miniplate her, did not make any sense, she does not seem one to be taken for. 

Every time I would ask what she wanted to do or eat, she really never gave much of a answer, as much as she said she was a planner, she was not much of one. I think she just left it up to me, which in some way I felt like she was my kid and I had to make all the decisions, I wanted more from her, but she was not showing me anything. I honestly think I would have been better off on my own, then having someone that was not giving me much to work with. Not sure what was going on with her, maybe she had other things on her mind, which I would have loved to hear what was wrong, I asked her maybe twice if everything was okay? She just reminded me of her dog, and I know that maybe I should have asked her to bring her dog, since her sitter was not really doing much with the dog, and the dog seemed lonely in a way, maybe that was my fault, but I am not much of a dog owner to actually travel with them, anyway, she seemed like her mind was somewhere else.

I never presented her with the charm I got us, I think I just wanted to end the trip and head home. Unfortunately It took a long weekend away for me to know that we are two different people, maybe it is me that gave up, or could not look past what I felt I would want a women to be like, but I know I tried to be open minded.

And if I did I thought it would be at least a year after my separation/divorce before I did.

But a few months after I separated, my therapist told me it was time for me to start dating again, since the last year of my marriage had been so emotionally difficult (and loveless/sexless!) for me while my ex emotionally abandoned me, which meant --- my therapist said -- I'd been preparing myself mentally for the end for quite some time.

At first I tried to date organically. I'd put on decent clothes and go sit by myself in a pub, or take walks around the park hoping to return someone's smile. But nothing materialized, in no small part I'm sure because it was during the times of Covid, and also probably because I had old fashioned ideas of how people met their dates.

Then one night after most of the world was in bed, I was alone in my apartment, bored and lonely, scrolling on Facebook, when I saw an ad for online dating. I don't know what motivated me to click on that ad that night -- because I think 99 times out of 100 I wouldn't have clicked on it -- but I did. Initially  I was just curious -- after 25 years of being loyal to my ex I wanted to see what the infamous OLD world looked like; that is, I just wanted to peruse. But to peruse, I had to create a profile, and to create a profile I had to pay 60 bucks for a subscription, and once I'd paid for my subscription and created my profile and uploaded a few pictures, suddenly my inbox was receiving pings from fellow human beings. Best of all, they were female and single human beings who were age appropriate (that particular subsite catered to over 40s).

How much fun I had!

Suddenly I was having a gamut of conversations -- via text and via video -- with real people. And not too long after that I was going out on actual dates -- just coffee dates, i.e. nothing fancy. But after a month or two of trying to date organically with no luck, suddenly I was going on 3 or 4 dates a week with some very wonderful people.

I had coffee with a very very nice -- but nervous -- nurse who'd immigrated from Iran and missed her brothers so very much, but also really still had not emotionally recovered from her divorce, which made me feel for her. Then I shared a pastry and coffee with a fun woman who had immigrated from Russia as a young woman and now owned several spas. And I went hiking with a striking middle age woman who was about to sell her business and retire and so looking for potential life partners. And these were just a few of the dates I had.

I was having so much (platonic, except for a little kissing and petting here and there) fun. And meeting such wonderful people. And I thought I'd be dating like this forever, since I enjoy people so much and after 25 years of commitment wasn't sure I trusted myself to commit just yet. But then just a few weeks into this OLD experience I met just the greatest woman. We had a spectacular six hour date of cocktails, dinner and a long walk with lots of lots (and lots) of talking; then a few days later she had me over for a second date where she made me a delicious dinner and served me lots of wine with the understanding that I could sleep in her guest room if I had too much to drink, but that there would be no sex (I was not yet at that moment emotionally ready for anything more than some kissing, so that was okay by me). And by the third date I cancelled all my other dates and my OLD subscription, and just have had the best few months with her ever since where I genuinely believe (and my therapist agrees) that I met my true soul mate.

So I am very appreciative of OLD. How it allowed me to easily meet such wonderful nice people, and then a very special person in particular. And all without making myself a creep in a public place (""Hello, there, what is a nice person like you doing here?"" hahaha) or having to dive into the hook-up culture I thought OLD might be or having to risk alienating women and embarrassing myself too much.

Anyway, there are so many things about the modern world that I love. And OLD dating is one of them. And I'd like to personally thank whoever invented the idea of OLD.

There seems to be a regular thought in dating (from women) that men do not “text something substantial” conversationally.  Women always say it’s annoying to open with a “hey what’s up” and leads to lack of interest.  

“Why isn’t he texting me something interesting?”

The issue though is This is not how people talk/text.  When I’m texting my friends, it’s often ridiculous memes, a “hey what’s up”, a “hey did you see the bulls game?” Those types of things.  Because we are friends, those “boring openings” and initial texts often lead to a larger convo, or sometimes ends after a few texts.  The difference is that friends “make an effort” to engage in conversation.  In dating , i feel there’s alot of one way on this.  If the man isn’t interesting, constantly, the woman loses interest 

I’m not traveling the world.  I’m not a CIA agent.  I work 60 hours a week in an office and spend an hour a day in the gym.  There just isn’t a whole lot of fascinating shit occurring in life that i can just entertain someone I’m dating constantly…

Contemplating getting out there after divorce (48F) and read that many folks have enjoyed meetup dot com groups. I’m in a big city so I think it should be fairly varied in options. When I signed up, however, it was a little underwhelming at first glance. 

There were what looked like two singles groups. Ok, so I guess that’s an option. I’m unfortunately the age cut off, so I can’t sit at the kids’ (including to 47) high top table at the bar. Probably ok, but still a factor. I wish it was a more open age range given I’ve met many interesting people across their forties vs only my age + 20 years. 

I love love games and trivia, but the trivia groups looked much younger. And the games were… more “European strategy games” or role playing. I guess not everyone wants me to kick their ass in Scattergories, Sorry, or Boggle. Lol. 

Some wine groups - I could consider one of those. Do people Uber to those? Just not sure I want to mix my anxiety about being single again with liquid courage. 

I found a True Crime Book Club but it’s 10 women. (Might also scare away my future lover…🔪)

SO, those of you who enjoy Meetup dot com, could you please share some successes and strategies? 

Please know my comments above aren’t intended to be a way to look for an out. And I do NOT see it as a dating app - I know it’s just to get out there and meet people. Socialize. That would be particularly helpful for me because a lot of my life here was “couple driven” before our split. I’m fairly outgoing, feel like I can have broad conversations, but it’s still hard to make new friends as an adult. 

I just like to try things with a bit of a strategy in mind, so I’m already trying to put myself out there. Would love to hear your thoughts!

It’s basically myself and my two kiddos, who are with me every other week from Sunday to Sunday.  I have no family and very few friends (most are out of state).  I have been very sick this week and under a lot of stress (back in school and of course my accelerated summer classes started this week 😭😭) and these are the times I feel absolutely lonely and sad and wish I had someone around to run and grab some Gatorade or drive me to the doctors, check on me while I am sleeping, etc...I am not a needy person, I have stayed single because I don’t want to settle for less than what I deserve.  I think I am actually a really good partner.  I got out of a bad domestic violence situation and rebuilt my life basically from scratch while rebuilding my own self and self confidence, etc....
Anyone else feel this way on those down days?  The loneliness is just palpable.....I sobbed last night, all alone in my bed because I felt so sick and so alone (no, kids aren’t with me this week).

I have been divorced 5 years and just started dating (49f) last year.  I met a wonderful divorced man similar in age that I am exclusive with who has been met my kids and family and we are very happy.  

I have a “difficult” ex-husband who was brutal during divorce who almost left me bankrupt. I temporarily lost custody due to false accusations (have custody now), lost home and was dragged through the legal system for 3 years.  I contributed to the issues by fighting him but eventually gave in when I was broke, got custody and we settled.  He had a superior legal team.  

Our final decree has some strange rules I agreed to in order to get a settlement in which one is I won’t date anyone for a certain time period which has now elapsed.

Last month my ex found out I have a bf and began harassing me.  Sending me hate mail, followed by messages that he still loves me, asking me on dates, and in the same day calling me the worst mistake of his life and calling me horrible names that I won’t repeat.  He accuses me of harming the children by dating.  I do not respond because he has done this for years and he cannot do anything legally to me that I won’t prevail in.  

I just don’t know how to deal with him and my bf wants to help but I am not sure this is his battle to fight.  He has never met or seen my bf and uses our children to try to get info but they stay out of it.

So I've been in the dating pool for a few years and noticed something interesting (at least for me), it feels like interest in my waxes and wanes based on the time of the year.  

  
For example - Even in my younger days, before I got married and divorced, it seemed that between the months of May and September the dating pool seems to dry up for me.. my usual 2-3 conversationships disappear, I no longer get matches on apps, and I just felt like I generally have a harder time meeting new people altogether.  In a way, I appreciate this break, as it gives me time to work on myself and spend time with my kids, but on the other hand, FUD and FOMO come into play.

Today I get a message saying “you’ve been single a while” from some one who has clearly seen my profile during that time. 

While I didn’t respond, what I don’t get is why people view being single and more specifically being single a while, as a flaw.

I personally would rather be single than waste any more of my life being with someone who isn’t right. This is a choice. Personally, I respect people that don’t just need anyone but are holding out for someone who enhances their life like I am. 

This isn’t the first time either. I’ve had friends say “don’t worry... you’ll find someone” like I’m currently incomplete until I do. (My response - wasn’t at all worried... lol) Meanwhile they are suffering through loveless relationships. Being partnered, not matter if you are happy or not, seems to trump being single. 

The way I see it is I could be like them - with someone but unhappy/bored/apathetic. Or living my life, meeting new people, spending time on things like working out and knowing any minute I could meet my person. But yet the perception is still that single = flawed.

HARD time matching with guys my *own* age. I initially resisted even entertaining the notion of dating these guys (“cubs” they’re called 🤷🏼‍♀️) but they keep pursuing me. So I matched with a few.

Then the 24-year-old and I did a video chat before our first date and he kept going on and on about how young I look for my age. Anyway we met up for the date, which was at a coffee shop and everything was going well until my teenage daughter and her best friend FaceTime called me, wanting to show her friend’s new tattoo. My date’s demeanor changed, because I think he realized that I have kids almost his own age. So the date ended abruptly after that and I never heard back from him again. Still I moved on. Then I matched with a 34yo (so much closer to my age). He liked my profile first and asked me for my phone number. We were having great texting convos, until I sent him a picture of myself and then all of his texts abruptly stopped. Later that day I showed my gf the picture in question and she said I happened to look much older in that pic and said I never should have sent that one.

When she removed her mask, I found she is older than in the pictures and looking very different. I was disappointed. But we started walking and started talking and overall it was a nice experience.

One time I felt she was beautiful and I told her. 

At the end, she wanted to leave and felt like ‘She is disappointed’.

There is this profession that on paper sounds like it would be full of people I would be compatible with. But it seems to be the opposite.

Everyone one has been a train wreck, this last one is still maybe salvageable but usually if something does not look good on OLD its dead. 

The profession is one that requires a lot of education but does not pay anything. Its environmental, so basically a magnet for white women from families with money who want to work in something idealistic. 

They see me, think I look good then I talk or more likely do not talk enough and its done. 

I am trying to figure out if I am self-sabotaging the last one. I have not answered her last message yet. 

I did notice that all three seem to be very social oriented, doing this and that with there big group of friends.  This is not my thing.

We’ve started chatting at length while in our yards, taking trash to the curb, shoveling snow, etc.  Each conversation is easy and light. He keeps up his end of a chat, and thanks me each time. 
I’ve learned He’s pretty straightforward; He wants a family, and considers a large family an expression of wealth and success.  I(43F) am intrigued to say the least, but unsure if I want more children. I have a HS aged child I raised as a single mother. Plus, I am wary of dating a neighbor. 

My better angels consider how warm, orderly, meticulous and grounded he seems. I am attracted to those qualities. He’s good with his hands. He has completely transformed his house on his own, and keeps things very neat. While on a tour of his house last summer, I noticed he’s got a degree in theology, raising my antenna even more. He’s not overly spiritual by any stretch of the imagination. Just warm and approachable.

She told me for our next date she wanted to come over to try a dinner that reminded me of my mom. She came over. We ate (she loved it and asked for recipe). She made sangria. We watched a bunch of episodes of Girlfriend Experience (her choice). It was late so I asked her to stay the night sleeping in my bed and I’d take the couch. She agreed and thanked me for being a gentleman. The next morning after she left I found a note under my pillow. It said “Had a wonderful time and can’t wait to see you again.  xoxoxo”. I called to thank her for the note. On the call she said she no longer wanted to see me because she was not ready for something serious. We’ve not spoken since that call.

This is uncharted territory for me so please be patient with me. 

Been with my BF for about 6 months now and things are going great and at a good pace. He is bringing me to a friend's birthday party this weekend and I just learned yesterday that it had a theme. His friend did say we can choose to dress up or not, whatever we do will be fine. I already had a dress in mind but this threw me for a little loop. While I could whip up something halfway decent to fit the theme, I don't know if I would be comfortable in it -- I tend to get awkward and shy with people I just met, so slapping on a costume on top of that will dial my awkward levels way up.  ""Midsummer Night's Dream"" is the inspiration. My original dress  has a great flower print and is a deeper jade green. As for a possible costume, I do have another green dress that i wanted to use for a Renaissance Fair but did not end up going. Was going to go to a craft store and get flowers to decorate it as well as my hair.  

TL:DR - BF bringing me to meet his friends at a themed birthday party and I am torn between dressing up in costume or just going with a nice dress. I would like to make a good impression by adhering to the theme but I don't want to appear trying too hard. 

P.S. BF is not dressing up but tells me I wear whatever I want and it will be pretty either way. Yes, he knows the choices but gave me no preference lol.

It went well overall. His wit and sense of humor is awesome and he actually knows how to be a gentleman. As in, he knows the etiquette and manners that I thought every guy under 60 on the planet made a pact to erase from history. I didn’t feel that extra attraction but his personality was so awesome I decided I’d give it at least two more tries if he wants to see me again. 

He was apparently interested. He asked me out again for a date 2 weeks later having learned that work was crazy through the end of the month. Considerate and patient. The next date was even better. We were able to talk less superficially and he still made me laugh. The attraction still wasn’t quite there yet for me but I felt a little progress and started seeing the potential. He seemed attracted to me based on his compliments but was still very respectful and I felt comfortable he wouldn’t make a move unless I was ready. 

Then he asked me to go out again the very next day, which in retrospect seemed a little too fast but I wanted to, so I did. It wasn’t as perfect but it was still cool and I was having fun. As soon as we paid the check, I saw that my son (17) who was staying at his father’s had tried to call several times. Without going into detail, my son is going though a mental health crisis. Anyway, I told my date that I need to go home because I’m sure this isn’t one of those quick calls you take outside of a loud restaurant and try to brush off (I was right). He suggested I take the call from the car for privacy while he walks around, but it is such a high traffic area there’s no way to block out the noise and distractions. He seemed disappointed but very understanding and even followed up with a text saying it’s too bad the date was cut short but he loves that I’m such a terrific mom and totally understands. Yay, right? 

Well, that was last Saturday and since then the texts have become more brief and sporadic. In fact he hasn’t texted for two days. I sent the last two, which were light, friendly and I think inviting, so I’m not inclined to text a third time. Does this mean we sort of just fizzle out? I’m such a newby to the dating thing (was married for &gt; 20 years). So, shall I consider this trial done and move on?  I’m not one to date several people at once. I’m too busy,  it’s too exhausting and I generally like the idea of focusing on one opportunity at a time. Maybe it’ll get easier with time but it’s all just too new.

I know we can say 'well I look at the profile too', but are we looking at the profile before you 'Swipe Left' ?

It's not a criticism, truly. I'm really asking you.

I guess I'm thinking that as I've gotten older I realize that the most beautiful and amazing people I've known, cared about, and/or loved have outward physical beauty that doesn't matter. To be clear, I mean that their whole being is what's beautiful. Their appearance is of little importance in my desire to be around them.

I dunno. Maybe I'm in a different imaginary world. I want to be with with someone who cares about being together as much as being there for each other, someone who gets excited for the others happiness as much or more than their own, someone who is less worried about what can we do next and more about how great it is to have found real happiness, sometime who gets me as much as I get them. 

I know this probably seems weird coming from an older guy, but I've experienced enough and taken the time to learn from life that all the superficial crap just doesn't matter in the end.

I'm not saying I know how or where to meet this right person. Trust me, I'm clueless after the years out of dating. I just wonder , at this point, do I feel like wasting heartache or disappointment on Miss ""Swipe Right""? 

So, I ask again. Is an app really how I'm going  to find happiness? Maybe I'm not getting it. Any help/thoughts/direction would be appreciated.

I don't have a large family, but the family that I do have (mother, aunt, kids, and of course ex-husband) are not accepting of me dating. 

Even if I hypothetically mention dating again, I'm met with abuse, insults, threats.  My family puts my ex-husband on a pedestal, and they can't fathom me being with anyone other than him.  They have told me that they would never welcome or even speak to any new partner.  Older adults in my family encourage my kids to disrespect any man I speak to on a friendly basis.  

In reality, my ex is diagnosed with borderline personality and is emotionally, verbally and a bit physically abusive.  (My mother and my aunt are both abuse victims themselves, and I believe that's part of the reason they find my ex so wonderful.)

Regardless of what they think, I'm interested in dating again.  I'd prefer a serious, monogamous relationship.  I realize I'd never be able to introduce my new partner to my family.  And I know I'd go through a lot of abuse if they found out he existed. 
I'd be willing to be as open as he wanted with his friends and family. I also have a good sized group of friends with whom I'd be completely open about our relationship.

I don't have a lot of dating experience and I'd like to get better at what I see as basically a fear of telling someone how I feel.

When do you decide it's not working out? On a first, second, or third date, do you tell the other person how you felt about the date, face to face, at the end of it? Later, by text? Do you mutually decide whether or not to give it another go if it's only been one or two dates? Or, if you're not feeling it, do you unilaterally say Thanks but no thanks?

It all feels so daunting, I guess because I'm worried how the other person will feel - I guess the tables will turn when I'm on the other end, dang it! - but yeah, how do you work up the courage to *actually communicate how you feel about another person or about the date, if how you feel is very ambivalent?*

Maybe part of the frustration is, if you've only been on a couple dates, it's very hard to tell how the other person feels, too.

I’ve tried dating but I find myself comparing other women to her and they just don’t measure up.  I can’t seem to find the same emotional and intellectual connection that I shared with her.

How long does it take?  How can I make it go away?  I’m pretty sure she’s gone for good and I burnt the bridge to a crisp but it’s almost like I’m holding on to a thread of hope.

On here lots of folks ask and get advice on OLD …how to make a good profile, attractive photos, best messages and all that but clearly its a failing market. So, lets talk about advice from you on what someone can do to attract you in the wild.  Obviously, being where youre at is the biggest challenge (that OLD kinda solves) but lets just say they’re in the same space as you, what can a man/woman do get yours flirting attention. Examples: what they wear/are they put together, should they smell good?Where in your day to day should they be most keen to find you? Should they just walk up to you? Give us some “meeting you in the wild” pro tips.

I’ll go first (47m): If you run into me (say in an elevator) and you smile at me super friendly like when you see me (and we dont know each other). I’ll be polite and say “hey hows it going?” If you have anything I can ask about I will at that point. If you have a dog, I will ask about him/her and if you ask ANYTHING personal about me the guy-stranger at this point I will now notice you and be interested (assuming attraction). Next, let the conversation go on a little longer than it naturally should (a la when we get out of the elevator). If this happens, and youre single I will either ask you out or I will at least be thinking about you non stop for the next 2 months in hopes we run into each other again.
