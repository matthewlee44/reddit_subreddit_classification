We met at an ugly Christmas party in college when we were both 19, and we just continuously talk after that. We hung out for 2 months, he goes everywhere I go and I go wherever he goes. And one day he told me his best friend wanted to ask me out on a date and kinda has a crush on me. I rejected because I liked him, not his friend. 

Later on, I basically confessed my feelings for him in the car, and he told me  straight up I’m not his type. He said I’m too tall ( not an important reference: I’m 5ft8 ) and he’s into girls with a small chest and just basically shorter like a cute “shorty”. I kindly accepted it and told him that that’s fine and I wish him the best and I’m happy to continue be friends with him. And than that’s the first night we had sex, we were both drunk and tipsy. 

I did regret it, since I’m a person who does get emotionally attached,  I cried and I decided to move on. I had other guy friends who give me advices on how to deal with him, but I quickly picked myself up and focused on my studies. He did keep on reaching out to me and long story short we both dated different people and in between we still have sex with each other within “breaks”.

And now we are both 26 years old and I just broke up with my ex boyfriend and he’s currently living with his girlfriend of 3 years. And guess what, he still tried to reach out to me and wanting to know when he can see me ,and he missed me, also told me he sees his gf as a little sister now( I rolled my eyes immediately). He basically texted me everyday on what he’s doing ,he really wanted to just hangout with me.

Recently, I (19M) was wondering what might happen if I messaged my old high school crush (17F) just for the heck of it to see how things go. And to my surprise, it was pretty good! She messaged back and we had a good conversation that flowed really well :). Things seemed to be going great! I was wanting to ask her if she wanted to meet up in person but the opportunity never came around — she said she had to go and have a rest bc the other night she only had 3 hrs of sleep (fair enough).

Anyway, towards the end, she sent a message wishing me “good luck with uni and stuff”, which was nice, but IDK, almost seemed like a conversation closer — as if the exchange was just gonna come to a close and be a one-off thing :/. I wished her good luck with her studies and work too and we finished off positively, however, I was left wondering what to do next. The way it ended sort of almost made it seem she thought my contact was just a nice one-off thing, but I was hoping to maybe meet up and see how things go :/.

Speaking with my friends who are also (now more distant) friends with her, they said no to worry too much as she may have just been tired and can be pretty guarded around guys (at least from the last time seeing her). But now I feel if I message her again (like today or something) it might be sort of awkward and unexpected, and I don’t wanna seem pushy or anything, especially if it just seemed like a one off thing.

I wasnt no 3% man ot nothing but I knew when a girl liked me and when to do and say the right things when it was time to escalate. I guess you can say I get easily get the girl but I couldn't keep her. It was the beginning of freshman year and there was this girl who was clearly into me. She would annoy me, make fun of me, put her hands on me, etc. I ended up getting her snap and asking her out. We would walk home everyday after school and ended up hanging out for hours everyday. Someone I used to be friends with told me ""you got a good one man dont lose her"". Indeed. And she would prove this for months even after making one of the biggest mistakes ive ever made with a woman. I wanted to date other women but little did I know she was in love with me (I learn this later). So when I broke up with her over text like a jack ass I broke her heart. But even after coming back to her multiple times after it didn't work out with the other women, she would always take me back and treat me like any woman in love would. But oh boy did karma bite me in the ass. After I was done hoeing around and wanted to settle, we had a talk and decides to be exclusive. Time passes and she cheats on me. I proceeded to yell and cuss at her and make a complete fool of myself. Then my dumbass took her back. Eventually came summer break. Even after the cheating situation we would still hang out and she was still very intimate and affectionate and she would act feminine and sweet and treated me kindly. But during summer break I stayed with my mom and couldnt see her. It started driving me insane. I became obsessed with the thought of us hanging out again. We would talk all day everyday. We would fight a lot. Usually she would be on a cycle or in a bad mood about something and instead of letting her work her emotions out, I took it personal and acted like a dick. Fast forward one day we were on the phone and she let me have it. Basically told me everything I was doing wrong and all the mistakes I made. Then she blocked me. Hurt. All the way up until spring of last year, it was about a year since we talked. I've been working on myself and getting my shit together. She was stuck to me like glue. We started dating again for a few months till school started. At random i would say nasty things to her and treat her rudely by ignoring her or giving other women attention in her presence. The truth was I was insecure about her cheating on me cause of what happened in the past which led to the nasty behavior. One day she started an argument and compared me to her ex. That was the day before she would see him and her son. The next day I got a picture sent to me from her number. It was the woman I loved in bed with another man. Hair and make up messed up with horny eyes and drool around her lips. It was obvious what happened. I was shocked. I stared at the picture for a few seconds then chocked. My chest started to hurt and my eyes filled with tears. I was heart broken. We were obviously over. Ever since that day we talked a few times but ive been staying single and working on myself. I still havent had the chance to say sorry for not knowing these things while we were together. I couldn't be the man you deserved. Things wouldve been different otherwise. But now I wanna thank her for teaching me everything I know now.

I posted a little here before about this girl.

We've been friends for 7 years and we have both expressed romantic interest in each other multiple times over the 7 years. It is clear she doesn't want an official romantic relationship. She absolutely refuses counseling. I don't want to end a 7 year friendship, at the same time I don't want to be used. She is very self centered, which comes from years abuse. I could tell you everything about her. I don't think she could tell you much about me.

Another problem is that I'm not very social, have few friends, have low self esteem, have a different belief system than many people, and women just don't seem to be interested in me. I think she knows this and uses that to her advantage. She is quite socially intelligent, out going, and could get most any guy she wants.

I've tried cutting her off by ignoring texts. After this she expressed interest in me again and I decided to give it another shot. When I'm not around her I'm content being single. My depression is controlled by natural supplements. I don't want to go down the road of prescriptions. 

At the end of the day, this friendship is toxic. I don't think she intends for it to be this way. I worry about her as her family isn't the best and she has issues with decision making. I genuinely care about her and it is clear she has strong emotional attachment to me.

What would be a good way to cut off contact in a nice way? Moving is on the table in a year to 3.

All was going well she seemed very interested, texting me often, hearths, always accepting my get togethers and kissing all over multiple times (very affectionate).

But last date she slept over and she was brought up that i was weird that my friend mentioned me to her (as if we were dating). I just said, well they know we are seen each other buts its not like im going around telling people you are my girl if thats what bothers you... She said it wasn't but after became more distante (physicaly mainly). She slept over and we barely touched during the night. 

She left next morning and send me a msg ""had a great time thanks &lt;3"". I said me too, and follow up with a small joke but she didnt answer until lat that saturday at 1 am saying she was thinking of me aand had a greaat idea of something we could do next time together. So i thought obviously this was a good sign and told her ""a surprise?! great! What are you doing next Wednesday?"" She told me she would let me know the next day but never did i i never brought it up again and just made other plans instead. 

We talked twice this week over text- but she always answered me 16-24 hours later with brief answers (not super cold, but short). And she ende up telling me that she had no time for anything anymore because of work. So I decide to tell her ""Work is important, better that than the alternative ;)"" "" let me know when you schedual frees up then, have a lovely day!"".

To that she told me ""the weekend"", ""but weekdays are impossible for me now"" ""thank you , kisses"" (no smiley/ short messages/ but still telling me she is available during the weekend... 

So i'm confused here... I don't want to invite her to hang and to be left on read again for 24hours to have an answer... Perhaps i'm overthinking it. She does work and study A LOT. But com on a messgae takes a seond to reply, not 16-24h (twice in a row)...

I was a little hesitant at first since I've read there are a lot of fake profiles. To my surprise I don't find it that bad: Lots of people with interesting and personal profile descriptions are what I see the most.

But I haven't Liked anyone yet except for one profile that I accidentally Liked, and when I figured he'd done the same and therefore was considered a Crush, I immediately panicked and removed my Like again. I just couldn't do it.

I'm a 24 y/o female, and I've never dated anyone before in my entire life! Maybe that's why I find it so difficult to take the step of Liking someone on Happn.

What I find even more strange is that +99 people Liked my profile within the first two days. Lemme tell ya, I'm no Scarlett Johansson. So I kinda suspect it might all be fake anyways.

How do I break the barrier and just do anything, whether it be a simple ""hi"" or a simple Like. Any advice for Happn specifically?

Also, I once met a really cool dude in the library. We clicked really well despite coming from very different backgrounds, both geographically and culturally. We added each other on Snapchat and later that day he texted me. 
I got so shy or terrified or whatever feeling that was, that I totally ghosted him by deleting my entire Snapchat profile. I've been regretting it ever since, and I was looking for him for months afterwards, only knowing his first name.

Throughout high school, all my friends got into relationships and kind of had their personal development in terms of navigating dating. I know that some of my friends are glad that they have had those experiences as they got to learn from them. Meanwhile I haven’t liked anyone in a while or every guy I have liked hasn’t had any common interests with me. For context, I’ve never had any guy friends I talk to regularly beyond people in class. 

What kind of things can I do to meet someone? Some of my friends are telling me my expectations are simply too high. I’m looking for a person who I can grow with and explore our goals and passions with, is that unrealistic at my age?


So far, I’ve been introducing myself to people in class and made some friends through a class discord. I also regularly attend social/networking events held by clubs (recently I’ve gone to trivia, an alumni session). I’ve told my close friends that I am interested in dating. I haven’t met anyone I’m interested at any event and typically, it’s because I have to be attracted to them at least a teensy bit before I consider anything.

For the past two months, I was always feeling anxious about the uncertainty but never had the courage to speak up in fear of scaring him away. However, something changed in me today. I realized that I didn't want the anxiety to eat me alive anymore. I also didn't want it to manifest into resentment towards him. This will most likely seep into how I interact with him and make me sometimes cold and unresponsive. I like him as a person and would prefer to stay friends even if things didn't work out, so I wanted to do anything that would keep the situationship from souring. 

During our talk, I told him everything written above. He admitted that he still isn't looking for anything serious, and I thanked him for his honesty. In the end, he told me that he admires me as a person, and I told him likewise. We reminisced on the good memories we had together (going on a road trip, cuddling, discovering new restaurants) and agreed that neither of us have any regrets. Moving forward, there will be distance between us (as there should be), but we will still be on amicable terms. Who knows, maybe sometime in the future, when the timing is right, we will cross paths again. I'm not holding onto any hope though. As of now, I will focus on myself, my hobbies and my career. In the meantime, it's nice to still have him in my life as a friend because, if I'm being honest, this dude has some sick ass song recommendations.

I’m supposed to go tomorrow, but honestly at this point I don’t know. I haven’t replied because I just feel like straight up ignored no matter what I say. And honestly I am worried at some point in the date he’s just going to try and force going back to his.

We live in a more conservative country and both of us have expressed clearly from the first date we’re looking for something serious. I enjoy spending time with him, he makes plans after each date but what bothers me is the lack of communication and enthusiasm. This has been the same from the start. Between dates I’m the one who initiates texting, he doesn’t really ask me how I’ve been doing if I don’t do it first. If I don’t text him he doesn’t text me for a couple of days. However when we meet he’s very present and we have great talks. He asks about my future plans, when I want to get married, where I want to live. There hasn’t been kissing or sex and he hasn’t tried anything. Which is normal in the culture we live in. However there’s has been some “red flags”, for example in a couple of occasions he has taken 4-5 hours to answer my text, however he has had the time to view my if stories. 

Question is - I’m seeing him tomorrow and I have three options in my head: 1. to stick around and see if things change or evolve. 2. Just tell him I feel there’s a lack of interest from his side and take the exit. 3. Bring up that I feel there’s lack of interest from his side and ask how he feels about where things are going. Tell him that I feel things are stagnant and communication is not what I’d expect.

Nothing serious happened between us so far, but I'm still interested in her. She's down to earth, reserved, pretty much what I look for in a person. She and I are both college students, but she's also working part-time in a law firm, so basically I can only see her on weekends. 

I've tried to organize a third date twice, but she couldn't make it for either occasions. She gave some reasonable excuses though:

1. She had a effed-up weekend and didn't want to see anyone; 

2. She took her 2nd vaccine shot and had an adverse reaction.

I then made it clear she should tell me what's bothering her, or if she's not interested anymore, that's okay too and I'll walk away (this Mon). She responded the next day, and said she was sorry and was not her intention to flake. BUT she never bothered to reschedule either occasions and it's been a month since I last saw her.

Here's the issue: I really like her, and she is much better than the girls I've been seeing. However, she takes a very long time to text me and is hardly ever online and twice cancelled on me. Does this mean she is stressed and busy with work? Or is she just not interested anymore? In my last text, I made it clear if she's not, I'm okay with that and I'll move on, but she didn't say that.

She said she had to be home by 11, but eventually she wanted to stay longer and stayed extra for dessert to talk more.

At some point in our conversation I brought up ideas on where to go here in our city (she’s new-ish in town), and I finally used that opportunity to suggest a second date. She said yes to the idea, but then told me she needs to check her calendar first before finalizing a plan. I told her no problem.

Some important points I thought about when analyzing about last night’s date:

* she’s new in town and is really busy with a lot of things regarding work and school. She hardly has time to socialize.

* she seems stressed out by how much she works, as she kept bringing up how tiring it is and how little time she has (not sure if she’s telling me if she’s not interested, or if she’s just genuinely venting)

That said:

* eye contact was strong. Her eyes were locked on mines the whole time. Didn’t pick up her phone once.

* she asked me plenty of questions, real good ones, and our conversation was equal.

* she stayed longer than she should have.

* she texted me back 15 minutes after I texted her that night saying I had a fun night.

* after I suggested the second date, she asked questions later like how late are places open there, what’s my work schedule like, am I flexible and if I’m free during the daytimes. **Despite these questions, she didn’t really confirm a day with me for the second date during our first date, so is that something to worry about despite the questions she asked me above?

As a couple and as most do, we plan things that we would enjoy but have recently thought, it could be fun to go on a “bad dates” once in awhile, everything’s better when you’re with your best friend. So one Friday of every month we take turns.

He was up first: He took me to a neighborhood watering hole in Buschwick, Brooklyn. Right when we walked in, I immediately felt like we were the outsiders and that this maybe was a family owned bar. Everyone seemed to know each other, besides my boyfriend and I lol. Some of the men were wearing suits that looked like they were from the 60’s and some were wearing basketball shorts and sweatshirts, all while smoking cigars. The women were dressed casually and drinking $5 vodka crans. The ambiance was super relaxed/minimal and almost looked like someone’s backyard/living room with one Juke box (couches and fold up chairs/tables). One thing that caught my attention the most was that i saw everyone eating what looked like store bought cake… which I thought was an interesting menu item given the place/vibe. We went to the back outside area and then… 

**DIALOGUE**

Me to boyfriend: That cake looks really good! 

Random woman: oh honey! Let me grab you a slice!

Me: oh no no, that’s very sweet of you.

Random woman: No! I insist 

*COMES BACK WITH CAKE* 

Me: Thank you! Is it someone’s birthday today?!

Random woman: oh no honey, mama just passed, this is for her.

Some will say I'm stubborn and I'm uncompromising by not lowering my standards. But after looking at as many ""single"" people on the internet and certain social groups I'm apart of, I feel confident in knowing that it's not that I'm the problem but it's more of the fact that I'm a enigma amongst a sea of unoriginal people. 

Alot of women I meet all tend to have the same expectations, but when I try and find some kind of interests that justify me trying to meet those expectations I begin to realize that I'm the one suddenly jumping through hoops and having to perform the mental gymnastics while she feels entitled that she doesnt have to do anything but present herself and look good which makes me question if my inadequacies are really the reason I'm having the results I am getting and it isn't something to do with the fact that there is a high amount of people like this already in the dating pool.

I can go on and on about all the things that I like about myself and all the things I ""bring to the table"" but the very basis of that argument is transactional because it says ""you need to be this or that in order to get my attention"" but all the work you might do for that individual would still result in you being unsatisfied because the person you were trying to get did not have any qualities that you liked. 

I strongly believe in the fact that nobody should have to sacrifice being comfortable with who they are for people who do not have any kind of admirable qualities that you might like. If people cannot appreciate who you are I believe that it's necessary to search for a new group of people who will make you feel more appreciated for staying true to who you are and not falling for the pressure of the unoriginal majority to become someone who you were never interested in being in the first place.  

Some of you may remember this but in the old pokemon games there was a point in which you had to travel all over the map to find Suicune and you had to have already been at a certain threshold if you intended to catch it. Every pokemon you encountered wasn't what you were really looking for and when you did fund it there was only one and you really had to think about how you'd catch it. If this metaphor got through to you then you should understand what some of us like is extremely rare and not common by any means and to give up on finding that rare thing is to refuse to accept their existence and further allow yourself to be miserable amongst a bunch of people you're not attracted to.

Three weeks later, the same person sat in front of me and kept on looking at me in the same library, and there were many empty places too. Today, she was with a friend and I was watching a basketball game remembering the days before COVID then her friend asked me about my major, and then I asked them about theirs, the girl was always smiling while talking to me and also asked me questions the same way I asked her (a tit for tat), that girl is so beautiful to an extent that I felt in love with her, afterwards I started having a feeling I had never ever have before, in the class that followed, I kept thinking about her and having some what ifs, it is the first time I felt in love with a girl that way, she is charming and beautiful. I kept thinking about her the whole day. But the duo also hinted that she has plantonic guy friends (I also have plantonic girl friends) and that she was introverted before college amd became ambiverted (same personality as me). But I am really overthinking about her status, I also noticed in the chat (from far) that she is sort of confused about her dating life and she seems picky.

We've had a kiss after each date. On the third date we had a discussion about what we actually want from this and I said I want something serious (I have done the casual thing for the last two years, but am ready for something more now). She said she's sorta on the same page but gets very 'skittish' about serious relationships and wants to take it slow and to see what happens. 

I just can't tell if she's actually into me, as our conversations aren't overly flirtatious (I find it hard to be flirty with someone unless I'm already super comfortable with them). Like it's really good chat but it's also the same chat I'd have with a good friend. I'm quite attracted to her but I can't tell if she feels the same way. She's definitely the sort of person I could see myself with but I also don't want to waste my time on something that's so unclear after three dates. The obvious answer would be to date other people at the same time, but I literally don't have time for that and I also hated dating more than one person at a time in the past as it just felt sorta wrong for me. This is to the point where I don't even want to message other people on dating apps (not saying other people can't do it, but I personally don't like doing it).

Actions to take, The 3 keys :

1. Mindset
2. Approach
3. Feedback  
 

**1. Mindset : take action and make life improvements.**

* Don't blame things outside of your control (focused on the negative like you are not attractive, resentful, dateless, toxic, virgin)

If you are struggling with girls, Ask yourself :

* What’s my mindset ?
* Am I a victim or Am I in control ?
* What can I change ?
* I am the type of person who say online ‘’you just need to be handsome, tall and rich’’ Or do I try genuinely to learn and apply ?

Having the right mindset make the difference.

&amp;#x200B;

**2. Approach Habits :**

* Challenge yourself to approach guys &amp; girls and get out of your comfort zone.
* Adopt a good approach habits. You can’t be 24/7 in tinder, or by hoping that one of your social group has a cute girl who just happen to be single and crush on you. You need to make the decision that you will be willing to put yourself on imconfortable situation. For example going to a girl in a library and ask her “what do you think of this book?” Because she seem smart and interesting. You need to approach womens and people constantly.
* Just be friendly, learn the basics of social skills and how to be the person that people want to be around.

**Challenge for approach :**

* Going out constantly and talk to 1 different person each day for a year.
* approach 5 people per day for a month.
* Talk to different persons twice a week.

**Benefits of those challenges :**

* Improving your eye contact with people
* You will be more comfortable when you're around people
* Improve your social skills and your game
* Meeting new girls constantly until you find a girl that fit to you
* **It can dramatically change your life.**

&amp;#x200B;

3. Feedback system :

By going out constantly you can see how other guys are handling social situation and you can see quickly what you need to work on (meeting womens, learn how to use humor, how to use your eye contact and physicality to establish a mental frame)

**Ask yourself the following questions :**

* What type of girl was she ? (Was she a girl looking to have good time?)
* What did I do well in this interaction ? (This way i'll know what i should keep contuining to do in my future sets)
* What could I do better ? (Body language, read the vibe better, physically escalate in a smooth way.)

with these 3 question you will be able to indenifie whenever you keep the same mistakes over and over again.

**Some mistakes to avoid :**

* not establishing enough frame with her and just go along on what she said
* speaking to quickly or nervously

With a feedback system like this, you remove that equation of having to guess why you are not doing well with womens.

With that being said, go out of your comfort zone and go interact with people.

&amp;#x200B;

Guys stop with the online dating app and online long distance relationships. stop messing around on videos of two human beings having sex behind a screen.

&amp;#x200B;

These things can really ruin your life and ruin the way you interact with women. The human brain is not used to consuming all that virtual, all those naked women in those shitty sites. 

If you can't talk to women in real life or you're nervous it's because you're constantly looking at them naked every day and jerking off to them. That's not real life and women are not made for that, porn sites have put in your head that women = sex, when in reality they don't.

&amp;#x200B;

Go out and talk with real women, get your brain used to talking with women face to face to see what you should improve in yourself and in the way you talk to others. It will be hard at first, that's normal, it's an addiction. But every time you feel like doing it, don't do it and think about what you can become later if you stop doing it for good.

&amp;#x200B;

You guys aren't ugly, no one is ugly.If you're not tall it's okay, learn to dress well, take care of your hygiene (beard and haircut), remove all bad habits and replace it with good ones (if you stop ejaculating on sex sites you'll become more beautiful because your self-confidence will increase), go to the gym (this is the most important) and you will see how you will glow up. Improve 1% everyday and in 70 days you'ill be twice as better as you were 70 days ago. It's all about decision and taking actions. Go out and talking to people and got out of your comfort zone, because social media and internet it's a unlimited comfort zone with unlimited rewards that you don't deserve. Be a real man and deserve your ""ejaculation"" with a real woman that you love and that you made the effort to get.

The more I read some subs, the more I see some guys aren’t convo initiators and some totally miss the point. I made it clear with this guy I wanted to hang out with him again, and he said “for sure.” No follow-up. A week went by and nothing. 

A week after no text I asked him to return something to me by dropping it off at the front desk. There had been no convo for a week and the only convo was me asking for him to drop my stuff off, and he said he would (he hasn’t btw). He didn’t ask for more dates. How I was. Nothing. I figured that meant he just wasn’t interested in me. 

After talking with friends, they thought I may have jumped by gun and perhaps inadvertently told him I wasn’t interested by requesting my items back. 

My problem is, I can’t tell if he’s actually interested or what. Did I jump the gun and end things prematurely after a week of no texting and him now following up with availability to hang out? He has a high stress job, works 80+ hours/week and studies.

I saw a picture on twitter of a hot girl, kind of weird girl who likes anime, very hot and with tons of things going with LOTS of common interests. I realized that she was the best friend of my best friend's boyfriend and I told him about her.

I followed her on IG and she was immediately hooked with me. She would chat non stop and it was obvious she was into me from the first message I sent her. Even tough I never chatted with a woman before considering her as a potential sexual partner, I immediately realized that she was into me and I immediately asked her out. This was sunday and she immediately told me let's see each other saturday (the next weekend) and that she lived alone and we could go to her house after some drinks.

Conversation was great, I took it easy, She was hooked. She replied back in seconds, she sent strings of messages, voice messages, pics, even double texted me. I was a bit reluctant to talk this way as Ididnt want to burn conversation topics which were better in person and didnt want her to build HIGH expectations for me (which she did).

Saturday arrives and we go to a bar have drinks. I am doing great while drinking, asking her questions, not talking much and really hitting it off. A few hours go by and she tells me that we should go back to her place. I agreed, but I immediately lost my frame. I started behaving more nervous, I felt insecure to perform any sexual act as I was COMPLETELY new to it. I never even kissed a woman before. I felt I was attracted to her. We went to her place like 2 am, and we kept talking and talking to the point it was damn obvious I should kiss her. I feel stuck, I feel completely blocked to go for the kiss. I realized how much I was repressing in my attraction to women due to subconscious fears.

After it being wholly obvious, I told her about what was happening to me. I opened up to her and told her I have never ever been with a woman before. She took it well enough, but I knew for a fact that I screw it up a bit for this. I presented myself as insecure and her as my ""teacher"".

Finally, I went for the kiss and things become quite passionate. I loved kissing with a woman, I loved her body. I realize I am not gay at all and suddenly I start liking her. I start wanting to be with her, I really liked her. But I knew it was more or less over after that.

In this moment, she was VERY horny. She pressured me to stay the night, but I said no. And I didnt even get undressed, she yes. Fully naked. I left her there laying in bed naked and horny and me leaving her house at 7 am as I felt it was too much for me for one night and needed more time.

Next mornign and over the week I notice her excitement for me was less. She would still chat with me, she would sent me voice notes, and be interested but not as much as before. I knew she was very likely giving me one more chance tough.

So I asked her out and she agreed to see each other again this saturday. I went directly to her house. I brought sushi and wine. We watched a movie. I was much more confident but my performance over the week in texting (being far more needy than before) and me opening up with my sexual issues really put me in a vulnerable spot. I thought we had a good time in her house this saturday, conversation I thought was great. I advanced in my sexual insecurities, I fingered her and did oral sex. She told me she liked it. But I was nervous, I couldnt get hard and we didnt fuck. She told me she cummed from fingering as she was telling me how to do it. I spent the night at her place and in the morning I once again opened up about my weaknesses, what I think are my bad personality traits, etc. I thought that being vulnerable she would like that, to have a deep conversation. We talked for a bit and I left like 10 am. She told me to let her know once I got home.

I arrived home and sent her that I was home and she completely ignored the message, never replied back to it.

I ask my best friend if he knew anything about what happened and he told me that she had told his boyfriend that she didnt know if she wanted to see me again. That she thought I was too needy and insecure. That sex was not the issue. And that she felt she was my psychologist.

I didnt think that was the case as to me opening up wasnt for her to solve my problems but me trying to talk something deep so she could get to know me better.

Today I sent her a message telling her that I would be around her neighborhood, and that we should grab dinner together. And she replied back very coldly with a ""heyy, I can't today. I am busy"".

So now, I know my chances with her are almost non existent. I will just pull back completely and stop messaging her, she might message me again if I do this but I dont keep my hopes up. I will maybe hit her up in a few months if she doesnt. I fucked it up hard, I hate myself. I became too needy with her It was like my first love all over again. I feel so bad, I want to cry for being so stupid. If only I could have presented myself in a better way, take my time to open up, be more confident, this never would have happened.

Right now, she isnt even watching my instagram stories. I think this is weird as everything was alright between us two. I am enduring the possibility that she actually became insecure that I didn't get hard or she didn't like the fact that I was with men before. I don't see another possibility as to why she would mute me completely from IG but still follow me, by what she said it seemed that she couldnt care less about me but she muting my IG might mean she thinks she can be affected my what I post there? So weird

I am open to advice as to the whole story. As to if there are chances of me seeing her again, about having sex with women in general, about text messaging. About everything. I would highly appreciate it.

I used to approach dates as If I am willing to go further and if they allow me to get it there, GREAT. If not, my main priority is to have a good time, meet people, make a friend then go home. Sadly, too much is assumed about me and the date is dull because the person is too busy looking for my angle.

Also, It’s too many people trying to just boost their own egos, get attention to make bf mad, trying to find side girls or gals and its like HEY do what you want but you could just say so. Because all you are doing is setting others up and someone a bitter cycle is created where they go off and waste others’ time.

I had a situation where a girl from a dating app let me go ahead and pay for a date she was supposedly cool with only to ghost last minute, I was prepared and had my friend as a plan b so no money was wasted. 

My point is not to say, all of this will go away or should. My point is that the more of us that stop fearing what we want and just put it out there, the easier our lives and others become.
