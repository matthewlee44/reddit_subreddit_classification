0,q7gc2q,1634146664,Dating someone new,"Hey all, so I'm dating someone new after being single for about a year and a half. The last guy I dated was absolutely a wolf in sheep's clothing. He ended up being  super manipulative. I only started dating my last boyfriend because he was nice to me, which I needed because my boyfriend before him was extremely emotionally abusive and controlling. Anyway, I say all of this because I obviously have some relationship trauma and as a result am very hesitant to trust someone and open up to them. My question is, how much of my past traumas should I tell the new person I am dating? Should I be upfront and tell them that I was hurt in the past, so have some hang ups about certain behaviors/situations? Or should I just not mention any of that stuff until it becomes an issue with this new guy (which, hopefully it won't). I am worried that if I tell him what has happened to me he will think I am damaged and helpless and possibly try to use my traumas against me. To be clear, I really really like this new guy and he hasn't done anything to make me think he would use my traumas against me, this is more of a general fear.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q7gc2q/dating_someone_new/

3,q7giwp,1634147193,I [36/M] walked away from a dating situation with a [32/F] because her mental health issues were a detriment to the situation. Was I Right?,"It's been years since I dated because of a previously toxic relationship. I decided to finally try it again recently.

I started dating this girl who runs a karaoke show at the local bar I go to. We were talking since August. I'm a regular there. I started vibing with her, and we started talking and we started dating. As I got to know her, she is a really sweet girl, but she told me about her previous history and how she has mental health issues. I didn't want to disqualify her for that, so I carried on and wanted to empathize with her situation. However, her mental health starting making the dating situation rough. She went through cycles of being skeptical about my motives or why I was treating her so nice and even said ""maybe we shouldn't be dating"". I just told her that we are still getting to know each other and that I'm being empathetic to her mental health.

It has been a rollercoaster of emotions. I thought maybe I could deal with her mental health issues (the mood swings, her being skeptical of me, etc, etc), but I started realizing it was bothering me more and more. When things got toxic in my last relationship, I had a bad habit of balling my feelings up and trudging along. We started moving too fast, and when we realized that, we hit the brakes, but she never did. She had gotten too drunk one night, and I let her know what happened the next day, and she was embarrassed and made me feel bad for telling her. Last Thursday, I jokingly said something about how I wanted to smack the person making me a sandwich at some late night food spot we went to (the employee was rude as hell to me), and she lashed out at me because what I said was triggering to her (she had a physically abusive relationship in the past). She didn't want to talk to me anymore. Last Friday, one of her high school friends passed away, and the way she mentioned it to me was like if he was a passing acquaintance. Since she said she didn't want to see me anymore, I went about my day, went out to hang out with my friends. She randomly hits me up at 1am the next day asking if we could link up. I told her I wasn't around. She then lashed out at me saying ""I figured I could see you because I just wanted comfort after being at this funeral.""

The next day, I went to an event at the bar. She was there. I was cordial with her. She was playing music. I was there hanging out and had some drinks. A random girl comes to ask me to dance. Things got pretty close since it was a dance that was borderline sensual. Of course, the girl I was talking to then rips me for afterwards and told me there is no chance we are fixing this. The next day, she is groveling at my feet (via text) saying how much she misses us and how I am only human and can make mistakes and wanted to talk about it, but the mental Olympics I allowed myself to be a part of stressed me out. What kills me even more is that the dancing with that other girl incident was what I used as my ""out"". I told her I felt bad about that, and that it showed that I wasn't ready to date, but in reality, it was this incident and all the mental health hoops that she put me through that truly led me to end it. I felt like me telling her that her mental health affected me would hurt her immensely.

 I think she's a really nice girl, but I don't think I'm ready to date, nor is she. I was very brief with her after that...trying to get her to understand that I didnt want to pursue this relationship any further. She said she would stop messaging.

This Thursday is karaoke once again, and I'm always there. She will be there too of course since she is the host. I want to go so that I can prove to myself I'm capable of being cordial and not awkward, but at the same time, maybe I shouldn't for a bit because this is a ""too soon"" type of deal. I can see myself being at least a friend to her in the future, but nothing more. 

tl;dr: I walked away from a dating situation after 2 months because her mental health was beginning to become a detriment to the dating situation. Was I in the right?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q7giwp/i_36m_walked_away_from_a_dating_situation_with_a/

He called me on the phone a few weeks later to check that I didn’t need anything lol (I guess it would be too late anyways) honestly a nice dude but the sex was awful.

So it is the typical. I (M20), a CS student, never had a girlfriend. Because of this I can't talk to girls very well. I usually run out of topics. However I'm not an introvert, I have friends and can talk to everyone but I'm not too comfortable when I'm with a girl alone. By never having a relationship makes me more depressed lately.

Now I have a group of friends girls included. I am really happy when I'm partying with them. But there's one girl I am extra happy to see. Now if she does not come or I can't see her for a longer period of time it makes me even more sad.

And now the best part. I finally managed to be with her alone. I've managed to talk to her for about an hour. I've never talked this long to a girl before alone. However she did not fail to  mention inviting her boyfriend to meet our group. Yeah classic. But this was as close as it gets to being rejected for the first time.

Now at least I know not to waste time trying to get her. However I am still sad when I'm not with her and I have to constantly think about her.

TLDR: How can I move on and accept that I won't find a relationship anytime soon and stop being depressed about it

There were also a few issues involving a psycho ex that tried to murder us on the hwy for 2 hours straight. And after that I told him I didn’t want him to talk to her. And I had to find out for myself that he was still talking to her and he would deny it when I asked him if he was still talking to her then I would pull out the proof. He said this was manipulative and I told him I was legitimately trying to test his honesty. I feel like he never told me the truth.(how I feel because of his actions) he asked me to stay when I was leaving and I really wanted to but I couldn’t play the guessing game anymore. I was tired of always being on edge. I thought that once I finally found everything out he would be completely transparent with me but I was wrong. I wanted him to be the one so bad that I ignored every red flag thrown at me I’m still contemplating going back because i feel like im gonna die of sadness or at my own hands.

I don’t think he’ll miss me I think he’s glad I left so he can pursue other girls especially his old life style he mentioned he missed so much picking out of a mystery box (tinder,bumble, plenty of fish,etc.)
But my heart feels like it’s shattering finally I’m still in shock from when I found out. 
I’m sorry if theses are just a jumble of words I still can’t think straight I just want to be in his embrace and hear him say everything’s gonna be alright

Well anyways I’m going again in a few days and he’s already suggested I spend the night. So my dilemma is, that we’ve only been dating a month, and I like the direction we’re heading, but it seems too relationship-y already to plan a sleepover and a two-day-date and pack an outfit and toothbrush. It doesn’t seem as romantic to know I’m staying the night. Maybe I’m a little concerned we’ve moved too fast, or that we skipped over something? I feel so comfortable with him that even though we’ve only gone out a couple of times, I felt fine sleeping over. (I’m definitely not a hook-up person). Also, I do want to spend the night because it IS more convenient for me since we live about an hour away from each other… so I don’t know, it just feels weird to go to his house for a date with my overnight bag just a month into this ‘relationship,’ even though I actually do want to spend the night again",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q7k1r0/planning_a_sleepover/

I know I shouldn't, but I blame myself for the lack of chemistry, even though I've had chemistry with other dates in the past.

See, there’s one girl(girl 1) who is very pretty and nice although I don’t know if I’m in love with her personality. The other girl (girl 2)is also very attractive and nice as well, and she also makes me laugh and she is even friends with my own friends.

Thing is, girl 1 is actually attracted to me. She clearly shows that she has some form of feelings for me. I talk to her every so often and I enjoy it, I’m still very awkward.

Girl 2 seems to think of me more as a friend as far as I can tell. I love talking to her but I can tell that I am extremely awkward because of the feelings I hold for her, and I feel like it makes me less appealing.

Everybody knows that girl 1 likes me and is pushing me to go for it, but I’m afraid of if I’ll be dating her and still have feelings for girl 2.

I am a fairly attractive tall guy but nothing too crazy, I’ve never dated a girl in my life as I’ve never taken an opportunity and not many girls think I’m all that as far as I’m aware. I want to go for girl 2 in the deepest part of my heart but I think she doesent like me and I don’t want to ruin our friendship, I feel cornered because If I do decide to ask girl 2 to go out with me then girl 1 will lose interest and feel betrayed. I think I may have led girl 1 on too much and I don’t want to hurt her. 

Also I feel girl 2 doesent know  my true personality because I have been very depressed lately because my dog of 13 years recently died, I haven’t been myself and have been pretty quiet because I haven’t told anyone and don’t know if I should, I don’t want to ruin the mood.

49,q7l4al,1634160544,Why can't I end this dead end relationship?,"I've been dating a guy I met off of Bumble for the past 2 months, which I know isn't a very long time. I am very attracted to him and our first few dates were great. He's currently in the process of switching to a new job and moving to a new apartment so he has a lot of free time during this transition, in which we've been hanging out a lot. However, over time, I've noticed his behavior towards me becoming more and more cold, even though he still regularly wants to hang out. He'd do things like ask me to come over, buy me dinner, then be on his computer the whole time or repairing and packing stuff in his apartment. When I try to talk to him, he either completely ignores me (I can tell he heard me because he looks my direction) or gives me short answers or seems disinterested. 

I'm also aware he was dating other women or at least looking, as have I because we haven't established what we are and I can tell that perhaps he's keeping me on standby while he looks for someone he likes more. I know that me knowing this, I should just run, but I can't help it. He lives so close to me and we enjoy the same music and food and get bored at nights and like to get together to have a few drinks and watch a movie. I feel like we're heading more towards a friend like relationship but we still have sex occasionally. I'm not really sure what to make of this whole situation. I also realized despite how hot he is, the reason he isn't constantly dating or dating the same person is because he has a bad personality. He has anger issues and if he doesn't care about something, he's not engaged at all, even just to be polite. He doesn't seem to have any friends and he has a toxic relationship with his identical twin brother, who also seems to have anger issues (he broke a bunch of stuff in his apartment). Last week, his brother's ex who still seems to have a key to his apartment, broke in while he was at work and stole a ton of expensive camera equipment. I was the only person who helped him and stayed at his place apartment sitting while he got locks changed and allowed him to store stuff at my own place and stay over for a week. I bet I'm the only person who will help him move as well. 

I know deep down inside this relationship won't work because I don't like the way he treats me, there's no affection and the way he obsesses over stuff and ignores me, but I also wish that he would see that I've been there for him when no one else has and maybe he should be nicer to me to keep me around.  I've been thinking of telling him I need more out of whatever this relationship is otherwise there isn't really much in it for me. I don't really want to end a potential friendship but in the end, I know if he starts dating someone he really likes, he will ditch me... but the odds of him finding a woman that would tolerate his crap seems low. I know I'm just being a pickme and the sooner I end this the sooner I can find a guy who might actually appreciate me but...

I am worried I may have been roofied in December of 2020. 

I was coming back from a 3 hour road trip to spend time with this guy I’ve been seeing. I wanted to go home and shower first-a normal request. 

However, he was super adamant about me getting to the apartment at a certain time. I thought it was odd, but shook off those thoughts. 

I really wanted High Noon Vodka Soda when I got there-it’s my favorite, however he claimed they were too expensive and he wanted to make his own instead. 

When I got there, he handed me a mason jar of vodka soda, and before I’d even consumed half, I was the most intoxicated I’d ever been in my entire life. 

I don’t remember having sex with him that night, just waking up in his bed the next morning. I don’t remember anything after I drank half the glass of vodka soda. 

So I’m beginning to wonder if his insistence of me getting there at a certain time meant he put something in my drink. 

I am not a lightweight by any means. I can handle my alcohol. 

So with that being said, if you roofie someone’s drink, can the effects of it only last for a certain amount of time?

I thought that being in a real relationship would mean men would be more invested in my pleasure and me not being uncomfortable or in pain during sex. And maybe it would.

60,q7lrwp,1634162589,Venting: I think I'm broken.,"This is a long story, so I'm sorry in advance.

I (28F) had a summer fling with a man (27M) and it made me realize how I want to feel when I'm with a romantic partner.

We started talking in May, and by July he had let me know that he didn't see himself dating me further. He tried to friend zone me but I had a deep feeling in my gut that even if I did allow him to remain my friend, he'd never speak to me again anyway, so I politely thanked him for being so kind to me while we were talking and declined the offer. He told me that I helped him during a difficult time in his life, and we left it at that. I unfollowed him on instagram and chose the option that made his account unfollow mine as well. I unfriended him on snapchat, and I deleted our imessage thread (I'm a very sentimental person and I like reading old message threads to feel nostalgic and happy. Deleting this thread was a big deal for me.) 

Over this two month period we spoke to each other every day. From waking up, all the way 'til going to sleep, we had a consistent back and forth. We went on a couple of great dates that he raved about, and we slept together once. I've had three relationships in my adult life-- a girlfriend of 1 year, girlfriend of 2 years, and then a boyfriend of 1 year. Compared to these three people of my past, he immediately was treating me better and speaking to me with more respect than any of them. It was refreshing. I also had never been the type of girl that was given pet names, never been the type of girl that was lucky enough to feel taken care of or petite/small (in a good/protected way, if that makes sense?), but he came into my life and did these things for me. Called me baby and other silly pet names, sent me sentimental messages at random or let me know what he was thinking about me, and was very vocal and kind in the way he expressed what he liked about me. I felt protected and desired. I was finally talking to somebody that wanted to give me the kind of care I'd given my exes and never received.

I'd never felt that good before. I've always been the more caretaking partner of the pair when I was with my girlfriends-- and my ex boyfriend was abusive (physically, mentally, and sexually), so I never got the chance to *really* feel like a girlfriend considering the fact that he put a lot of effort into making me feel ugly and undesirable. Talking to this man was patching up my self esteem from this bad track record. I felt beautiful for the first time in years. Like.. I, for the firs time, viewed myself as beautiful. It was so different compared to a friend or a date giving you a compliment and you awkwardly accepting it. But I guess that doesn't make sense.

It wasn't until he rejected me that I realized I felt more for this person than any of my past partners. It was a punch in the chest. I have a long track record of driving people away when I open up, so I didn't share any of the above information with him. I didn't want him to see me as this sloppy girl with a tragic backstory that suddenly is falling for him after two months of knowing him. I guess there's a part of me that wishes I'd gotten a little emotional/messy on him and expressed myself. But I'm pretty convinced that wouldn't have changed anything.

If you've read this far I appreciate you, because this is where my dilemma is:

It's now October. I spend time with my best friend, I get outdoors and hike with my dog, I go do my nerdy dnd stuff with my party on the weekends, I'm killing it at a new job, and I actively go on dates with new guys from Tinder and Hinge in hopes I'll connect with somebody. But I still think about him every day and it's not getting easier. I never check his social media and I've never had the urge to text or contact him whatsoever, but I still think about him periodically throughout the day. It's miserable. I'm miserable. I feel myself sinking into a pit.

I'm not connecting with any of my dates-- even have tried multiple dates with the same person, but I don't feel the spark, or the butterflies, or the desire. They're nice, but they don't make me feel beautiful or confident like he did. I just want to feel wholesome and good again. I want to be somebody's girlfriend so badly, but I don't want to commit unless I can feel the way he made me feel. it doesn't even need to be him. If there was anyone that could make me feel similarly, I'd welcome it with open arms, which is why I'm still out there dating. But I genuinely feel like I'm just wasting everyone's time. It's kinda hopeless.

I'm sorry if you read all this. I just needed a good vent. I've never spoken about this in this much detail because quite frankly, I feel like a fucking idiot for being this torn up over somebody I barely got to know.

But I dunno.. I waited 28 years to feel that way about someone, and I had it for 0.2 seconds before it was gone again.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q7lrwp/venting_i_think_im_broken/

Maybe there’s something wrong with me. I’ve noticed that this is the third time in my life already where I’ve developed feelings for a friend after months of just viewing her in a platonic way. The prior two times I held my tongue and allowed the friendships to weaken because I was too scared of outright rejection. I feel even worse right now.

I (mid-late 20sF) moved back in with my parents at the start of lockdown last year. It made sense for a lot of reasons - finances, they have a garden, it stopped them worrying about me, etc. But it's a small town, I don't really know anyone here - and even if I did, I couldn't go out and meet them because my mum is clinically extremely vulnerable and unvaccinated (note: on doctor's advice!) and case rates are high here. I basically haven't left the house since March 2020. I haven't seen any of my friends since March 2020, and I can count on two hands the number of people outside my family that I've spoken to in person (people like ""the nurses at the vaccination centre"" and ""the cashier at the local takeaway"")

It's especially frustrating because I felt like my life was finally on track - I'd spent years clawing my mental health back together after some bad experiences, got a job, got an apartment, made friends, was looking to date, then boom, covid. It wasn't so bad at first, even up until this summer I was coping, but case rates don't seem to be going anywhere and the rental market here has just gone crazy. If I move out now, I'd be able to meet friends without worrying about bringing a killer infection back to my mum, but I'd be paying something like 60% of my income on rent before utilities and food, and prices for those have gone crazy too. So even though I'm in the best physical shape/have the best body confidence of my life (I lost 13kg over lockdown - feels good!) it doesn't matter because I can't meet anyone. It feels like I'm wasting my mid 20s stuck in my room, while all the people I know seem to be getting married. They're not - it's a FB echo chamber thing - but it feels like it. 

tl;dr Avoided dating for years to deal with my issues. Finally had a glow-up but now I'm stuck at home where I know no-one and can't go out safely, and probably will be until spring. Getting on a dating app seems unfair/pointless currently when I can't meet the people I'd match with. I've been trying to keep in touch with friends/make new friends online, but it's not the same. Feel like I'm getting older and more run down with nothing to show for it. Anyone here in the same boat or got any advice for coping with it and preferably doing something productive with the next 6 months instead of wallowing in my overwhelming loneliness and touch starvation?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q7m86j/people_who_cant_date_at_the_moment_how_do_you/

70,q7mhjd,1634164819,How do I handle this dog situation?,"I was very low key dating someone. Great connection. So understanding of current mental health issues I am going through, but also because he is going through similar. We hang out often despite having very busy lives and we both have a very strong interest and love for dogs. He has two and I have 1. When I first started talking to him, he actually had just picked up the second puppy from Montana. This is a weird part; the dog was bought for him by a girl that he used to know in high school but she is married. I do believe he lead her on and at some point she was very upset about it. Then he limited communication with her and still has the dog.
Red flag right there. Hello.
Flash forward to my idiot ass. One common interest we had is the breed of dogs we absolutely love. I randomly meet a lady who knows a breeder about an hour away. I start to correspond with her but at the time they had a huge waiting list and didn’t expect to have available puppies soon but said I can come see their facility. While there seeing the place I developed a friendship with the older lady that runs the breeding facility. Due to my line of work she actually hired me to do something for her. In the months that I was going up there to do work they had 4 litters (2 being accidental). They knew I was obsessed with this breed and encouraged me to pick out a puppy I liked. I picked one out over pictures and then later saw a different one and contacted them immediately and said please hold this one for me instead.
Every trip I would make up there to work or just spend time with the breeder, I held and played with my puppy.
Because of some issues at home I couldn’t bring the dog to my house right away and wanted to make sure he was potty trained and just well behaved before I brought him home full time. This is where my friend comes into play. 
Over the course of about 3 months and knowing I’d be bringing this puppy home and initially it would go to his house. I was very nervous and somewhat paranoid and I would always ask/clarify that we would be sharing the dog and he would not ever keep it from me. He promised profusely. Even though I had picked out the puppy via picture the breeder encouraged me to come see all the pups because some were very unique. I invited my friend to this and as usual with anything I plan for us to do he either slept or didn’t feel good. So I gave him an opportunity to pick out this puppy with me and he didn’t. Finally the day came to bring him home and he went with me. The puppy is beautiful, smart, well behaved (for a puppy), sweet as can be. My youngest daughter is obsessed with him and my other dog absolutely has the best time playing with him.
I keep him sometimes for up to a week and then he goes back to my friend and the other two dogs for a few days up to a week. In the time he is at his house I still see him. I stop by to let him out to potty or sometimes I hang out at my friends house.
My friend and I got into a disagreement. During this argument I said just give me my dog and then you can block me or whatever.
That’s lead to him blocking me in all forms. Threatening to pay me for him so I can just get another. I paid the breeder for him at a huge discount but still costly, done all the vet visits, recently signed him up for school starting Monday. I have puppy insurance on him, the chip is in my name with my friend as backup. Can he keep my dog based on the fact that he says my dog has spent more time at his house?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q7mhjd/how_do_i_handle_this_dog_situation/

He checks a lot of my boxes. Deep thinker, same love languages, shares my views on kids (doesn’t want them), loves to travel, likes to spend a lot of time with his partner, is relationship-oriented and actually wants a relationship. Values commitment and takes relationships very seriously. 

But he is starting to come on too strong. We’ve FaceTimed a few times and usually it’s 2-3 hours. Great conversation. And he always tells me I’m beautiful, tells me I’m a great person, asks me how I’m single, etc.

But he’s also, albeit jokingly, said stuff like “Wow look at my WIFE!” And “I’m already envisioning our wedding.” He sends me the kissy emoji with the heart. Calls me babe. It all seems a little fast. 

Again, he says it jokingly and he has a very goofy, playful personality. But he also has mentioned he falls hard and fast.

From my first boyfriend, I have a habit of falling intensely in love with similar people. We get close quickly, and it usually progresses to them wanting more.

What is this obsession with seeing women as evil, manipulative, and up to no good? Or is it just me? I get so tired of having to “prove myself” or fight against actual manipulation that I can’t be bothered. 

If that were me, and my family/friends were lying about someone, it wouldn’t be them against the people in my life. I would be responsible for dealing with it. It just ruins the trust in the relationship when someone won’t stand up for you, especially when they’re the one telling you what others are saying and actually asking if it’s true. 

“My girl best friend said you’re probably using me for money” for example. All I can think is, if someone said that to me, I’d tell them where to go and how to get there. I wouldn’t burn the trust in my relationship on that cross.

Dating has been as hit and miss as I sure we can all relate to. I have met some good people and spent some good times with them. I have met some shit people and had terrible times, but am still looking to hopefully find that life partner.

The thing that I struggle with after having my now ex-wife cheat her way out of the marriage is trying to balance giving trust and being open without overlooking behaviors that could signal problems. This problem, I think, is compounded by the OLD environment, where at any given time when you meet a person they are probably at least talking to or likely involved with other people. My question is, and hope I can get some constructive feedback (from both male and female perspectives), how during the first month or so you are with a person, probably having sex and building a relationship are you able to cope with the fact that they might be doing the same with others. Obviously without trying to be possessive or clingy, but sometimes it just fries my circuits thinking about it and either waiting to be cut out or see an errant text or for everything to go fine and just move forward.

93,q7ogwe,1634171513,"Dated for 3 months, still not having a crush. Am I sailing on a sinking ship?","I (26M) have met my SO (27F) on an OLD app few months ago. This is my first relationship, and I had vague idea of what I want entering into one.

From the first few dates, I have enjoyed my time with her. She is funny, sweet (with a hint of spice), responsible, and willing to share initiatives, and more. I have been attracted by her personality that I was happy to continue dating her despite other downside. I haven't had any crush on her, but I wanted to get to know her more. After all, all crushes I had in the past came after getting to know them a bit.

Fast forward few months, the relationship is going going well - kinda. We enjoy our dates, and are fairly comfortable in front of each other. Very little conflicts, and we are both mature enough to communicate. However, I still don't have the same degree of emotion to her as my previous crushes. No butterfly, no heartbeat, etc.

I have told myself that such emotion will build up with the relationship, but I see little to no improvement so far. I'm phlegmatically thankful to date a good person, but my heart is yet to be kindled emotionally. I am increasingly questioning myself whether if I will ever have a crush on her. While I don't believe relationship is all about having that butterfly, I also don't think the relationship can sustain without having any at all. My desire to explore things with her is slowly dwindling away, even though she is a great person.

I can continue the relationship, hoping that the emotion WILL build up further down. However, with my previous crushes, I have already known my feelings before I got to know them as much as my SO. It's possible that this might be a sinking relationship, but I've never experienced one to take as a reference.

I'm not afraid to become single again if the relationship will not work out, and we haven't been together for THAT long. However, she seem to have some scars from her past breakups, and last thing I want is to break her heart explaining my current feelings (which will likely spell an end for the relationship).

94,q7oj20,1634171733,Dating before sex?,27M looking to ask a girl I’ve been talking to for 1.5 months to be my gf. Haven’t had sex yet but have done just about everything else.

95,q7okch,1634171867,Is it time for me to ask the girl I’ve been talking to be my gf?,"Okay so we met the first week of August. Mid August we hooked up for the first time and we have been consistently hooking up ever since. We have had numerous dates and I have stayed over her house, I don’t know how many times. We talk everyday and almost hangout everyday if our work schedules allow it.

The thing that has me worried is that a couple weeks ago she said she wants to take things slow. I don’t know if I should just ask her to be my gf or cut my losses? Am I rushing things after almost two months of seeing each other? Any and all advice is appreciated.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q7okch/is_it_time_for_me_to_ask_the_girl_ive_been/
96,q7op7y,1634172371,Does a person's bodycount affect your perspective of them when it comes to settling down &amp; marrying them?,"I'm curious as to not a specific one by one body count, but in general: 10-30, 30-50, 100+ affect someone's judgement and decision when it comes to seriously settling down. Even if they're a great match in all aspects, would (and if so, what) number be a dealbreaker? Is the perspective different amongst male/female/other identities?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q7op7y/does_a_persons_bodycount_affect_your_perspective/
97,q7oq1s,1634172453,What’s your opinion? Should a guy always pick up a girl or can the girl drive to his house sometimes?,"Me (23) and my boyfriend (22) have been together for 2 years now. We currently still live with our parents and are still in college. He lives about 45 minutes from my house. I typically drive to his house because that’s where we hang out most of the time. We typically get something to eat in his neighborhood and just hang at his place. But I live with very old fashioned parents and they do not agree on this. They are constantly nagging me that I’m “chasing” him and that guys need to pick girls up and complain about me wasting gas. I drive there because I feel its fair to him and would be stupid to make him drive from his house, to mine, back to his house, back to mine, and then back to his again. I also don’t like to wait at my house for him and would rather just drive there. But they never leave me alone about it. They keep saying he’ll get bored of me because by me driving there, I’m not letting him “chase” me and I’m looking desperate. He comes and picks me up sometimes on the weekend when I get off work. I know I’m an adult and can do what I want but I can’t stand the constant nagging.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q7oq1s/whats_your_opinion_should_a_guy_always_pick_up_a/
98,q7ordb,1634172580,"Guys, would you rather keep high standards and end up alone or lower your standards and maybe end up with the wrong person just to not be alone?",That is the ultimate question in dating. Will someone be happy if the right person for them never shows up? Will they drink anything including poison only because they are thirsty? That is something that constantly plagues my thoughts when I am lonely. Should I lower my standards and just settle for whoever just because I have this burning desire for companionship? Will I be happy when all my family members are dead and it's just me and Snowball (my future dog)?,dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q7ordb/guys_would_you_rather_keep_high_standards_and_end/
99,q7otrf,1634172820,Is he interested?,"For a little while now, I've (20F) been working with a guy (20M). For some context, he and I work in the food industry and we go to the same university. We have a lot in common, and we talk frequently. He's a friendly guy, but kind of nerdy. At first, I would always be the one initiating the conversation. I'd ask him about his weekend plans and such. He would give me detailed answers, and he'd ask me questions back, but I didn't want to be the one starting the conversation all the time. So for one day, I didn't ask him any questions. I was still being friendly to him, but I didn't make any effort to have a conversation. The next day which we both work, he came up to me and started asking me about my weekend plans. It's been that way ever since; him asking me questions first. Sometimes, he won't even start the conversation; he'll just come up to me and stand next to me and not say anything, so I'll start it.

Another thing is that he's so helpful at work. Even when it's inconvenient for him to do so. For example, one time it was really busy during lunch, and he and another employee were at the register. I was in charge of expediting food. I was the only one expediting, and it was a struggle for me. Not an impossible one; but a struggle regardless. Even though there was a long line of customers waiting to pay for their food, he came and helped me for a few minutes. Another time, when it was less busy, I was at the register, and he was restocking items. I messed up, and forgot to give the customer change, so I was heading to the back to ask another more experienced coworker for help (to reopen the register, we need an ID card number to do it). But before I could go to the back, he stopped what he was doing, came up to me, and asked me what happened. I explained to him, and he tried to use his ID to reopen it. He wasn't able to, but he tried regardless. Of course, he helps other coworkers as well, but it's usually only if they specifically ask for it.

On the same day where it got really busy, when we didn't have any more customers. He asked me if I was okay. Could've been friendly coworker talk, but I thought it was interesting. Another time, he was sanitizing the men's restroom, and I had to do the women's restroom afterward. When he handed the bottle to me, he said ""here you go, m'lady"" (he's into D&amp;D and all of that gamer stuff).",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q7otrf/is_he_interested/
