We were going to meet tomorrow night. So for all the posters who saw red flags about him inviting himself over, you get a gold star. For the very keen posters who thought it might be a sign that he’s married and/or cheating, you get a trophy! After getting some encouragement from a fellow librarian and friend to do more thorough research, I found out that he’s married and he also lied about his actual name. So yeah, I took an L but I’m glad that I found out before we got busy. Thanks for everyone who gave advice. Even though it didn’t work with this guy, this situation has made me look at things like boundaries and my attitudes towards sex.

11,p88pe8,1629476981,Need advice on not getting “boxed” on OLD,"Edit: Took out the “OLD is gross” statement and expounded a bit.  Didn’t realize it came across as judgements, my bad.

OLD is complicated, and my emotions are slightly depressed right now because I feel undesirable at first glance, which is everything the apps are really focused around.  Usually once I get to an in-person date, things go along swimmingly because it’s easier to communicate nuances, communicate with body language, etc.  Not to say I always get a second date, but they still go smoothly and generally enjoyable.

Getting to that first date is usually the hard part.  Across the initial conversations, we usually hit on common topics that tend to lead to dealbreakers for people.  I mention I like to go bouldering, they assume I’m super active (which I’m not) and dip.  I mention I game, they assume I’m super lazy (which I’m also not) and dip.  I mention I work in the trades and they assume I’m uneducated (I was close to completing a Master’s at one point).  I mention my spirituality and the associations of that religion are hard to shake.

I feel like we’re all complex, nuanced people that have depth and exceptions in everything.  So it’s a bit of a downer when others don’t extend that same courtesy to me.  I know I’m not owed that courtesy, but it would be nice.

So how do you all avoid being put in these labeled boxes that don’t fully exemplify your character?  Is that even a battle worth fighting?",datingoverthirty,t5_34cyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/p88pe8/need_advice_on_not_getting_boxed_on_old/
12,p89b55,1629478824,Dating with low(ish) T and recent episode of ED,"Not sure if this qualifies as NSFW so tagged it just in case.

Due to a recent dating fail caused by an episode of ED (and the first time this has ever happened), I discovered my Testosterone levels are on the low side of normal (but technically still within ""normal"" range). Not low enough for insurnace to pay for TRT, so it would be expensive as fuck.

I am doing everything i can to bring this back up, such as lifting at the gym and losing weight, and in turn also getting blood pressure down (since I have high BP).

I also just ordered Roman supplements to give it a try.

Stopping all alcohol.

Anyway, I guess I have a few questions.

1. Should I even be trying to date right now, or am I just setting myself up for failure/disappointment/heart break?
2. If I do decide to date, do you think I should be up front about this recent discovery or would that be an instant hard pass for women?
3. My doctor prescribed me Viagra but I haven't gotten it filled yet. Should I?

This really sucks and I can't tell you how incredibly frustrating and humiliating this issue is for me. I have never had a problem like this before and I am not taking it very well. It's affecting my self-esteem, my mental health, etc...

I just want to know, if you think women would be understanding of this, and would be willing to put in a little extra work, or if that would be an instant ""nope""?

It's not that things don't work at all. They do. It's just there is an ebb and flow now, and sometimes a little more effort might be needed to get things done.

EDIT: Just because there's a lot of people suggesting there are other ways to have fun in bed other than PiV, such as toys, oral, etc.. First of all, thank you, I do appreciate the suggestion. But, unfortunately, she was not interested in trying other things. I did offer to go down on her all night, if thats what it took. Unfortunately, she wasn't interested in that, or anything else. But it's good to know most women are okay with doing other things.

EDIT 2: I appreciate everyone telling me this is a normal occurance. It does help to alleviate some of the feeling of it being my fault, something wrong with me, etc. It also helps to know there are lots of women who are understanding of that, and are perfectly happy to do other things sexually. This whole experience was awful and it helps to know that, others will likely be more understanding.

13,p89qhi,1629480112,OMG sleeping over at my guy's place,"I don't even know what I'm asking for sure. I'm just having my usual panic attack thingy about new. 

K so my man owns his own house, sweet. His parents are elderly though and they live with him. They help around the house and he takes care of them. Great! Except no sleepovers at his place. 

However they left town today. They won't be there. So night before our first vacay I'm going to SLEEP OVER AT HIS HOUSE. I can't believe he even asked me I am so excited to sleep with him in his own bed! 

But still the whole thing is new. Sleeping at his for the first time, going on a long road trip for the first time, showing him hiking for the first time, meeting his sister (in person, we've chatted) for the first time, actually sleeping together a whole week when we've only actually had 2 sleepovers ever, also being together 24/7 for longer than just a single 24 hours. 

I'm also kinda freaking out that my buddy *technically* lives with me and might be in my house when I'm not here. He's stayed at his gf's this whole time but who knows? Maybe he'll capitalize on me being gone or something then someone is walking around my house. 

Tips please? I think it'll be fine but y'know, anxiety is going crazy. So tips and/or reassurance appreciated. And title is because the biggest thing in my mind is actually that he excitedly asked me to sleep over tonight OMG",datingoverthirty,t5_34cyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/p89qhi/omg_sleeping_over_at_my_guys_place/

I asked this to a match this week, and he told me he hadn't been on many dates lately (2 years post-divorce). He mentioned a few activities he liked, but said his number one criteria for a great date is ""getting the butterflies."" I thought it was a cute answer! 

Which leads me to few thoughts and questions:

* do you every get the ""butterflies"" in the first 1-2 meets from an online match?
* do you think the ""butterflies"" are random or do you will them into existence 
* how often do you get the ""butterflies"" in your dates

24,p8du1j,1629493096,"Opened up for the first time with a guy I'm dating about being raped, he said all the right things but now I can't tell if he's ghosted me or has too much on","I (31F) met a guy (31M) recently and it was going really well - we had so much fun together, the same nerdy interests, same life goals/values etc. He'd told his friends and parents about me, made it clear that he really liked me and I really thought this could become my first relationship. I'd never told a guy about what happened to me before as I have such little dating experience and it's a hard topic to talk about, but thought it was important he knew before things progressed. I was also conscious that his mum had cancer and he was having a hard time with that, I didn't want to overload him.

&amp;#x200B;

About 6 weeks in I still hadn't found a good moment and he made a move on me. It caught me off guard and I was triggered - I curled up into a ball, cried and said no repeatedly till I calmed down. It wasn't pretty. He got me a drink to calm me down, reassured me nothing else was going to happen that I wasn't comfortable with. I explained to him I have a severe form of PTSD called complex PTSD and I really needed to take things slow, and that if he wanted to leave he could go. He told me I didn't need to tell him what caused the trauma and that it was ok. The next day we did manage to do some stuff, he got my consent before and told me he would stop at any point if it was too much. I told him afterwards that asking me really helped, it worked for me and that it's what I need. 

&amp;#x200B;

I saw him the following weekend and this is when I opened up to him. I didn't go into the horrible details, I gave him a kind of overview. Explained that it started when I was 6, I had been through the police process and I'd worked on myself to try and deal with some of the issues. I made it clear I didn't want to ask him for support, I just wanted his understanding that I need to take things slow and that I'm inexperienced. If it was too much he could leave and I'd respect his decision, that I didn't want it to be awkward so if he had questions we could talk about it and that I was on a waiting list for trauma focused CBT to help me with it. He held my hand, thanked me for opening up, said all the right things, told me he didn't want to leave, then we went back to talking about normal stuff. Again we did some stuff but didn't sleep together, he made it clear we'd only do what I was comfortable with.

&amp;#x200B;

When he left I didn't hear from him, so I messaged to see if he'd had a nice time with his friends I knew he was seeing after leaving me a couple of days later. I knew he was going away with friends later that week on a camping trip as he'd warned me he might not have signal when he was there. He took over a day to reply. Then he kept leaving me on read/delayed replying. After not hearing from him since the Wednesday and knowing he was going away that day, the Friday, I decided to just ask if everything was ok since opening up to him, and that if it was an issue to let me know, I also apologised for doing it before he went away but explained that it had been on my mind so I wanted to talk about it before he went. He replied pretty quickly saying he'd been working crazy amounts (he had mentioned the last time I saw him he'd worked a 55 hour week and was finding work hard, he seemed pretty down about it) and planning for the trip, apologised for his lack of communication and that there wasn't an issue with what I told him. I replied thanking him for letting me know glad it was sorted etc, and wished him an amazing time on his trip. He apologised again for coming across as ghosting me.

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't hear from him for over a week, at first I put it down to him not having signal but then I knew he was back because I could see he was playing Pokemon Go again. After 11 days of not hearing from him (he was away for the first 7) I decided to say something. I went along the lines of I don't want to assume anything, I don't know if something has happened and in which case I hope you're ok, but if you're no longer interested can you let me know. Told him it took so much to open up to him and it was hurtful to then have silence. I tried to word it really carefully to not come across as clingy. He replied that his phone had died when he was away, when he got back he found out his grandad had heart failure and that combined with work had left him distracted. He apologised and said he's struggling to juggle everything. I told him I was sorry to hear about his grandad and I hoped his family were ok, I explained the lack of communication left me wondering what was going on and that's why I'd asked, I genuinely thought I was getting ghosted and that I could give him space if he needed it. 

&amp;#x200B;

He replied that it's not that he's not interested, he's being pulled in too many directions and apologised for not being able to give me the time and attention I deserve, that he can't promise it will get better in the next few weeks so if I wanted to distance myself from him he'd understand but is happy to remain in touch. I replied that I understood he's got too much on, that if he wants to vent/rant/talking to someone I'm here but don't want to put the pressure on him to do small talk when he doesn't have the headspace and that I'd leave it with him to reach out when things are better. He read this message and didn't reply. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if this is a genuine I have too much on to see you right now but still interested, or if he doesn't want to be the guy that rejects a woman after finding out she's been raped and this is his way of getting rid of me. I do think that everyone has time to reply to messages, if you're super busy you can do it when you're pooping! But there has been a couple of occasions where I didn't hear from him for over a day because something had happened with his mum, and I know he's really close with all of his family. He went from being so into me, to barely speaking to me after I opened up. It feels like I lost all value and respect from him as a person after I revealed this. I made myself vulnerable because I honestly thought he'd be able to see past it - he seemed like such a genuinely good and nice guy with a strong moral compass. I gave him multiple opportunities to say he wasn't interested/leave and he didn't. I just don't get it. What do you think?

&amp;#x200B;

Apologies this has been so much word vomit (probably with lots of typos!) and thank you if you've read this far. Should I have approached the way I opened up differently? I feel like I've completely fucked this up. I didn't want to be clingy but his behaviour made me question what was happening/where I stood. Would you be put off someone after finding out they'd been raped?",datingoverthirty,t5_34cyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/p8du1j/opened_up_for_the_first_time_with_a_guy_im_dating/

27,p8eb16,1629494586,Unapologetic last minute cancellation,"Five years ago I started seeing this guy.
After 3 months of dating and after our first international trip together I brought up the 'Where is this going question"". I got the ""I'm not sure"", ""maybe too soon"", ""I just came out of a relationship"", type of answers.
I (wrongly) stayed around a couple more months hoping his doubts would disappear, but that didn't happen. So I broke it off and asked him to go No Contact, not to reach out to me.
5 months pass and I get an email from him. I was not happy to receive it as it had took me a while to get over him but I ended up replying. He wanted to share some professional news with me, about something I had given him advice on in the past and it had materialised. 
After a couple of email exchanges he asks to meet.
We meet. Cordially. Some subtle flirting, some references to our past...all in all a pleasant night out. He walks me home and I have the feeling he wants to kiss me. I don't entertain that thought, say good night quickly and leave. Later that evening we exchanged a few messages on how good it was to see each other again and agree to repeat it soon.
The next morning I woke up extremely early. I was going to reply to his last message from the evening and realised he was online on WhatsApp. That was odd because it was really early. I asked him why up so early. He tells me his sister commited suicide during the night and he was about to drive 5hours to his parents who found her hanged body.

He was in shock. I was in shock.
I spent 2hours on the phone with him keeping him company while he drove home. I can't even remember it all. I tried to talk as much as possible, trying to ignore my own shock, just so he wouldn't be driving alone.
He gets home and after that it all started to fade. He didn't want to talk much. I understood. I was also hurting, but I let it be. Still, once in a while I would message him, to see how he was doing, sending him strength, offering my support or just randomly messaging to take his mind out of what happened. I was truly truly sorry for him and his family. This event really shocked me. For days I couldn't forget about it, wanting badly to ease his pain, knowing very well there was nothing I could do.
And so his answers became shorter and shorter until they stopped. I didnt insist more.

One year passes. The memory of what happened is vivid on my mind and I send him a short email saying he was on my prayers and that I lit a candle for his sister. His answer was very sweet, he said that it meant a lot to him that I remembered and that it was the best part of his day. He asks how I am doing but I don't reply. I was not after connecting, just really wanted to send love his way.

3 years pass by with me always lighting up a candle on that day and saying a prayer. I could never forget that day. 
This year on that date, I email him. The event was too strong on my mind. I tell him I never forgot that day and that I wish time is helping him heal and send love his way. I thought by now he would be married with kids. My email was respectful.
And so he answers. This time also appoligising profoundly for cutting contact after his sister death and saying he shouldn't have never done it but he had too. Saying how my email warmed his heart and that he would be willing to explain it to me if I ever wanted to hear. I told him I didnt need an explanation, that to me he was grieving and needed space.
Our emails become longer. We told a bit about each others current lifes. He asks to meet for a coffee. I tell him Im traveling abroad and that I return in 2,3 months, and by then I would reach out to him.

2 months pass and I get an email from him asking if Im back and if I would like to meet. I tell him Im still abroad. He asks when exactly Im back. I tell him. He keeps on saying he really would like to meet and is looking forward to it. And he keeps on asking for a date to meet until I land. So I told him once I recover from jet lag, I reach out and we meet.

A few days go by and on Thursday I tell him Im free this Friday, in case he his. He says he is available and asks me where and when to meet. I tell him where and let him decide at which time as I knew he also wanted to go for a run.

To my surprise, on Friday late afternoon I get a message from him saying he is way beyond schedule, still at work and still needs to go for his run (he is training for a competition) and so he doesn't think he can make it this evening. No apologies, no Im sorry, no rescheduling... I answer him ""No worries, enjoy your run.""

Now..wtf? 
Why?
Why ask to meet so many times? Why to set a day just to cancel last minute so unapologetically after being so direct about wanting to meet?
I get the poor planning, but I don't get the reaction to it.
I honestly don't think I want to see him again. I was excited to meet him and chat about our lifes in these last years. But now...I feel disappointed.",datingoverthirty,t5_34cyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/p8eb16/unapologetic_last_minute_cancellation/

41,p8j8b7,1629512839,"Dating has become a big puddle of anxiety for me (31M), and I dunno how to avoid it","So I want to preface this saying that I never been very lucky as far as dating goes. Longest I've dated someone was for 3 months, mostly just end up being friends with the person, and never had a serious relationship. I've been trying tinder again for the last few months, and a couple of months back I matched with this great girl (31F). Really fun to talk to, very compatible musical taste and outlook on life, interesting, and really good looking! We talked a bit, but nothing really frequent (maybe like twice a week), but it was overall no pressure from either side. While we both expressed a wish to meet, we couldn't schedule it for a few reasons: she had some family issues, we weren't vaccinated, and COVID was still raging in our country. But, honestly, I think we were both very chill about it, taking it slow until it was possible to meet.

Fast-forward to last saturday and she messaged me asking if I could meet later that day, since she would be in town to deal with some stuff. I could, and we went for drinks. We had a great time, spent I think 4h in the date, made out, talked a lot. Overall, pretty good date, I'd say. After our date, twice she messaged me saying she was really glad she went out with me. 

The thing is, after the date, conversation between us kinda of died. Monday I messaged her as it was her birthday, and we talked for a bit, but nothing too deep, and today I also tried messaging her again, but she didn't answer much. So anxiety is starting to settle in, as it feels incredibly frustrating that even after what most would consider a very successful data, the person still loses interest after it.

From a rational point-of-view, I know that we are busy people, that we are talking pretty much in the same frequency as before, that not always we can have deep, interesting conversations through text, etc. But from an emotional standpoint, I can't help but feel like the situation is affirming all my the biggest insecurities I have about myself: my average looks, my kinda of boring life, my very small social circle which kinda of limits my opportunities to hang out and do stuff. While I try to keep myself realistic about it, I feel like the moment I meet someone I want to get to know better, this defeatist mindset overcomes me and what should have been a great experience (of meeting her) just becomes a big puddle of anxiety. And I dunno how to avoid or deal with that because I'm conscious it happens, and I can rationalize these being silly thoughts just fine, but no matter how much I repeat to myself that, I can't help but *feel it.* Do you have any suggestions how can I deal with that?",datingoverthirty,t5_34cyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/p8j8b7/dating_has_become_a_big_puddle_of_anxiety_for_me/

Instead, they just see it as a necessary sacrifice before earning the the ultimate prize (usually marriage, kids, and happily ever after). 

If people are only willing to do what they truly enjoy, then I think fewer of them will have regrets about relationships that ""fail"". Indeed, I think this sub is too harsh on divorce. A lot of people here dismiss marriages that happen in other people's 20s because many of them end in divorces. But so what?

53,p8mf2b,1629526826,Need advice for an oddball situation,"I would not in a million years have foreseen this situation happening, so I am reaching out to internet strangers for some advice.

I recently started using hinge, and it has been going decently well, if rather slow. I've kind of been half-assing it.

I recently got a like from someone from my hometown, who I went to high school with and who is two years younger than me. We are in our late 20's early 30's and divorced, so she presumably got married young just like i did. 

So the thing is, this woman, when we were teenagers in high school, very clearly was interested in me and then was turned off by something I did and lost interest. This seems pretty obvious to me now in hindsight.

The problem is, I wouldn't let it go. I wouldn't drop it. I texted her incessantly when this happened and it got to a point where I was doing it for my own entertainment. It was total lunatic, psycho type behavior. I was teenager and an idiot. I remember it clearly because I cringe about it from time to time, to this day. I'm lucky nobody called the police on me.

Now obviously, this doesn't represent me today. I'm a grown ass man with a professional career. I've had so many positive experiences as well as rejections from women in the last 13 years that I don't care one way or another. Again, I was 17 and now I am 32. Obviously an entirely different person and a normally adjusted adult.

I am interested in matching with her, but I have decided that she either:

1. Forgot about the whole thing and we will meet up, her memory will be jogged, and it will be awkward as hell.

2. She sees this as ancient history and doesn't care. 

Should I bring this up in chat at some point to clear the air, or just play dumb and let it be? Or alternatively, ignore her like and go with someone else?

This just seems silly to me at this point. I haven't thought about my teenage years for a long time, but it still seems relevant in this case, at least in my mind.",datingoverthirty,t5_34cyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/p8mf2b/need_advice_for_an_oddball_situation/

We talked very briefly about our jobs, but mostly talked about other topics that I'd say were much more interesting. I had no reason to think he wasn't smart or engaging.

Then on our second date, which was a nice dinner, it seemed like he had done some research into my career and was trying to impress me with his knowledge and give me advice on things I should do. Frankly, I wasn't even annoyed that I was being ""mansplained"" to (I don't even think him doing this was a gender thing) - I just felt secondhand embarrassment on his behalf. He was overconfident and had very surface-level knowledge of something that I'd be considered a subject-matter expert in, and he wasn't asking me questions or trying to learn, he was just sort of bragging to me about stuff he was doing in this area.

This has happened to me a number of times, and it kind of kills my attraction to them. I especially hate it when it crops up on a later date. Like if they really want to talk about this subject, I'm happy to answer questions or explore a topic we mutually don't know about through reading/research. But I just have trouble when they come at it from this mindset where they want to tell me what to do, but clearly have limited expertise.

R Kelly knowingly infecting people with herpes.

Side effects of Tylenol and Motrin.

Her brother's 3rd grade teacher thinking he had ADHD even though he's now an engineer. 

Getting her car towed, then registered, then summoned for Jury Duty.

How Physician Assistants are undertrained for their job duties.

A baby who came through the ER that had meningitis.

How some drug companies lawyers use certain lingo to get them off the hook for liability.

A small rant about how have I never been to Yosemite even though I live in California.

To be honest, half of the time I didn't quite know what to say to these things besides ""I hope that baby feels better.  Yeah I need to go check out that national park.  Yeah R Kelly is kind of a scum bag.  I hope the car's registration went smoothly.

We started having phone sex the other day and she brought up the cuckold fantasy I told her about, which runs completely counter to the dominance I have over her. She played along, enjoyed it and even wants to do it in real life now (whoops). She humiliated me and told me all the ways in which I was inadequate (part of the kink) and it was amazing in the moment. Ever since this interaction, my anxious attachment has activated. Now I’m back to my old ways of wondering what she’s doing, if she’s on a date, resisting texting her, and feeling completely anxious and needy. This all started after the conversation. 

I’m looking for advice on one, how to keep her respect and submission as her Dom if I go through with the fantasy/even if we just talk about it during sex.

68,p8uel4,1629563037,"Is online dating truly ""how everyone meets"" now?","I've been enjoying this subreddit for a few years now, and I've noticed someone will occasionally post a critical comment about dating apps. The response often includes blaming the poster for not being good at the apps, or (more often) pointing out that OLD is how people meet these days.

More concerning to me, I've seen a few commenters argue (to many upvotes) that OLD is the ***only*** appropriate place to ask women out. As a millennial woman no longer using dating apps, this is somewhat alarming to me. It reads almost like saying Facebook or Instagram is the most appropriate medium for getting to know a new friend.

Putting personal preferences aside, I came across this research by Pew on online dating.

[https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2020/02/06/the-virtues-and-downsides-of-online-dating/](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2020/02/06/the-virtues-and-downsides-of-online-dating/)

Their survey was done in October 2019 and found that online dating is common (and normal) but is not the main avenue for meeting someone, unless you're LGBT.

According to this:

* 38% of Americans aged 30 - 49 have ever used a dating app.
* 48% of people aged 18 - 29 have used an app (52% haven't).
* 38% of women aged 18 - 29 believe that dating apps are not a safe way to meet someone.
* Only 12% of Americans overall have been in a relationship with someone they met through OLD. 17% of adults aged 18 - 29 have been in an OLD relationship.
* Of the people who do use online dating, 39% have found a relationship or marriage through the medium. This seems to imply 6 out of 10 online daters haven't gotten a relationship.
* 23% of online daters have never gotten a date through the apps.
* 57% of OLD users have a positive view of online. 44% of women OLD users have a negative view. Also the less educated (and poorer) you are, the more negative your experience.
* 45% of current and recent OLD users say the experience leaves them frustrated. 28% of users feel hopeful. 27% are neither hopeful nor frustrated.

It's quite a long article, so check it out. What I conclude from this is that while online dating is quite popular, it's clearly not the only way people meet.

I've noticed how you interprete the data matters. For example, the Stanford finding that also says 39% of heterosexual couples met their partner online has been used in articles and marketing by dating sites to claim that online dating is the ""most popular"" way to meet a partner.

[https://www.statista.com/chart/20822/way-of-meeting-partner-heterosexual-us-couples/](https://www.statista.com/chart/20822/way-of-meeting-partner-heterosexual-us-couples/)

Yet, one could argue the reverse - that offline or in-real-life (IRL) dating is the most popular avenue since 61% of relationships started offline. It's a question of framing. Instead of comparing OLD to ""meeting through friends"" only, why don't we compare OLD to the myriad of ways one can meet a partner offline (through friends, through family, at work, etc)?

My point is that while online dating is here to stay and many people find their current relationship that way, most people found their partner elsewhere. So why do we talk about OLD as if it's the only and best avenue? Personally, I suspect that frequent usage of Reddit is correlated with usage of dating apps and we seem to project our internet savviness until the general population of daters. (This might actually explain the frequently clueless OLD profiles we see posted here.)",datingoverthirty,t5_34cyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/p8uel4/is_online_dating_truly_how_everyone_meets_now/

72,p8w5wv,1629568971,I have never been in an LTR and I’m starting to wonder what the problem is.,"I (31f) have never been in a long term relationship. Not because I didn’t want to, but because it just didn’t happen. I had three “boyfriends” (at 15, 17 and 22), who all ended what would have been heading towards an actual relationship after a few weeks.
In all that time other than those three I had very few crushes and one other person I had actual romantic feelings for (it didn’t work out).
Since my last casual fling in 2015 I haven’t really felt attracted to anyone, let alone developed any feelings.

I go on the occasional date with people I meet on OLD (I don’t really meet people in real life anymore), the dates are mostly ok, the guys are too, but there’s never anything there that really makes me want to see them again. 
I know what I want, in life and in a potential partner. I do have some “boxes” that need to be checked (e.g. wanting children) and of course I value certain character traits, but it’s not like I have an ideal person in my head that I’m trying to find.

I’m happy with being single, but knowing that I would like to start a family at some point (and I would also just like to experience an LTR, I think it could be great), you can see why I’m starting to wonder if there’s anything I could do differently.
Is this a mindset problem? Should I be aggressively going on dates to increase my chances of meeting someone great? (I’m an introvert so I would probably not enjoy this). Is it possible that I’m on the aromantic spectrum, because I so rarely develop feelings for people (but when I do, it’s rather intense)? Should I just take physical and romantic attraction out of the equation and date people that are a good match otherwise? Or the other way around? Have I just not met the right person and should be patient?

I've always been a ""one person at a time"" dater and strongly prefer that approach to dating. I met a guy (37m) on Bumble and we hit it off big time and have really great chemistry. He told me after our 2nd date that he's seeing other people, which hit me really hard, but I liked him enough to give it a try. It's been rough for me emotionally, but I like a challenge and appreciate the opportunity to grow.

I did tell him I want a relationship, and he said he is looking for a monogamous relationship ""at the end of the day"", but that he wants to explore his options before getting into something serious. Fine - ok. I get that and believe he's being genuine. I told him I'd try dating other people, as well, but have only been able to go out on one other date because it was too weird for me.

My issue is - how long is this stage of dating supposed to last? I asked him this, and his answer was ""I know this isn't a sustainable setup, and I think it lasts until you're seeing multiple people and you end up only wanting to spend your time with just one of them"", which is... not a great answer?

It's been about a month and we've gone out about 8 times and the connection feels strong to me, but I have no idea where to draw a line. Friends have told me I should put a solid number limit here for myself, but that just seems like it'd be so arbitrary.

I'd love to hear how other people navigate this type of thing and where you draw the line between casual and exclusive, if you're looking for something serious.

EDIT: I should add that his reason for wanting to date casually at this point is that he's just gotten out of a 7 year long relationship that lasted a lot longer than it should have, so he doesn't want to get into something too soon. It makes sense to me, although it's hard to be on the other end of it.",datingoverthirty,t5_34cyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/p8wtss/how_long_should_the_casual_stage_last/
75,p8wyug,1629571707,“I don’t see likes.” The most subtle red flag on OKC (and probably others) 🚩 [35M in Colorado],"Profiles that say this, while it is honest and I’m sure nothing untoward is meant by it from the individual, scream “you’re expected to do the work here.” 

On OKC, the “like” feature involves swiping. If someone has “liked” you, their profile will simply show up in your swipes and if you also swipe right, then you will match. You actually don’t need a paid account to see who likes you, believe it or not! You just need to match with them.

To say, “I don’t see likes.” Basically says to me, “I don’t pay. I don’t swipe. I don’t put in much effort here. But I also don’t wanna miss my Prince(ss) Charming, so I sit here and absorb messages until I see one I like and hope he or she falls into my lap.  Apply now!”  I find that the person who writes such a comment is typically much more entitled a person than the person who doesn’t write that comment. I’m ready to debate that generalization.

There’s nothing wrong with it... you do you. Definitely a red flag for me, though.

85,p90qqi,1629585095,Is this the end?,"I (M32) met this woman (F43) on a site purely for hookups. It turned out we were completely compatible and it instantly became more than just sex. We made our intentions pretty clear very soon that we wanted more eventually.

She understood that I wasn't quite ready for a relationship and said she'd wait as long as it takes....this wasn't even 3 months ago yet.

Last 4-5 weeks, she's seemed really off, the kisses have gone from the end of messages, I'm left on read atleast daily, the replies are short, she has an excuse every time I'm available, be it reasonable, but always seems to be whenever I'm free. 

I made it very clear too, that I wanted to be exclusive, and I was under the impression she wanted to be too. Now my anxiety got the best of me. I logged into the site we met on under a new username. This is the first I have been on it since the day we met. I saw that she had been online literally a few hours earlier. I messaged her and asked her if she still goes on that site, and she said yes, but only to verify a friend of hers and to delete messages. Seemed a bit pointless, but I didn't want to think about it anymore, I just let it be. 

So tonight the anxiety takes over again. I log back onto the site, she was online only 8 hours ago. I've also noticed that she uploaded a provocative photo a month ago, long after we discussed being exclusive. There's no proof that she is meeting other people, but the fact she is still active in this site really upsets me, and I'm wishing I had acted sooner.

We still haven't made anything official, but the other day I told her I loved her, and this is after hints of her telling me 'elephant juice' for weeks and weeks! But she just responded with....I don't know what to say to that.

Am I losing her? Have I lost her? I really have fallen for her, and I'm ready for the relationship, but is it all too late? I feel fucking awful!

Edit: typo on the age.

Update: I have told her my feelings over text, not how I wanted to do it, but I can't wait any longer.",datingoverthirty,t5_34cyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/p90qqi/is_this_the_end/
86,p90u19,1629585436,Need advice or support or something,"I’m feeling really low and don’t know what to do about what I guess is a situationship? That’s part of the problem I can’t even tell what it is. I really like this person. We attempted dating last year, but pandemic restrictions and related depression kind of derailed us. I took a break from dating for the first half of 2021. He reached out and we re-connected last month. After a few weeks, we had a conversation about whether to actually date each other and also whether we were dating anyone else. This conversation was mainly forced because he is explicitly not a multi-dater, and I wanted to know whether we were actually going to do this or not. I did not request or require his sole focus, but was basically told it’s that or nothing. Reciprocity from me was not requested either, I just don’t feel like dating anyone else. Every time we see each other I have so much fun (both conversation and physically), and I really think he does too. But it always leaves me wanting more, and he only wants to see me once a week.  I’m not looking for any kind of relationship progression or commitment or anything, just for more time connecting and having fun. 

I know, everyone says have your own friends and hobbies, etc. and I do! But I also have a relatively high sex drive and I have a running debate with myself whether this once-a-week schedule is worse than being single with no intimacy at all or not. Another snag in my brain is that I did see a Bumble alert on his phone that he had a new match recently. In having a general conversation about sexual health sometime after that, I asked if he was seeing anyone else and he said no. He’s given me absolutely no reason not to trust him, so I’m trying to just do that. It’s only been like 6 weeks, am I being unreasonable to be so bothered by these things? Is there a way to manage my emotions better? Any tricks to chill myself out? I really don’t want to end it, but I also hate feeling so sad the day after I see him. I’m ALSO nervous that if I go on apps we will see each other on them and it’ll be real awk.",datingoverthirty,t5_34cyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/p90u19/need_advice_or_support_or_something/

I've never been the type of guy who was overly fixated on sex, but lately that's kind of changed. I would like to get into a nice romantic relationship, but honestly right now, my libido is doing more of the driving. Basically, I really want sex more than a relationship at the moment (not opposed, just not my primary focus now). I would actually like to try my hand at something more like a FWB, but I'm not really sure how to go about that?


I don't think the OLD scene is going to work for me, I can keep on trying there, but I'm just starting to get frustrated by the lack of reciprocation and I've even had it set to looking for a relationship status (I'm planning to change to casual, LFR wasn't a lie before) so I can only imagine how much worse it is only wanting to be casual. I don't drink, never really liked alcohol so I stopped drinking like 6 years ago. So I'm not sure the bar scene would be a good choice? I'm not a very attractive guy and I'm also not super experienced around this type of approach (obviously) so am I just up a creek with this expectation?

90,p91pdw,1629588767,Your 2 cents about à situation,"Hey guys, I was contemplating a situation that occurred to me this summer, and decided to ask the Internet strangers for their opinion. 

So this summer I was travelling across Europe and met a girl, saw her in a nightclub abroad and was instantly attracted to her. Looked up at the big man and vowed that I had to take her back to my hotel. Now normally I do not consent in this kind of behaviour and just dance the night away as I discovered at an early age that the great Stevie Wonder has a better chance of picking up signals than me.

However I decided to approach her and we started to talk as the evening started to turn into a early morning we still were talking and crying from laughter. We decided to take a breakfast and ended up talking even more, until the point that I had to check out at 11:00 or sumthing (I was due to go to another city) I asked her to join and she agreed. So after a drive of 2.5 hours we arrived at the spot and my hotel. The vibe was very relaxed and at this point we were both very tired, yet there was unmistakablely a unique chemistry in the air. 

After dinner I felt that as the evening progressed she became a little colder and when I asked her about it she told me that she normally is a girl who needs time. 

I didnt pursue anything after that, because of the flow. 
Next morning I drove her back to her town and we departed with a hug. This felt akward to me but I didn't call it out, and we went our seperate way. 

A couple of days went by and decided to text her instead of dm. And we had 3 days of texting and just before the weekend I asked her what are you doing next weekend instead of this weekend ( in which she already made plans, and which I knew so I didn't refer to)

She responded that she was already busy and cut of all contact on WhatsApp.

Based on my perception she misread my text. But as it now turns out to be a case of soft ghosting (no contact whatsoever, just a like on the gram a week after this abrupt silence)

I'm kinda in a split. One the one hand, friends tell me to let it go, she's not worth it and just move on.

On the other hand as I'm normally quite reserved, and not easily tapped into my feelings, I can't deny certain feelings based on that one day... The fact that it was quite the unique experience and we were so in tune (according to me of course) makes me wonder if I should pursue it.

We haven't had contact now for over a couple of weeks turning into a month, and I'm thinking that she should make the first move as I don't want to come across needy, and I want to be righteous. (which I don't know If is the right thought) If it isn't ment to be I can very wel accept that, but waiting in vain, tends to become a burden.

92,p92sjd,1629592936,What do women over 30 who use dating apps actually want?,"I'm sure I'm not the first to have asked this question on here, but a common theme I've noticed is that everyone seems to be ""busier"" than they actually are. My impression is that if you are actually looking for a relationship, you make time. But I've encountered many women similar aged to me (32) who text infrequently, or always have something going so they can barely squeeze in a meet up in a week. I understand a lot of us work long hours, have hobbies, friends, etc., but it seems that a lot of the women I meet this is a common theme.

One way I interpret this is that many women maybe go into dating on the apps with the mindset that things likely won't work out, and therefore don't want to commit much effort at the outset.  I worry that this could potentially lead to a vicious cycle, where no one really commits making things work because they don't expect them to...and therefore things don't work out. Now I sort of understand this position to be honest. For instance, I don't like to invest a lot of time up front texting woman, preferring to try to meet up as soon as possible instead, because a lot of those conversations will ultimately go nowhere. But I feel that some level of communication is important even after a first date just to keep building that chemistry and interest.

 Is the main profile too much like a resume, and too wordy?

\- Am I expressing openly enough what I'm looking for in another person?

\- Would the additional photos be redundant, or beneficial?

\- And, is it too rash of me to mention from the get-go that I'm a former monk?
