* Some younger men are genuinely into older women and have always dated older women (which is what I prefer) -- but many younger men seem to be interested in me only because they couldn't get the younger woman they wanted
* Since I'm older they figure I will do a lot of the kinky stuff that younger women won't do -- which is true to some extent BUT if it's the only reason they want to be with me (which is often the case) then it's basically a turnoff
* Immaturity -- this is probably the main reason -- a lot of younger men don't demonstrate much consideration or common courtesy so I basically have no choice but to drop them.  
* Default Booty Call -- a fair amount of these younger guys also drop me i.e. ghosting but then of course I hear from them 2-3 months later when whatever other prospects they were chasing fall through and they want to get laid.

I am 23, male, master student, NW European and heavily crown balding so I crop my hair to about 2mm. I like the way it looks on me and have accepted it kinda but it seems most people dont.  Almost nobody around me is already bald at this age.

I have noticed I barely have succes on dating apps.
I'm not unattractive. I rated myself a 6.5 and girl friends told me I'm more than that. I get compliments from time to time (eyes etc). A fun and beautiful girl I had a date (and more) with told me my baldness also has a rugged masculine look to it. She says that with hair (picture) I looked like a typical fuckboy/prettyboy.

I guess that is where the problem is.. 
In high school when I still had hair I had a lot of succes both on dating apps and irl. 
The few matches I get now, however, are with a few exceptions very low quality and they barely put in effort. IRL I can't judge because the lockdowns prevent proper socialising. A cute girl I had a great time with did ask my ig at a bar a while ago so IRL I still ""have it"" I guess.. 

I have a feeling this lack of matches is because im bald and while irl personality, confidence etc have a greater effect, online to swipe only looks matter. 

And i notice that with the girl friends I have, all the guys they swoon over on dating apps look like that typical fuckboy I was talking about (with that fluffy full head of hair). 

Should I just give up? It's honestly affecting me quite a bit.

I've been told I'm not a bad looking guy on numerous occasions, but every girl that I'm attracted to and interested in, I never get a chance, my ex was the only one that gave me a shot.

Every other girl either rejected me, or tried to friendzone me, it's gotten to a point where on a few nights laying in bed,  I considered giving up on dating altogether. I've found myself thinking what's the point liking this girl or being attracted to her? There's been times where I see a girl I like and I do absolutely nothing, because again I ask myself what's the point? Crazy thing about this, is that I have good conversation, and I can sometimes get a phone number, or social media, but after that it's usually nothingness. What should I do?

I'm a 26 years old man from South America and moved to Scandinavia one and a half year ago with the purpose of expanding my career internationally. After this change, the girlfriend I had at the time, since I was 19, broke up with me because she couldn't handler the distance relationship that we would need to have for one year before she could move in here, for personal reasons - this breakup was really harsh on me, made me really depressed and I decided not to date again till May this year, because I couldn't simply handle my emotions properly. I seemed to always be in the verge of an emotional breakdown.

As anyone in Scandinavia who doesn't want to scare the autistic locals by randomly starting conversations I decided to download Tinder. I don't consider myself a pretty man, but I've been able to match and go on dates with girls I who are very gorgeous, and this is is where the problem starts. When in a date I normally have no problems interacting with the girls, I think. We normally keep the conversation going, we talk about interesting stuff, we normally kiss or have sex, but no matter what I hardly can get on a second date.

For instance, the first girl I met was a local blonde, adorable! We went for a coffee, talked for hours and had a great and warm goodbye kiss before I took the train back to my place. On that day we agreed we would see each other again, I get into the train, she send me songs and we get the conversation going during the week with one or two messages a day. She bailed on the date e initially agreed, and then I rescheduled, but she bailed again. She was always super nice, and we were always respectful for each other, but we ended up being just friends, even tho it had an initial spark.

Time goes by, I go on more dates, always being able to ""score"", till last week. I've met this girl from Latvia, and she was absolutely gorgeous. We went on a date, all goes as normal and we do have sex, she says all kinds of nice things to me, like ""we should spend a weekend together"", ""we have a really matching energy"", ""you are cute"", hear emojis, etc, etc. I keep talking to her, ask her out again, she agree on going out, but then she bails out, reschedule, bails out again, and I end being pushed alway as a friend again.

On the other hand, girls which I don't like that much and don't get emotional with normally want to keep hanging out with me and propose more serious stuff. Normally when I go on a first date, I've not yet been emotional available for the person, but if I like the girl, I make myself available. I will text during the week, try to get into fun conversations and so on. When I'm just for sex, I will text just in order to schedule the next hangout and talk only when out.

**I fall in love too easily**, from Chet Baker, is a song that basically sums up in a few words the kinda man I consider myself to be, and I think that being passionate and very upfront with feelings is scaring off the fellow Northern European chicks - but I'm unsure. The problem is, I tried to be different and to hide what I feel but it doesn't work, my desire to act like that and built something I consider to be special is simply overwhelming. I tried to read a few books, and the message I always get is basically ""don't be too nice"", ""define boundaries"", ""you won't be respected if you act like this"", and so on.

Prestory to everything: We know each other for a good time, not friends, but just seen on friends party and whatsoever. 3 Weeks ago, she started texting me FIRST and she asked a lot of times if I wanna go on a date with her. I always said yes and she cancelled everytime last minute. So I talked to her IRL saying i dont like this bullshit and either she wanna do something or not(not the same words, i hope you get it anyways what i mean).

He yelled at me over the phone telling me how he doesn’t want me anymore and how toxic we are for each other. I don’t understand where he got the toxicity from when our arguments would be me reacting to his treatment and expressing how he hurt me. He never was able to take accountability for how he treated me instead he would tell me how terrible of a person he is and that I deserve better. Whenever I had problems with my mental health he wasn’t there for me emotionally, he would get irritated that im depressed and then say to me “he’s lost and depressed and that he hasn’t cried in years ever since he met me” he also had a huge problem with ❄️and alcohol and would constantly bring it around me knowing I’m bipolar :/ so I don’t understand how I was toxic when all I did was be loyal, loving and affectionate and supportive towards him. I did everything I could to make him happy even though I wasn’t mentally well. It’s been almost two months and I’m struggling sm. right after our breakup he’s posting on ig a LOT living his best life with his friends, he posts things we have done and their little adventures but he didn’t do the same with me? Sometimes I feel like he’s purposely doing it cause he KNOWS I’ll check his profile. I don’t understand where I went wrong but it’s killing me. He seems so much happier without me so I guess I was toxic ?

I’m married.

So I have a friend who I have been close friends with since high school, (we are in our late 20s now. Her and I have very different ideas when it comes to dating and relationships, ever since she left the state we grew up in and moved to California, she’s been more about “hookups” than monogamous relationships. Which is absolutely her prerogative. 

However, she recently mentioned that she has been having unprotected sex with this new guy she has been seeing. She is on birth control, but that doesn’t help against stds. The problem is, they are not in a monogamous relationship, and I know for a fact she has previously tested positive for HPV. She has not told him this, and said it would be weird for him to tell him now, since she’s already let him not use a condom. 

Now I know HPV is the most common std, and some people don’t ever experience symptoms, but some people can have major health issues because of it.

I couldn’t believe what I was hearing.. it’s seems so selfish and irresponsible. It’s stupid IMO in general to have unprotected casual sex, but especially when there is a known STD.

Should I say something to her? I’ve already told her she should think about the health of the next girl he’s with. But she just was kind of like “I know I know.. but so many people have it, so he probably already has it”.


She hates when I or anyone else comments on her sex life, she doesn’t like to be “judged”, but this about people’s health. I need some advice.

He’s perfect but the only downside is his texting. He only texts me once a day which is usually late at night and sometimes it’s 2-3 days later.. I’m not a huge texter myself but I think 1-2 texts a day is good. I get nervous when he doesn’t text back for a couple days.

On our date, he said he only uses his phone for logistics during the day and then checks his texts at night. Should I bring up his texting or is it too soon? Is it also too soon to ask him what his intentions are?

I have had absolutely no luck when it comes to romance. I used to be quite forward with men by asking them out, planning dates, planning second dates, and I have continually only gotten the interest of problematic men. These being manipulative assholes, men who are too depressed and detached to really give to a relationship, or men who act super interested and excited only to ghost me.

I got out of a relationship last year and started to really do some internal work on myself. I started working out regularly and building muscle, meditating, being more organized, and got into therapy. I really thought dating this time around would be a lot more successful because in the past I was super desperate and came on waay too strong at first. Lately I have been letting men make the first move and making sure that I don't come on too strong. Despite this, I just keep getting ghosted or meeting men who only want to talk to me for sex or to fill some void (and I know they will just end up telling me that they aren't ready for a relationship later).

I am a black woman, I live in the midwest so it is mostly conservative around me (I am not), I'm not religious, I don't want kids, I like nerdy things, and I can be socially awkward so I come across as a bit quite at first. I'm starting to wonder if all of these traits combined is what is causing so much of the struggle. It is hard to find people who want to date black women, don't want children, and aren't religious (at least in Nebraska). I'm just starting to wonder if these qualities are what is making dating hard for me? I'm getting burned out from it and taking a break. I believe I am a catch and would make someone happy but for some reason people just don't take the time to really see the great person I am.

Since sometime last year, things have really gone sideways. I'd say probably 8 out 10 either ghost or don't show. For the ones who do, whether they agree to a FWB and make arrangements; they constantly defer to a more NSA style of handling things.   


I think most of us out there in the dating scene probably obviously understand FWB vs NSA-H. However, based on behavior of people I've met even since the year started; I think there needs to be clarification.   


If you agree to be a FWB  with someone, this is not a NSA arrangement. The NSA's are for if you just wanna have a contact for that random once a month... every few weeks bootycalls.   


The FWB arrangement is intended for people who like to have some form of connection, and they are going to be more than just a bootycall. This doesn't give them a right or grounds to demand any form of commitment,monogamy, or anything like that. However, you should be making an effort to get to know them. It's fair for them to want to hang out sometimes. The frequency of how often you're talking and meeting can vary by a lot, but this should be accompanied by very honest and open communication. It's important to be clear about  your boundaries. I think it's important that this agreement gets revisited sometimes as situations can evolve over time.   


If you find yourself in a FWB situation where you want to see how things can develop, there's also the option of trying a poly situation where it can have more romantic notes to it, but it's still open, and everyone can still see other people.   


The point of this post is because I've met lots of people who agree to FWB situations, but they never bother to either chat and get to know. They won't go out and do anything except pop by for bootycalls. Most messages from them are WYD. If you're only hitting someone up for a WYD, that's not being a FWB. That's nsa-hookups. They are not the same thing. There is a difference. Don't agree to a FWB just because you wanna  hook up with someone. That's so rude, and you're wasting people's time.   


There are people out there who want  more out of a situation than just nsa's with strangers.   


not terribly related: but if you ghost someone you're supposed to be fwb with. they have every right to block you or not want to talk to you anymore if you don't communicate within a certain time frame following that. it's not ok to just waste people's times and make plans.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,909958,public,self,differentiating between FWB and NSA Hookups,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oogjeo/differentiating_between_fwb_and_nsa_hookups/,all_ads,6,,,,,

Last week I asked if he wanted to FaceTime. He replied saying that he probably wouldn’t have time because he was going to work out but that he did want to FaceTime in the near future. I agreed but since then we have not really spoken about it. It kinda bothers me that I am constantly the one who has to bring up FaceTime and maybe going on a date after that. He is never the one to bring up the topic. Could it be that he expects me to bring it up because I was also the one who brought it up in the first place or could it be that he is simply shy?

So I went to her today and asked about the time and place, and she got shy and started smiling, and said she's nervous, then said she has a doctor's appointment (true, she was a bit sick last week), and then she will do homework because she's going out of town tomorrow. She'll be back Friday and can move the date that day. All the time she was a bit of shy, insisting on her nervousness.

Then I asked her, when does she finish her homework, and she said 9pm. And then I said that I will be at the coffeeshop near her home at 9am, I hope you will show up. 

She did say that she doesn't wanna be someone to say she'd come but later doesn't show up, and I said, it doesn't matter, I am taking the chance of maybe, then I went out of the store with a See Ya!

Now I am at the coffeeshop, and she hasn't showed up yet, which makes me a stood out, i guess.

So she has been with this other guy for a couple weeks now, not dating but just casual going to eachother’s houses and I think they may have had sex a few times. 

Last weekend we were at a party and she was keen on me all night, (even though the other guy was there too) dancing with me and making out and we slept together (didn’t have sex, on her period).

So we have been snapping eachother since but she often snaps me while shes with him (they live close together, I live far away).

To make matters complicated, me and him look somewhat similar.

I just want to know which one of us shes really into here, I mean it could be both but i dont get it at all.

I have now moved back to college in the US and have been trying to get back into the dating pool. I thought that im at college and dating would be easy since everyone is young and single. I joined Tinder/ Bumble and all of my matches seem to either not respond/ stop responding after a while. 
The thing is im a colored international student with an accent, so I probably dont fit what most American women are looking for. Everyone has their own dating preferences and thats fine but its surprising that I feel like I cant find anyone to want to date me. Back in my home country I was considered an attractive guy and it wasnt uncommon for girls to approach me. I definitely never felt like I had to try very hard to seduce women. I guess most American women have different preferences, but Its surprising to me how big the difference is. 
I even began cold approaching women sometimes. I cant say im the best at it but I feel like im not bad (and getting better). Those usually fell through as well. 
I feel like im starting to feel a bit depressed because of the lack of intimacy. Its probably been nearly 2 years now since ive last been with a woman. Its starting to feel hopeless ans im losing the motivation to keep using Tinder/cold approaching since i just end up being constantly let down.

When we see each other we always hook up but also go out to eat, drink, hang with friends, have fun. I even met his family once. Now that things have opened up more &amp; calmed down &amp; I actually ended up moving closer to him because of work (he’s still 2 hours away), I started to think about our relationship more &amp; realize I have feelings for him. I thought that maybe he had feelings for me too because of things he would say. He compliments me all the time (not just on my looks, but on my personality &amp; character) &amp; tells me how much he misses me &amp; wishes I could live with him, &amp; also tells me that he cares about me. One time there was some confusion &amp; he got upset because he thought I was seeing another guy. Once I explained the situation, he apologized &amp; said that he gets jealous because he cares about me. He also told me that he started calling me his girlfriend to his coworkers because it was easier than explaining the whole friends with benefits thing to them.
However, when it comes to his actions, I see a different side of him. We seem to hang out on his terms &amp; not mine. I thought that now that I was closer I would see him more but he only initiated one hangout so far where I went to his house. He implied that he really wanted me to come back again but hasn’t asked me back yet. His family had a party last weekend &amp; he told me about it but didn’t invite me. He then said his family asked if I was coming &amp; he said I told him I couldn’t. I told him that while he told me about the party, he never invited me. He then gaslit me &amp; told me that he had &amp; I just forgot. I’m now trying to make plans for this weekend &amp; he complained about what I had planned so we are doing what he wants instead. But he doesn’t even seem that interested in coming &amp; when I asked him which day worked best for him he told me he hadn’t decided if he was actually coming or not yet. 
I’m just so confused how last month he introduced me to his family, invited me up for a romantic weekend at his house, &amp; told me how much he cares for me. Now he’s acting like he doesn’t even want to see me at all. I would say that this hot &amp; cold behavior is pretty typical for him though. I’m just so confused &amp; could really use some advice.

After being a part of this subreddit for so long, I kind of thought that you guys would be brilliant at some ideas. I have some of my own,, but I know reddit is always full of amazing and memorable ideas. As mentioned, this is a 2nd date. The first date was 3 hours over happy hour, we both had a great time, lots of subtle flirting and chemistry. Tomorrow night, Wednesday, is 2nd date time. We live in NYC so there are plenty of things we can do. Tomorrow is supposed to be another humid day, but the general idea is meet around 6pm, do something and then have dinner around 8pm. All signs point to things going well between us and there is definitely excitement for this 2nd date. 

I really want to try and make it really fun and a date that she will want to think about often. Unfortunately money is a slight issue, I am not wealthy, so I am a little conscious about expenditure. Being a gentleman though, I would like to cover the costs. I'm really excited and of course very nervous. It's been a long time since I've sincerely wanted to both impress someone and be myself at the same time. I'm hoping some of you wonderful peeps out there might have any suggestions. Essentially, meet at 6pm, do some activity without sweating to much in the humidity, and then eat dinner at 8pm.

I have to say that the guy looks young for his age so she came to know the truth after the 3rd date probably. Thing is, in my country sex before marriage, especially among teenagers is low. There is barely any teenager having sex in a suburb like ours (unless they are married as legal age to marry for women is 18). Now I am an year younger than her so I was even more naive than her when she started dating. I was kinda uncomfortable with the age gap, but I never knew that this was the sign of a predator.

Fast forward to 2020-2021, she is 19 now. They have been in an on and off relationship for a long time. She told me a long time ago, she has broken up but never told me they got back together. She doesn't even talk about her relationshipsto me anymore. The boy's ""best female friend"" hates my friend and tries her best to spread rumors about her. I came to know that the boy has dated a 14 year old before dating my friend. The thing is, I now know that this kind of behavior is predatory. I tried to tell my friend about this as soon as I came to know that they are back together, and she lied that they have already broken up. I came to know later that she lied, or maybe she got back together again because everyone else around my friend convinced her that the boy is in Love with my friend. I also told her straightforward that your bf is dating young girls because women of his age can see right through him. Now, no matter how much I try to convince my friend, she keeps on lying to me saying that they have broken up but I know that's not the truth. She also refuses to talk to me about him but talks to her other friends about this.

But when I mentioned hey why did you ignore the part where I feel too ugly for something, gave a lame response to me. I felt very ugly and no longer trust people who say that after ending that qpr.

It’s a constant cycle of always checking on him, asking him how he is, asking what’s he’s doing, asking if we could call for a little, always sending memes, always messaging him, etc. I’m hurting my own heart when he doesn’t respond all the time like I am. 

He’s the type to not respond immediately. I wouldn’t say like hours on end, but when he’s doing stuff, it’s more of hours on end. I guess i’m ranting cause i’m a little frustrated that he doesn’t text me as much. He’s currently on vacay with his friend and i thought maybe he could text me every now and then throughout the day. But it’s more of like text in the morning, one text in the day, and then barely anything at night. I’m concerned why he’s doing this because his friend is sending me pictures throughout the day of what they are doing. If his friend can be on his phone, i feel like that’s the perfect time to text me just a little of how it’s going, just to talk for a little. 

And while he’s not texting, I constantly am. I’m waiting and waiting and waiting for him to text me while i’m busy doing the things I am. We had a little convo about it today and he just told me he can’t always text me the way i want him to. He said that he won’t always be there to text me, which made me upset, but i guess I understand what he means. 

I tried today to not answer him. It’s been 5 hours and he hasn’t texted me asking why it’s been so long since i’ve responded. :( I thought maybe he would notice, but no. My mom tells me i need to stop giving so much of myself to him. That i need to make him want me, because currently, i bet he believes he has me wrapped around his fingers.

I was really excited cause I honestly caught feelings for him so I just wanted to see if the feelings were in person.

I joined a friend group 4 years ago and met this guy, I'll call him F. I thought F was cute the second I met him, but he wound up in a 2-year relationship and I watched it turn sour and eventually break. Now that it's over and he's had time to heal a bit, F says he's looking for a girlfriend.

Recently I've been hanging out a lot with F in group settings and my feelings have significantly grown for him. We've been staying up late watching movies, playing board games, listening to music, going on car rides, dancing, going on walks, etc. and it's crushing me that I don't know what to do with my feelings. F and I have a lot in common and I love spending time with him.

In short:

I really want to ask my friend, F, on a date but I'm avoidant of making things awkward if he turns me down. He's a good enough person that we would remain friends, at least. I talked to a close mutual friend and he encouraged me to speak up about it.

How do I approach F? We're always hanging out in groups. I don't want to come across as too serious if I pull him aside. I don't really want to text him because it's less personal and I can't see his reaction - good or bad. However, I learned that he has started past relationships via DM.

So the thing is that she’s seems like a really caring person, even remembered my birthday and texted said happy birthday. I also am very caring and I definitely want to show that side of me but I just don’t want to overdo it in person, and from my understanding you can friend zone yourself that way. So what can I do to show I’m caring, but also romantically interested, while also not being disrespectful?

I’m totally new to dating, specifically OLD. I’m using bumble exclusively and have only been on the dating section for two weeks. I have received a lot of interest and over the past two weeks been on five dates and will keep it at this for a bit since they all asked for second dates which will proceed this weekend.

All of the guys asked for a second date during our first. There is one guy who I like more so far. I allowed him to peck me a kiss goodnight after our date and we’ve been in steady communication up until last Thursday. We’ve been having challenges scheduling our second date as we are both really busy and have been transparent with what’s been making us busy. Last Monday he asked for Wednesday but I wasn’t free so I said Tuesday or Thursday? He said that both those days would be hard but he’ll try. Tuesday comes and I didn’t hear from him so at 5pm I ask if I’ll be seeing him that night. He apologizes for not messaging me earlier and says that he can’t. Asks if there’s another day I would be free. I said Thursday I’m still available and Friday might work but I wasn’t sure at that time. Thursday comes and he messaged me a huge paragraph in the morning that he won’t be able to make it for today but essentially wants me to know he’s still interested and that we should aim for Friday or the weekend if I have the time. I said “I hope Friday will work!” And he hearted the message and told me he hopes I have a good day and I hearted that message. Friday comes and nothing. I felt I reached out already and this time he should. Or perhaps he was thinking the weekend instead since he said Friday or the weekend. It just wasn’t clear but I made other plans and let it go. The weekend comes and again nothing from him. 

While dating is new to me, I see the difference in communication between him and the others. The others are consistent with messaging and firmly arranged our second date. OLD to me is new age, meeting people this way is new age. I have no idea if this lack of communication indeed shows his lack of interest and I should take it for what it is or if I also didn’t do that great in communicating and perhaps should reach out? It’ll be one week of no communication if this continues to Thursday.

On our first date he said he doesn’t ghost as he thinks it’s rude and will tell his date that he is no longer interested… I know actions vs words. But I’m thinking of reaching out and just asking if he’s still interested? Or should I just leave it? 

If it matters, he’s also 30.
