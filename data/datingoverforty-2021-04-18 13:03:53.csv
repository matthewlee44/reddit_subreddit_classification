&amp;#x200B;

**Disclaimer:**

I don't think that life as such is unfair just because I am am man

I don't hate women, I've had my share of sexual partners and I had my 12 years long marriage that led to two wonderful kids that I love more than anything. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Secondly - Please ladies .. Stay out of this thread.** 

This isn't about you. I'm interested in what my fellow men are thinking. And sure, there are going to be a few that come here to brag and tell me that they've just re-married (maybe even a 25 year old) and there are going to be a few that will go all anti-women ... But hopefully we are going to get a discussion that can benefit us all :)

&amp;#x200B;

**The actual post:**

I just find that I sit here in silence facing zero interest and I've basically given up on ever having a relationship again. 

I mean, I'm fairly extrovert and intense when the mood strikes me, so since my divorce 5 year ago I've managed to get laid whenever I was feeling too ""desperate"", but apart from that .. Everything seems bland. 

The thing is after that first shag then sure, I can get laid again .. but I still have to do the heavy lifting. Initiate, be awesome, entertain and then ok .. we do a repeat .. but next time you again have to initiate and .. fuck it! 

&amp;#x200B;

**Kids**

I didn't realize this back in the day, but with 20/20 hindsight it is blatantly obvious that having kids was the main driver .. Sex and fertility in other words. Especially in my younger years I accepted a lot of shit just for the sake of good/fun sex. 

&amp;#x200B;

That thing is gone ... So what I'm left with is still very little interest .. and it is still having to do a shit load of heavy lifting. I mean .. I can do that .. and I can get a woman going if need be, but I no longer can do that continuously like in the old day. The reward is simply not there. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Simply put**

I want interest, I want engagement and I want support. 

Sex alone is no longer can no longer carry it .. I suspect it's the lack of fertility that comes with being our age

But that seems to be too much to ask, so there ... oh well .. *shrugs shoulders*

&amp;#x200B;

**My questions**

So here are my two questions:

1. I'm not the only one that feels this way am I. That life no longer is about relationships. It's about my kids, it's about me, it's about work .. But the dating stuff seems to no longer carry a reward, right?

2. If so .. How do you guys deal with it? Have you just shrugged your shoulders and gone ""C'est la vie"" .. We had our fun and now it's something else?",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/mtjedu/the_absolute_silence_that_comes_with_being_a_late/

15,mtrl6h,1618800909,How to talk to new people about the dissolution of my marriage,"I am divorced and can’t really say with certainty exactly why I am. I went back to school when we were pregnant with our second and into a time-intensive job. We both knew that to be case. While I was doing that and starting my career she started hanging out a lot with a stay-at-home dad friend that we had just met. They both had more time to do fun stuff and work out a lot than his wife or I did and I guess found out they had a lot in common and just recently bought a house together - mostly with money he extorted out of his ex in lieu (per his untrustworthy word) of child support that she would have to pay him for the next 15 years.

She never talked to me about anything we could do so salvage our marriage and keep our family in tact. After we were separated for 18 months and divorced she said in an email after I mentioned the word affair (which she still insanely doesn’t think happened) she said some mean things and that I didn’t make her feel wanted as a woman. That was painful because I did want her as a woman but in retrospect my being so busy trying to learn a hard new thing made me emotionally and psychologically and physically exhausted and I guess allowed me to not place our relationship on the forefront in her mind. It was on the forefront, I felt like the things I was doing was for us and for her. She appreciated it and told me until she stopped and didn’t tell me. I didn’t want her to feel that way. She was the most important person in my life. My hopes and dreams and what I strived for were mostly related to my family and she was the most integral part. 

I don’t have hopes for her and I. She threw me away like garbage after 17 years while I was doing the hardest thing I ever did for us and our children. I feel like I am a good man and think she will regret what she did but I think that her having 50% of her time without her children right now is what she wants and she is the kind of person who takes what she wants. She is also prideful and narcissistic and would never admit she was wrong. 

Anyway... How do I talk to a new person about that? I would have described myself as a family man but now my family is my kids half of the time. I have of course felt worthless and inadequate since the separation. And broken. I think that ultimately it is just that I married a person whose values I thought aligned with mine and they didn’t. I think the most important decision I ever made, to marry her, was a bad decision though I did not know it at the time.

I’m not worried about getting dates. I’m quiet but (forgive me this next part but the anonymity of the internet allows me to be a little more blunt than I normally would be) I am attractive, in good shape, tall, smart, kind, and talented. I just worry that people will think something is fundamentally wrong with me because of what happened with my marriage. That is something I’ve questioned. It just didn’t work out? That’s not really it.

Am I overthinking? Everyone has baggage I guess. How have any of you addressed past marriages or relationships?",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/mtrl6h/how_to_talk_to_new_people_about_the_dissolution/

I have a few degrees and have an interesting career with a wide range of worldly experiences. I am well-mannered and very pragmatic about almost everything. My ex is a professor and cheated on me with a whole bunch of women who don’t look as good as I am nor anywhere close to being as well-educated. That really hurt me and took me a long while to get back my confidence. We are still friends after the divorce and he still likes talking with me and sometimes (before Covid) asked me to go to his university events with him, because he was always proud of me and liked to show me off.

I value education and used to be around people with the same level of education or higher, but after divorce i thought i wanted to try something different. I met a couple of community college educated guys who said they weren’t threatened by my education, so I thought cool. At first i enjoyed talking with them, and then I got bored pretty quickly when the conversations couldn’t go beyond what they know or their interests. I met another guy with a master’s degree, and he had to prepare topics for conversations before our dates. A couple of times he would have the questions or topics written down before meeting me. Another guy also told me that he had to read up and prepare before he went on a date with me.

I do not know what i did that they think they had to do that. I usually just show up and don’t start the conversation until the guy does and go with the flow. I can talk about anything except cars. In my opinion, i never tried to be intellectual or intelligent. Most of the time i just threw out one-liners unless I was asked for opinions about specific things/topics. I was just being my laidback self most of the time, and have a tendency to make fun of myself or of the situation.

I really want to be with someone who is confident in his own skin and let me be me. But i seem to have hit a dead end with that.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/mtt3ft/should_women_dumb_yourself_down_to_date/

22,mtuphs,1618813877,Question: would you date a guy who lives in a van on purpose but is financially responsible?,"Really quick about me: 43, financially secure, investments etc.  I actually own a property &amp; pay a mortgage on it  but I rent it out.  And yeah, I live in a van.  I guess you could call it ""houseless on purpose"".  I just enjoy the lifestyle. I've been doing it for nine years.

So here's the nuts and bolts of it: I meet a nice woman through mutual friends. We're doing this socially distance party thing.  Where I live you're allowed ten people per group, six feet apart.  There's obviously chemistry and we're hitting it off.  As we're walking up the beach back to the parking lot she wants to keep the night going.  I say ""sure, this is my home.  Wanna hang out and drive up to the mountain for a sunset?"" The look on her face was like a deflated balloon.  It didn't end with a mountainous sunset.

And this isn't the first time it's happened.  I've got a Tinder profile, I explicitly say I live in my van full-time for financial and adventure reasons.  I still match with women which means they aren't reading my profile buy just looking at the pics. ..  We'll go on a date and throughout the course of the night, the topic will come up.  It doesn't end well.

I'm just wondering what's up.  I'm just wondering if there's a stigma against it.  Like, I'm not some crackhead making meth in the back of a clapped out RV.   I didn't get kicked out by my ex-wife and I'm living in my van (never married no kids).  I'm not a bum.  I just live for adventure, I've lived in a dozen countries in my lifetime and I've been to over 85.   Legitimately the only difference between me and another guy is that my house is on four wheels, it costs me 1/4 of what people paying to live in a place.  Even with my mortgage I'm still making money.  And that's nothing to say of all the other things I have going on in my life.

And it's not even about the money.  I just truly and deeply enjoy going on adventures, exploring my backyard (socially distance of course) and living my best life.  It's not like I'm some student eating canned chili like a homeless person.

I dunno just frustrating with the dating lately.  Maybe it's covid who knows.  Pre covid there was no problem finding those pixie wanderlust fairies who loved going on a road trip and living in 60 square feet.  Maybe times are changing and I'm just getting old.

So question: would you date a fit, friendly, financially secure  Canadian guy who just so happens to live in a custom van? I can't offer you a bathroom but I can offer you a gorgeous sunrise at the beach.

27,mtyg3v,1618831251,Profiles- am i being too picky or have we all become lame?," Hello all! I hope everyone is happy and had a great weekend (for those reading this on a Monday). I have some requested insight/question to ask all of you fine people.

   I (46M) did OLD a few years back, before swipe apps took over and had above average sucess with it and enjoyed it even. I had no problems finding women that I could get interested in and once a meeting was set up, get excited about. It didn’t always work out, but quite a few times it certainly did. 

   Since then, Ive moved to a large US city (large enough to have pro sports teams) and have recently went ‘back out there‘ and I have to say the quality of profiles have significatnly dropped since (and Im sure this isnt gender based at all). Im no great shakes in the looks department ( a 6 at best, a 7 if i wear a tie), but I can’t seem to find a single person in this multiple million people city that I’m interested in online. I can’t tell if its me being too picky, the pandemic still keeping folks away , or have people become so boring? What Ive found in profiles so far:

\- Nearly ALL are blank (even on paid sites, non swipe). If there’s a write up which is rare, its sparse or super negative. Did we collectively stop writing ”about me”s? Did creative writing stop being a thing?

\- Photos are 3-4 selfies ... often in the same outfit, same day. Nothing interesting that I can grab ahold of and comment. I can swipe through 500 profiles and literally see none with anything but selfies only. 

\-Replies are never more than 1-3 lines. Ive yet to receive a paragraph in reply when my replies are of decent length.

\- The rare time that I match with someone, the conversation has yet to be engaging. Not once. This of course could be my fault. I try but the lack of profile/ photos makes it challenging.

This isnt a rant, or gender based. I’m just curious if things have changed or have you noticed? Have people just given up? Maybe its the pandemic and what’s still on there are ‘bottom of the barrel’ profiles? I’m not faulting the people, as I’m sure they’re wonderful human beings, I just dont understand the 100% lack of any effort. There are profiles that are far worse of course (Snapchat filters, “just ask” write ups etc) but I’m more talking about the average person that could very well be on here. Are you one of those people that put no effort in? Maybe it still works out and I have to give up on caring about such things?

  Have things changed or am I being too picky?

Dare I say I was even excited at all the possibilities? In a way, we didn’t have so many possibilities when we were all young and starting out. I had built up a much more dismal scenario in my head, but I needn’t have.

To the issue at hand....I am thinking about returning to online dating. It's been a couple of years, and I will need to update my profile to reflect changes in my life, change out pics for more current ones, etc. I use OkCupid because it has worked well for me in the past, so it's where I'm going to start again this time. The other day, I opened the app and of course had to enable my profile, but before I could even get to updating anything, I was already getting likes and even one low-effort message. I disabled my profile immediately. I wasn't ready, and more importantly, my profile wasn't ready. How have others handled this?

36,mu6fqu,1618855183,"42, living with grandma as caretaker, been going on for years now. Last relationship ended 6 months ago, got dumped and ghosted by whole group of people not just her.","This guy in dating advice posted the lyrics to ‘tell her about it’ by Billy Joel. Like it was good advice. This isn’t good advice. Tell a therapist about it. Let her tell YOU about it. Dont tell her shit. Because truth is a blunt and deadly instrument that cuts deep. Keep it light and fun and be emotionally stable if you wanna keep that girl. Pop songs from the 80’s literally made my personality. Made me think i’m special and I can turn a no into a yes by magic or by willing it or by proving myself. I cant. This song and phil collin songs, and simple minds, and the cure make me feel like this gets me and this is the way. Unfortunately there is no reward for good taste. Just have to eat shit and improve and get it right the NEXT time. I so wish I could have my ex girlfriend kirsten back right now though. And her friends.  Last summer and fall they invited me to play tennis almost every day and since she dumped me in October I have been so depressed. One day turned into a week turned into 6 months. And now im fat and lazy and no confidence. A good mindset and program is like a house of cards or a sand castle. Sucks to see it destroyed and know how hard it was to build and how hard it will be to rebuild. I used to have a great career in baseball until my mom died and i went crazy trying to work everyday afterwards as an only child who just lost his mom and had to put off her funeral until the all star break thinking that the people i worked for would help me and look out for me. They didnt. They started soreading rumors aboit me beinf crazy and i got fired and ruined. That was very hard. Took me to a failed engagement afterwards and another blown opportunity at a college where i had a great job and payed tuition and benefits. Then J got REALLY fat and lonely for a few years before i discovered tennis and this racquet club.   I dont have many passions and I have very little self confidence due to sub standard sexual performance with her and my limited career achievements and where and how I live. I got into great shape and fit in with the beautiful tennis people in the rich part of town until they figured out I was exactly who I am. Now its been six months. She wont ever return an email or a call and in fact im blocked and I wont ever hear from her friends again and she got me kicked out of out tennis club a few months ago. Ive been driving all over town looking for what I had at that tennis club. I’m tired and not making any friends and feeling like she was the best opportunity ive had in my adult life and I blew it and then blew it again by emailing her until she asked me to stop and then j did again and she had me kicked out of the one place we shared. Now i have no place to see her or her friends again and no real hobbies or places i belong or know people. I joined other tennis clubs but they are not at all the same. I am going to go back to nursing school soon.

39,muavrx,1618867271,"My options are dwindling down. I just don't think I can do the OLD thing again, but IDK how else to meet someone.","I tried OLD a few months back for the 2nd time and, within 2 weeks, ended up deleting it in tears. Not really because I was sad, but because I was SO damn frustrated and discouraged. The men would seem great via text and/or phone conversations and then, when we meet, they lose their damn minds or something. For example, I talked to one guy for a few weeks via text/telephone, and the conversations were great. He was intelligent, kind, and funny. He didn't ask for any nudes or send any unsolicited dick pics 🙄 (It is sad that I even feel the need to mention that, but that is the dating world we live in today, unfortunately). Not once was sex mentioned during any of these conversations, and there was minimal flirting. My profile even stated very clearly... ""If you are only looking for a hook up, you should look elsewhere.""

Anyway, long story short, I met him at his friends' house (wife and husband + another friend). We all sat outside and had a few drinks. I wasn't there 30 min when he invited me to come inside to ""talk,"" as it was kinda cold outside. He led me into a bedroom and starts undressing himself and tries to kiss and undress me. I'm like ""Stop. Stop. This is NOT why I came over here."" He persists and tries to kiss me again, but sees that I'm not having it, and pulls away. I looked at him, obviously disappointed, and said ""Wow. Seriously?""
He didn't say anything, so I said ""I think I should go."" He stays quiet so I just walked out of the room and down the hallway, and then here come condescending remarks from the room, ""I know, I know. ... Im such a piece of shit... yeah, I'm the asshole... I'm so ridiculous... Blah blah blah.. ,"" and I walk outside towards my car and turn to see if he is behind me, but no... He didn't even walk to the door as I left. He just let's me leave, alone. I never heard from him again, (not that I ever wanted to), but you see my point. 

That is just one example of the type of experiences I've had with OLD, and I just don't know if I want to deal with that BS again. I love sex.. and I want it, but I can't just jump into bed with any and every guy I date one time. I have had some one night stands in the past because hey.. you can only be lonely so long before you NEED some type of physical contact, but that seems to be the expectation of MOST every man I have met via OLD. You are a whore if you put out on the first date and they don't respect you... and you are a prude and a bitch if you don't put out on the first date. I feel like I just can't win either way. Ugh.. I'm getting off topic. Sorry... 

So someone asked me the other day, ""Are you actively looking?"" I had to say no because, how the hell do you ""look"" for someone today if not online? Even Pre-COVID, the options are pretty limited. I work full time and have two side jobs doing home health, so I have no idea where or how I could possibly meet anyone in a spontaneous, natural way. I am content being single. I have a good career. My children are now 19 &amp; 20. I have an amazing family. But I do want to find love again at some point. I just fear that my options for finding that someone are running out. So that's all, I guess. I can't be the only one that feels this way, surely. Thanks for listening to me whine and complain.

He accidentally hit a 6 instead of a 9 on his Match profile, and it wouldn’t let him correct it. And I believe him.

54,mujug2,1618898005,I Hate Everything,"...about online relationships.

First, there are too many options.  Normally, that is a good thing, but most of them cost a serious amount of money with no workable free trial period or something that doesn't require access to my credit card.  Sure, I can check online reviews, but a LOT of those are paid for by the company and therefore unreliable.  The rest are written by hopeless romantics who are riding high on the honeymoon period of a relationship they finally managed to get after YEARS of acrively searching.  I've tried asking people in person, but the best and most common response I get is, ""I dunno,"" accompanied by a shrug of the shoulders.

Then, once you find a place, it's IMPOSSIBLE to make a meaningful connection.  Every physical woman I've talked to says they have to dig through a veritable mountain of garbage people only to find that nearly every ""single"" guy is either hopelessly hung up on his ex or just wants sex (or both).  And for us men, it's even worse!  You have to reach out to LITERALLY HUNDREDS of women to even have a chance of a response and most of the women that reply get bored easily and lose interest if they aren't being love-bombed, ESPECIALLY THE WOMEN WHO SAY THEY DON'T WANT TO BE LOVE-BOMBED.

Sure, I could keep trying and be patient, but that costs money, a LOT more for men than for women, by the way, as much as 5 times what women are charged.  If I wanted to pay through the nose to get a woman's attention, I'D HIRE A PROSTITUTE!

The ""free"" ones are either a scam or Reddit, which is so beseeched by trolls as to be completely unworthy of even the most desperate lounge lizard in search of a one-night stand.

64,mv3j72,1618962056,So much for dating an older man,"After being divorced and coming out of a long term relationship for 13 years, I met a guy summer last year on OLD. The connection was instant and we had about 3 to 4 dates, shared a lot of kisses (no sex) and alot of messaging and video calls but we never visited each other's home. I really liked him but some things just didn't sit well with me. 

He has his own company and would work the whole morning or pretty much the whole day. If he wasn't working, he would be spending time with his mum, sister, or meeting up with a friend in the day which never bodered me but, all I was left with were little chit chats. He was also into playing guiter/his music in the evenings while having his beer, and he over did the whole ""enjoying life more and putting myself first"". Meanwhile, I have a 7yr old, studying full time at uni and on clinical placement but I always made time.

When we met, he mentioned that he and his ex girlfriend broke up because she was ""controlling"", she felt unappreciated because he didn't prioritise her and that she threw tantrums everytime she sends him a message and he didn't reply on time, therefore he doesn't want it to be a problem when he does not reply to messages on time. I thought fair enough,  we both have lives to live, but then he overdid it. His warning also made me supper careful about expressing how disrespectful I found this behaviour when he later started doing it to me, cos I didn't want to sound like a nag or be like his ex (smart move on his part). 

With me: he blew hot and cold, had on a few occasions not reply to messages for over 8 hours despite being online,  and a couple of other funny things he did like getting super defensive when I saw his profile after we had both established that we were only talking to each other. A pushback from me in response to some of those behaviours eg me ignoring his messages for hours with no sensible excuse afterwards got him in his feelings and we just decided to stay ""friends"", but even that didn't go well as he would make promises/plans to meet up for coffee but wouldn't follow through or acknowledge it at all. So, I ended up walking away/cutting ties for a few month's. 

We had such a great connection, he was quite lovely and we found each other incredibly attractive, but I sensed he was prideful and those behaviours were a manipulative way of gaining control. He once jokingly mentioned that I look like I have a lot of options and he would have found it hard to think I was single if not for OLD. He also mentioned that I had no idea how much he liked me but he would rather make sure I don't get it way in my head or get  too comfortable (not sure where all that came from). 
My question is, was I fair in abruptly cutting ties? Was I overreacting or is this what dating is like this days? I feel rusty getting back out after all this years and it feels tiring already. 

He is 42 and I am 32 so I don't know if age had anything to do with it? I've always had a personal preference for slightly older men because I find thier emotional maturity and intellect most compatible with mine but I won't lie, this experience has had me thinking otherwise.

On January (the third time I saw him) he invited me to a house he has out of my city (4 hours from here). We stayed there 3 days and he tried to have sex with me and I told him that if I have sex with someone I don’t want it to be something casual, that I just want to have sex with someone if we’re both willing to have a relationship. He understood and we didn’t have sex in that ocassion. Next time I saw him we had sex (I started to like him since that day) and we talked about what I told him the other day, he told me that he wanted to know me better and go out with me (he basically accepted what I told him that I wanted) but he also told me he usually takes this things slow.

So a month later (Feb 19) he traveled to one of his hotels that is in the middle of the jungle, he stayed there for 2 weeks. Since he came back from there we’ve been seeing each other often, he has introduced me to some of his friends. I started to trust him even though on the inside I always had insecurities about him having sex with other girls (just because I don’t know him well and bc he’s impulsive and always moving from one place to another). He told me he wanted to earn my trust. So I decided to trust him and to not speculate over things I can’t control or find out. I respected his space, he respected mine and everything was going fine.

So yesterday I decided to log into a fake account I have with some friends on ig and that I haven’t used in a while (bc for some reason it gives me anxiety). I follow random girls in that account and I saw a story of a girl that follows him on ig (he follows her back). I decided to see her profile out of curiosity and she has a lot of pictures in the same city where his hotel is located (seems like she lives there). So in her highlight stories she has one with the name of this place and I started watching all the stories and found out she was in his hotel and in other story I saw his car on the back (according to the date it was 6-7 weeks ago, the same weeks he was there). 

Right now he’s in another city for work and he has to go to that hotel within the next days. I told him to call me because I wanted to talk to him. When he called me I sent him her profile asking who she was, at first he was confused, but then he told me she was a girl he met there (I think he had already met her before). I asked him if he had sex with her he said no at first. Then I sent him the stories and asked him if she was with her the last time he went there and he said yes, but he was with his other friends too (friends that work and live there). He asked me if she was my friend, I said yes and that if he had something with her I rather hear it from him because I was going to ask her anyways. He accepted it. Long story  short, he apologized for what he did, he told me he didn’t like her, that he likes me and wants to have something serious with me that I’m an incredible girl and that I don’t deserve what he did to me. He said that he acted like an “animal” (that’s the word he uses and I think it describes him well bc he’s very impulsive in many ways). I told him that I always respected him and I was very clear about what I wanted and expected from him (respect/ exclusivity) and that I know my worth and I don’t deserve this at all. That he lost an “incredible and gorgeous girl” just because he decided to have sex with a girl he says he doesn’t even like. He told me that he did that when we started dating (it happened a month after we had sex for the first time), that he didn’t think about it and that after he came back from there we have been talking and going out more, so he didn’t think he was doing something wrong because he was single (we’re still single but I always talked about exclusivity and respect). Finally I told him that if he did that one time he will do it again, that I deserve better and that I don’t want to keep seeing him. He accepted it, apologized again and told me he expects to see me when he comes back, just to talk. 

I like him, I have feelings for him but there are also things I don’t like about him. Because of the pandemic is hard to date other guys . I’ve been single for 5 years so right now I rather just date one guy or have a relationship with someone.

What do you guys think about this? I feel bad but at the same time I know I acted right all this months so I shouldn’t feel this way. He had sex with that girl when we started dating, do you consider that as cheating/betraying? Would you forgive him? Should I accept talking to him in person when he comes back? I just want to hear some opinions. Thank you for your time.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/mv4dmp/should_i_23_forgive_him_43_or_move_on/

She is really sweet, we get along great. We text a little Sunday, meet for dinner Monday. Afterward she discloses to me she has genital herpes. 

I feel so sick about this whole situation. I’m not someone who has sex early in a relationship, so it wouldn’t be any issue whatsoever for a while. But then it becomes an issue. From what I read, it’s really not that bad of a condition and is mostly controllable. Fairly low risk of getting it if you take precautions. It’s more the stigma of it, where to a lot of people you become a pariah.  So it seems like it’s not so bad actually getting it, it’s bad because other people think it's so bad.  But, the fact is people are afraid of it and it seriously impairs a person's ability to find relationships.  

I don’t know what to do. I’ve had some weird and downright bad experiences since I started dating, but this is honestly breaking my heart. Not because I’m magically in love with this woman I barely know, but because she was so scared to tell me. She tried to be strong and poised when she told me, but I know she feels so dirty and worthless and she’s terrified she’ll be alone her whole life now because of one rebound relationship.

The weird interrogation after a joke that they didn't get was so strange. I assumed that if I wasn't funny that people would recognize it as a joke... albit an unfunny one. I found it fascinating, I had never thought it possible.


Both came across as a bit tense and aggressive but to be honest most women do at first til they trust you although not to this extent. But the complete dead pannedness was really strange.

I'm nearing the end of a marathon divorce proceeding, she's been a single mother for several years. We dated until early December, with her breaking it off (sort of) because my life situation as a dad with placement of his kids, and a marathon divorce proceeding, made her feel I wasn't ready. We still kept in touch though, we either of us initiating text conversations. In mid-March, we went on our first date together in months, and decided we'd give things another go.

Last Wednesday, she revealed to me by phone that she contracted herpes 2 years ago from a lying boyfriend, but has not had a flare up since. She was embarrassed and her voice trembled as she told me. I think she was afraid I'd run off, but I have feelings for her and the thought didn't cross my mind.  I told her I think highly of her and it would take more than something like this to scare me off. I'd just have to be careful when we have sex. It felt like a big step for her to tell me this, honestly. She's quite private and reserved.

This past weekend, she came to my place (albeit an hour or so late), we went to dinner (my treat), came back here and we had a blast. We made martinis, drank wine, played 3 games of pool with trash talk and kissing, before concluding with a great finish in bed (no intercourse, just foreplay). Here's the deal: I feel like I nice-guy'd myself into the lower-hand in the relationship and killed some attraction between Saturday and tonight.

First off, before she arrived, I asked what she was in the mood for, for food. Second, I got her a card congratulating her on her new house she got in February--writing I'm here if she needs any advice or help, as someone who has been a homeowner for a long time. Third, I lost to her in pool. Fourth, when we kissed goodbye next morning, I told her she's amazing. Fifth, I texted her to make sure she got home alright a couple of hours later (her drive is about 25 min). What troubles me is, Sunday night, Monday and today, I was the one to initiate the text conversations. I heard nothing from her Tuesday after I posted on FB a video of my son's complete game in his first ever LL start. I know she was on FB a few times after the post went up. Not a ""like"" or a text.

I feel great when I’m with him- at peace, loved, happy. But when I’m not with him, the relationship feels like a lot of work. 

10 months ago, I was over 1.5 years out from filing for divorce, the pandemic looked almost over, and life felt full and joyful. Now, I’m “balancing” being a mom/teacher/daycare with a new, intense job. My kiddo (7 yo) is struggling with clinical anxiety. My ex is stirring up trouble and using our daughter as a pawn.  I feel like I’m out of energy long before I get to being part of a relationship, let alone doing any of the hobbies (or chores) that make life so much more livable. I do see a therapist, but need to find a better fit. 

Part of me wants to batten down the hatches, dump the guy, and just focus on kiddo, work, and self. But every time I make up my mind to break it off, another part of me points to the value and love and support in this relationship, an end to the pandemic in sight, and my tendency to push people away when I need them most. And another part of me is whispering that I stayed in my last (violently abusive) relationship for at least 18 years too long and I’m doing the same thing here, that I don’t need people, and that life is safe and sane and secure only when it’s just my daughter and me.

During a brief period i activated Tinder earlier this year, around January IIRC.  I only made one match, but i was optimistic about them.  Male, not precisely my type - short hair while i prefer long, only a couple tattoos, but a decent punk-light aesthetic and a great smile and charisma, artist and teacher while i prefer STEM types, openly spiritual while i was raised without religion so i don't grok it very well. Nothing major, a few areas of concern but i figured the things we had in common - love of neonorse music, nerdy subcultures, etc, were enough to at least get a conversation going.  And we did chat for about 2 weeks, during which time we moved from Tinder to text, but being unvaccinated, we couldn't meet in person.  So i texted him after about 3 weeks of increasingly tepid texts, i hope respectfully, ""I think you're interesting and we have a ton in common, but i'm not feeling a spark.  Maybe post lockdown this might have legs, but text might not be the best medium to get to know each other."" And he replied, ""Ok cool.  Take care.""

So, in 12 days i WILL be fully antibodied up, and if he is too, we could meet in person.  If you were him and received a text with an invite to hang out in person because now it's safe, would you be offended or hurt or annoyed? I fully accept his right to say no, i'm more worried that extending the invite to begin with, would be unacceptable.

99,mw7n5p,1619106297,Scared as hell,"I'm really struggling with dating at this age. My first relation was when I was 18 and the guy knocked up another girl. I went on a hiatus and met someone when I was 40. I didn't plan it but I fell in love. We were together for a year but my own insecurities got in the way, we struggled for another 6 months until we called it quits. 2 years later I found a very generous and sweet man. We clicked well and had amazing sexual chemistry. But he had to leave Singapore for good because his company was moving elsewhere. So we had to break up after 6 months. Last week I met a man via a dating app and we were talking everyday for a week until he stopped chatting a day before our first date. I sent messages through outthe day, he read them but did not reply. So before I went to sleep, I sent another message just to check if he was still interested and he got all defensive. So I just cancelled the date and told him I don't want to talk anymore.

Sometimes I feel that I will never be ready for a relationship. I'm a lady in her 40s with the emotional maturity of a 20 yr old. It's frustrating.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/mw7n5p/scared_as_hell/
