It hurts me knowing that I've hurt them; I don't want to hurt anyone. The one girl I was talking to was upset that I was still kinda talking with other women and exploring options, even though we've only been talking for a week or two‚Äîwe haven't even met in person, and we were only beginning to start to plan a date. She also told me that she felt she was catching feelings for me already.

The girl I'm currently seeing (we've been seeing each other for about a month now. She's also my first kiss and I lost my virginity to her) was actually ok with me continuing going on dates with other women while we kept seeing each other because she understood I haven't had any experience. But this fell through when she asked me to be exclusive with her not long into that (didn't go on any other dates in that period). I agreed being exclusive with her because I do really enjoy talking and being with her. However, it's tough because deep down I feel that I can't possibly know just yet if someone is right for me because of my inexperience, and I'm terrified of hurting her. She just told me recently that she felt she was falling for me. 

There is another girl (right before I decided to try being exclusive with the current girl) that I started talking to that I was quite interested in as well, but we won't get the chance to meet and of course I have no idea if I'm making the right decision or not. I'm kinda worried about it. 

Typing this out I just feel like a pos because idk what I want and I don't even know if I'll ever reciprocate feelings toward the women I see. I'm all over the place right now and I don't know what to do or how to feel. On one hand, I'm proud of myself for finally breaking out of my shell and doing these things; on the other, it hurts because I can't believe how easy it is for me to hurt others. 

Should I just accept that I'm going to hurt some people along the way of finding the right girl? Or am I doing something wrong? This is quite the discombobulated ramble, but I just wanna see if anyone has any thoughts/experience with what I'm currently going through.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rv9y8o/finally_starting_to_date_and_connect_with_women/
1,rva060,1641238680,Extremely short guy observations,"So im a short guy. (5'3) 
This isnt gonna be a post where i ask for advice directly, but more where i just state my observations.  Id like to see what you people think. After scouring the internet, talking to other guys, making observation in real life, this is what i noticed about guys my height who are in relationships.

- Many usually significantly dropped there standards physically and mentally. When you have a smaller pool, you take what you get. That means sacrificing some personal ideals and physical attraction. I did this and wasnt really happy in the end. Neither were the guys in question. Again this is based off my perceived observation so they could be happy.

Of those who kept some standards 

-Picture a guy my height, highly charasatic and toned. Decent face. Extreme levels of social proof. This guy can randomly break into dance in the middle of a meeting and 20 other ppl from another department would come to cheer him on (this actually happened). Can come off slightly intimidating despite his height. Based off my perception, this guy had an okay dating life. He was not even that wealthy either

-They guy who got zero matches on any dating site but then found an unorthodox unknown niche where they were somehow able to get a date a month and struck gold. (got lucky)

-Men who looked beyond the US for a wife and expanded their search worldwide. Usually having to give up on the western thinking of love. Stability/resources/family ties. Idk how these guys are. They are usually wealthy

-the lengthener. This guy saved up 100k plus or had rich parents and they just increased their height using surgery. Depending on starting height, most ended up having more relationships but i dont have enough info on there full outcomes

This is all based on my observations.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rva060/extremely_short_guy_observations/

Need some opinions here, each one is valued greatly.

I've been dating this girl for about 10 months now, and it's been nothing but spectacular. We love being around each other and she already wants to marry me, and I feel the same. (2 year rule) Soon we're moving in together in a few months, which is scary in itself, but shows her dedication to the relationship.

All that being said, I heard she cheated on her ex, and I confirmed it. They were living together for about a year, and things went south, she moved out but they were still together from what I could gather. While she was moved out there was a guy she was sleeping around with and I think that sparked them breaking up for real.

We're definitely in love, but I still fear the worst at times. She hasn't told me directly about what happened, but to be fair I haven't really asked.

I need some help getting info from her, I just don't know what questions to ask without it being uncomfortable. Without saying, did you cheat on your ex.

Any ideas on how I could bring this up and get some honesty from her would be greatly appreciated. She's never lied to me in the past and has shown me texts from dudes that hit her up and blocked their number on the spot.

(side note to set the tone, I met one of her exes at a function and told her it made me insanely uncomfortable, which she instantly cut ties with him on the spot and we haven't heard from him since)

13,rvbgh5,1641242450,working on your issues vs having someone support you while you work on yourself?,"which is better? and dating for me is dating with the goal of marriage. there is no casual dating neither where I live, nor with the culture or the mindset I've been brought up with. so that's something to keep in mind.

recently I've realized there's a lot of things I need to work on within myself. I have had impactful years through my teenage to my early 20s. and because I've never got love from my family, I'm always looking for that in other people. Even little bit of love from others make me jump mountains for them. I have difficulty establishing boundaries. I becomes too clingy and expect atleast half reciprocation of that which is still abnormal. and when I don't get that since I'm also an overtly sensitive person I just cut myself off from everyone. I've done that in relationships before. I was just listening to this psychologist explain enmeshment and he said ""I'll give you my hand, not my life."" and that sparked something in my mind because that's exactly the opposite of what I always do!

I'm identifying many of these things now. and that this is not healthy. and I need to work on these. should I work on them and only think of dating someone after I've (hopefully) successfully got over these issues? or should I look for someone who understands me and is willing to let me work on myself while loving me in the process? is that unrealistically romantic?

I realize everyone deserves an emotionally balanced and healthy partner. and I'm not that so I haven't even given myself an opportunity to ever think of being with someone for almost a year. but then sometimes I think what if working on these issues takes me too many years and what if it's too late before I realize?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rvbgh5/working_on_your_issues_vs_having_someone_support/

But...

I went to a family run Italian restaurant today, and was served by the most beautiful woman I have ever met in my life. And, she was super chilled and easy to talk to...
I was going to leave with my friend after eating/paying, but come back in by myself straight away, and ask her for her number.. but the skeptical thoughts kicked in... And didn't want to be too forward either.. so while paying, I asked for her name, said mine, and I just said ""pleasure to meet you"" she smiled and I forget what she said, which she seemed genuine over.

So my plan now is to go the same day but next week, at the same time, but with my parents (they do need to go, they'd love the food) and to show I am family orientated too (I'm Greek), which I am, and a decent man, not a ""player"" and to basically do my original plan from today, but after that meal.

Out of the blue in December she texts me basically fishing for a date. I agreed to text her when are both back in town from the holidays.

Fairly recently and definitely happily single. It was night and dark and I was walking to the dancefloor and this girl took me away from my friends and confided she had seen me and thought I looked beautiful (as a man, that was a rare one to hear). Alas I was fairly intrigued as she had that look I like and was actually really cool once we started chatting and things were grooving. She was staring at me a lot and it was nice to bounce off someone so easily, then she sort of looked down and was like ""I have a boyfriend by the way.."" and I immediately was take aback. I told her straight that she then shouldn't have gone so hard on me like it was some love at first sight BS and she was apologetic but said she couldn't help it and her relationship was going downhill and she wanted out. I said I was minding my own business with my friends and didn't need this sort of drama. I gave her some advice about how she needs to make the decision for her and her bf to save them both years of their lives not being in a crap relationship based on my recent experiences (she is a couple years younger), regardless of me and my existence, and she was clearly in need of that sort of insight and was quite grateful. She said she wouldn't cheat on him but yea she just liked me. At the time it felt right to leave here there and move on, because new life new me, not here to fuck up relationships, but now today I haven't been able to get her out of my mind! Saw her on the dancefloor the next day and we had a little hug and like ""So about last night.."" chat and laugh but yea now it's done forevs

We clicked, but also, it's the right decision to just move the fak on right? Adding her on social media and doing all that jazz is just a waste of time and kinda sad/pathetic because I'm better than that? 

Part of the problem is after that it kinda got to me and so I wasn't enthusiastic to properly meet people much thereafter even though I was meeting other girls I wasn't really interested, so I ended up getting no action at the party which is rare, or atleast a prospective date ya know, and I think it sort of dulled my ego lol.

30,rvd9hf,1641247211,‚ÄúAll men cheat‚Äù. What is your viewpoint on this?,I hear this so often from women. Is this what I should believe as well?,dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rvd9hf/all_men_cheat_what_is_your_viewpoint_on_this/
31,rvda6z,1641247256,25M and perpetually single (VENT),"Hey there. To start with, I wanna say that I don't expect much response since this reddit is full of guys like me bellyaching about their woes, perceived or actual, but I've been keeping this buried for a long time and I need to spew my proverbial sewage. Also, I understand that some of my views could be interpreted as ""extreme"" but in all honesty, everything I believe has to do with what I have experienced. Specifically, I don't believe for a second bullshit like ""looks don't matter that much to women"". Women are human beings and like all human beings, they are attracted, on average, to specific qualities in men. 

Before saying more, I also want to acknowledge that I haven't so far done everything in my power to improve my situation: I truly believe that no guy has a right to complain about his looks or not being able to date women until he reaches a 10-15% body fat percentage. In my experience at least, being not just fit but actually muscular is the minimum requirement to be considered dateable or attractive in any way if you don't have any redeeming features. As in, with everything else being average (height, face, eyes, hair color/style etc.), being fit is the minimum threshold. 

And from the above stems perhaps my romantically shit relationship with women, or at least that's what I understand.: I have zero problems socialising, having fun or connecting with women. I have several female friends (more than 3, I think) with whom I can open up and they likewise open up to me about literally anything and everything. Just 3 days ago, I was talking and joking with a flight attendant for almost 30 minutes, then struck up a chat with a couple of girls on the bus home. So, no, I am not a socially awkward basement dweller.

 I have a Masters degree, a job, hobbies, friends, I travel, I play music, but that seems to be irrelevant to women I meet because obviously they can throw a rock and hit 20 guys that have that. I am kind, giving, open, funny and very intelligent, and although I can sometimes be opinionated to an extent about subjects I like or find interesting, I feel that makes me a more interesting person to have a conversation with. 

To cut to the chase: I am not an attractive guy. I have no jawline, I wear glasses, my eyes are asymmetrical (one eye has a larger angle compared to the other, making me look almost chinese???), I am below the average height that women want (I am 6'/5'11"" and judging from the guys I see most women are with, the average is 6'1"").I don't mean to say that women in general don't date shorter guys, just that taller guys ""stand out"" to women, for whatever reason.  I have a beard but it's weirdly shaped (like Keanu Reeves's, but I obviously don't look nearly that good).And obviously, I am not fit. I am at around 30% body fat and what you'd call ""skinnyfat"" because I let myself go to focus on getting my Master's and doing other stuff at the same time.  Some of my redeeming features are my hair (getting a haircut didn't help :) ) and my smile, but that's about it. 

Finishing up, to keep this a bit readable and not a book chapter: I have never had an actual girlfriend and I am a virgin. I have approached a lot of girls, have felt connections to many of those, but no one wanted anything to do with me. I have had a chance to be with 2 girls but I wasn't attracted to one and the other has mental problems she needed to work on. 

So, given the above, how do I break the vicious cycle? Apart from not being fit (which I am working on since September), what am I doing wrong, what could I do better? How do I become confident in myself since basically the entire female gender has decided I shouldn't even bother trying?  To be honest, if getting fit doesn't work, I am seriously considering surgery to fix my eye and jawline...Unless I don't manage to save up the money, in which case I'll just be with prostitutes for the rest of my life. 

TL;DR: Never had a girlfriend. Try to convince me that my looks aren't the reason.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rvda6z/25m_and_perpetually_single_vent/

33,rvdgin,1641247705,Are we all sociopaths?,"  We are with someone and happy.  They are the love of your life.  But you can't put our finger on it, but you feel there is something missing.  you communicate very well,  Sex life is great!  Maybe we have children.  life is good  That feeling that something is missing keeps eating away at you.   You don't talk to family or friends because you don't want them to know or worry.  You don't want to worry at first you husband, wife, girlfriend or boyfriend.  So you turn to someone at work, church maybe a neighbor.  It develops into a friendship.  It is a secret relationship.  You feel guilty.  Instead of doing the right thing and ended it and talking to your significant other.  You begin to get angry at your significant other.  Why should you give up this person because he or she makes you feel better they are some one you can talk to with no fear.  So to justify this growing emotional affair.  You start finding reasons. Let say leaving the toilet seat up or down for argument sake.  You confide in your new friend.  They are so supportive, nurturing and you begin to feel more resentful of your significant other.  A growing hatred because your talks with new friend make your feelings mean something.  As you with draw from Significant other.  Sex gets less and less you you are distracted by the text chain with your friend.  You begin avoiding your significant other.  Your friend is feeding your anger.  Starts say how beautiful or hansom you are.  If you were your significant other.  He or she would worship you.  At this time Your Significant other.  See you pulling away.  Dose everything in their power to show you how much they love you.  They bring you flowers,  they help more around the house,  They make sure to tell you they love you every day.  By now you are so invested into the emotional bond with your friend you despise the significant other for making you feel guilty.  Anger is full blown because how they make you feel.  Your friend only fans the anger telling you for the first time that they love you.  That is the time you convince yourself that you are also in love with him or her.  You are riding the high on the attention you have received from them.   Angering yourself.  Because it doesn't seem your significant other doesn't love you any more.  spite all the things he or she is doing for you to show you they love you.  One day shortly after.  Your significant other goes above and beyond.  You come home to find the kids are at your mothers.  That he or she made a candle light dinner.  You see all your favorite foods.  A good wine.  All you do is boil inside.  Guilt that has turned to anger long ago screams inside.  After dinner you tall them you need air.  for the first time really hurting them and taking a big bite of their self worth.  All you can thing of is getting to your friend to vent your anger.  You leave and drive straight to your friends home for the first time.  He greets you with a hug.  Maybe your are crying because of the guilt.  He or she holds you.  Which leads to your first kiss.  The electricity is overwhelming.  You vent but the kiss is like a fire.  Things then move so fast.  For the first time you have sex outside of your marriage.  Riding that high on a new found love.  Time gets away from you and you do not go home till after dawn.  On your way home you are so worried about your significant other is going to say.  When you arrive home.  Your once love of your life has been up all night.  From the looks of it they have been crying most of the time.   Maybe from some deep down concern and love you ask what's wrong. They ask are you seeing someone.  You lie and said you went to see a girlfriend and it got late.  so you stayed the night.  You say how sorry you are for not calling to let them know.  They buy it because they do want to believe in you.  But you continue to distant yourself.  get angrier because you think they are not fighting hard enough for you.  Egged on by your now boyfriend or girlfriend.  You haven't had sex with significant other now for months.  Haven't told them how you love them for almost as long.  Now they have withdraw as their self worth has now been crushed.  But now they are out of sight and you have no empathy as you ride the new love and support you get from you boy or girlfriend. Then d-day comes they find out.  Their self worth and their trust in anything has been stolen.  As you have convinced your self they were dead to you.  They now are dead inside.  With out a word you leave.  Because it is easier then dealing with the pain you have cause your love of your life.  Knowing nothing will be the same.  You run to the thing that makes you feel good now.  Time passes.  Maybe again those feeling there is something missing find their way back.  You are lonely because your boyfriend or girlfriend now spouse is distancing from you.  D-day happens.  All you can do is think you deserve all you get for your actions.  You reach out to the once love of your life.  To apologize to make it all up to them?  But all you find is an empty husk of the person you knew.  Your heart finally breaks.  We can say we forgive ourselves.  But do we really.  The more you try to make them feel they are not alone.  The more the blades that first cut them sink deeper.  They love you so much.  Hating you for it.  The guilt is now real for you.  The love you still have.  Those feelings buried to justify the illusion that drove you away.  Now haunt your soul.  You realize how much you lost and stole.  It will never be the same.  For what because a toilet seat was forgotten to be lifted or put down?  Why cant we see the conditioning of wanting more has killed us.  Because we close our eyes to what is in front of us, ""Everything"".  Are we truly sociopaths?  That will kill all that is precious to us.  For something shiny.  It has been 22 years.  I still question my self worth.  Question my faith in people.  I still haven't found someone to fill the hole that was left when my happy life and my self worth was stolen.

We seemed to have great chemistry and always laughing when we conversed. I asked her out after meeting her a few times and we went on 5 dates. We always laughed and had great times so I thought it was going great, although I thought she wasn't initiating things as much. 

Yesterday, during our date, she told me that she ""likes me and finds me attractive, but her intuition says no"" - I'm so confused what this means. She also mentioned how if things didn't work out, she'd be sad to lose me as a friend. It surprised me because we'd kissed for the first time the date before and it felt amazing. I didn't really try to argue with her as I didn't think I could change her mind - she seemed like she'd thought about this a lot. I accepted it as is and walked her to her car and we just had regular conversation.

I'm sad. I still have feelings for her. I wish I could change her mind or nudge her to give me another chance, but I don't want to challenge her or come off as needy.

Today, I'm going to meet with the group to do the hobby and she's gonna be there. She said she really wants us to be friends, but I'm not sure if I have the mental capability to act as if nothing happened between us.

39,rvdnre,1641248224,After 10 Years - A Swedish Old Friend Wants to be More Than a Friend --,"Back in high school (freshman) I had this Swedish friend. I admit that she was my first crush ever and I was too shy to tell her that. She was also shy and we didn't really talk much until suddenly she had to get back to Sweden and we started texting afterwards. We texted for a couple of months, and then it just faded away, and we stopped texting (Life, you know).

Fast forward almost 10 years (I'm a second-year grad student now), we reconnected again. I remember that I posted a meme on the beginning of 2021 where it said (Does anyone else feel troubled by the fact that the name of next year is literally 2020 won?) and she replied to my story and then we started texting again.

We texted, factimed, called each other multiple times. This made our relationship stronger than ever, and I admit that I started to like her again, and I told her jokingly that she was my first crush ever. She admitted that she likes me too and would love to see how things might turn out. 

With that said, I am not a big fan of long-distance relationships, and I made her aware of that. So we decided to keep everything normal until we get the chance to meet each other (and see what might happen afterward). This created many problems recently since she started getting jealous once she knew that I was going out on dates with different girls. However, I continued to remind her that we are not in a relationship, and this should not bother her. She's mature enough to admit that she's wrong and told me she wishes to meet me one day.

I currently have a chance to visit her in Sweden (Indeed I'm planning to go there within two weeks - unless of course, covid ruined my plan. Yes, I'm vaccinated, and I recently got the booster). 

She got very excited once I told her about this and she even told her mom since her mom also knows me and likes me. Indeed, her mom encouraged us to meet and stated that she would help us with everything. 

This girl is beautiful, smart and a little bit conservative when it comes to dating cuz she had a terrible relationship with her dad (he divorced her mom and came back to the US and cut all contact with his family) So she doesn't want to have a similar experience. She's also planning to get back to the US once she gets her degree. However, I'm scared of meeting her.

On the one hand, I'm excited to see her and can't wait to start this adventure. On the other hand, I'm afraid we might not like each other in person (or she might not like me or I might not like her, etc..). I'm also scared that once I get there then our relationship will develop into a very serious stage (and I'm a little bit scared about commitment since I've been single for 4 years and I - (know this might sound stupid) put really high standards for the next girl I want to date cuz I worked so hard on myself and I won't be willing to settle for less than what I deserve.

Now, I don't know what to do. Should I give it a chance and visit her? Play it cool and see what might happen? Or Forget about it and move on?

Tldr: Old Swedish friend wants to be more than a friend and i'm scared of commitment.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rvdnre/after_10_years_a_swedish_old_friend_wants_to_be/

41,rvdvxe,1641248809,Friend has left me very confused,"Over the last twoish years, I (25M) became very close with a friend of mine (25F). We were introduced to each other through a mutual friend who was sort of shipping us. Our relationship became very deep very rapidly. We met just before Covid, but since it hit our communication became online for the most part.  It's a sort of difficult relationship to describe - we're very emotionally intimate, if that makes sense. Not in a way I've ever been, even with my closest friends. We message each other daily, and often talk on the phone for hours. At the same time, we have spats not infrequently, maybe because we have that level of connection. But I think I'm the closest person in her life, and she in mine.


She moved out a couple of months ago, and since then I've been spending nights over at her place a couple of times a month. At this point the relationship also became somewhat physically intimate, and it's at this point that I began to realize I have feelings for her. She would ask me to lay in her lap and she would play with my hair, she would cuddle and put her limbs on me, or spoon me when we shared a bed together, and on NYE's she put her leg on top of me and I began feeling her up a bit, and she got closer to my face as though she was expecting a kiss. We were both drunk, though, so I didn't do anything further, and she eventually moved away and said something along the lines of (I think) ""this won't end well."" I was pretty drunk and don't remember exactly.


The next day, like an idiot, I told her my feelings for her (in a not opportune moment, when things were sort of tense.) She rejected me, saying she makes a decision on compatibility with someone pretty early on, and once she decides that she doesn't really move them from that category. She apparently decided within a year that she didn't want that with me (so she had considered it before I'd honestly considered the possibility, actually), and that she doesn't think things would work out. She noticed somewhat recently that I might be catching feelings, but she said that I'm too ""complicated"" and she wants something simpler. It might also be that she's not impressed with where I'm at in life relative to her (she makes much more money than me and is more independent), but she doesn't want to say it for the sake of my feelings.  She also sort of phrased things as though it was me initiating the physical intimacy, which she shouldn't have indulged but did, when from my perspective it had seemed mutual. I can't help but feel that we have a chemistry which is undeniable, but that she was trying to convince herself we didn't.


I'm just very confused at the moment, and really beating myself up. Did I destroy my chance at a relationship with her? Can it be salvaged? Did I misinterpret things, and never have a chance at all?  Was she just leading me on, intentionally or otherwise? (I really don't think it was intentional.) I know that I should have let things develop organically as opposed to putting my feelings out there, but I couldn't help myself in the moment.


And how should I proceed? I really don't know. Part of me knows that it would be better to just not bring this up again, and leave things be, give her her space, and essentially just go back to being ""friends."" But part of me wants to ""confront"" her about what has happened up to now and confirm that it wasn't all in my imagination, that we had a chemistry, and she was alluding to something more.


There's also a part of me that wants to be clear that I can't continue with this level of emotional intimacy, and if she wants to just be friends it can't be this sort of ""special"" friendship. But part of me feels guilty, as though I'm guilt-tripping her into choosing a relationship to continue our friendship, or that I might make her think that the only reason we became friends is because I wanted to get with her (which is definitely not the case.)


tl;dr, over the last two years, became very emotionally intimate, very quickly with a new friend, things were progressing to physical intimacy, put my feelings out there and she rejected me.

We have pretty similar personalities, clicked quite easily and she's basically exactly the type of person I want to have as a partner. A few days back she revealed to me that she has bipolar disorder. She told me that she takes medication for it and that it's totally under control. I've never really noticed any symptoms (other than rapid speech) of bipolar disorder in her so far, and she does really seem to have it under her control. She never misses her medications, follows a strict sleeping routine and diet, and exercises consistently. She also seems to be doing really well in life in general - graduated from a tier 1 college, has an amazing social life with a lot of really close friends, has had stable jobs and is currently working at a pretty reputed company. She's just really perfect and I'm really beginning to like her more and more with every passing date, but at the same time I'm just super confused if I should get serious about her because I've been doing a lot of research on bipolar disorder and from what I've read it seems to be extremely challenging to have a partner who suffers from it. I really respect and admire how she has been actively handling it, but at the same time I'm very scared about what could happen if it somehow goes out of control at some point. I've read statistics of how most relationships/marriages  involving people with bipolar disorder tend to fail and this really scares me. At the same time, she's such a sweet person with so many amazing qualities and I just can't think of ending things with her just because she has bipolar disorder, especially given how well she seems to be managing it. She's also starting to get pretty serious about me which would make it even harder for me to make such a decision. I'm really torn about what I should be doing at this point.

As I'm going to see her tomorrow, I thought about buying a rose and write a note where I ask her to be my GF (putting it in a small letter). When I meet her, I'll be hiding the rose under my coat and also I'll hide the letter in her trousers' rear pocket. 

I won't give her the rose until we chill in a known park here in the town. After giving her the rose, I'll tell her to check her pocket and she will see the letter and read it. After that I will explain the reasons why I want us to be exclusive and try not to put too much pressure on her obviously.

We were both very drunk and had an absolute blast with new years eve, we greatly enjoyed eachothers company. We went to the park and had drunk sex, it was really bad and I was ashamed of myself and my girl thought I was mad at her for not ''doing it'' properly. Apparently this made her cry after we were both home but I did not realize it hurt her so much because it was not my intention to hurt her. I was ashamed of myself not her. I did not know this in the moment. 

After drunk sex in the park we went back to my house to find her coat she lost in the park, when we were almost home I saw an old friend of mine and he stopped on his bicycle to talk to us (we were on foot) apparently my girl was mad at me without me knowing so she wanted to go look for her coat without me. We were close to my house so I said it was not necessary to bring her to the park, my girl insisted on looking for the coat without me so I let her hop on my friends bike to go the park and find her coat.   

It did not sit well with me so after 5 minutes I went to the park as fast as I can because I didn't sit well with me, I panicked and she reassured me that everything was ok and that I did not need to be here. She gave me a kiss and I went back home.   

12 Hours later I hear that my old friend tried to kiss her and touched her private part, she was really sad that I left her alone in the park even though she wanted me to leave? I feel horrible for 3 days now because I feel like my girl got groped because of me. She just wants to be friends now.

67,rvfaux,1641252593,Online dating: How much / often do you message each other? When do you initiate a date?,"28m here who has never dated before. All my past girlfriends were already friends so I always skipped past the ""dating"" phase so I'm a total newbie in that regard. I'm also introverted, socially awkward and overthink things which complicates things.

I recently decided to put some effort into online dating and so far I have had some success with matches and messaging some ladies. We messaged back and forth several times throughout the day for the past few days and naturally the conversations tend to slow down over time. I'm not sure what the proper etiquette is here since I've been on both ends of ""too clingy"" and ""not responsive enough"" in the past.

Should I always keep the conversation going at all times or take breaks and wait for her to initiate conversations perhaps the following day? It feels slightly unnatural to me since I only message even my best friends once or twice a day or every couple of days. We often leave each other on read (stop replying) and pick up a new topic the next day. Online dating seems different as there is so much competition, you constantly need to be bumping yourself up on their own roster.

Curious to see what others do. What is excessive and what conveys disinterest? Should I just act the same way I message my friends, or is dating etiquette different? How do your conversations flow from the time you match over the next several days / weeks?

We discussed meeting for a 2 date and looked forward to it, when the date ended we had a little kiss. He then messaged the next day, suggesting we meet again in between Christmas and new year, and we organised it. The conversations via text weren‚Äôt as consistent or chatty but they were still daily. Anyway, we met up for a 2nd date, and again, in person he was very attentive, paid for everything and wouldn‚Äôt let me pay, we held hands, and he was constantly touching me, whether it be arm around me or hand on my leg. But, anytime something came up in conversation and I tried suggesting things to do another time, he just nodded his head and didn‚Äôt seem that excited.

71,rvfk1k,1641253284,How do I kickstart our conversation on instagram in a subtle way?,"Hey guys, just getting this off my chest.

Here's a little backstory: 
So a guy I like (m21) is actually a relatively popular youtube guy in my country. I've olny known him from social media; he has an influencer account and a private one on instagram. When I (f21) was back in high school, I always joked around with my friends that ""one day I will make him mine"" but didn't actually mean it, of course.

Fast forward to today, his tiktok landed on my fyp on new years eve. And yes, me and my friend group started stalking him on tiktok immediately, mostly because we forgot he existed and wondered what was he up to. He posts a lot of tiktoks about him being single and really wanting a girl. Being in the festive mood (and drunk), I was dared to follow him on instagram.

Well, why not I've thought. 2021 was coming to an end, it's just a simple follow and at least I could say that I've ""tried"". And I chose to follow his private acc and didn't expect nothing to actually happen. But 20 mins later, he followed me back. And added 3 new pics from archive. I was stunned. High school me was on cloud 9.

So here's my question.
I would love to talk to him, he seems pretty chill. But since I've already followed him, I really don't want to come across as pushy (or an obsessive fan). I don't want to slide into dms or like his old pictures. I actually want him to initiate the conversation, I just don't quite know how. If he initiates I will at least know he wants to talk to me, ya know? Maybe an interesting story he can then comment on, or maybe a nice post? Thirst traps (too obvious maybe)? I really don't know...

What would you do in my situation? How would you get his attention online? Any advice would be kindly appreciated.

73,rvflxq,1641253434,Can I ever find someone being the way I am?,"So before you answer, no this is not a sob story nor am I looking for pity and definitely not playing victim here. I‚Äôm simply sharing my story and seeking answers.

Some background, I‚Äôm a 25M who is physically active and has a good job. I‚Äôm no Jason Mamoa but I think I‚Äôm good looking. I‚Äôm a pathological liar. What I mean by that is, I never present myself to women as who I really am.

Coming from a middle eastern background, I have been a sole target of bullying and racism since I was a child. And with everything that‚Äôs going on in the news about middle eastern or Muslim people being te^^orists made things even worse. 

And to add on to that, (me living in Germany) there was a middle eastern refugee crisis going on where a lot of innocent women were raped on New Years Eve. I can totally understand why women would be scared and I don‚Äôt blame them one bit.

But I can‚Äôt help being middle eastern, I didn‚Äôt choose this race. And I have done nothing wrong. That‚Äôs why I lie about who I am and where I‚Äôm from. Because once I tell people where I‚Äôm really from they run away. 

Earlier this year, my ex dumped me because I pretended to be someone else for 3 months until I confessed to her. She was like:‚ÄùIf only you told me this on the first date, everything would be fine by now.‚Äù And I was like:‚ÄùOh bull‚Ä¶if I told you. You‚Äôd run away just like everyone always does.‚Äù

I know this lying is good for short term stuff, but you can‚Äôt have secrets in a relationship. My best chance is to ask my parents to set me up with one of their friends daughters. So I‚Äôll live a life unhappily married but at least she knows who I am.

75,rvfqso,1641253820,I'm quitting OLD because of self-respect.,"Ok here is my half a year of dating recapped.\[25M\]

Let's start at the beggining. I made some big changes in my life(i made a few posts and comments about it),and when i look back at who i was i get shivers. I was completely unaware of my own existance, sexuality, and lacked any purpose in life and ambition. I was fat, i wasn't grooming myself and so on so on. After about year and a half from my initial decision to change i wasn't even thinking about getting into any kind of relationship, and the only thing i was mentally working on was university and beating depression. But i went on vacation and met this wondeful girl. Of course my lack of experience and self-worth and being unsure about my body because i never had sex ever made her obviously jump on my friends dick later. My fault completely. Heartbreak deserved.

I went on dating apps, tried multiple photos, tried multiple bios. After a couple of months what worked best was one photo and a bio that said: ""I'm moderately cool"" which is quite funny considering how people take their profiles very seriously from what i've read on reddit. I had maybe about 20-30 conversations with random woman, i would consider half of them around my ""league"" for the lack of better word(here is my photo for reference, thats normal going to shop, if i do my hair and beard i look even better: [https://imgur.com/a/iMN3yuJ](https://imgur.com/a/iMN3yuJ)) where i still considered their photos attractive but a ""down to earth"" look where she doesn't look like a doll, around 1/4 had photos in their bikini and felt like i was browsing pornhub not Tinder, and around 1/4 i would consider them unatractive but talked to them out of curiosity if there would be any difference in aproach(there isn't).

I held meaningful conversations with: 0

I met in person with: 4

Tried organically: 2(not included in the 4 above)

So here is the feedback that i got:

\-I'm boring

\-I'm unatractive

I got told by my second crush from irl that she likes me very much but to her i'm unatractive and she prefers my tall muscular friend with tatoos, i've been told i'm boring, and that i have a boring life. Also i've been stood up multiple times, sometimes hours before the planned meeting for reasons like: ""i have a lot of studying"".

I'm sorry but how am i supposed to have any kind of respect for myself and be treated like that and still do it again and waste my free time just to be walked on constantly with a smile on my face? I am not a perfect person by any means and i'm not looking for perfection.

Meanwhile i would say 90% of the woman i was talking to when asked about hobbies and interests would list eating food, watching movies, traveling, some kind of physical activity. Really? I definetely not like eating food, watching movies and traveling. EVERYBODY LIKES THAT. I can get down on PE because there are many forms of doing that and it takes a skill to do right and not everybody does it. Every time i read that: ""i've been to Italy this summer"", or ""i love sushi"" my eyes just begin to roll. Meanwhile i learn guitar and even composed some of my own riffs, i read books(not only sci-fi but i'm also interested in cosmos in general), i play video games , i lift ,i'm doing a degree in IT while also working full time and i love cooking and i can surely say i cook better than my own mother and i'm called boring by those girls that are as generic as they can get?

I honestly can't believe that until just a few weeks ago i faulted myself for being ""boring"" and ""unatractive"". I think this is the first time ever in my life when i genuinely think i don't want to meet anybody right now and i wish i was gay.

81,rvgdvh,1641255607,My girlfriend and I went clubbing and her behaviour made me angry and I want to confess to her in right manner,"We went to our favourite club as New Years thing to party and drink. I(23m) have been with her(22f) since 7 months. Nothing of this sort has happened before.

We were dancing and basically enjoying ourselves. I told her I am going to get more drinks for both of us from the bar. I went to the bathroom and was headed to the bar as it was crowded so it took some time to get the drinks. I came back to see her dancing with 2 random guys. But it doesn't end there. The dress she was wearing was strapless kinda like a tube top but in a dress form.

She was dancing and dress being short it kept slipping down to the point of her nipples getting out every now and then while she was dancing with those guys in front of them. she didn't seem to care much as it wasn't stopping her and it kept slipping after her pulling it up.

This has gotten me angry over her and I feel like im lost for words to say to her or what to say to her about her being like this. Firstly her dancing with them and then showing her boobs to them

I was ugly. I was asocial. I was undatable. And then a specific situation slapped me in the face and made me realize what a mess i was.

I didnt even believe in myself enough to CREATE a profile. I just knew i would fail. 

I created tinder and bumble two weeks ago. I have over 80 likes and 40 matches since then. I cant even chat with all of them. Its at a point where i just wait for them to text first so i will filter out those that are interested. I have dates scheduled for this week and even a hookup.

However the truth is... I am fucking scared. I have no idea what to do. I have no idea how to ""date"" and I have no idea how to even hookup. I had sex once. It (I) was terrible. Call me a narcissist but the attractive weirdo stereotype is real.

We went and I felt we got along great, plenty of conversation, back and forth laughs. She even invited me on more hikes. However I'm not sure she has feelings as it wasn't a 'date' per say just an outing between two friends.

My worry is I don't know how to go about approaching her about how I'd go about telling her how I feel or asking her on an actual date. Do I wait till we go on more hikes or tell her before just in case she invited more people on future hikes.

She stares at me and when I look at her she would smile and keep staring, she rubs my body and tells me how soft I am, she always sits right next to me to where our legs are touching, she would be excited to give me rides home, she started offering to buy me food and I only let her buy me like 2 things, and I would pay for all her stuff or if she gives me money I will pay for it and just give her her money back. When she talks to me she gets all close to my face like she is going to kiss me. She even asked me if I noticed her nipples are hard. When she heard that I was going nights with her she jumped up and hugged me.

She recently switched shifts so I would work overtime to see her and spend time with her. She would do the same things still but it was less often since we didn't see each other besides during shift change. So I decided to text her and see if she wanted to go out. So I asked her how she was told her I missed her and wanted to know if she wanted to go out. She just said she can't and isn't that a holiday which it was I had gotten my days mixed up. But when I seen her the next day she came up to me and my friends at work and asked me why I said I missed her. Which was kinda embarrassing and hurtful but I answered her anyways and said cause we haven't worked or seen each other. 

So I pulled back after that and just kinda kept to myself didn't bother to say anything to her. She started to just jump in my convos with ither ppl and ask why I dint like her anymore. Then we started talking again but I got hurt at work and was out a few days. She sent me a text and asked if I was good because she heard I was on crutches and she hasnt seen me and a few days we texted for a min but then she randomly stops texting me. I sent her a message today telling her how I think I have covid and she just says you think and stops responding to me.

so I matched with this girl a few weeks back, seriously the best looking girl I've ever seen, a literal 10/10, and she messaged me right away. whole thing seemed too good to be true from the start (I look good I guess but not nearly that good imo). Turned out she was actually a real person.

we talked for a few weeks. we had a huge amount of common interests, and similar humor. it was going great I thought, even though I started to notice she didn't chat that often or start the chatting. figured she might be one of those who's trying to cut their social media usage. 

well, turns out I was right, since she deleted her instagram and snapchat suddenly, without telling me. I messaged her on tinder two days later since she still had the profile up, and she said that she kinda just did it suddenly and told nobody, she wanted a break, and apparently wasn't ghosting me. I asked for her number, but she said she doesn't like giving it out, little weird at this point (or is it?), but she asked if I have discord. 

I said ""yeah, (username)""

that was two days ago. no new discord friends. 
i remember her saying she doesn't use tinder much but isn't it a bad sign itself that she doesn't even seem to remember me, again?

I realize she might sound a little unhinged in this text (so do i), but she had just gotten out of a relationship and has some shit going on in her life rn, especially this month, so I do get it if that's the reason, but the issue is that I don't know. I honestly cannot tell if I'm being ghosted or not and it makes me extremely anxious since I actually see potential here, or saw. I don't know.

I figured i'd send her a message tomorrow asking what's going on here. 

I'm either just blind to all the obvious red flags or I'm overthinking the shit out of this and I hate not knowing which one I'm doing. just tell me what you think.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rvhtq4/someone_wanna_speak_some_sense_into_me/
