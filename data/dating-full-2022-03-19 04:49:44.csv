Welp, after 3 months and a failed (sorta) relationship with an ex later, I decided to try it again. Once again, I have no success.

I really do wanna find someone though, so I got on literally every dating app I knew of, and even paid premium for a couple of them, and got to work with sending the first message, swiping, making conversation, etc. I‚Äôve tried all different approaches when sending messages (everything from sending a simple ‚ÄúHey‚Äù to writing a well thought-out paragraph where it‚Äôs clear I read their profile). But even then I get blocked, unmatched, rejected, etc. Even if I get ghosted, I consider that a ‚Äúwin‚Äù cuz at least the guy acknowledged me so I could be ghosted in the first place?

I did have a couple of guys here and there express interest during the few years I have been on these apps, and I did try talking to them and going on dates, but things never really worked out because when it came down to it, I just wasn‚Äôt attracted to the guy myself (which I know is hypocritical üò£).

As you all know, we do give a 'report ' to our friends when we are courting a girl about how things  are going  and I was no different  ,so  I used to tell my friend how things  were going and tell him the things  I liked about her and the things  I don't  like  about her. At the time I didn't  know I was making a huge mistake. 
After our first real date  I went to her house, and although  we did nothing of interest in particular  ,it was fun ,and so naturally  I told my friend about  it . That's when things  started  to change  and she grew cold and distant almost instantly  ,at first I thought  it was my fault  but after serious  reflection  I found nothing  could have possibly  gone wrong.

For about  two weeks  I thought  maybe she had just rejected me outright for whatever  reason, until one evening  when we were talking as a group of friends  ,and I learnt that  discussions were held between  my friend, the girl and some  other friends, and although nothing about  sabotage was  mentioned, it was the first time I became aware of this, that they had been talking 
That got me thinking  and  I later came to learn albeit  not with full certainty that my friend had taken  words  out  of context and  had told the girls  friend  ,thus making  sure she got the information, and because  he knew such information  coming from  him would be treated  with  some skepticism  due to the massive  conflict  of interest, he used the girl's friend. 
Now at first  I gave  him the benefit  of doubt until two weeks  ago when we got drunk and he kept  on insisting and  asking me what went wrong between  the girl and I,  and this all but confirmed my suspicions.

No sex involved . 

We both are in our late 30s and early 40s. 

In every date he either kept saying he is unhappy with my dress or my hair or  that i look stressed and so many other things that I started questioning why does he even initiate for the next date. 

At the end of date-3, I literally cried in front of him and mentioned that if he doesn‚Äôt like we should end it and not drag it.

He consoled me over the phone when I got back home but at the end of the conversation kept hinting indirectly that he‚Äôs like ‚Äúme to breakup‚Äù with him. 

when I questioned  him how he can immediately login to the dating app soon after I left his place after second and third date, he didn‚Äôt have an answer. 

He thinks there is something fundamentally missing but is unsure what. 

After a week of third date( total of 15 weeks from the time we started talking)  I finally asked him what he feels about where things are heading and if it‚Äôs worth taking further he didn‚Äôt seem to say anything. 

After two days of having this conversation he said he‚Äôd like to meet me for the 4th time at my place which I refused as i was still recovering from the hurt and wasn‚Äôt prepared to meet him.

soon after this I noticed that he has become a ‚Äúpaid‚Äù member in the same dating app we met. 

I‚Äôm unsure if it‚Äôs worth continuing this any further. Will meeting him for date-4 change things?! Or hurt me more ?! 

I have indicated my priorities around having a family etc., and that I can‚Äôt drag aimlessly. 

I think we both are still talking because we haven‚Äôt found anyone else and the moment someone else comes along he may dump me for her. 

Should I initiate the break up ? i did see a future with him however I am not sure if he will ever commit.

I met the first guy in campus and we dated 4years. He was distant, ghosted alot and told me made up scenarios which caused alot of emotional and psychological torture. Sometime later he confessed that the stories were to ""keep me away"" but I didn't seem to go anywhere. I honestly don't know how I managed to be in a 4-year relationship with him... Maybe it was the love I had for him or it was that I thought if I held on long enough he'd change. Anyway fast forward...I broke up the ""relationship"" last year and I encouraged him to see a therapist because from the childhood stories he used to tell me he was clearly damaged. Maybe that's also part of the reason I stayed with him; because I convinced myself it was not 'him doing this' and that he needed someone to show him the softer and kinder side of love. He has really changed alot and is more open and seems happier now. No...we didn't get back together. We still talk and help each other out and I think he is a better friend to me than he was a boyfriend. 

We have both moved on to new relationships and I am with this other guy who has doesn't ghost but is always busy. The relationship started in January and I think we have met like 4times. I don't want the repeat of what happened in my first relationship where I snap out of it 4years later when it's clear I am the only one doing the work in the relationship. I have realized that I am the one who initiates conversations and suggests meet-ups and maybe I should take this cue and break off the relationship. 
One other thing, he doesn't seem to reply to my messages with the same energy. I wrote him a long romantic paragraph once and he replied with 'I share the same sentiments'..WTF? Being a poet I also wrote him a poem last week and he completely blue ticked it and went ahead to reply to a meme I had posted on my status.

Maybe I am the problem, maybe I am the one who rushes things...But I know no one can ever be too busy for someone they care for. Because I am also an extremely busy person but with the little time I have I try to get in touch with the people in my life.

What should I do? I don't want to invest all my energy into a relationship where the love and energy is not reciprocated.

Hello everyone.

So situation looks like this:

We are going together to the second year of the university on the same field of study. She is planning to end studying after 3rd year, I'm planning to study 5 years.

She ended her last relationship half a year ago. But she still rent a room in the same apartment as her ex and 6 other people.

Last 4 months we were talking a few hours a day, around 3 days per week. We went to the shops or cinema together. We are also doing party twice a month (more people than us). Last 3 months I was thinking about how to tell her I like her.

I said to her one week ago: ""I really like spending time with you. I wanted to ask you something. Do you see me as more than a friend?""

She said that she needs to think about it.

So we talked again 2 days ago.

Unfortunately, she said: ""I also like spending time with you. But. I don't think I see you more than a friend.""

Asked her if it can change over time.

She said: ""Maybe yes, maybe no. It is safer to assume that no, so you can date someone else without waiting for something that can or cannot happen.""

I want to add that. The same day she said to me, that I chose terrible time to confess. She just started a uni project and didn't have time to even sleep. I don't know... if I asked in other time maybe I would have other answer? Or it doesn't change this...

So here I am.

We are friends. We are going for the next 1,5 year together to study. Should I wait around one year and ask her again? If she doesn't start dating someone else in the meantime...

(By waiting, I don't mean literally ignoring everyone around. If someone I like shows up, then I won't ignore her for the sake of waiting. By waiting, I mean if anyone else doesn't show up)

I'm thinking if maybe she needs more time after the last relationship or something like that. Maybe she still thinks about her last partner since they see each other at house every day.

If I should give up about more romantic relationship and focus on friendship, then do you have any tips how to stop thinking about her in a romantic way? I see her when I sleep. I think about her when I cook. But I know what she told me.

I want to add that when I was asking her; I was more scared of destroying our friendship than to hear decline. So it is actually not that bad. I feel kind of relieved that it ended like this. But that doesn't change the fact that I still think about her.

I also want to add that I don't want to distance myself (I mean losing contact). I still want to be at our uni party or go shopping together. So please don't write stuff like, stop contacting her.

Thank you for reading. Thank you for answers. Thank you for tips.

I am currently 25 years old, and male. I've reached a point in my life where my friends are gone and I am divorced. I married the only girl I met with on Tinder and after our 4 year relationship we tied the knot. She cheated, and left me. This is my only dating experience. Unfortunately for me - my friends were her friends first. 

I am a social misfit. I have social anxiety. I also don't have any friends, or networking to meet anybody new. I'm a mail man, I work a LOT and my coworkers are old men. My life is relatively safe, and boring. I love to hike, camp, canoe. I love to work on my many cars and home diy projects. But without my partner, I guess I just feel lonely and have no drive to do them. After she (my ex wife) left, it's my first experience living on my own.

I also live rural, but on the outskirts of a major-ish city. There's nobody around, and it's quiet here. I own my home, hell I have two houses. I have federal benefits. I've (mostly) beat cancer. I wouldn't say I am unattractive, either. I'm just a darker-hair colored ginger. A little too skinny, maybe awkwardly pale.

So, all of this to say that I don't think I am undesirable, or unattractive. I think I am unrelatable and it's amplified by my awkwardness and anxiety. I was raised by two stoic workaholics, and I'm a reflection of that. I just don't know how to talk to new people and I am scared of strangers.

I don't want to use tinder (or other). I don't have social media. I hear and see that women don't like cold approaches in stores.

I look ok (nothing special), i dress nicely (or so ive been told), i am ok at making conversation and making them laugh and i'm a good dancer.

However, i'm 'scared' to ask girls out on dates because i know i don't want a relationship and that's probably what they're looking for so i don't want to waste their time, give them the wrong impression or make them feel used. 

My question is: how do i find someone who's also interested in something casual with no 'romantic' expectations? Is there anything i could do or say? Ive been told that if we go on dates and have sex, there's still no 'relationship expectations' until we agree there are, but it feels like i'd be an asshole still?

A year ago almost to the day now, the girl I was with cheated and dumped me. I spend the rest of covid moving on from that, and when school went back into person, I began trying to start dating again. The first semester back, I was rather successful; while nothing really went beyond coffee dates, I met and struck up conversations with several girls and eventually did ask one of them out beyond a coffee date. I've been trying again this semester as well.

Since the breakup, I have mainly focused on myself and my projects, and I have gotten to the point where I'm happy with myself. I have a great social circle of several friends, most of whom go back a while and some of whom are girls. In general, I've never had a huge issue talking to girls despite being very introverted and generally hanging out with guys. But the ones that have gone the romantic path have been consistent disasters. I'm honestly at a point where I don't need anyone, but would really like someone.

Which leads to the question: if I'm open to finding someone to date/relationship, is doing so more of a function of making an effort to find someone,  or just being open to the possibility? (ie, just being friendly, talking to girls when you can, creating a context to meet them, etc)

In my relatively limited experience, all the girls where things developed romantically and went somewhere happened by chance. The first girl I dated, we met because she came over and sat next to me and started talking in a class a while back. The second girl and the one that would have become a relationship if it weren't for covid (long story...) I met by chance in a computer lab when we were printing stuff, and then started seeing her around everywhere. The third girl I met as we were walking to an early class when it was evident we were going to the same place. However, in the cases where I made an effort to go up and talk to a girl, those have almost never worked out. Same with dating apps by the way- I tried them during covid and even though I got several matches, absolutely none of them went beyond basic conversation.

I really loved her and she cared about me but I felt inprisonned because I couldn't talk to my friends without her being mad at me for leaving her alone at my house. A day after I broke up with her I had to tell her about this terrible sin that soon turned into a guilt, I exchanged nudes with another girl about 1 year in the relationship. I felt guilty and she shamed me in every way she could. 1 week later she told me that she would like to have me back and she forgives me for all of the things I have done, at that moment I was still a bit emotinally detached from her because I wanted to be free and talk with friends that I haven't seen in a while so I told her I had alot of love for her and I was sorry for what I've done but I wanted to stay separated. she didn't handle it well and she called me multiple times for about 1-2 weeks because she was sad and I comforted her by telling her I loved her but she needed to get a life and stop living for mine. Thru the next week she didn't call me and I developped back my feelings for her so I texted her to tell her that I wanted our relationship to continue and I was missing our love. she answered me that she wanted to get back together too but in a very weird so I asked her if she did anything with other guys and she told me that she kissed another man who is a total loser but good looking man the day before I texted her. I got very angry but realised that I broke her off and it was my fault and she had no reason to not go to his house. after a fee hours of raging at work I managed to cool off so I went to meet her at her job after her shift. I was a bit mad still but we started laughing and having fun. She interrupted everything by saying she had done something that was very bad and she can't keep it in anymore. she told my that she sucked him off and I panicked, I started asking a bunch of questions that I shouldn't of asked, she told me that he had a bigger penis than mine, she sucked him off until he came and that she slept there but on his couch. that tottally destroyed me and I couldn't make any sense out of this and how can someone who I respected as much as her could go do something like that with a guy she never met. I have many confidence issues now and it haunts my everyday life because I'm scared that she is just looking for another man to lach on to. at the end of the night I gave her a kiss and a hug that was very painful because I couldn't bare the fact that she sucked another guy off a few days before. I texted her that night about how really sad I was and that I needed space to process everything thru my head. after 3 days I still feel like there is a big hole in my heart and I can't see her the same way because one of the reason I was with her was because I knew she respected herself but now I don't even know if she cares. She told me he forced her but I have a strong time beleiving that because his house isn't far from hers and she could of just left. she did also say that she rejected her after that and she regrets everything but I didn't give it enough time to see if she would go back with him and never  think of me again. If we get back together she said that I could go see my friends and she wouldn't care because she said that she never knew how much it was important for me to socialise althoug I told her about it all along our relationship.

Honestly it just immediately clicked, as soon as we met. We spent the majority of the night together being flirtatious, and she was very proactive, and even initiated this flirt. We were hugging, teasing each other, getting our heads very close while talking, typical flirt. I wanted to kiss her so at some point I told her I liked her, the night was already ending, we had spent the night together, I thought it was a good time to say it.

Memories are a bit blurry but I believe I answered something along the lines of ""I'm just being honest"", which is I guess not the best nor the worse answer I could give? Idk really.

For me it was a rejection but she kept being flirty after all of this, nothing really changed in our relationship after this, and we never addressed it, we just kept it playful. I wanted to kiss her still but I didn't dare after this situation. 

Not so long after, the party ended and we were making plans to go to an after party together, we even found a nice one we were excited about.

By text she still said we could catch up next weekend but I'm confused really.

Maybe I messed up, and I shouldn't have told her I liked her, but it's not like I said I loved her, idk, it doesn't seem odd to say this in my book and it's not the first time I do it but it's the first time I receive such an answer.

Season 5, episode 21 of Star Trek TNG features a being called a metamorph. She is effectively very empathic and fine tunes her personality to suit the men around her. While I don't become someone different with the men I encounter/date, I always saw myself reflected in this episode. I am particularly intuitive - I work in the mental health field - and I can read others fairly well. I can sense who they want me to be fairly easily. So dating always feels like asking myself the question, ""who do I want to be"" or more accurately, ""what parts of myself can I tolerate dimming?""

I've always felt that one gets to be an amalgamation of 60% of themselves. Do I want to be the poet? The scholar? The adventurer? The nymph? I'm all of those things and yet I feel that I have to pick one; play up certain aspects of who I am while hiding the rest of me.

Last night, I was asked by a suiter how one dates several people simultaneously. Perhaps he was asking how one narrows the choices down; I'm not sure. I told him that you have a different life with the different individuals; you're a different person with them. All parts of yourself, mind you, but they're all different. The way Rent and Moulin Rouge are both based on La Boh√®me, but are nothing alike. After that, you learn who you like being the most. You learn which one of these identities matches most closely with the person you are when you're alone. As fate would have it for me, it's almost always the person who knows they're one of many. The person with whom you have no feasible, foreseeable future. Because *they* are the person with whom I am most honest. It's a cosmic joke, isn't it? You feel the guiltiest about seeing people behind the back of the one person who knows you're seeing people behind their back.

I stopped seeing other people. It's not because I wanted commitment; it was because I like myself when I'm around him. It's easy. I don't have to pretend. And I was getting awfully tired of pretending.

He asked me because he's still ""talking"" to people, whatever that means. One of these people calls herself his 'side piece', of which he seemed strangely proud to share with me. These kinds of jokes were common when we first started seeing one another, but they seem hurtful now. He thought my answer had some agenda in telling him how to live his life, but I was only wanting to express how I felt.

I've posted on here before about needing advice on whether I (19F) should confess to my crush. A few days later, I actually did! He rejected me because he was already in a relationship (didn't know that) but he was really nice about it. I was of course disappointed but proud of myself for telling him. He goes to my school but since I told him over text, we haven't addressed it since but strangely enough, I didn't feel awkward around him.

A few weeks pass and I hear someone saying he's single. He knows I heard. That hurt me because why would he lie? I thought that if he didn't want to be in a relationship, he would be honest about it, because he just didn't seem to be the type to lie about this. 

I tell my friend about it and she tells me that she forgot to tell me but that he broke up with his partner a week ago and that he is, indeed, single.

That surprised me because honestly, could I have chosen a worse time to tell him? I wait a full year to confess my feelings then do it just a few weeks before he ends his relationship, getting him into an uncomfortable position to reject me. Just my lucküòÇ On another hand, I can't help but feel like I somehow sabotaged his relationship by telling him.

Anyway, I won't pursue him now that I know, it would be bad of me to force my feelings on him so soon after a breakup. It's just so weird to know he knows I like him and I wonder if he feels bad now, thinking I'm under the impression that he lied to me üòÖ

Two-ish years ago I opened the relationship to try to get that excitement back but I don‚Äôt think it worked. Maybe I was dating the wrong people, but I‚Äôve lost my hope in the dating scene.

I get emotionally attached to every girl i date (doesnt matter how much time i spend with them) usually after the second date i already develop an emotional wire, i dont really know why, this always happens with people i get along with and specially with women, i keep torturing myself over and over, thinking what i could have done to get things right, how that i wont get to date another girl ever, and those self destructive thoughts that god knows why i always think about, im not really ugly, you can check my profile to judge yourself, the thing is im an immigrant living in Spain (and where i come from we have a bad reputation) so getting jobs and dates is reeeeally hard for me, it may sound as victimism, but trust me, it is the case. Unfortunately with girls, i behave like im really needy, since im already 23 years and i didnt have much experiences with women, sadly. I was literally available all the time for her and this is a big mistake, my friends think she took advantage of that. 

This is my latest story:

So there's this girl i meet on tinder, we dated for a whole week, brought her to dinner the first date, she was a bit cold but after a while we really liked each other, stayed at her mums house the next 2 days to play some videogames, we cuddled, kissed a bit, then i brought her to the cinema (the last date) and we ate together 3 times, all things were going really good, until in the last date, i left her at her apartment so she could change her shoes and something else, thought she would take like 10-15m to be ready, so i parked the car and told her i was going to a small shop to get some chewing gums, this was after the dinner, i felt my mouth was dirty so yeah, i told her via whatsapp that i was going for 5mins, turns out, when i was at the shop (literally a couple of meters away) she was already down there, and she got kinda mad for some reason, i asked her many times if she was mad, but she insisted she was not, im not really that dumb to believe that since we were going to a park to have some time but she just dumped me there and went to her mothers house which was 20 mins away when i had my car parked there, i literally texted her that i would be there really fast but she decided to leave and told me to meet her later. Called her, texted her many times, she ignored them all.

&amp;#x200B;

 This got me really pissed off and ngl i was mad, so i told her to stop wasting my time and that now i understood why she never managed to get a stable relationship (ofc this got her sad and rightfully mad) but it was just because i was really mad at that time and i didnt have a cold head, not the first time she decided to change plans at the last minute, in the third date when i was going to help her move some things she asked me if i would stay, i told her i could not stay for too much since i already had plans with my friends, then suddenly she told me to just dont meet (i was already driving to her place) according to her she was mad and didnt want to meet with me because she got a discussion  with her landlord, and that she didnt want me to see her in that state (it can be understandable but i didnt really know why she paid that anger with me). In the last date, after we finished watching the movie i brought her to the backside of my car so we could talk, hours before she told me to not bring up the discussion but i felt i really needed to, to get things clear (this was one of the few mistakes i made in my honest opinion) brought her to her place, and kissed for the last time ever, she didnt message me anything, couple of days later i found out she unmatched me on Tinder, so i sent her a message thanking her for the time we spent together and that it was really unfortunate that things ended that way, she replied some time after that she didnt think we connected each other and that i should learn how to handle my anger and proceeded to thank me aswell for the time and thats it.

&amp;#x200B;

At times i felt she was gaslighting me to make me feel guilty for everything, she told me that i was making myself a movie out of my head and that i was paranoid. I do agree with some of the things she said, but honestly that doesnt give her any right to dump me like that and change plans at the last minute when im literally on the way to her house. And, whatever she kept telling me, i never believed she was not mad, as women tend to say otherwise.

I (22M) have never dated, or had a girlfriend really.
I have ADHD inattentive type and been a hermit most of my life. I am relatively good looking, though shy can be social after some time, so its not that i've not had the chance, just that i used to distance myself from people i felt were coming to close.

I have had ons, but learned im not really looking for that, so after some time reflecting and self work/improvment i wanna try to date.

I have a good jobb though its 3 weeks on and off. 
(3 weeks gone and 3 weeks home)
I have some insecureties about being boring, never really dated and the fact that im straight upp gone 3 weeks at a time, maybe more.
And some more petty stuff that im working on.

My biggest problem is that i dont know how to start a date, i know it probably wont be a pretty sight at the start, but thats not really a problem for me.

Im generally bad with phone, i struggle with keeping a conversaition trough it, like snap or tinder, both with new people and old friends.
It might be me being picky, i look for someone i can connect with, someone with same interesserts or humor. She doesnt have to be ""me female version"" at all, but maybe share some of the same ideas, hopes or goals.
Its kinda the same with friends, i tend to dissapear from alot of people i dont feel connected with.
I know everyone have flaws, as i do, and thats something that will never change. 
Its more that most ive meet dont even share the same intrests and more, so i move on. 

Im sorry this may seem a bit messy, so im gonna try to summarize it.
I am a introvert whos never really dated, i can be a bit ghosty and have some insecureties. Though i am truly working on it.
I do know my ADHD and unpleasent past have their roles in it, but as i said im trying.
I have no idea how to start a date, and struggle with meeting new people. This can be beacuse a lack of hobby, interest in phone use and even motivation.

But how do i start, or what should i do?
I have future plans like traveling and exploring in generall, and are looking forward to it. Its just a shame i dont really have someone to share it with, even more so that im scared of not really getting to know anyone.

Our first three dates were great. I will give a little backstory: I do not drink. I don‚Äôt have a prior history of alcohol addiction or anything like that, as long as I can remember I just never have been a big drinker, even in college. But the guy am dating drinks pretty often. He‚Äôs not an addict but he has at least one drink every day and he still lives with his friends from college which I think impact that a lot. Every time I‚Äôve gone out with him, I‚Äôve drank. 

The first time, I drank only two drinks and got sick the next day. I explained to him it‚Äôs because I don‚Äôt drink at all in my body just isn‚Äôt used to it and he said that‚Äôs not a problem we can be more careful next time. The last couple of dates I only had one. But then two nights ago, he invited me to a concert with his friends. I had one drink but then he made a comment telling me he wished I would ‚Äúrelax and loosen up a bit more‚Äù and ‚Äúnot be so weird.‚Äù He bought me a seltzer which I thought was fine. Just something to sip on so I could stop feeling so awkward. But the thing was, I didn‚Äôt even feel like I was being weird until he made that comment. I was just enjoying the music. I had a few drinks throughout the night because to be honest I didn‚Äôt want him to think I was lame and uptight. I really like him. I also wanted to have courage to not be weird around his friends. I had fun. But a couple hours later I started feeling sick. I wanted to go to the store to get some water and a snack, but instead he told me he had stuff at home. 

This made me super emotional, in a way I haven‚Äôt felt before after drinking. I couldn‚Äôt hold back the tears and emotions and I don‚Äôt know why. I felt genuinely out of control. We got into a big argument and I felt terrible once we got home. I don‚Äôt know why I got so upset. His friends went off to a party after the concert, so they didn‚Äôt see anything. I spent the night at his house and he told me he still likes me but thinks we need to talk before we go forward and he isn‚Äôt sure where to go from here or how he feels and now I‚Äôm freaking out. 

I don‚Äôt know why alcohol makes me like this but this is why I don‚Äôt drink. I have a parent in rehab because of alcohol and I never wanted to go on that path. I don‚Äôt own a single ounce of alcohol at my apartment. I have a bar cart with carafes of water and lemonade. I like this guy but he‚Äôs making me feel like drinking is a big deal to him. Like he can‚Äôt have ‚Äúfun‚Äù without it. But everything else with us is great. I‚Äôm not sure what to do or how to fix it. The person he saw last night isn‚Äôt who I am. I reminded myself of my mother and that really, really scared me. I don‚Äôt think I should tell him that obviously, but I feel like I need to say something so we are able to give each other another chance. I‚Äôm so incredibly embarrassed.

Is this because if a man likes you he'll make it obvious so you won't need to make the first move or chase him? Or is it because men are put off by being approached by women initially? I know this isn't a scientific study and there are plenty of exceptions but it does seem to be a trend.

She is never coming back. At this point any messages I would send to her would just be annoying and counterproductive for both of us. It‚Äôs written to her but she will not see it.

‚Ä¶..
Hey, I understand you don‚Äôt want anything to do with me. I didn‚Äôt respect any boundaries and was becoming very confused. I was facing some serious demons. I needed to look at myself and grow up, exercise some serious self accountability and stop making excuses. I tried playing the victim for a long time and it doesn‚Äôt work at all. Already by explaining everything I‚Äôm going to come off as trying to do this to win you back but I really am doing it for me. You were already very patient with me in the beginning. I‚Äôm doing a lot for myself now, making the best of what I can with the relationship with my family, reading gain starting with self help and philosophy books, researching to be more cognizant of my issues, making a concentrated effort to better myself and be mindful for my own well-being, reconnecting with old friends. The final step will likely be taking an antidepressant but I‚Äôm just seeing how far everything else takes me because that‚Äôs something I‚Äôve wanted to be a last resort and I haven‚Äôt even put an effort into my mental health in many ways for a long time aside from exercise. 

At some point we both said we hadn‚Äôt felt this way about anyone in a long time. I really meant it. We probably felt that way for different reasons, though. Before you, I knew I was too depressed to even try dating anyone so I was just hooking up with random people a few times and then ghosting them before they could catch feelings. But then I met you, and I wanted so badly to have my shit figured out because I saw you as someone I would want as my partner in crime but I don‚Äôt get to have that because I didn‚Äôt figure my shit out sooner and I pushed you away. I can‚Äôt give you that same value when my cup isn‚Äôt full already. The last few times we saw each other I was slipping hard because I was giving too much of myself instead of taking care of myself first and sharing the excess of what I had left, I could hardly look at you because I felt so guilty about the energy I was giving off. You probably thought I‚Äôm autistic. I‚Äôm trying to focus on no longer making assumptions and not taking anything personally, but I still wonder what‚Äôs going on in your mind. I need a support system but I feel it‚Äôs so hard as a man to share these things with people because the instinct is to provide something and be appreciated for that. And if I‚Äôm just the depressed friend who is dumping my issues instead of providing value by being fun and positive, I‚Äôm not adding value to my friends lives either and I feel guilty doing that. I already did it to you. 

I‚Äôve never come off so poorly in my life and I have a hard time shaking this off. I wasn‚Äôt a good boyfriend in my previous relationship and instead of dealing with my emotions properly and learning from it, I over-corrected by doing everything I wish I did for her and I came off as desperate and codependent at the end. I was actually doing fairly well in the beginning but it went downhill as soon as I started realizing how unhealthy I was witnessing how you live your life. I just numbed a lot of stuff out and kept an inner peace in a way made other aspects of my life suffer. I was having a quarter life crisis and looking back I feel weird that I behaved that way, I had a lot getting to me and it‚Äôs almost bizarre accepting that those were my actions.

I still want you back but I know I have to accept our connection as temporary and just be happy to learn from it. It‚Äôs normal to grieve and go through a period of putting someone on a pedestal and thinking you won‚Äôt find someone else. There‚Äôs so many other great people in the world and I know lll find another.

So I (26F) noticed my boyfriend‚Äôs (22M) behavior changing about two weeks ago, but it wasn‚Äôt until the past week that his consistency changed towards me. We are long distance and he was still meeting up with me for our nightly call and texting me throughout the day. However, he wasn‚Äôt putting effort into actually talking to me or spending time together. He was just showing up.

Last night, I called him out on it. Not in an aggressive manner, but like ‚Äúhey things are different, so what‚Äôs up?‚Äù. He admitted that he is stressed out by the distance, the fact that he just got out of the military and his whole life feels like it‚Äôs been flipped upside down. He‚Äôs struggled with finding work and is waiting on the VA and the military to finish up his paperwork, so he can join the border patrol. He asked for some space as everything is pissing him off right now. He didn‚Äôt say that meant me specifically, but i‚Äôm assuming i‚Äôm included in that.

Honestly, I feel better after confronting him. He says he still wants things to work out. I don‚Äôt know if it will, but i‚Äôm not really thinking about that today. I spent the morning cleaning the house, as it‚Äôs my first day off after working 80 hours this week, and I put a lot of things to the side to make time for him. I don‚Äôt appreciate him showing up to our time out of obligation, but he was trying to do the ‚Äúright‚Äù thing by me‚Ä¶so i‚Äôm really not angry with him. I just don‚Äôt like feeling like I was a chore.

So i‚Äôm going to finish the last of the stuff I put off this week. Start my stew, take a long hot shower, and just enjoy the day. It‚Äôs going to rain later today and I have this book, Son of the Storm, that i‚Äôve been dying to read. What better time than a rainy day to cuddle up with my dogs and read it, right? I think the time to myself is good and I hope that he sorts himself out. Maybe we will work out, maybe we won‚Äôt‚Ä¶but either way I know i‚Äôll be ok.
