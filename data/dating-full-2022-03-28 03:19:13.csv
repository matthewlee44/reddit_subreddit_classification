This past weekend, he was back and we went for lunch. Conversation still felt fun and effortless with three hours going by so fast!

I’ve just recently gone through a string of painful rejections, including with one of my friends who I developed a crush on, and with several girls I’ve met thru online dating. They’ve all recently gotten together with other guys. And these girls aren’t IG models or celebrities or anything- they’re just normal, intelligent, well-rounded, attractive people.

I’m stuck in the mindset of quality women want to date quality men. 
So therefore, if no girls seem to find me attractive, then I must be an loser. 

But I don’t actually THINK I’m a loser. I do alright with every other aspect of my life besides dating. But why do I FEEL like I have no value when the women I’m into don’t find me attractive and turn their attention towards other guys? 

It seems like whatever confidence I have in myself is crushed when things don’t work out with a girl (which has constantly happened throughout my life) How can I stop tying my self worth to whether girls are interested in me? I know it’s not a healthy mindset to have.

The work is customer service, and we have 1-2 shifts together per week.

It's been months (6+) and sometimes I think I have an idea of the relationship could advance to asking her out, then I try to reason myself out of it. I wouldn't say I have had much experience in any interpersonal relationships, but I have relapsing trauma which in short, assailants to me and a friend when I was a minor who should be in prison are still at large. The details are not relevant, but the subtle trauma is.



Previously, I had a no dating colleagues / classmates motto that I followed; first date ever starting in summer 2020.

Anyways, the colleague has shown indications for asking her out. 1. Customers have asked whether we were dating. 2. She said that most guys usually just ask her out. 3. She has asked me who my fabourite and least favourite colleagues are. 4. She has mentioned favourite shows, siblings, pets, etc. 5. The most significant has been that within the past week, she is always the first to distance herself away from me whenever I get close, whereas others don't do so. I wave and say hi, but she doesn't respond. In the rare case that we work together, there is a strong, awkward silence between us. She constantly walks and stands closeby, but doesn't say much. Though, she has praised my baking and cooking.


So, the Tl;Dr for dating is: Do I just be blunt and say ""I want to take you out on a date."" Then from there arrange particulars for the date, ie location, time, activity? Or do I need to pre-plan those parts of the date first? Based on the avoidant behaviours now, I'm gauging that a simple ""coffee date"" is out of the picture.

She was playing too and we really hit it off.

I've been trying to avoid dating my typical type (introverts) so I've been looking for a woman who's extroverted and out spoken.

Well she fits the bill and the chemistry is good too. Because she's not my usual type, wedding bells aren't ringing off the bat, just a nice feeling of ""hanging with her sounds cool and she's pretty cute.""

My friend who was hanging with us saw the whole thing and later commented she seems like a perfect fit for me. They've been advocating for me to try dating a more outspoken woman and they won't shut up about how she's perfect for me.

And that's what worries me.

This last heart break hurt me so bad I had to become a version of myself that could happily live without my ex and I've finally gotten there. The thought of falling in love again makes my stomach hurt. It's like, what if I fall in love and it doesn't workout again? How could I reinvent myself in a way to move on again when I'm already where I want to be? I'm scared I'll lose myself or what I have or I don't even know.

We're texting casually and usually I quickly go to set up a date but now, I just want to take it slow. Maybe start as musical collaborators or just friends even. Some friends are saying this is a good approach and others are saying I'm holding myself back because I'm afraid of getting hurt again - which is true- and ill get myself in the ""friendzone"" by going slow.

Online dating. Offline dating. Just dating. I am a bit anguished about sex and I don’t know how to handle it. It all comes down to the fact that I enjoy sex, I like sex, in fact, I love sex, but I want to develop some non-sexual rapport with a man before I sleep with him. I have found though, that the opposite is the case. Most guys want sex and if it is good then they might start considering a relationship. So I don’t know how to navigate this incompatibility between many men and me. 

My fears around sex are various. One fear is STDs. If I don’t know about a man’s sexual history, how am I supposed to assess the risk of getting an STD from a sexual encounter with him? I know that condoms exist but I know that they don’t protect you against everything. I also don’t know if they will work 100% of the times and if there’s a risk of them slipping, I can still get an STD. Ideally, I would have my partner show me an STD test, but I don’t know how to go about asking a man to do this for me. And I find that many men think it is off-putting and unnecessary. Regarding STDs I have to say that some men strike me as more trust-worthy and I don’t have these fears with them. But with others I do, because I have a feeling that they might be promiscuous or that they might not be very careful when choosing their partners.

The second fear is the fear of feeling used. I have had sexual encounters that were not satisfying, that gave me some physical pleasure but made me feel bad too, because I understood after a while that these men I had slept with were not really interested in me. They may have found me attractive at some point but that was it. Because this has happened quite a few times, I am very sensitive to it. And I don’t ever want to feel used or taken advantage of again. 

The third fear is related to the fact that sex can cloud my judgement. I have found that whenever I have sex with someone, I start to get very attached to the person. I feel that I think a lot about this person and that the idea of this person starts to take over my thoughts. I also start to think of them as potential partners because I have problems to separate sexual attraction from emotional attachment. And the problem is that if this happens, I can easily overlook fundamental incompatibilities between us. For this reason, I feel it’s better for me to delay a sexual encounter and wait just to get to know the man in question better.

Even though I think that these are all perfectly reasonable fears and reserves, they have killed in a way, some potential relationships, because I feel that the men felt frustrated and kind of annoyed, and many of them just got away from me before we even got to know each other. I feel though that if a man is respectful, he won’t behave like that and he won’t mind waiting. But the reality of things is that I have noticed that many men just lose their enthusiasm for me because of this and go for women that are more “fun”. So I don’t know how to go about navigating these fears? Should I express them to the men that I date? Should I relax a bit? Should I just tell them that I want to wait a bit more? What If they get away from me because of this and I lose a good potential relationship?

Department lead is a step down from the manager. While there are about 15 student workers at the restaurant, there are only 4 department leads. Department leads don’t have control over pay or scheduling. However, they assign breaks, and tell you what to do, for example, I specifically am told by them to go on the register. If the register gets stuck, they have the keys to unlock the register. 

The other day, I looked up the handbook for the restaurant. It says that managers and department leads are not allowed to date regular employees, as they are subordinates. So that’s why I think he’s my boss. However, by the time he got promoted, we already liked each other. He was kind of distant the first couple of weeks after his promotion.

My high school days consisted of me either being too afraid of rejection, taking too long to make a move or building my sense of confidence/self-esteem. I've developed a sense of social confidence after junior and senior year. Due to sports and being exposed to bigger crowds. I was still inexperienced but relaxed and my best self atm.

Soon after graduation, I began to develop an attraction to one of my coworkers at my theater job. We were both trying to open up more to others and we started to connect that way. One day I said that I had a crush on her. I simply said it to get out of my system. At that point she and her bf were having issues. However, she texts me later that night and said that she felt the same way. In fact, she said that she has always been attracted to me. Even thought she was still dating her bf. After they broke off, we started to be friends with benefits. I lost my virginity to her and actually started to catch feelings and so did she. Although, she soon went back to her ex because we had a toxic relationship. I was heartbroken jealous and bitter. I even ruined the friendship that we tried to have.

After 2020, I've been starting from scratch. I started to recede into my closed off and super awkward demeanor. It was hard to make friends at my new uni let alone talk to girls. Soon, I started to become depressed, guilty and anxious. Like I wasn't worthy of friends or a gf. I was tired of feeling that way. I'm now molding myself into the man that I want to be for a long time. If I want to be worthy of good relationships, I must have a better relationship with myself. Now that I have that, I'm starting to feel I think that it's time to get back out there and at least start having fun.

Now first things first, I'm not the best at talking to girls. I know that women are people too lol. But what differentiates a friendly and flirtatious convo? Sure, I'm a jokester. That's one thing people can say about me. It helps in many interactions and allows most to get comfortable with me. Although, I tend to rely on it too much. I'm self-aware enough to know that I have a lot more to me. But idk how to use that to connect to others much. Idk how to be flirtatious, charismatic nor how to court a woman.

I (m 24) have been on a date with this girl (f 19) I met on tinder after accidentally meeting her at a bar ( here we can drink at 18). 
The first date went well and she apparently deleted tinder after it. 
She’s super shy (during the date she kept asking if she was boring me) but she has reached out to tell that she hadn’t disappeared after some hours of not responding. 
She agreed on a second date but the first I proposed to go she said she was tired. 
I waited for 2 days and yesterday we texted a lot and after seeing I went at a club on Saturday she told me, she has never went and I told her that I’ll bring her with me and she liked the message. 
She then after some hours tested again but she was in a bad mood and told her if she and her friends wanted to come with us, she seemed to be agreeing at first but I feel like her friends talked her down. 

After this message she started to seem mortified about saying no to a meetup and started to taking it upon herself, at first I started joking but when I noticed she was serious I had to calm her down saying it’s no big deal and told her that both times I asked her with not much notice to which she said “no, on the contrary (sorry for the rough translation)”
Then she left me on read

&amp;#x200B;

To sum up my last relationship I was with her for 3 years and everything was great, really planned a future together, she got close to my family and I got her close to hers, and she was very involved helping me with my sick grandparents, and last year I was dealing with some mental and physical issues, and she promised that she would stick by me no matter what, obviously this didnt happen and weve been broken up for about a month and about two weeks witih no contact with little hope of us getting back together.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not really a casual dater, I've really only been in two long term relationships, the first one started when I was 18, and lasted for 4 and a half years, it was a pretty slow breakup because we kind of both started growing apart and moving apart. It was hard because she was my first for everything and I couldn't really see myself with anyone else but I knew we just weren't meant to be.

&amp;#x200B;

My second relationship which just ended lasted 3 and a half years, we were friends for about 3 months, and started dating about 8 months after I ended my previous relationship, at the start of our relationship I was 22, and she was 19. Because I was finishing up college when we got together, I had my focus on the future, I was ready to find someone to settle down with. She checked all the boxes, very loving, very family-centered, really cared about my family, never made me feel insecure. I truly believed that she was the one, but we broke up almost a month ago. I'm just really upset right now because I truly invested so much in this relationship, spending money on vacations together, spending all my time with her seeing her almost every single day, and basically opening up my entire life to her, telling her all of my deep secrets, insecurities, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

This break up truly shattered my heart, and I honestly dont think I can move on, and I seriously can't see myself committing as much as I did in my previous relationship, introducing her to all my family again, etc. I've seriously wasted almost 8 years in two relationships that I have nothing to show for, just faded memories. I know it sounds cliche but I seriously can't see myself with anyone else, and I really cant keep wasting years of my life on relationships that just end.

Just giving a little bit of background, we are both healthcare workers where we work in the same hospital mostly but been working on different shifts as of late, she works casually (3-4days a week) on top of her 5 days of uni. Things went pretty well until a few weeks ago when she got identified as a close contact and got really anxious over it ( afraid of covid affecting her lung capacity+ her asthma which could eventually prohibit her from playing trumpet -&gt; affecting her research progression) + her sisters depression is affecting the entire family, she told me that she walled everyone off for that period.

She stated that she really missed talking to me and my voice when she was feeling better about that so it continued to be good for another 1.5week (also discussed that we could take a break in between as things could get more hectic with uni). However she started to give 1 worded responses since 4days ago without any precursors so I reduced the frequency of contacting her as I thought she might want more space. We met yesterday when I was taking over her shift and she was giving body languages that indicated that she isnt keen on private times for ourselves so we just hung out with other colleagues. Whats really confusing is that she winked and did the finger heart thing (thats how we show our affections more sneakily at work).

So I (25M) was discussing with her various ways through which we can add flair to our soon to be long distance relationship. We eventually discussed boundaries and allied topics.

In her previous relationship she had a very toxic ex who was controlling and did not allow her to hangout with her male guy friends. So while talking about boundaries she asked if I had a similar problem. I refused and I jokingly stated that ""as long as you guys are not sleeping together in the same bed it's all peace"". However, she told me that many times during poker nights or late night cookouts - her close guy friends often pass out on her double bed. So due to lack of sufficient furniture they end up sharing the bed. She made it clear that no cuddling whatsoever happen during such times. To be honest I do believe her as I have also met her guy friends and they all are good human beings. I also understand that it's nearly impractical at 4:00 am in the night to look for seperate space for sleeping.

I understand her point of view and her innocence but I have been hard wired to view a bed as an intimate object. While I do not fear infidelity but I would feel disrespected if this was to happen. While discussing this she suggested that she would only do this as her last resort. I find comfort that she does understands me but I still think I will feel disrespected whenever it happens in the future. While she understands my point of view but she is not willing to change her stance as she says she doesn't want to be controlled.

I understand that this is insecurity on my part so I want to ask you people if you have been in similar situations and what solutions you guys were able to find out. I love this woman and besides this we have no issues.

He confused me w someone from class, but then asked if I was single and if he could have my number. I’m in a new city and an anti-social homebody so I thought, why not meet someone in real life right?.. WRONG

We texted here and there, everything seemed chill. He invited me to coffee at a café on campus but I arrived so late that it was a short chat. Talking was easy though, he even gave me a thoughtful gift that I appreciated. He wanted to take me on an actual date on Valentine’s Day but I rescheduled since that day seemed too special for a first. He kept asking if I wanted him to bring me dinner before our date but I declined. I didn’t feel comfortable accepting so much. Still he insisted he needed to see me before our date. Being late to the coffee and rescheduling already, I gave in and met him at a local spot. He gave me flowers and chocolate, and we chat for a bit before his study group. He mentioned my red flags and how it worried him.. an otherwise turn off for me, I let it go since I thought it prob was his experience. (I work and have my projects so respond when I have time for my phone. Some hate that, I get it). He seemed cool and our date came.

We did dinner and a movie. The theater was right by the restaurant and we were seated 1.25 hrs before start time. We ordered and the food came after 25 minutes. Before the food was even served, he was already insisting I tell the waiter we’d take it to go so we didn’t miss the movie! I told him to relax, we had plenty of time esp with trailers, we should enjoy dinner. We had smoked before so I chalked it to him being nervous but the date was off to a rough start. The conversation was awkward compared to our previous chats. After the eighth ask, we took the leftovers to go and dropped them off at his car. Waiting 30 min for the movie to start with him saying how we could have eaten was annoying but I didn’t want to sour the mood so kept it positive. Conversing was easier after the movie so I was open to another date.  He drove me to my car, all was good. I figured the smoking prior to dinner threw him off.

He wanted to schedule a second date asap but it was a busy time for me so I suggested weekends instead. Hardly being on my phone, he asked what kept me busy. I mentioned my work/projects and he immediately became condescending. He attempted to make me feel small for having a high-level profession. I wished him luck on his exams and told him it was nice talking but it’d be best to go our separate ways. 

The extreme negging that ensued was a confirmation my instinct was right. He went from saying he had women constantly after him and I had red flags he was looking past to how I could forgive him for making me sad. It was all over the place and not energy I wanted to entertain. I didn’t block him only to make sure he didn’t threaten my safety. Three weeks passed and he was still calling and texting daily. I was tired of it, and was advised to be direct so I texted him I wanted to be left alone please. He berated me. At that point, I called him and told him to please just respect my boundaries even if he didn’t agree. I just wanted to be left alone and move on in peace. He argued with me. It got to the point I felt unsafe and told him so. I said I felt harassed and to please respect my decision. I blocked him at that point. He texted me from another number.

It’s all gaslighting nonsense. How I had to give him another chance. I misunderstood. To forgive him. After another week of it, I texted back that he was essentially harassing me and while I wished him well, he needed to stop contacting me. He told me I was crazy, he was currently on a date with another girl and she agreed I was a psycho. I told him that was fine and to please just give her the attention I didn’t want and leave me in peace. He went back to apologizing. I blocked phone #2.

He called me from blocked numbers. Then texted from another number. After another week, I texted back he had to pay me for how he kept blowing my phone up at that point. It was obsessive and I wanted peace. I really prayed asking for money would finally have him running away. He said it was weird and he was sorry. I said I had no idea in how many ways I had to tell him to just leave me alone, that all I wanted was to be left in peace. I blocked phone #3.

He CashApped w a message to forgive him. He texted me from another phone how he sent me lunch. I asked my fam and gfs if I should accept it. They said definitely for the trouble. I accepted the first and they kept coming. Small amounts but at this point they’ve added up to a little over $100 which isn’t much but it’s something. I haven’t responded since phone #3 but have blocked 5 different numbers at this point. He continues belittling then asking for forgiveness and another chance. It’s been almost two months since our first and only date. We spoke superficially and were never near close nor intimate before or after the date. I’m not sure how to proceed. I got another text today and I’m exhausted. 

The person I dated before this threatened to kill me and himself every time I tried breaking up with him so I’m wondering if I may be stressing myself out for no reason here. But I’m genuinely scared. He doesn’t know where I live but he knows my general area. I’m afraid of running into him grocery shopping or existing.

I don't want a relationship with him, it was the first time we had sex. But I still felt a bit upset, like... the whole thing, which was super nice, felt cheapened by this.

I met this girl on discord a while back that building with me a good friendship and such. I see that she liked me cuz i was being a dick to her (in a friendly joking way you what i mean). 

Our friendship has had its up and downs.

But: We have never met irl. 

Currenly i think shes ignoring me and seems uninterested in texting (she literally left me on sent but  she was uploading new stories on her private insta). Now, moving on is not a option for me, not because i need her or some sadness, its because

I want her, i want to win.

You see she's hight level, and beyond my league, but i feel that i cracked her and putted her on my level (or made her detach from her league in a meta way) 

This woman who i manage to befriend and treat her like shit as a gimmick has shown me that i removed the ""hight value"" filter on her on my relation with her and such, i can reach and talk even thought im not on usual lane of friends that she has, and she aint talking to me cuz of pity, for a time actually i was talking to her cuz i felt pity for her. 

Point is, i want to win her, because she's a well rounded woman and desirable, and getting her under my cloak will be a great achievement, and something beutifull to add to my other suscesses (i work on myself and such, and i love myself enought to want her on a relationship with me, so please dont throw the ""move on and love yourself 6000 hundred times""). 

Now the ""you dont love her, you just like her ass"" alarm may be sounding inside of you rn, so let me clarify, i love this gal, i loved her since day one, she is one the few people that fully reciprocated my way of being in a controlled matter (it was balanced, i wasth to crazy nor too boring, and she liked that, i love that she like that, my way of being is mostly undesirable for women). She does have a great ass dou (im not even that sexual anyways). Now this love is not to be misunderstanded as ""she gave me validation so i love her"", yes she liked how i was with her and who i am but others have done that (few really), and i canr expect every person to love me. Look, if i want i can just move on and never talk again (already did that, realized what a hight treasure i was wasting), i dont need her emotionally to live, but i dont want to lose. Additionally, i liked how she reciprocated my way of being,  which came from who she is.

I have 0 exprience with dating and women (in friendships) i mean just the fact that shes in my life is epic. 

Summary: She's a high level girl that i actually like ""on the inside"", she aint prefect (multiple flaws), but shes something to not just be wasted and admitted defeat.

She's currenly uninterested (she was) how do i regain that interest back and keep it afloat until i manage to plan a day that we meet irl.

Remember, defeat is not a option, so dont suggest it.

So I went on the date. The nerves before we met were insane, I haven’t been that nervous for anything in a long time, but once I was with her it felt pretty natural and while I was still nervous, it wasn’t a crazy amount.

Having had zero dating experience whatsoever though I have absolutely no idea how to know how well it went. Nothing like explicitly romantic happened, but I didn’t expect that anyway. But I don’t know if she did or not which is kind of making me worried. For the most part it just felt like we were hanging out, although it definitely seemed like we had a little bit more of serious conversation sprinkled in than usual and it felt like there was just a little bit of tension and awkwardness compared to usual. I don’t know how to describe it, it wasn’t awkward but it felt like there was a little bit of weird tension. A couple of tiny little pauses in the conversation, us lingering a little too long when I took her home, that sort of thing. We did joke around with each other a lot still but it also felt like we were trying to get to know each other a little deeper than usual and like she was confiding in me things she wouldn’t have before. But then a couple of other things make me think she might not have enjoyed herself as much as I thought; her being the one to ask if we should leave after we ate, her saying not to worry about walking her home at first and that she didn’t want me to have to go out my way (even if she did seem grateful for it in the end), etc., it felt like maybe she just kind of wanted it to end.

Maybe I’m wrong, but I just kind of keep replaying everything in my mind and wondering if I should have done things differently. She was pretty adamantly against me paying for it all and we split the bill and she said I could just buy her a drink some time instead, but should I have paid? I walked her home which she seemed grateful for, but is it weird to do that after a first date? Was it awkward for her? Should I have tried to flirt with her more explicitly or should I have suggested we do something else after we had dinner? The biggest one; I didn’t set up any second date with her, does she think I’m not interested or something now?

I don’t know. I had a good time but it didn’t feel like much beyond just a hang out, and I don’t know if it should have. It was pretty casual from the get go, which is fine by me, and at the time it seemed pretty damn good, but afterwards I just think about all these little unwritten rules of dating you’re meant to follow and all these things I should be doing and it feels like we just kind of hung out. I don’t know. It’s hard to tell whether we had a fun little hang out like she wanted or she expected more and I kind of blew it.

Anyway I don’t know what to make of it all, maybe I’m being stupid. I’ll probably just need to see if she’s up for going out again and take it all from there.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1164797,public,self,[UPDATE] I have my first ever kind of date with a girl I’m really into in a few hours and I am terrified,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/tq7om4/update_i_have_my_first_ever_kind_of_date_with_a/,no_ads,0.0,,,

I (21F) have noticed a pattern in my dating life and I'd like some advice from strangers. 

A little background: I study at a good university and have a full-time job as an IT Project Manager. I've been fully independent for a while and you could say that I have my life together.
When it comes to dating, I have a considerable amount of experience and my last relationship continued for over two years. It was very abusive, though, so I spent a few months just healing and recovering from that. 

Now, I'm slowly getting back into the dating field and I'm very open about seeking a serious relationship. I'm also demisexual, which means that casual dating, fwb, one night stands and such are really not up my alley. 
But the same thing keeps happening - I meet a guy, he says he also wants a serious relationship, we go out, we get intimate and when I bring up some serious talk, the guy says how being with me made him realize that he still needs to grow, mature and get his shit together to ""get to my level"". And these guys always want to stick around, but I can't have such people around when I've stated that I'm looking for a commitment. 

And these are all guys in their mid 20's to early 30's so I don't think age is a factor. 

So, what got me wondering is.. Am I the problem? Do I attract such people? Am I intimidating? Am I attracted to such people and subconsciously choose them?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1164796,public,self,Things end because of the same reason again and again.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/tq8a2o/things_end_because_of_the_same_reason_again_and/,no_ads,0.0,,,

Fast forward to this weekend, I had a booty call / date with another guy at mine and he left a condom wrap in the trash which he saw and we had a chat- he was not happy about it but also admitted he is seeing other girls so it’s fair game. And I emphasised how much I like him and wanted to be with him more , and we both agreed that it’s not the right time to be exclusive (yet - in my case) as he will be travelling for 1.5m soon.

Things seems to be good afterwards, we spent the night and brunch after and I sent him text about it, saying I really like him and hope it doesn’t ruin our potential future and he replied that he knows I care about him and we had a great time and hope I get the same feelings from him.

I'm 30M and clearly I had deeper issues from trauma when I was younger. I've had 1 long term relationship, but otherwise I'm exceptionally inexperienced. It bothers me how little sexual intimacy I've had in my life. I've never been able to ask a girl out or express interest. That relationship just happened.

I knew I had to address what was going on with my psychology, so I started therapy. I also knew my location was a problem, so although I make good money at over 150k, I've been searching for a new job to move to the city. Unfortunately, the interview process in tech is ridiculous and I've been studying for months. Finally getting through my interviews, but there is no guarantee these will turn into anything for some time. On top of that, I've been driving hours away constantly to visit my mom who is dying of cancer. I'm barely keeping it together when I see her, and it's a hopeless feeling to watch her deteriorate and have zero control over it.

It feels like I can't ever escape my external situation. Am I just making excuses or is there such a thing as a horrible time to date? It always feels that way to me. In my case, I know it'll be a full-time job outside of work to fix my intimacy issues and inability to ask women out. I'm aware my problems are larger than normal, and I just can't seem to find that time. I think about it every day and it bothers me how all my ambition have made me into a successful person who just can't make himself vulnerable. On paper I'm tall, very good-looking facially (apparently), muscular from years of lifting, great career, and I genuinely have no issue making new friends. No one is throwing a pity party for me, but it causes extra agony for me when I'm reminded how much I should cleaning up with women. And everyone assumes I do and puts that pressure on me.

Should I dial things back and try to find time to date in my current schedule? Or should I push through the move and make it my first priority after I move?

I (26f) was dating a guy (28m) for about 5 months. I had him spend the night one night, he left the following day at like 1pm. Before he left I offered him a rolled blunt since he'd be out until he picked up more. He declined.

I always watch as he leaves my place since he needs to walk a little and just cus I care. 

I see he lights a quarter blunt before he walks and I think ""hmm that's weird, that looks like the one I was saving for myself"". I go and look and it is the one I had left for myself.

I text him and tell him something along the lines of ""hey was about to go smoke the quarter blunt I left for myself and see its gone. Next time just ask and I'll be more than happy to give you whatever it is within reason! I wanna help you out!""

He says:
""Sorry didn't think you'd see it gone, I smoked it last night while you were sleeping lol""

I tell him what I mention above about watching him leave so I know he's lying and I'm unsure why he is.

He said that he's addicted and for one moment made a bad mistake that he regrets and that hes sorry. 

I'm like okay but im super weary to trust you ngl, you lied so easily, took something from me. Im willing to work through things but im super hesitant. He said he'd try to earn the trust back yada yada.


A week passes and he texts me saying that I don't show emotions to him, that I dont like him, that I dont compliment him enough. How im acting super weird. I tell him that I'm still processing what happened w him and I but I'm trying to move past things. That I want to work and address his concerns but that right now I need to move past what just happened. (Keep in mind I've never been the complimenting type so that comment did come out of left field to me) 

He says ""really all this over a fucking blunt"" tells me that all his friends think im bogus for even bringing up the blunt to him. That I have to choose between this blunt or him. 

Told him that I'm ending things with him not over a blunt but over his lack of awareness of how taking and lying to your partner shouldn't be a thing. How he shouldn't be deminishing what I feel is important to make what he did better on his conscious. 

Now its been two weeks and he's been texting me and I've put him on mute. He wants me back, says he really wants me in his life. He even came up to me at work (we both work for the same company, not in the same area tho) to tell me what he had texted me last. Basically his last try at it and I shut it down. He thinks I'm making a mistake but hasn't tried to reach out after that big final attempt. 

I feel bad. Like maybe I am making a mistake? First time in my life setting and sticking to my boundaries and it feels almost wrong to act in the manners I have to him since ending things (like putting him on mute) but logically I think im saying and doing the right things for me. Im unsure tho lol. 

Edit: our last argument ended in me running in my room and slamming the door cus he wouldn't leave my place when I asked. Im the type that needs space to process things and he wouldn't give that to me. He kept touching me trying to make me feel better but I told him to stop touching me and he wouldn't. I ended things with him and than took him back about 2 weeks later. 

Edit 2: posted this r/relationships but it was deleted so reposting here!

TL;DR guy I was dating for 5 months took a quarter blunt from me after I offered him a full one before he left. After texting him about it he lied to me about when taking it and that broke trust. He and his friends think I'm bogus for bringing this up.

so my boyfriend and i dated for about 3/4 months over the summer.. i was moving interstate and told him this at the start of us dating. About 2 months in he says he doesn't want to do long distance, but wants to keep seeing me until I leave at the end of Jan (the Jan just been). I was pretty upset by this and we got into a big argument, as I was like well whats the point. We continued dating, I met his mum and siblings, went on camping trips with his friends, etc. He started to become a bit weird as my move got closer, until one day I asked him to have coffee with two of my friends to which he said that ""would give me the wrong idea of where this relationship was headed"" since we weren't staying together post me moving.

I got really upset (he'd done other things too) and a few days later he broke up with me saying that my move was freaking him out and that he can't do this, he didn't know how to communicate it because he was so confused as he cared so much for me but this move was upsetting him. 

The break up sucked. I got upset and angry, we both cried.. and then we sorted it out and caught up a couple of times for the month before I moved interstate. At the last catch up, the day before I moved interstate, he said he wouldn't forget me, and that the 'door isn't closed' and that this isn't over for us. He reassured me that the only issue was the move, and that we would still see each other/talk when we could. When we left that catch up, I went to give him a hug goodbye and he kissed me on the lips, said i'll talk to you soon and got in his car.   
That was almost 2 months ago and we haven't spoken. We like each other's social media posts and thats about it.. I would love to speak to him, and i'm coming home for the Easter break in a few weeks so was thinking about messaging him to get a coffee. The only thing is, I keep thinking if he wanted to speak to me, he would... but I want to speak to him and i'm not? I've struggled to write a message to him as I don't know what to talk to him about anymore, a 'hey how are you' text seems so desperate. 

Do you think in this case both of us are just being stubborn? would it be okay for me to message him for a coffee when I am home over easter? I don't want to look needy or desperate but do miss just talking to him and would love to know how he is going.

She has a big personality, which sometimes was too much for me in the beginning but has really grown on me. She moved here (US)  a few years ago from Latin America whereas I’m from a very Irish family that buries their emotions.

She’s always mentioned her “best friend” which is a nickname for her guy friend Steve. I didn’t ask many questions about him, and he’s only came up in conversation 2-3 times that we’ve been dating. She has also said multiple times that she doesn’t just sleep with anyone, that her last relationship was 6 months ago, and she has very strong feelings towards me. We had agreed to be  exclusive but I was hesitant to officially be bf/gf although we essentially were.

Her, me, and one of my male friends(P) went to dinner last week and were having a good time. She has always commented that she isn’t a huge fan of P because he’s a bit of a man child (which I agree with and happily have said similar things to his face but we’re still good friends). Now my friend P has a friend (J) which I strongly dislike. (J is a very aggressive sovereign citizen type into pickup artist shit). During dinner J came up and my girl asked to see a pic of J. We showed her and she immediately gasped and said she met him a few months ago through her “best friend”. She immediately sends a photo of P to her “best friend” and FaceTimed him. Turns out her “best friend” was one of J’s best friends and I had met the guy before. I didn’t meet him him super well but if he hangs out with J then I have a negative opinion of them.

From the get go I found this very weird. Her being excited to show that shes out with my friend P (who she doesn’t like much)  to this other guy. Also knowing that she calls a guy who hangs out with J her “best friend” really made me question. 

We get back to my place and she is obviously very sheepish. I ask what’s up and says that she wants to be honest and she has something to tell me. She let me know that her and her “best friend” had actually been on some dates a few months ago (before me) and they had fooled around but not had sex. I learned from P that she had wanted a relationship with her “best friend” but he didn’t.  After finding this out I broke up with her on the spot.

From my point of view, she kept in contact with an ex, whom she had wanted a relationship with, under the guise of it being a friend, lied to me about them just brings friends, FaceTimed him in front of me, and then only came clean because it turned out I knew the guy and was going to find out anyway.

It feels irrational but if she had told me she had actually dated her “best friend” I would have been upset with the lie, but for some reason FaceTiming him in front of me just felt so disrespectful it made me end it entirely.

What do you guys think of this weird situation? I really liked this girl, and wanted to make it work, but I’m not sure there is any coming back from that. Any advice would be great.

After being on the receiving end of another “You’re a great guy but I’m just not ready for a relationship” conversation, I’m finding myself becoming increasingly discouraged. 

I start to wonder if I’ll ever find my person. I look around to my friends and family and see them all in happy relationships with people that are everything they both need and want. I don’t begrudge them for their happiness and I get that no relationship is perfect but it’s astounding how people can find these types of relationships where both parties are just super into each other. It’s also hard coming home from a hard day at work to an empty apartment and an empty bed.

I know there’s the whole “love yourself” thing, and that’s important but it will never be the same. That feels like trying to fit a square block in a round hole. I don’t think I’ll ever be able to “self-love” my way out of wanting companionship. I could say I’m content with being single for the rest of my life but I would be lying to myself. I don’t want to be single my whole life. I want to marry a woman I am completely enamored with and have children with her. That’s what I’ve wanted since I was very young and having to accept the possibility that it may never happen… is scary.

I’m a young adult. I know I have time, but being perceived as inadequate to receive the love or intimacy of people you’re interested in time and time again does start to wear on your confidence and emotional health.
