Hi. I‚Äôve posted previously about this person - backstory: we‚Äôve been casual friends for about 3 years, and started talking more consistently about a year ago. I‚Äôve always thought he was cute but he always gave off the friend vibe. We would usually talk on Instagram. Out of nowhere in Jan, he stopped talking to me as often, no real explanation. He‚Äôd still occasionally pop up but I tried just moving on. He‚Äôd keep popping up. One day I decided to ask him for coffee, he didn‚Äôt seem to be into it, so again, I tried to just move on. A couple months later he texts me at 1:30 in the morning to apologize for disappearing. We chatted for a while and he mentioned us getting together but he disappeared again for about 2 weeks. He asked me to get a drink one night and it was great - we were really hitting it off. He kissed me at the end of the night and we made out a little. Both said wed like to do it again soon, but I haven‚Äôt heard from him since. I know he‚Äôs breadcrumbing me or just ghosting completely so im trying to just move on.

2,owugon,1627959736,Love doesnt die a natural death,"

Love doesn't die a natural death.


It dies because we grow in different directions and we no longer want or are willing to strive towards the same things


It dies because of lies and cover up. When we inflict jealousies and inappropriate behaviors. The explosive confessions after a fog of suspicion.


It dies because its impossible to divide the heart over multiple partnerships. That feeds indifference. And its a testament of character.


It dies due to starvation from crumbs of affection and attention. Crumbs of smiles. Crumbs of happiness.


It dies due to stagnation. Love is dynamic and alive ever growing and developing. When you no longer wish to explore new interest together, love will coil around someone who will.


It dies from abuse, cruel words, non pleasing acts and from over possessiveness. All these states invite resentment.


It takes more than love to keep love alive. Midnight never strikes two hearts at the same time. One will always love more than the other. The one who loves less stops protecting the one who loves more. Remember my reddit reader. Love is not words. You can proclaim love and treat that person badly. Love is not a feeling. Your feelings can change over the course of breakfast, plus love comes with a drop of pain and fear. Love is behavior. What you do. What you show.


We have become sexually frivolous and confuse desire with love. Sex and desire are elements of love just as hot water is not soup.


Remember the vow. Remember the reason for the vow. The wisdom behind the vow.


To honor and cherish my mate in good times and bad. Please grasp the wisdom. Good times destroys sometimes faster than bad times. Look at the mess celebrities create. In sickness and in health. A vain man always working out or woman looking for a boob job has a drop of poison. Health can destroy. In want and in plenty. Wealth becomes tools of dominance, and that is anti love. Love is an equalizer in that it can reduces a king to kneel and marry a peasant. To forsake all others. This one really confused people and I will not get into this.. All others. All ,not except...


But love does not die naturally. When you allow yourself to get familiar and boring. When you allow your passion to wane. When you reach the point when you believe your mate isn't worth fighting for.. You murder your love.


Love alone is religion. Get to know it. Revere it.¬†",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/owugon/love_doesnt_die_a_natural_death/

7,owuz6l,1627961550,"Cute girl at work asked ""for a friend"" If i was in a relationship","Started a new job, literally today was my 17th day. I work in a big warehouse with mostly people in my age group (20-30, I'm 24.) Everyone is cool and friendly, and a few chicks have caught my eye. 
One in particular, with tatts all up on her leg and beautiful wavy hair, and very feisty. We talked in passing a few times but not much aside from her teasing me but the last 2 days shes definitely said a lot more. Asking why I didnt hang out with her at lunch, didnt say hi, etc just teasing. Lots of mutual smiling at each other. She did say ""goodmorning handsome"" as I was working but I only got to watch her walk away that time üòãüçë. Everytime I go near her she gives me shit but I can get her right back and she is quick with it. 

Today though I was taking care of something and she was nearby with a few of her friends she came up alone and said,"" asking for a friend, do you have a significant other"" and if asked If i wanted one. It was adorable and awkward and totally caught me off guard. I said something clever tbh I can hardly remember, her friends heard too and laughed a bit. We talked for like 46 seconds probably and she walked off. I asked her her friends name and she said I'd have to find out on my own. And like high school I heard her friends laughing and teasing as they walked away. I tried to see if I could catch her on our way out but she was with a few of the other supervisor/coworkers I didnt know and I chickened out. 

Funnily enough I have no idea what her name is since it hasn't really come up organically, we never really have time to just stand around and I'm a little chicken. 

She's super hot and seems really fun, I'm very excited to see her again.

15,owvwkr,1627964992,Last night was the first time in my life that a girl has called me her boyfriend in front of other people,"So a little back story about myself. I'm currently a 29M. My 20s were an insanely hard time of my life. I lost a parent to cancer when I was 21. Because of that, I decided not to date while I put the pieces of my shattered life back together. I started dating again when I was 27. I really didn't date prior to losing my parent, so I literally had to learn how to date at age 27. I spent basically two years straight absolutely failing, but after each failure, I would reflect and be very critical of myself. Each time I got a little better.

Fast-forward through all of the shit experiences, about a month and a half ago I decided to shoot my shot again with a girl on hinge. We had previously matched a few months ago, but I just couldn't get a conversation to click between us. With an extra few months of failures and experience, I was able to get a good conversation going and we clicked. We texted for two weeks before going on our first date. It went great and we started finding out we had a ton in common in person, both with our interests and personalities.

We've gone on a few dates since, but this weekend was just magical for me. We were driving back from a day at the beach and she more or less brought up the exclusivity talk with me. Just basically said, ""like it or not I'm you're girlfriend now"" (the night prior she also mentioned how she's not seeing anyone else and that she doesn't have dating apps anymore). Later that night we went to a little get-together at her friend's house and she was referring to me as her boyfriend to her friends. I don't care how sappy this sounds, but that was such a great feeling. I cried tears of joy on my way home that night after I dropped her off. I've been through so much bullshit in the last decade. My 20s started out absolutely horrible, but it's looking like they'll be ending sky high. I'm just really enjoying this feeling of euphoria right now. I think it's really important to bask in the good times while they last. I know that more difficult times are inevitable in life, so when things are going well, just slow it down and enjoy them. I'm tearing up as I'm writing this and I feel so blessed right now.

My advice to those that are feeling like they're failing with dating: don't give up. You have to reflect and be critical of yourself after every failure. It's a difficult process, but it's the only way you're going to get better and find someone right for you. Literally, every failure I've experienced has helped me with this girl I'm currently seeing. Those failures were absolutely necessary for me to have success with my newfound girlfriend. I don't think I would've been able to succeed if I didn't experience those failures.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/owvwkr/last_night_was_the_first_time_in_my_life_that_a/

I rmbr he was gone.. and I dance with people.. kissed people.. I was not ready for a relationship and I think I cheated on him in his face before.. I danced with someone infront of him.

A guy I dated after.. he was bad.. generous though.. but he was bad. Not worth it. I cheated on him when I went on a trip somewhere kissed someone on new years eve.. then I sexually cheated.. was not proud.. it was disgusting.. 

I got cheated on badly by one bf.. who I really let down my guard as he was generous and also gave me the name. But he was actually bisexual. It was one of the worst relationships I ever experienced. 

Last bf also a very bad relationship.. I met him as a cheater.. and things were horrible throughout the relationship. He was one the only ever.. who ever wanted me back.. I guess I held out long and I respected him. He emotionally cheated on me many times and I did it once. I think we both just like eachother cause we can't find someone else. I thought I Iiked him a lot but it was less than I expected. He really is surprised I did that. I am even suprise that I did.

I finally stood up for myself and told him I was completely done with him. And it‚Äôs never going to workout between us. 


So I‚Äôve been seeing someone for the past two weeks. I really enjoy him a lot. I feel like within time I was over my past relationship that I don‚Äôt feel like I need a long break to be ready to see someone else. I‚Äôve just wanted someone to actually care, and for once I don‚Äôt feel like I have to hide or be scared to say something of my interest. This guy is extremely out going and knows how to talk to people fine. My ex always had a problem with someone or felt like everyone is out to get him which is unfortunate because it‚Äôs not true. Well I did end up sleeping with this new guy I‚Äôm seeing. Despite of how happy o feel with someone else I hate the feeling in the back of my mind like an annoying buzz, and it just reminds me of my ex ready to talk shit and say I‚Äôm a bad mother for sleeping with someone else especially since our son is only 2 years old. I don‚Äôt want to feel that. I want that annoying buzz of him gone. I‚Äôm single should it be okay I enjoy someone else?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/owxgk9/am_i_wrong_for_this_freshly_single/

So i do know that i can be crazy and insecure due to past relationships and i know i currently can not bring it to my new relationship i‚Äôm in atm 

for one instance me and him talked about what we would and wouldn‚Äôt be okay with so in my mind we set boundaries like hey let‚Äôs not do this and i have told him i eventually will get over this i myself need to get over my insecurities i‚Äôm working on it 

so one time him and his brother were sending half naked girls on tiktok to eachother and called them hot and spoke about how they want to get them ‚Äú pregnant ‚Äú 

i told him him hey i‚Äôm not okay with that please don‚Äôt do it so he stopped 

another time i was asking him if i can use his instagram to look someone up i had thought blocked me , and i had seen he searched a girl up USUALLY that would not bother me it‚Äôs instagram whatever right ? well a few days prior we spoke about a friend of mine how she was upset with her boyfriend about it and i guess it kinda got to me like in a what if he‚Äôs doing it type way ? so i talked to him about it and i said hey i don‚Äôt think i‚Äôd be okay with that and he agreed and was like hmm alright so when i seen the girls name i did get upset with him and kind of questioned it 

because of course what if she‚Äôs just a friend you know? so a few weeks later we had got into a fight and we spoke about like the whole instagram thing and we got into a fight because i had seen he looked up one of my best friends instagram and stalked ALLLLL her photos and to me that seemed weird and his response to me was i‚Äôve done it to other people of your friends this one you just so happened to catch and i kind of got thrown off guard by that remark 

because i did have a bad relationship before so i felt kind of a pattern happening like my past but i do know something crazy thoughts will pop up 

sooooo we talked about the girl he searched up and he told me he uses her photos to jack off and in my mind it would be different if it was someone who had did only fans butttttt it was someone he had went to school with and had a class with and he was only upset i was packing my things when i heard that because i indeed felt some way and my first instinct was when i heard him say that was pack your bags and get out

but of course i didn‚Äôt i stayed and we never talked about it again

until one day i had a friend stay the weekend and i over heard him and his brother talking about my friends ass and how it looked in short shorts &amp; he just told me he was talking to his brother and he doesn‚Äôt know what else to tell me 

so now i seen he got a message while he was sleeping and it‚Äôs a friend of his saying how she missed him and honestly nothing but rage went through my body seeing it",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/owz0cp/am_i_really_crazy_or_do_i_react_perfectly/

So we now have slept together three times. The first time I was rather nervous but not that nervous. I am not experienced but did a lot of research into how to pleasure her and fuck it if I couldn't I asked her not to worry about my ego and just guide. Couldn't believe it but I made her cum four times via foreplay. That made me really more confident and noticeably less nervous. So that's when she decides it's my turn and goes down on me. My first blowjob. Not gonna lie, it didn't feel like much. It really did feel good when the head was played with, but I could tell I'm not as hard or excited as I usually am when touch myself. So it was nice and after a while I just kiss her while she gives me a handjob, again I was surprised that nothing was happening. Even worse, it became half soft and half hard and felt powerless.

Fast forward the two other occasions: more of the same. I make her cum and when it comes to me, I can't get it up or keep the erection. The condom kills it even more. And it's really irritating now, she feels bad cause she thinks it's her but this girl arouses me and attracts me a lot. It's been three times and I CANT EVEN GET HARD ENOUGH TO ACTUALLY PENETRATE HER WHICH WE BOTH WANT SO MUCH

51,ox0h6a,1627985821,Does my client have feelings for me?,"Hi,

So I \[30F\] and client \[M\] have known each other for a while. First of all, the positive thing about this is that this will have no impact on my work life, which is great. So, I've been working at a technical site for the last two months where I've been managing a team. Me and my client hit it off straight away, we got on really well. However, I think our friendly banter is starting to turn into something more.

Recently, whenever we get into work he spends over an hour talking to me about anything and everything and when the conversation is about to die he brings up a new topic. He tells me a lot of personal details about himself and he's made it clear he is single. He remembers absolutely everything I've said to him, even when its been a casual conversation with little weight. We had access issues to some areas of the site and he had an emergency meeting with his bosses saying that I had to get access as my skillset is in high demand and my time is worth a lot of money. He also called up another boss telling them to give my company a 5 year multi-million dollar contract and to make sure that I manage the whole thing.. he told me he even said, 'if you want a successful job done make sure you get \[30F\] to do it'. He also gives me and my team particular privileges on site which usually isn't allowed and I know he never allows anyone else to do what he lets me do. Whenever a decision needs to be made, he asks me if i'm personally okay with it... beyond the usual care of a client relationship.

He always gives me intense eye contact when he talks to me and is always very close when he speaks to me. Also playfully punching my arm when he's making a joke and setting up my work desk next to his.

My gut says that he has feelings for me, but I just wanted to get further insight. As I said before, the good thing is that this has close to 0 impact on my work life as we move from this site to another site soon and I can hang out with him outside of work without there being any issues.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ox0h6a/does_my_client_have_feelings_for_me/

I had cast on leg for month and couldnt walk without crutch for another month.

One boy kicked me and another guy from the groupchat we had. After that i havent talked with that girl and another 3 boys since 2017 july. Recently i started seeing that 1 girl in large store working as cashier and i just cannot get her out of my head. I keep thinking about her, but im afraid to do anything (im kinda big boy, 190cm, 123kg)

Im afraid to talk to girls since i think automatically that i dont like to them.

What should i do to get her out of my head? I mean she obiviously is cute, not gonna lie. But im sure a boy like me would have no chance with her. It literally takes me 2 hours to fall asleep because i keep thinking about her, so i only get around 4-5 hours of sleep per night.

She shouldnt have a boyfriend either, because the one she had, is now dating her best friend. And after i found it out, i started thinking about her even more.

Okay guys pls help me out. I have never been in a situation like this before.
Okay so I have a boyfriend and we have been living together for 2 months now and we are really enjoying each other. 
After we moved in his family started getting real comfortable and showed me their true colors. They are nice people but they are also a very very toxic family that I have a hard time spending time with. It‚Äôs not always enjoyable. Okay, so the last 6 times I have seen the sister she has been sneak dissing me and been rude to me. At first I ignored it but I‚Äôm really bad at standing up for myself and setting boundaries so I just let her continue. My boyfriend got sad that he never defends me when his family members or friends are rude to me so he went over to his sisters place and told her in a nice way how I felt and she listened. 
She saw me at my boyfriends birthday at our place and seemed nice but when she went home she texted me asking what my problem is and told me she never did anything to me. Instead of just saying sorry. She then kept on calling me names and it started getting real personal. She used some personal stuff I have told her against me. So I feel really betrayed. She wants to involve my boyfriend but my boyfriend doesn‚Äôt want to be involved. She is 30 years old single and living alone and looooves drama. I told her to speak nicely to me but she kept on being personal. Today she has blocked me and she knows very well that she has my suitcase that she borrowed. I don‚Äôt think I will ever see that suitcase again‚Ä¶. How do we go on from now? She blocked me because she wants me to stay away from her. But what do we do when there are family gatherings? Me and my boyfriend also really wants to get married. How do we do that when the sister hates me so much? She is trying to be manipulative but it doesn‚Äôt work on me or her brother.

I cut off contact after then but we've reached out to each other on an average of once per month, plus we attend the same church and I see her every Sunday, even though we don't talk. And when we talk, it's just to ask about how the other person is doing.

Now, it's been close to six months, I've tried dating but nothing has worked. Yesterday, she uploaded on her status that she's now single and not joking about it and that she doesn't want any questions. Since I saw that post, my anxiety has been up, and my hopes were rekindled. I don't even know if she posted that as a joke or was indeed saying the truth.

We had dinner out, went back home for movie and then slept cuddling and next morning went out for breakfast and then cooked lunch at home. We were holding hands all the time so it was pretty good long date.

I mentioned to him that I want to have sex only if I know the other person does not have sex with someone else (meaning exclusivity) and I asked if he is seeing someone else. He answered not anyone seriously. I know people will judge me for stalking him but I did open dating app to see if he is still online and yup he is.

He never texted me during the week and only texts to set up date detail. So I found it quite weird as I would text people I am interested in. Not sure if he is interested or not

I will ask him if we meet again: 
If he likes me
If he wants exclusivity 
If he would pause the dating app

Do you think bringing these up by just 4 dates are demanding and too fast? I am looking for serious relationship and I know he is too, so I don‚Äôt want to waste time for one person if it won‚Äôt go anywhere.

94,ox5kb7,1628003794,M(29) Disheartned by dating scene,"TLDR: Dating in your late twenties is challenging and disheartening. 

After a rough break up, I decided to get back out into the dating world going through the chaos that is online dating which im not unfamiliar with. My problem has been with a lack of reciprocation in communication after I have a match that successfully leads to a first date. 

The dates are pretty standard: meeting for a meal and drinks or sometimes just drinks. We talk about our hobbies and interests, schooling that we have or havent done. and overall have nice and intelligent conversations.  At the end we leave and I usually have a good feeling that maybe a few more dates will come out of it.

When I text  back the next day for two after, i dont get the usual ghosting that you read about on here. Its selective or unresponsive unless I prompt woth solid question behind 'hows your day?'. No inquiry as to me yet the person meetings I've had have been nothing but talking for what seemed like hours. 

Is this just how everyone responds now a daya because of covid? Maybe it's because people just got super bad at communication and forget that other people have feelings too? Whatever the reason is, it's unfortunate when you both say you felt a connection and nothing ever comes of it. Its disheartening when you're trying to connect and get disconnected.

98,ox5wbe,1628004757,"Reality check about ""True Love""","I'm 24 male, never been with someone, never kissed or anything, only dated twice. For some strange fucking reason since I was a kid, I believed that everyone will eventually meet their soulmate. Their destined lover, the perfect match, even if the person is far from perfect. Someone that will never be bored with you, someone that will accept every negative aspect of yours. 

 This misconception eventually brought me depression. After getting rejected a few times and after I saw what everyone else around my age was doing. People want to have sex, they want to have fun, they cheat. Relationships are temporary until you reach a certain age, then maybe some feelings do develop, or people just want to settle down.

I felt that I'm alone in this world. But I'm willing to change. Should I try out any dating apps? Any other advice on how to move forward? I just want a happy life.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ox5wbe/reality_check_about_true_love/
99,ox62ky,1628005261,Hope for a Longer Relationship,"I'm pretty wary of relationships and their reputation. I decided to give the dating scene a shot for the first time though and within these past two months I've been seeing another person and been enjoying it a lot. 

That being said, I've also been kind of on edge about commitment. Life, schedules, and maintaining a life outside of a relationship are all still things I'm trying to keep stable, and soon I'm heading off to college. The future is always subject to change and I've kept that in mind with how it corelates to my relationship.

I'm not great at communicating my emotions, but the first date went smoothly. We were somewhat close friends before this before there was a possible romantic interest, so chemistry was already there and we both had a ton of fun. I communicated that I would like to hold hands next time next time, and over the course of two months we have hung out and everything has gone great.

It took me a while to realize it but I get a massive spike of serotonin everytime I'm around my partner. Although I've communicated that in passing, we didn't really talk about it until recently and the serotonin produced from knowing said spike in happiness is the same for both parties makes me feel like I could actually work with this relationship.

 ""Like yeah, I miss you too when you leave my house"" gave a MASSIVE ""aaaa that makes me so happy I feel hope.""  

I'm aware the temporary euphoric high is well, temporary, but that recent talk was the first time I'd thought, yeah I really want to keep this relationship for a long time, instead of being immediately hit with cynicism whenever I think about the long term. 

I've always just been way too busy for a relationship and seen bridges burn from relationships. I'm still conscious of terrible outcomes, but it's just nice to feel hope and reassurance from an event. It's just nice to live in the moment I guess and hold onto what is in the present as it has a positive outlook for the future. 

I don't really have advice based off my experiences because I only have crushes on people after I've become friends with them, which is known as being demisexual.

I guess the main one is if you like them, just tell them outright. People can be really dense, because they don't want to assume wrong so sending signals doesn't always work. Try to do it in person. If you find you physically can't and you text that person often, text CAN be a last resort. 

TL:DR: I've seen relationships hurt people dearly and for the first time in a while, have felt hope that a relationship might last. It's a pleasant feeling.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ox62ky/hope_for_a_longer_relationship/
