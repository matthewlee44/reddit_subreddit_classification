We met at Corner Bakery (a very casual chain sandwhich/soup, order up at the counter type place), got it to go, and had a little picnic in the park.  

When we were walking in and looking up at the menu, he asked what I was thinking of having, and as I walked up to order my food about to order, he like all of a sudden was like ""She'll have the Chicken Pesto sandwich, and I'll have the ""xyx."" 

I've been on dates at nice restaurants where we talk back and forth about what we want, decide to split something, and the guy orders for me, but that was with someone I had been dating for a little while! Today, I had just met the guy 1 minute prior! It just felt very overpowering?  Like i felt kind of like a child. Is this weird for a guy to do? 

Anyways, picnic date happened, it was fine, pretty boring conversation and wasn't really feeling it, so as we are walking back to my car, I thank him again for lunch (he insisted on paying), and don't initiate a hug or anything bc I didn't want to lead him on, and as I turn around to get in my car he lightly runs his hand down my back! Now is this weird??  The unexpected touching when I turned my back definitely made my brain freak out second, but I have a mild history of sexual trauma years back that makes me sensitive to that stuff so idk if it's just me or that is actually weird. 

He texted me about an hour after the date saying he had a good time and ""Let's do a movie date next Saturday"" but I definitely would not feel comfortable being alone with any guy after 1 date, let alone him. I don't even think I want a second date? But is it bad to turn down a second date just cuz the convo was kind of dull?

I'm 29. And its not like I've been sleeping around either. Been working on my career and such, making myself better. But Ive been really lonely and the lack of female intamacy has left me feeling somewhat insecure, even though Ive been in multiple 3-5 year relationships in the past. about 6 months ago or so I decided to seriously get on dating apps and try my luck. 

I met a wonderful young lady and we connected instantly. We went on dates, became close, helped each other through problems, and have both had a hard childhood and had to assume vast responsibilities at a young age. I felt a real connection with her. Not to mention my physical attraction for her grew to a crazy amount. I think I am more attracted to her than I can remember being towards someone.  Background of her, she has been in a 5 year abusive relationship and got out a year before seeing me, but also said that she would see her ex up until a few weeks before we started seeing each other.

She asked me if I loved her when we were drunk one night and I said I think I could. She then asked if we would ever be boyfriend and girlfriend and I said right now, I am not ready yet, due to my current situation. I am in the middle of being kicked out of my current house and frantically packing things up and looking for new houses at the same line to meet the deadline at the end of the month and I needed time to think about my feelings and process things. We had been talking at this point frequently ever day for almost 3 months. 

A week later,  I noticed that she no longer seemed interested in texting me or seeing me. I asked her what was up and she said since I asked she might as well tell me and be honest. She said its nothing I did but she has depression and has to work on her own stuff and cant spend time with me anymore because she hasn't even had time to work on herself. . I honestly feel like I fucked things up somehow because of my fear of commitment but I have opened up to her more than I have opened up to any human in the past 6-7 years and it really hurts to feel rejected by her. Now we don't talk and are blocked on social media because it hurts to see her posts. 

I have debated messaging her but I fear just being rejected again, and at the same time, I feel like I cant just be that guy that is sitting around waiting for her to come back to me. I have to move on. I just hate this and honestly wish I just said yes and made her my girlfriend, but then if I honestly wasn't ready, things could have ended even worse than they already did. The last time I talked to her, she did say she had feelings for me and she thinks I am the perfect person for her, but like I said earlier she has her own  issues she wants to work on herself. Its been a week since we talked and I still miss the fuck out of her. I feel like I fucked up.

I've tried getting back on dating sites and been talking to girls, but while it helps me feel a little better I am somewhat not interested and I still want her because she had emotional depth and understood me. I feel like I wont find that easily again and she's honestly all I want right now.

So, my girl ( let's call her A) met this girl an year ago. They hit it off instantly as they were in the same fandom of a show my girl likes. ( I didn't watch the show so yeah, she can't really talk to me about it as much as she can). This girl, lets call her B fell in love with my girl. And because she was jealous of me, she with her several friend trolled me on instagram. Spread the rumour that I am a harasser and stuff. When my girl found out, I expected her to stop being friends with that girl but she didn't. She asked her to stop and continued being friends. I let it go. 
After a few days, girl B started to emotionally harass my girl. She would fight with her and throw tantrums if my girl does anything she doesn't want her to do. she started to emotionally manipulate my girl. And I tried talking to my girl about this but that lead to an heated argument. My girl didn't talk with me for a few days. When she came back, we both apologized to eachother. We had a long talk about how that girl is bad for her mental health. She agreed yet stayed friends with her. 
A few days later she confessed that she has feelings for girl B. I saw it coming and blamed myself. I thought it wouldn't have happened if I had treated her right. I accepted the situation. 
After a few months, my girl confessed that she has been fooling around with girl B, I forgave her for that. I talked to her about it. I made her understand that it hurted me and all. 
Now, just a few days ago, girl B did something that broke my girl's heart. They were best friends as my girl claimed. She betrayed my girl and yet my girl wants to be friend with her.

They also kept associating intentions to my actions, that were not my actual intentions (though they were willing to say that maybe my intentions weren't to hurt them). When I asked to discuss, they elevated their voice, kept covering their ears and going ""lalala I'm not listening"", just lost their shit more and more and kept telling me I had no idea how to communicate and that they were done with me and I'm ""full of shit"" among other things. For the record, I didn't speak to them in the same way. I simply said, ""when and if you're ever ready to actually reflect on the things you say/do to me, we can talk"" and because they kept telling me I was full of shit, I said to not contact me again.

Our relationship had been toxic in the past and I thought they were getting better, as I was able to address most of my side of things and was wanting a pretty peaceful and healthy relationship. But this among a few things had me really concerned, especially since they demanded exclusivity today out of nowhere (we were broken up and sort of talking/seeing each other lately but the request for exclusivity was sudden and they were time-pressuring me/telling me to leave their apartment if I said no). I was hoping for discussions. 

Is it best to just walk away from this for good? It's tough to date right now and me and this person had a pretty serious relationship before and I was starting to believe that they had done the awareness work and were going to be a good partner, but how they handled the conflict seemed so incredibly immature to me and like it'd be a lot of work.

I need some advice. 

I'm a 31 year old male and own a dog training company. I have an 8 week program where I meet with clients once a week for, you guessed it, 8 weeks. 

 I've recently finished with a client. She's my age and seems to be single. She's very attractive, extremely pleasant and kind, is very easy to talk to and seems to be very driven in her professional life. She's also done a great job with her dog, but like I said she's very driven and capable. 

Our last meeting we took a walk around a park downtown to work on walking her dog around lots of distractions. These are usually 30-45 minutes but we spent almost an hour and a half just walking and talking. Some about the dog, but mostly about ourselves and personal lives, families etc. We kept passing her car and I'd expect her to stop and say OK well great see ya later, but she'd just keep walking by. 

I've become increasingly smitten by her (lol) over the weeks and really enjoyed our last conversation. 

If it makes a difference, she texted me when she got home of a picture of her dog. A couple of texts back and forth and she thanked me for all my help. 

I never do this with clients, and I wanted to wait until our professional relationship had ended, but I'd really like to ask her out. I'm just so taken with her I feel like I need give it a shot. If she says no, it's not the end of the world, it's just not meant to be. But I'd just be kicking myself if I didn't at least ask.

I just discovered he is actually married after a friend told me his behavior sounds like a married man because she’s been through it.  

I did some digging and found out indeed he’s lied about timelines.  He could be separated but it would be fairly recently. I specifically asked if he was married a couple times and he said no once and the first time I realize he worded it carefully but didn’t say “no” in fact 

So now I need a plan of action. I want to let the wife know.  If they’re separated and she is aware then no harm really... but whatever he says, I won’t be able to trust since he’s lied so much.

Dating makes me anxious and takes energy. I also have autism + ADHD.

However, I do feel lonely often. I’m happy with myself but feel it's difficult to connect with most people. I get anxious. Dealing with dating takes my anxiety to another level. When I feel lonely and meet people I sometimes even feel more lonely while with them.

However, would like to meet a girl that likes to stay at home as much as I and be creative.

He also kept saying if he didn't like a girl and enjoyed her company, he wouldn't keep going on dates with her. He also suggested us to go to a nice hotel some day; I declined and reminded him I would not have sex with people who are not my romantic partner, and he said he wasn't persuading me to have sex but he just wanted to cuddle me close.

I haven’t had sex in over a year and haven’t had a girlfriend in over 5 years.  

From age 19-22 I was in community college and working in a restaurant and surrounded by attractive women. I had many dating opportunities and enjoyed it very much. I had romantic relations with 10-15 different women up to this point. 

I then transferred to a university at age 23 for engineering, graduated at 25 and have been working in engineering ever since. Ever since 23 years old, dating has been brutal. No women at my job. No women in my classes when I was in school, most my friends are now married. I used tinder, bumble, hinge, Facebook dating, all with no success. 

My friend and I try going out to bars and dancing but it’s just not the same.  It’s so much more difficult to meet someone out at night compared to working with them or being in school with them. 

It really makes me question my choice of career. I chose it only because I knew it would allow me to support a family and have a home.

So here's the situation:

Let's say you're a single 26/27 year old girl, who's well read, knowledgeable &amp; stand for feminism, anti-patriarchy &amp; are basically a 'woke' kind of millennial girl.

Your parent is the usual traditional/conservative parent who puts your profile on a Matrimony site - which you hate because it is community-caste based.

Meanwhile you're on dating apps like Bumble etc - but you're having a tough time finding a dude who's sensible, kind but also shares similar outlooks / tastes as you with regards to the world, culture, music, films, food etc. And you are only looking for a serious long-term commitment, no flings.

Then your mum / dad ends up giving your number to one of the Matrimony dudes, who then texts you. You obviously hate this &amp; ignore it &amp; tell him saying you aren't interested in this politely &amp; move on.

But then the guy also says he shares similar views on these sites &amp; that it was forced upon him by a family member etc. He even seems open to dating &amp; not necessarily in a hurry to get married or anything.

Over the weeks, more texting happens &amp; you realize this guy actually seems great &amp; better than most guys you've met on Bumble / Hing etc.

However, the one fact that bothers you so much is that this was through a Matrimony site - and that's a tag that you don't want to be associated with, cos of course he's from the same community and all that, which perfectly suits your parents.

So just because of that one reason - should you be avoiding this lead, because it goes against your principles? Or should you be like fck it, lets just be happy we founds someone nice cos YOLO.

He always told me how I was beautiful, and he was so attracted to me, my body is perfect, but he would lose all his respect for me if he had sex with me (?!).

Also, the most he would do is hug me...he wouldn't even try to kiss me...he said he was waiting until marriage for that too because he might start something he can't finish. He said he had no self control and he would take it too far. But my thing is, he did all this in his last relationship...which was 6 months ago. They had consistent sex. 

He told me in the kind of relationship that he wants, sex is worthless. It means nothing to him. He also says he has no desire for it...but he's not asexual. He said he had a crazy sex drive but he was working on eliminating it completely so he could focus on his work. Sometimes I'll try to sexually banter with him, just make a cute joke, and he'll look at me disgusted and be like Don't do that. Is it that serious? Why is he so sexually closed-off? 

Here is my thing. He was cool and all but I really started to feel undesired and like I was hanging out with a friend. He is so adamant about the don't touch me thing that I can't tell if he has issues or if he is not attracted to me. It's so suspicious and weird. Kind of icky. It takes away from his masculinity.

I can't hold the conversation its like after hello hi and introduction there is nothing to talk about like there ia nothing in common between us bcz its either its our first chat or our interest r not aligned even if they do I'm able to hold conversation till next 2 maybe 3 chats after that there is nothing to talk about which makes it boring so i end up losing interest or girl loses interest. 

It like happened to me two uptill now like i had a girl friend in high school we used to chat for like 4-5 hrs late night daily but that went on for 7-8 days at most bcz she had really hard crush on me so she was little desperate to talk with me so i also went playing along but after 7-8 days she started to say she is getting bored when she talks to me bcz there is nothing common in between us except the thing we both like each other yeah i started to like her too but even after that we use to sat there online and try to hold conversation but after 2 maybe 3 weeks we both lost our interest and went separate way but i must say it was really nice though talking to a girl that freely without thinking that much.

So second time it was when i was in the college and covid had started there was a good looking girl in class who had a crush on me but had broken up with her last bf and got new one then corona happened then she was free during that time so we started talking then she started to play pubg with me bcz i used to love playing it so we usually went like 3-4 hrs daily voice call in pubg but same thing happened again we started to get bored after 11 days maybe 12 13 but my point is we started to get bored even this time she also said the same thing that pubg started to get Boring and whenever i started to hold a conversation there was nothing to talk about bcz we already shared a lot things like crushes, likes, interests, dreams, ppl  we had past with and some sexual interest too yeah we were somehow that close even she had a bf but a new one so she used to said that she not that serious with him right now bcz she doesn't want to break her heart again but after 2 weeks i had same problem we both lost interest and we went separate ways after that

Now I want a girlfriend desperately i held back my whole life bcz i had no money to afford one and i finally got my graduation completed and got job as software engineer so in short i have money now to afford one so I'm trying to find a good looking one gf even though i have avg looks but quite nice personality so it won't be much of a problem if we went on few dates but thing is I can't start a conversation with random girl i never met i dont know why it feels like i have no interest in her when I'm jusf desperate to get a gf with who i can share my feelings with.

Since I mostly get looks from girls in my 20s, I suppose that is the age range I should flirt with. Since my looks make me feel younger with girls that are 30+ but my looks make me feel more comfortable with girls in their early 20s.

Over the short period of time I have known him, I noticed he began to make comments that made me feel a bit off. 

Things like implying that my home is unclean (it’s always clean, I maintain it well) picks at my things “your expensive shampoo smells terrible” “your hair is sooo dry” “look at that photo of you in 2019 your hair was so healthy back then” and makes comments about how I’m only successful because of my “white pretty privilege” and that I “do the things in my job no one else wants to do” 

After I hang out with him I feel less confident in myself, which is unusual for me as I built myself up to be very confident in my own skin and life. I’m a very independent, ambitious woman who live a comfortable lifestyle due to my job. Although I feel like those attributes are a double edged sword because I get marked off as “intimidating” a lot of the time. 

I brought this issue up to him and he apologised but called me hypocritical, and then left my house and we have not spoken for a few days.

We had great chemistry, she would often ask me for advice and wouldn't shy away from touching my arm and being very close to me physically. We would talk irl and over messages about everything that came to our mind. She would also give me subtile compliments suggesting I was intelligent and competent. Among many signals she would give me, she asked if she could dance with me when we had to pick a dancing partner in Music class, and asked me to tie her bra when we were out swimming with a few other classmates. I also knew she talked about me to her best friend. The bra incident motivated me to ask her out on a date, because I thought she was giving me a clear signal to do so. Keep in mind she doesn't act like this with other men. She's a charismatic and radient girl, but she's also a traditional and conservative girl when it comes to relationships (she never had a boyfriend before) so I thought it was too out of her comfort zone to not be a signal. I asked her out. She declined my offer. I was disappointed and confused, but I accepted it. I just couldn't fathom I was so wrong about how she felt about me. We didn't talk for a while, not beacuse I didn't want to keep contact with her, but beceause it was a bit awkward for the both of us at the time I guess. Our interactions were brief for a few months after that and then I learned she's leaving my class to pursue a music career. I was surprised since she was the best student in the class, but I understood music was her passion, and regular class was taking to much of her time and energy. For a farwell gift I gave her a golden neckless, since it was the least I could do. She, of course, hugged me and thanked me, first in person, and later in my dms (with a lot of emojis and kind words). I didn't think much of it since she rejected me before and I took it as a friendly gesture. After that we didn't really interact that much; a few birthday wishes and instagram story replies, but not even close to what it used to be. Fast forward to a week ago, and she sent me a long message out of the blue  
''Heyy, happy Easter :) I know it's pretty random, but I'm currently studying for the finals and I must say that I still remember a lot from that time when we studied the renaissance together hahah, so I guess it was worth it 😄 ''. I sent the message to my other female friends and they say that she's definitely interested. But then again, they also said that the last time, and she rejected me. We continued that conversation dor about 4 days, but I got mostoly friendly vibes from it, not romantic. Also, even though she replied to my messages at a pretty fast rate, they were more and more shorter and dry as the conversation progressed in my opinion. I showed our convo to a few female friends to see if maybe I'm the problem, but they all confirm that I was doing a good job. I decided to start a new conversation today (I had a good reason so it didn't look forced), but I got the same dry vibe from it. I just have no idea what to think.

I have an average 'Becky' face but I dress very tomboyish. Besides the ravenous catcallers no decent men ever give me attention. And till now since I've been in non-lgbt spaces dating women has been impossible. In regards to preferences I also lean more towards women.

So I decide to try online dating, mostly Tinder.

At least 30% of users are bots. 

On the women's side, there's a lot of foreign students 'looking for friends' or someone to help with their English. But even a lot of the local women have on their profiles 'just looking for friends/new people'. Oh and of course 99% of them have an instagram link just to get a follow from you.

On the men's side.......I have to say that my physical attraction is equal to both sexes, but romantic preference is mostly women. A lot of the men show off with a lot of shirtless pics and make some very bold statements and assumptions on their profiles. And a lot of them STILL seem like they're mostly looking for instagram followers. 

But onto the real tea.

Talked to a girl for 2 days. She says 'You're quite the talker I see, I'll reply when I get back home cause I'm out'. And never contacts me again.

Talked to another girl for 3 weeks. She flirts a lot with me, we say good morning and good night every day. We exchange photography photos. On week 2 I make my move and ask to go on a date, and she seems enthusiastic. We delay for 1 week because of her work and the weather. Right before the day she cancels because of an 'emergency'. And then exactly an hour later admits it was an excuse and says it's because she's very shy. I worry that there's been some miscommunication since English is not her native language. I explicitly ask her if she wants to actually date me. And she replies with 'It's better if we talk here but you can message me any time', while still having the nerve to keep calling me 'dear'. Oh and of course she got me to follow her on instagram in the meantime.

I (26F) have been talking to someone (26M) since the start of the new year. We hit things off great we match personalities, both of us saying we’re interested in each other, the mood felt right. We met online, live thousands of miles apart, discussed possibility of an actual relationship if when we met was still the same energy. Made jokes about the future and summer adventures. Then we finally started talking about meeting, got his schedule to plan around and we haven’t really talked about much of anything since. He’s just seemed distant. He still texts me every morning and throughout the day but he just seems off. I like to think I’m pretty intuitive and an empath so I know since this change I’ve also been acting off because I don’t want to overstep a boundary or drive him away. 

We hadn’t really established anything about us aside from if things didn’t work out relationship wise we both certainly wanted to be friends because we get along well and enjoy each other’s company. I wanted to talk about him coming down when and the logistics, like how long, where are you staying, are you just coming down for me, etc. so I can plan accordingly and respect whatever he wants to do. We had poked fun about being up front with one and other about if the feelings change and I were no longer wanted around to please tell me. I can take a no and I don’t want to be strung along whatsoever, I’m an adult. So I’m just kind of confused as to what’s happening right now. It kind of catapulted from getting the schedule and me making a joke about him not liking me when he came down and sent something a friend had sent to me about “I’m going to warn you like I warn all my dates I’m repulsive in person” or something like that and he played it off.

Maybe the insecurity rubbed him wrong? Maybe he’s nervous? Like certain things he’s done since I’m like “nah, were okay”, and other things in like “maybe not?” I haven’t seriously attempted to date anyone in five years by my own choice so my mind is running tbh. I don’t want to straight up ask if he’s okay or “we’re” okay because is there really a we if we’re just talking but I’d rather actually talk beyond the superficial stuff and know what’s up rather than be dragged along just because he’s “too nice” to say anything.

If you read the entire story, thank you**

I’m a 28F, he’s a year younger than I am, and we have known each other since we were teenagers through a writing community online. We’ve kept in touch through socials, he lives states away from me but we were never anything more than just friends.

Last year in November, we met for the first time and there was an instant connection that I can’t explain.

From there, it all changed and I’ve met with him (stayed at his home for over a month) for the holidays (thanksgiving, Christmas and New Years) and could have sworn we were something. He treated me extremely well, something I was never used to from a previous 5 year relationship, and had promised me that he would treat me better and would never hurt me. I believed him because I’ve known him for a long time and thought his words were the truth.

The end of January of this year, I returned back to my state and we were keeping in touch through Discord, texting, and phone calls every single day.

But then in March he seemed to have slowly retracted and backed off from doing some specific things that I noticed instantly after days and weeks went by. He would still call me and watch anime with me over discord, but the meme sharing (we would send wholesome cute memes to each other) and Snapchat ceased and I started wondering why that is.

I’ve mentioned to him about my concerns and he would always reply to me saying it has nothing to do with me, and it’s him trying to “figure out his life” and that I’m doing absolutely nothing wrong. Fast forward to April, and I get a strange text from him saying “not to give into her” and answer him when he calls, telling me to call him an asshole and hang up. 

He later calls me after all of that explaining that he was with his ex (that he PROMISED me he would never talk to and that it was OVER before ever being involved with me) and they were at an appointment at an abortion clinic. She found out about me and physically abused him, then later found my socials and my number was given to her. I picked apart the pieces and put it all together before he fessed up to me about what he was doing the whole time he was involved with me, and I am beyond broken.

I don’t understand how you can show someone the world, but break their heart and lie to them because you can’t get over your abusive ex. I’m a very open and honest person, and thought he was the same. I wanted the best for him, and show him that he CAN be loved the correct way. But he took me for granted, and now I’m emotionally paying the price for thinking I could be there for someone that just didn’t value me the way that I thought he did.

This was the second person I’ve ever been involved with in my life, and I’m not sure I could go through something like this again. Trusting someone else is proving to be quite difficult and I can’t get over him. I feel like I lost a soulmate, and my best friend. A void I don’t think I could replace.

I grew up valuing a healthy relationship when I was around one, but I’m also cautious about how much I enable my boyfriend. 
By the time we marry, it would be the first time he would be back from school... I only get to see him 25% of the year and things are bound to be different. After all, I’m waiting for him for 5 years total of school... which i’m totally fine with. 

But i feel like i’m giving up too much getting married right after school, and he just gets so angry about it. I want to get married a little later, have kids a little later, and I want to be in a position where we can provide. 

Is it toxic for him to feel so irritated? I’ve communicated to him why I feel a particular way about things. I told him he just doesn’t accept me, he is ashamed of my religious differences with him. He hasn’t even told his parents, and I know the longer he waits the worse the outcome. They are very tight christians and I grew up where I was open to chose what I wanted. Went from Catholicism to agnostic / atheism.

He assumes his parents will not accept me, but then proceeds to correct himself later and say “they will support me and accept me”. Just that they “won’t understand our decisions” and he’s not okay with that when it comes down to it. I don’t know what he wants, just that he wants whatever his parents want for him. 

Which comes full circle and irritates me, I grew up knowing that you should focus on what you want in life. Not living up to someone else for image.. and everything he says contradicts with what I know.

At the end of the day, 
I love him. 
I have always accepted his religious beliefs despite the differences.
However, he has criticized my own and made me feel disgusting.
He tried to help me feel better, but gets angry and doesn’t know what to say majority of the time to make me feel better. I feel like a dirty secret...

I’m not sure if this relationship is worth it, what to do, I don’t know what to listen to.

I feel like if I do start talking to someone they would lose interest if I tell them I can’t afford to go out multiple times a month which is what everyone does at my age (22).

So i met this girl in an organization a few years ago. We hit it off pretty good. She seemed into me but i didnt act on it at the time. 1 year later i slid into her dms and we had a decent conversation but it didnt go anywhere. So i thought ok that was it, but then after 5 days of no contact she asked me out for a beer. We did. After that i tried asking her out again and she said yes, but flaked last second, she wanted alcohol or bring a gay friend. Which made it obvious for me she was nervous. This was august last year. So i gave up, but then started talking again in december, and we have talked since. Then she came over this weekend and we drank for like 9 hours and talked. We didnt even notice how fast the time was going. So she was about to leave, and ordered a taxi. She said she had to go in like 5, and then i said we have to do this first and went in for the kiss, we made out abit. And then she said she could stay over so she canceled the taxi. She slept over and we spooned and everything. In the morning and in the night prior she was literally insecure about everything, her laugh, i gave her gum in the morning, so she was like did my breathe stink, and asked if she snored etc. She blew me a kiss and left. After tho everything changed, she used longer to answer on snap and answered other people first. I said i had a great time and that ""time seems to fly by when were together"" and she said ""yeah its crazy, the time was suddenly 3 am"" Then i asked if she was free next week and she left me on opened. I tried again today to ask her if she was free next week, which she said she works the entire week, and i said we could just take a walk or something for a few hours, and she has left me on delivered, even tho shes been online and answering other people. Wtf should i do?

We would constantly fight, she would use her anger to manipulate me into feeling shame and guilt over a small issue that could have easily been resolved if she wanted to. She never communicated properly, my every attempt to communicate with her and resolve the issue was met with agression and disrespect. I was constantly being accused of lying over trivial things, of manipulating her when in reality... I was the one being emotionally manipulated the whole time

She was the one that broke up and looking back at our relationship I learned some very important things that I wanted to share with you people;

1. You never know you're in a toxic relationship until you're out of it

One of my best friends used to date a girl in high school that I didn't like. She would constantly disrespect him, belittle him in front of everyone. I saw that she was toxic but he didn't and it baffled me how he would endure her. My ex was simillar, but when you're ""wearing rose colored glasses"" you don't see that. You think ""this person loves me, surely he/she is not that bad, didn't mean to say that"" ect. The reality is this: if you're constantly anxious, afraid or feel bad... its bad for you, period. 

2. You can't help someone that doesn't want help

My ex is proud of herself for being ""cold"". She thinks that emotions will make you vulnerable and people will use that (even though she had no problems with expressing anger). In a healthy relationship people need to open up and be vulnerable because that's how your relationship grows. I tried to accept her and at the same time help her see that, I felt like I had that responisibility because I was her first serious partner. She saw this as manipulation and this brings me to my second point; the only person you can truly help is yourself, nobody else. It's their responsibility to work on themselves, not yours. If they ignore their problems, if they antagonize your effort, just walk away with grace and you will save yourself from even more heartache

3. Know the difference between being patient and enabling toxic behavior

In this relationship, I thought of myself as someone with a lot of patience. In reality, I never set my boundaries with this girl. I though everything would be ok if I could just love her more, give her more attention or change just one more thing about me. I was shifting my boundaries and becoming an inferior version of me everytime I did that. You need to respect yourself and set healthy boundaries because nobody else will do that for you if you don't. You need to love yourself the same way you expect others to love you. Have courage to walk away when someone doesn't respect your boundaries, it just means they choose not to treat you the way you deserve, their choice. Healthy relationships will accept that and encourage you to grow.

I have some more things but these are the most important. Knowing this girl was important to me  because it's been a life changing lesson and I am thankful for that. I hope some of you will find these advices useful",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,721941,public,self,Things you learn from toxic relationships,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mtb7n5/things_you_learn_from_toxic_relationships/,all_ads,6,dating,,,,
