I'm sort of short &amp; skinny 5'3 &amp; been between 100 lbs-115 lbs for the last 10 yrs! My measurements are 31-25-35 so small pear shape (maybe my small boobs are a turn off lol). I go to the gym often &amp; workout. I even have the outline of some abs going. I think my face looks alright. I have a slight overbite, but that's the only thing a bit unattractive I find about my face. 

I get told I look young for my age. Been told in my 20s I look anywhere from 13-19 yrs old. Maybe that's the deterant in person? I think I have decent style. I wear a little bit of every type of clothing, but I try to find things that fit me well. Like probably most anyone else sometimes I wear sweats, jeans/leggings &amp; a sweater, sports wear, dresses, skirts, crop tops &amp; shorts etc. depending on what I'm doing for the day. 

I have dark brown hair &amp; eyes &amp; pale skin. I had my hair long for yrs, but after bleaching &amp; dying it blonde &amp; red last yr I cut in short because it was breaking off from being damaged. I'm a little self conscious about it now. Maybe guys prefer girls with the pretty blue/green eyes? I wear light makeup. Usually foundation that matches my skin tone &amp; possibly some mascara. I'll put on more makeup if I have plans with someone. 

I'm outgoing &amp; often get told I'm really friendly. I also get told I'm funny, &amp; I think I have a good mixed sense of humor of silly &amp; sarcastic depending who I'm talking to. I don't get out in general much to the bar/club scene though because I usually hang out with friends one on one &amp; don't have a group of girls to go out with every weekend type of thing. 

I asked one of my guy friends to rate me once &amp; he said 7.5 &amp; also has told me not to be worried about approaching guys. 

All this being said I can count on one hand the amount of times I've been genuinely asked out. I've been on dates with only 3 people in my life. 

The usual type of guys I get are either 
• Guys 50 or older like the 80 yr old that hit on me at the gym &amp; told me he likes my ""school girl physique"", the 60 yr old customer at an old job that leaned on my cart &amp; said ""I see you here all the time. Your really pretty"" etc. 
• Broke guys that use me for money. ""Can I borrow $20 for gas money"" *sob story with it* 
• Clingy guys at jobs I've had that try to linger around me so much I start to get in trouble for them being around me &amp; not doing their work. 
• Married guys. A factory job I worked I swear the married guys there flocked to me. Lol 
• Guys that message me on social media like Instagram usually saying something like ""hey beautiful"" &amp; they're usually overweight. I mean, I honestly don't like my guys skinny skinny by any means, I like a little chunk, but they're like double chin overweight

All this makes me start to think people are lying when they say I'm attractive &amp; I must be ugly if guys never genuinely like me &amp; these are the type of guys I'm getting. I'm nervous that if I'm still single at 30 I'll be single forever.

Sure a great personality, manners alongside with ambitions is all considered attractive in a human but displacing the importance of physical appearance when entering the dating scene is absolutely absurd.

Okay, so I work at a retail store that has a coffee “hut” in the parking lot. It’s mainly for drive through but there is a walk up to another window for pedestrians to order. I go there on break or when I arrive and have been for a long time now. I talk to the baristas enough to know some more intimate details of their lives like one is moving out of the country with her fiancé at the end of summer. I come from a VERY small town, (sub 1,000) to me these people have become my “friends” to some degree. And I don’t know if that feeling is just because in a small town everyone is your friend to some degree? I even went and played disc golf with one of the male baristas on a day we had off. 

One of the baristas I’ve always thought was pretty (from the mask up) but I kinda always thought she was taken or just uninterested because she never really wanted to chit-chat with me which is fine. But as of late she started being more inquisitive, randomly asking me where I went to high school, what my favorite type of music, basic stuff. But it was a noticeable change in our interactions.

I’m the type where, I won’t ask out a woman when she is on shift. She’s just working, she is doing her job, any and everything I notice about her behavior could be basically be chalked up to customer service. A couple of the barista’s and I follow eachother on Instagram and in a quick bit I found her. I decided just following her and seeing what happened would be a more appropriate way to see if she was interested.

She followed me back but when I messaged her “how was your first day at work without a mask?” I was left on seen. 

Idk it feels like I messed up? Or maybe she doesn’t think much of it. But I feel a little embarrassed.

I feel like with this experience i can say that eventually you feel NORMAL being alone, as sad as this may sound. 

You dont feel bad on Valentine's Day or on your birthday, you just live through. 

Its like if you loose your emotions. I cant even find a better way than that to describe it. 

I cant say for every single person and their needs, but you CAN survive living lonely and alone. Even if it makes you depressed. 

I know the disappointment of going back from a date where not only goes wrong, but the girl abandons you in the middle of the date cause you are not a tall muscular hot guy. 

People can be mean to you and they dont really give a f*ck about it. 

I dont expect nothing from Tinder anymore, its always the same thing. 

What i realize is the less you show interest on a girl that REALLY IS into you, the more she will like you. If she is just needy she will forget you in a few days and move on. 

You can survive lonely, not being happy tho, but most of you will handle.

I'm a 17yo guy. I am preparing for a pretty important college entrance exam (JEE in India). I am a pretty good student and mostly the school topper. I really didn't enjoy online classes in lockdown and about October of last year I got into a relationship with a girl (Let's call her X)... 

 Her last bf of 3 years dumped her as he had to focus on his college career and exams. Also, the situation at her place is not that great and she's very disconnected from the rest of her family too. All this caused her to have major mental health issues and she's in depression and has abandonment issues as well... 

I really love her but our conversations are like i'm more of her therapist than her boyfriend and I really try to solve her issues or guide her through it. This is taking a toll on my mental health as well as studies. I'm usually a really cheerful guy who gets along with all the cliques in school but nowadays I rarely speak to anyone plus my marks have dropped from around 96/100 to 65/100.

I really care about her so i'm conflicted about what to do and how to break it to her or not...

Option 1: I continue the relationship but take a break of 6 months or so which will be extremely difficult for her as she's really attached

Option 2: I break up with her and focus on my studies and prioritize my mental health. If anything, I can try to patch up again after my exams if both of us are still interested.

Due to a stressful job and just not having a real dating pool to work with, I eventually deleted my Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, everything but Reddit. All I would see on these apps was stuff about dating, which was irrelevant to my life in a small town with basically just a job and a gym to go to. Also deleted them because they're kind of bad in general, a lot of toxicity. 

But I'm going to a pretty big college in a big city in August. I'm attractive, and I work out (not saying that to brag, only for context). Idk if or when I might date. But the world, especially among teens and 20-somethings, largely uses social media for socializing and for being seen online by potential partners. I've heard that some people in my age range (I'm 24) consider someone without social media as strange or anti-social. When I had deleted my social media accounts, I still had Tinder for a while, and a girl I matched with seemed to want to know me better. She asked me to chat with her on Instagram. I told her I deleted it, that I got sick of social media. Then she unmatched me, as if to think I was a creepy scammer. So social media seems like a must-have. 

I really don't miss having social media, I feel happier without it. But it could be a seen negatively somehow by potential partners. Can you realistically date people today with just texting and phone calls? Would someone I meet in college react negatively if I say I don't do social media?

He said he’d drive close to my area but there isn’t anything to do so I suggested to meet in the city area for coffee in the morning as Sunday is a bit of busy day to get organised for the work week, basically I was the one making compromises and then I didn’t hear back for 5 hours today so I just deleted him from Instagram, bumble and told him it’s not gonna work because he didn’t really organise anything and last weekend he seemed keen to meet and then he never put in plans into action this weekend and I felt lied to and truth is I do and I feel manipulated because one minute it is we can do this together and we can do that together but there was no effort really, just a lot of talk and that gives me the message he wasn’t very interested, so maybe my reaction was for the best!

I'm also educated to masters level, have a good career, and can hold a proper conversation.

I often have no problem talking to and making friends with women who are already in relationships, but it feels like women who are single just shut down conversation with me before it can even start. When I do have a conversation with them they give closed answers and seem unsure, and or unwilling  to talk. Needless to say this makes it impossible to find a girlfriend. This usually applies to dating apps as well.

I'm not big-headed about my looks, but as I say, the consensus among people I know is that I'm very handsome. Could this be a put-off to single women? Player vibes? Too intimidating? I have no idea, it makes no sense. But all I know is that I can definitely hold my own in a social setting, so I'm pretty sure my social skills aren't the problem.

Slim guy. 


an independent, ambitious and jovial person with zeal to live life at the fullest. I have learnt to value every single moment of life and most out of it. I do believe in big dreams but also find happiness in small things in life rather than waiting for something big every time to enjoy. I consider myself as social and approachable guy. I have been raised in traditional values and I cherish and value relationships.

I like listening to Punjabi music, travelling, socializing with friends and family. I like to invest my free time in learning something new or watch comedy shows instead of frivolous or fault finding. I do not have long list of attributes but looking for kind-hearted, fun loving person with a calm demeanor. Life is an undulating journey, for which I am seeking a life time friend with whom I can explore it, so as to make this journey a vacation.

Apologies for the long post which I am typing on my phone. I (F24) been seeing this guy (M28) for about 8 months now. Let’s call him John. My last relationship ended rather badly when I realized that my then-boyfriend of nearly 2 years was cheating on me with his secretary. After that ended, I could not muster the courage to date again for over a year and a half. Then I met John at a mutual friend’s birthday party. We exchanged numbers and it just took off from there, I guess. John is my second serious boyfriend. I have had a couple of casual hookups apart from these two, and that’s it. 

The thing is, John is VERY attractive. Have you seen couples where you wondered ‘how did THIS guy land that gorgeous woman?!’. That’s kinda the story of my life, in reverse. Other women do not hesitate to make a move on him. In his own admission, he has been groped, touched, and kissed without consent multiple times. And when he recoils or pulls away, some women have followed him. He has been followed all the way home by women on at least two occasions. 

Once, I was 10 minutes late to a date due to traffic and when I reached, a couple of women were already flirting with him. One of them handed him her number AFTER she saw me. She actually accosted him in the mens’ room, handed her number over, and smirked at me before leaving the restaurant. 

I am no butterface, but this guy is WAYYY out of my league looks wise. I try to laugh it off when things like that happen, but it is getting to me. He swears he does not enable it, but I do not see him discouraging such women either. How difficult is it to say ‘no thanks, I have a girlfriend?!’. And he is way more sexually experienced. His partners have gone to extreme lengths to please him, and have done acts that frankly disgust me. 

Our sex life is great, but he has asked me to do things that I am not comfortable with. He asked me to rim him once, and when I refused, he just laughed and said ‘well, you will eventually’. And on another occasion, he opened what he calls his ‘panty drawer’ that had no less than 25 panties, thongs etc. in it. Yes, they were from the women he slept with previously. They are his ‘war trophies’, and he refuses to throw them out. I am so tempted to check his phone too, but nothing is out of place yet that suggests I should. Plus, the idea of invading his privacy like that is revolting to me. What should I do? Put my foot down and insist he push back on unwanted advances? Be the obsessed, insecure girlfriend and keep him on a tight leash? Or just play it cool? My older, married sister has met him and has said it is just a matter of time before he cheats.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,847054,public,nsfw,I (F24) need some advice.

We went to see the sunset on Thursday and I packed a picnic. It was lovely. And then last night we went to the mall and then drinks with same (mutual) friend. 
So where I’m a little confused. Beach Thursday we got touchy after about two hours and I enjoyed it. Yesterday wasn’t as touchy, but it was daylight and we were either in the car or out in public so I get it. When we went to the first place for drinks, I felt some distance once his friend arrived. He kissed me goodnight at the end of it all but the last hour just felt a little odd. How do I not overthink this and just enjoy each other without trying to overthink everything. I’m 23F btw and he is 25M. Do I ask him to hang out again? Also do “summer flings” just naturally become so or do you have to declare it?

We took a mini break because he was overwhelmed with work and wanted to take a break where we could do whatever we wanted.

Well, the break lasted maybe a month or so before he came back saying he really needed someone like me in his life blah blah. We have decided to give it another chance. We went back to talking everyday.

We are long distance, but we managed to see each other every few weekends and via Skype. He said he’s not ready to be in a relationship yet because he can’t commit to the effort and time. 

Yesterday, I saw him active on the dating app because I went on to unsubscribe since I was getting charged out the ass. I confronted him about it and he told me he got a match from when he was on there while we were on a break so he went to look. I assumed he was lying so I told him that he’s a 30 yo grown ass man now and literally everything he does at this point is a choice.

I told him I don’t appreciate him going on the dating apps but he keeps claiming that he hasn’t swiped since we started talking again. He also threw in my face that we aren’t exclusive and until we are in a relationship, I’m allowed to do as I please. 

This completely threw me off guard because I thought we were already exclusive based off the way we interacted with each other. His family knows about me, I’ve met his friends, etc.

Within the 5 months we’ve known each other, we’ve only had sex once so I know he isn’t just interested in that. We’re also going to his friends house in another city next weekend to see him and his girlfriend.
