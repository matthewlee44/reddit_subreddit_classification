I was also considering gifting him 2 concert tickets ($30/each) to a band I know he likes so he can take a friend. We had discussed buying the tickets prior but I have another show the same night so I can‚Äôt make it.

I am 27M and just started seeing a 27F we have been on two dates so far I have a strong suspicion that she is seeing other guys (always online on dating site) which is ok, her right etc.

The thing is she barely initates any texting at all, when I message her she does reply normally around like 4 hours later etc but never develops into a conversation, on the dates we have has a good time but don't feel or at least having seen any signs that she is into me, although she has agreed to see me for the third time.

I feel like if I am just an option or backup etc, I don't won't to be in that position, in my eyes she either shows interest and initates also etc or no Bueno, doesnt feel like she is actively trying to get to know me at all.

I texted if you are interested in meeting up on the weekend let me know when you are free and she said I'd like that and Saturday?

I don't want to seem needy but at the same time don't want to be an option or something she isnt actively trying to date etc. 

So in your opinion should send a text of sorts too her or, just stop texting completely and if she initiates after a while maybe say something like, I see that I am always initiating contact or trying to to to know you, if your not interested tell me :)

I paid last time. and im happy to pay again. she want sto meet tomorrow and Im thinking shes still trying to push it to a relationship and im trying to stay friends. shes also lonely and I think she likes my company as I do hers. but we also talk throughout the day and I know shes aiming for that. 

I feel bad for using her. we hugged a lot but I did not kiss her and I restrained myself. I need a friend so badly after the hell ive went through. I also think it will help me cut some of my neediness when meeting other women so I dont seem desperate. once im in it and get topped off with some time spent together I will be good. its not that I need attention. its that I need to love another. it makes me feel good to love.  corny",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1019004,public,self,2 different expectations. dick move on my part?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/psm627/2_different_expectations_dick_move_on_my_part/,all_ads,6,,,

We really got to delve deep into each other and find out everything, and eventually we started hooking up. When we were friends, he told me all about his past dating experiences and talked about girls pretty openly. He told me some messed up stuff‚Ä¶ he was dating a girl for a couple of years and while he was with her he had crushes on other girls and constantly checked out other women.

I started falling for him pretty quickly. We were best friends, and combine that with sex, it was feelings right away.

Like we didn't know if I was going to have this job I was trying to get (something much better than what I had before), my mom stopped helping at all with practicing driving and we didn't know how I was really going to get my car. She cares a lot about me and wants my life to go well so all of this was really putting a huge stress on her, especially the driving practice cause it felt like she was the only person supporting me. Like I was super reliant on her and if I didn't have her then I'd have nobody. She's also had two like really major traumatic events happen to her in the past and one of them related to having someone like that in her life. Someone who's dependant on her and only her. So that was already a pain for her, but then we went on a trip to upstate. The trip had me, her, her brother and her mom. Now is also in a relationship with a girl. This is gonna be pretty important later but I wanna tell it in the way that it happened. So yea my gf and I were out at some point, just hanging out and trying to find something to do and while we were out she told me that she wanted to talk about us. So of course I said yea let's talk, she started saying that she wasn't really sure anymore about us. That she wasn't sure where we'd be going or how much further she could go with me. I didn't really press for much more than that and I just kinda agreed while trying to not show my sadness at this sudden revelation. We left it in that kind of up in the air situation and went on with our day on the trip while trying to be more apart. Night came and we were hanging out in a room alone, so we talked about it more. She started venting about so many very personal things to me, her traumas and how much it hurts and affects her  to this day. How it bothers her that it has influence on how she's acting while she's with me, that she doesn't want to put me through that and through her moods that she'd always say switches so much. That she needed time and space so that she could go see a professional about this and work through it, to better herself. Of course I tried to reassure her of some certain insecurities, then she asked me if I'd wait for her while she did all this. Even if we weren't going to be really together, that I'd hold onto us. It sounded like just a break so I agreed, vehemently agreed. It was only space. So we sort of made up but after that night I was still left in the dark about where exactly we were at, so then the trip ends and we go back home. Things are still weird. She offers to come over and hang out in the morning right? So I, wanting to clarify everything about where we were and everything else, agreed immediately and was like ""totally yes come over."" So she came over and after a bit of a tension breaker with a board game, we started talking. I asked the big question. ""What are we right now? What are we going to be?"" And she explained everything. You see on the trip, she started to reevaluate everything about our relationship because her brother and  his gf both have really good paying jobs and are moving in together and are a really good couple. Now this is important because on revaluation of a lot for her, my Gf realized that it's that type of relationship that she wants. One that she can envision her partner being stable, having and maintaining a house, being responsible, wanting to move in together. A partner that can plan a getaway trip or even just small things like going out for a dinner every now and then. A mature relationship. She didn't see that in me. She loved me, she loved who I am and all those immature pieces of me. The ditzyness, being aloof, having the child-at-heart wonder, being grounded and seeing things one day at a time and giving her complete unconditional love and support and freedom. That she loved all of that when she first met me and she wouldn't change that for the world cause, in her words, it was all of that that helped her relearn how to love herself. But because she does now, she had the chance to see that it's that relationship that her brother has with his gf that she really wants. That would truly make her happy. Before, with one of the guys that she had a past with, they had offered her a life and relationship like that. But she wasn't ready, she felt like she was rushing through maturity and that she forcing herself to try and grow to meet him. Now though, she is ready for that. She's ready for moving forward in her life and she doesn't want to drag me along for it since I'm not there yet. Since I live my life so slow and she lives here so much faster than me. Since she knows how it feels to force yourself to grow. I told her that, in reverse, I'd also hate to force her to wait and suffer that agonizing feeling of stillness while your partner tries to catch up to you. To feel so limited in scope because the person you love just isn't there enough to see that. It's because of that that she couldn't stay with me. That we had to end it. She asked me how I felt about it and I told her that I, honestly, felt so awful. Just a full body dread and sadness. Then she said that I shouldn't be sad, that we'd still have that bond. She said that nobody else could call her bt her nickname the way I do, that nobody else was allowed into her headspace as much as I was and that I'll always have her. Of course I couldn't fathom how I shouldn't be sad about being broken up with, so I said that even though it may be true I can't help but feel this sadness. That I'm not gonna have her in the same way. But she was adamant about not feeling that way, so I said something so so stupid. I told her ""Hey it's okay, don't worry about me I'll just get over it in a couple days you know me."" Of course that was a complete lie, but I didn't want her to be thinking of me. To worry about me or anything. That kind of settled things and she left, the days following were so awful. I had an unending weight on me, every day I woke up and had to go to work. I'd see her and feel nothing but despair, thinking of how I couldn't make her laugh like before, that I wouldn't see her in the mornings, see her smile like that, hear her say my name all concerned when I say something stupid or act ditzy, about how much I loved her. I didn't really know it at the time but all the dread also came from all the things I left unsaid. After nearly a week and a half of just feeling straight up awful and practically avoiding her to keep from feeling that way I got the chance to talk to her again. I had to ask her a favor to take me to get my cut since I didn't have my car just yet, she also had some errands to run so it worked out and we met up and hung out while doing all that. When we were done we started talking about everything, I admitted that I lied through my teeth. That it was going to take so much more to just get over her and maybe I wouldn't really get over her ever. Just cause of how big of an impact she had on me and how much she changed for me. I truly don't think I'd have pushed as hard as I had to get where I am now without her. Maybe I'd still be here, just not as fast. That I introspected about all the flaws in my life and in my environment and how badly that definitely would have affected her. She told me more about how my mom's sneaking around with stuff around me also really bothered her. It's a little unavoidable too since I currently live with her. Especially since before I let her pretty much walk all over me. I told her that I missed her, I missed talking to her and being able to look at her and hear her be happy and see the way she looked at me when we were even just friends. That the lie I said was just to hopefully help. She told me that, of course, it only really hurt her since it sounded like I didn't care or that it didn't mean much to me. Now obviously that wasn't true so I just reassured her of that and said that even if it was just friends I just wanted her back in my life again. She agreed to that too. I got to think about it a lot myself too and draw my own conclusions and now I just feel that I care about her. I genuinely love her. I want the best for her and I want her to do whatever will make her happy and feel fulfilled. But it's because of all that, because of all that care I hold for her, that I can't be with her. The picture she has for herself, for her life and her partner? It doesn't include me, at least not in that way. It's a bittersweet acceptance. That I can't be that for her, I can't be what she wants and what will make her truly happy and that's why I have to let her go and let her grow away from me. But it's the best for her and I love her, so I need to be content with her going away. I'm sad and happy at the same time cause at least now I know that, despite us not being together, she can go on to become even more amazing. To find more joy, to help herself more, to find someone perfect for her. Even if it isn't me. It's been a month and a week and a half since all this happened, we're better than before in terms of talking and stuff like that. We're back to being good friends, I have my car, my new job and my old job. I still have my hobby of gaming and am trying to pick up playing keyboard and driving for fun. Even with all this, it's like I can't stop thinking of her. I can't stop feeling this inkling, a leak of sadness that keeps dropping small bits of it through everything I do. She's done so much for me, means so much to me, I loved and love her so much. Part of me wants it to disappear, but at least this means that it was all so real. Maybe it's better that I never forget how I felt or feel now, so that I never forget how good she is to me.

Went to the fair and had a fun time on our 1st date, and have two more planned this week, one being a formal dinner. She's about 30 minutes away and a single mom.

At 34 I have never put much effort into pursuing relationships, I have dated sometimes when I am bored and had relationships when they just sort of happened but recently I have had some kind of crisis. 

I took out a loan and bought motorbikes and never am at home, always out with people, trying new things. I started noticing that I am getting increasingly more angry and crying over stuff that really shouldn't be a big deal and generally noticed I am actually quite depressed. After a particularly bad day I drove home crying for hours and wished that I had someone who I could turn to, eat pizza with, watch junk on telly, have sex and cuddle and that would make me feel better. Since this I realised that I have been craving intimacy for a long time and been in denial. Initially I felt better cos great now I can do something about it but it is getting to the point where I am actually angry and tearful a lot. I had a dating experience with a guy who is confusing me, told me he wants to be exclusive but isn't making any effort to arrange a date and I feel neglected and ignored. I have said to him I need to arrange a date to feel connected to him and he has read my message but not replied. I am craving sex and cuddles so bad I can't even masturbate or watch porn without crying.

I feel like I am losing my marbles and am desperate for that kind of intimate connection with someone. How do I cope with this? I feel like feeling this desperate will kill off any chances to meet someone!

Initially, it seemed like she was pretty into me as we‚Äôd text all through the night on many occasions, I also noticed she added me to her close friends list on Instagram almost straight away when we were both at home (she‚Äôs from Greece and I live in the U.K.). We‚Äôve been speaking from early July till now which is a total of more than 2 months. The only problem is, I never seemed to get past first base in the sense that our conversations were often very basic and superficial and was rarely anything deep or complex so I felt we never really connected on THAT level. Most of our convos would just be asking how we were doing that day and what we were up to and she would send me videos of what she was doing and I would do the same. Due to the nature of the conversation, there were periods that our chat was pretty dry which then made me say things to close it (and just wait till we went back to university to talk again just to not drag things out) but she would keep it going. I saw this as her continued interest. However, I noticed she started this habit of blocking me from seeing her stories and then re-adding me again after a period of time. I first noticed this when she posted a story but my signal wasn‚Äôt strong enough to view it so I waited till later to check and saw that it had disappeared. I then went to her page to check the story and saw nothing there. I noticed that she had some story highlights previously and they all vanished. I asked her and she said she deleted the stories. The next day (after 24 hours) I suddenly saw her  highlights again when I checked her page. I googled this and saw that when someone blocks you from seeing their story, you‚Äôre also unable to see their highlights. I kept talking to her anyway but realised a marked change in her texts. She would now take much longer to respond and usually ignore half of what I‚Äôd written and only answer to one part with one liners. 
Again, I saw her post a story which I couldn‚Äôt load because of my signal and then when I went to view it later on, I noticed it was gone and her story highlights had disappeared again. 
Just out of curiosity I followed her on my second account and she accepted and I saw that she was truly hiding stories from me although she was still replying to my messages.

I can understand if she‚Äôs no longer interested but she has almost 10k followers so I just don‚Äôt understand why she‚Äôd specifically hide them from me. And what I‚Äôm more perplexed about is the fact that she does it on and off. So sometimes she‚Äôs okay with me seeing them but not other times? And it‚Äôs not like there‚Äôs something crazy she‚Äôs hiding as the stories I‚Äôm seeing from the 2nd account that she‚Äôs hiding from  me are the same ones she usually posts. 

TL:DR; met and hooked up with a girl on the last day of semester and have been speaking to her all summer and noticed she has been constantly hiding and unhiding her Instagram story from me. She‚Äôs showed less interest recently but don‚Äôt understand why she keeps hiding stories and then changing her mind about unhiding them.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1019106,public,self,Why did she block me from seeing her Instagram story?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/psnwmi/why_did_she_block_me_from_seeing_her_instagram/,all_ads,6,,,

I‚Äôm (29M) dating a girl (24F) I met OLD. In nearly a month we‚Äôve hung out 4 times for 3 dates and two of the nights she came to my place. We‚Äôre both busy adults so I only plan our dates on the weekend. In between seeing each other we don‚Äôt communicate much. From my point of view I would send her enthusiastic messages and she would reply with short/dry texts. Then I‚Äôd back off because I was thinking maybe she‚Äôs not that into me so I‚Äôd text her less and try to reciprocate her energy. 

Apparently her point of view is different. On our last date Saturday, I asked her to meet up with me at a nice spot in the city to grab a drink. She agreed but said she had to meet her friends at 10. Our date was going great! But at one point the topic of our communication got brought up. She said that she told her friends that we don‚Äôt talk much, she made it seem like it was my fault. She said ‚Äúoh I know you‚Äôre busy with work‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt want to bother you‚Äù she‚Äôs also told me on multiple dates now that‚Äôs she‚Äôs surprised I asked her out again and that‚Äôs part of the reason she doesn‚Äôt text me much. I told her yeah I get busy but I‚Äôll make time for you. I also said of course I keep taking you out, we have a really good time together, you‚Äôre funny, beautiful, etc ‚Ä¶ So anyways we both agreed that we will put in more effort to talk to each other. We admitted that we aren‚Äôt the best texters as well so I told her I‚Äôll call her too. 

So the night goes on. Our conversations started to heat up so around 8:30pm I asked her if she wanted to go back to my place (I live an hour away) she said yes and I asked what about your friends you‚Äôre supposed to meet at 10? She said they‚Äôll be fine. (I should note this is the third time she‚Äôs had plans with her friends but chose to hangout with me instead) We took separate cars so we both drove an hour back to my place. When we lay in bed together I try making a move but she tells me she‚Äôs on her period. We‚Äôve hooked up before so I‚Äôm questioning why this girl really just ditched her friends and drove a whole hour to just stay the night with me??? It‚Äôs confusing. I was convinced she just wanted to go on fun dates and hook up with me. We literally don‚Äôt talk much outside of our dates and every time we meet up I feel like it‚Äôs a first date all over again. 

So anyways she stays over and we cuddle all night. She doesn‚Äôt leave until almost 11am. This was sort of a problem for me because I was supposed to pick up my friends at 1:30pm to go to a music event in the city but I didn‚Äôt say anything. We‚Äôre running late and I obviously am busy out with my friends all day so I don‚Äôt text the girl that I‚Äôm dating. 

So it‚Äôs Monday and I text her a nice message. Basically I fill her in on what I did Sunday and that next time I go to an event I‚Äôd like her to come with me and I know she‚Äôd love it! And of course she doesn‚Äôt reply. 

So later that day I post all my videos out with my friends on my IG story. I‚Äôm not sure if this would affect anything but my friends I went out with were girls (just friends) and the videos were of us dancing together and having fun (nothing sexual or grinding) Btw I know some girls get jealous so on our date I did let her know I‚Äôm going out with my friends who are all girls. Anyways the girl I‚Äôm dating looked at my IG stories every time I would post something new but still ignored my text.

Today is Tuesday and she still hasn‚Äôt replied. So idk what to do. It‚Äôs odd that she told me I‚Äôm too busy and I don‚Äôt text her like it was my fault. So I put in effort and she ignores me. I also find it strange that she would want to ditch her friends just to spend the night with me, a guy she barely knows and not even get sex out of it. She came over to cuddle for over 12 hours so that makes me think she must have some feelings for me. But if that‚Äôs the case, why not text me back??

So do I keep waiting for her to respond? Do I put in more effort even though she doesn‚Äôt do the same? Or should I just move on and let her go?

However, I've noticed that I have this constant, burning desire for companionship. Be it in the form of love or sex. I started beating myself up for not getting laid enough. All day I lament the fact that I have no one texting me etc. I'll save you every unhealthy thinking behaviour I get into, but I will say that I have eventually been sucked into the FA subreddit (as well as this one, which has similar posts, albeit with more advice which is shot down) and end up feeding off the miserable loops of self condemnation to an eternity of solitude. Now, I have been quite successful in my dating life as a person, and have very little right to start feeling sorry for myself. So I began trying to analyse why I felt this constant emptiness within me. I call it 'the craving'. It also extents to friends and 'fun' in general. 

I think what I've identified as 'the craving' is directly linked to my childhood neglect (parents worked a lot, divorce at 9, lots of ugly details in between). It's extremely difficult to put into words, but I feel a constant crying out inside of me of something that is unattainable. When I read about FA people on forums, be it here or on that subreddit, the endless desperate, hopelessly frustrated cries for love and attention speak of a sadness far deeper than a simple lack of love. I will not sit here and pretend to understand the pain that being romantically unsuccessful so late in life is like, I imagine it is excruciating. However, the fact that I relate to their feelings despite having been very successful in this sphere of life says betrays quite a lot about my own way of thinking. I know many unattractive people who are romantically/sexually unsuccessful and are not consumed by feelings of inadequacy, frustration, sadness and desperation in their every waking moment. However, as I lurk on such forums, I start to believe this is the norm. 

And thus, what they perceive to be 'hollow' suggestions to self-improve and fix their issues from 'normal' people are, in fact, completely correct. However, they may also be incredibly difficult to achieve. The foundations for inner peace must, unfortunately, be laid in childhood. I am not condemning anyone to an eternity of suffering. However, I'm acknowledging the scars that a not-ideal upbringing can leave. As I have them myself and they affect me every day. It would be much easier to put a plaster over it with love and sex. I believe this is the trap that I have once again fallen into. For many of you this may be a 'yeah duh' post, and this is something I acknowledged myself very early on in life when I judged people who stayed in abusive relationships. However, I've fallen into the trap myself. I may be completely wrong about this, but I hope I'm not because it will allow me to stop judging my perceived lack of romantic success so harshly and find other joys in life.

I'm rolling up to mid 30s myself or as some might call it the golden age where dating is 20s, 30s &amp; 40s for me üòåüôÑ 

What I can't help but notice swiping Tinder;

- 20s are all self prescribed models with poses, glamour shots and the oozing sex pics... surprisingly the local store clerk seems to live the life of a socialite based on that 

- 40s is all natural photos, no crazy over sexualization, no modelesque behavior, but not to say some aren't extremely beautiful! ...More tame with less staging for pics

- 30s is a mix of both above, can go both ways (not just saying their bi üôÉ) some go all wannabe models with sexualized photos each in a little itty bitty bikini striking poses like it's yoga class others just are out and about and simply beautiful in their pics without the amp up

Depending on what age range app is set to this rings true... is this just generational? 

What is it, 20s are finding themselves and grown in this overexposed life of wanting to portray themselves one way, are 30s just transitional, whereas 40s are self actualized to an extent. Or is it just the difference in the overall times we've grown up in? Some might argue that 40yr olds now would've done the same if they grew up in current times and were in their 20s... most likely

Does anyone know if there are any apps out there specifically designed for minorities (mixed raced here)?

I've used bumble, tinder, and hinge but I hardly get any matches. Granted, I do live in a predominantly white society (UK). Most white women I believe do not find me attractive, which is fair enough as they are entitled to have their own preference. Ironically, I do get interest from women when they see me in person, but the problem is I don't really go out much as it isn't my personality. I think people that use those apps subconsciously fall into the trap of racial bias, but that's   a whole other topic that I do not want to get into.

Back to the original problem, there aren't that many female minorities on those apps in general, and I feel like my dating life would be a lot better if someone designed a dating app for that market.

I didn‚Äôt expect it to be a date but he kissed me and bought me dinner. It was a great date and he wasn‚Äôt expecting anything after the date if you know what I mean. He even joked saying he wanted to marry me. The conversation flowed and we were both flirtatious. We then went on another date and he picked me up and we went for a walk.

I initially thought there is no way this is going to work but he was very very persistent on wanting me to go visit him. Even though I really wanted to, I was scared of Covid (this is when it first started) and I never flown on a plane alone before. He was understanding that I wanted to wait and said that he would make me feel comfortable once I was there. But after a while, I continued to say no because I was terrified. Not only because of Covid but because our two best friends (Mike and Alana) aren‚Äôt dating anymore. I brought up to my friend that Eric reached out to me and she freaked!

Eric felt really bad for what he did and acknowledged what he did was wrong. So now, Alana, alanas friend, and that boyfriend, does not like him. This puts me in an uncomfortable situation. Eric and I are in our mid to late twenties and this situation happened when I was 18. Do I think what he did was wrong, of course. Even after it happened, Alana encouraged me to hook up Eric. 

Someone in his family passed away and he came back up to my state for the services. He invited me to go but again, covid. He invited me to see his friends and family.

Anyways, Eric and I went our separate ways again and he got a girlfriend. They broke up a couple months ago and he reached out to me a few weeks ago. Since then we have been talking.

I don't like getting treated as an option, I don't like having to bend to men's whims and schedules when they don't do the same for me, and I don't like constantly feeling evaluated and not being made to feel like I'm measuring up.

My ex boyfriend is now in prison due to killing the next girlfriend he had 3 weeks after I escaped the relationship - he gave her fentanyl. 

Almost instantly after the cycle ended and I was free and sober, I did a lot of casual dates and had some casual flings to try to help myself find my power back in myself - then quarantine happened. I had a lot of forced time spent by myself feeling nothing but guilt, disgust in my behavior during the time of the relationship and after adding meaningless bodies, and that‚Äôs when the reality kicked in that I was traumatized.

She lied to me about so much, and I really should hate her, and I think I did for a while. It was a pretty bad breakup involving lots of tears, blocking each other, unfollowing social media accounts, and way too many people knew about it. 
And then I processed, healed, forgave her, but I‚Äôm not sure that I‚Äôve forgiven myself. I ‚Äòmoved on‚Äô, found someone else, and she‚Äôs really great and everything. She‚Äôs a lot of things my ex wasn‚Äôt, and vice versa, in a good way, mostly.
Is it possible that even though I‚Äôm in a new relationship now and I wanna believe I love my new gf, that I‚Äôm still not over my ex? That maybe I‚Äôm even still in love with her somehow? I actually miss her, I‚Äôm not even gonna lie. I know I shouldn‚Äôt, because she‚Äôs obviously happy with who she is now and living her best life.
I sometimes honestly feel like I couldn‚Äôt love anyone as much as I did her again. And I‚Äôve been looking for a place to rant about this all day, but there‚Äôs really no one I can talk to about this because I‚Äôve convinced them all I‚Äôve completely moved on.
But as much as I try to convince myself I‚Äôm over her, I still get lost in thought and memories and would-have-beens so many times in a day, which probably isn‚Äôt healthy.

We went out casually together and immediately clicked and after the third date he asked me if I was willing for something more. I did feel we moved pretty fast but we ended up being great together and helped each other in pretty low points of our lives. I didn't even realize it but we were seriously committed, he moved in and we shared our daily routines around each other. We shared loads of same interests and we helped each other through difficult times. It was both of our very first times dating someone and I thought I'd found the person I was looking for. He was very affectionate and gave me a lot of support. But after our first year together he started acting hostile towards me and pushing me away. I always gave him his space and did whatever I could to support and help him. I am a reserved person and dont make friends easily so it was getting increasingly difficult to understand what I should do and had no one to ask for advice. Eventually he broke up with me and I don't know where it went wrong and sadly still have the same feelings for him as I did a year ago. 

Tldr; my first time getting broken up with and I still find myself very attached to the person.
