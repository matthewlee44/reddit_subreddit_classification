He also posts emotional videos about loosing a spouse. He still has her wedding dress and other personal items around the house. 
I don’t think he is ready for a new relationship, even though it’s been 4 yrs, he is also OCD which I think may also be hindering him/ causing him not to be able to move on.

3,rkgllr,1639981527,How can I find my type as an introverted gamer?,"So my question is how do I find my type as an introverted gamer?
My type is someone who is basically just a female version of me personality wise.
But look wise that is definitely a hard one lol, but I will definitely not date someone who is fat with a crap ton of acne on their face, I’m the kind of guy who would probably date someone who has a good looking body and an innocent smile.
So where exactly can I find my type, the first few things that come to my mind are gaming conventions and game stores but I bet there is more than those two.
TBH some things that I really want to do is become a game designer, an author, a digital artist, possibly an animator etc.
So maybe there are some places where I can meet people that also want to do some of the same stuff that I want to do.
(Side note: I absolutely loathe online dating, I have done absolutely nothing but waste my time on them and will hopefully never try them out again for multiple reasons that I will not go into, however someone suggested a website for me called meetup.com where you can meet people and from what I can tell it’s not specifically designed for finding dates, it is designed for finding pretty much anyone, but literally every event that I’ve came across has like 4 attendees or below, like bruh is this site a f*cking ghost town.

i had my first kiss freshman year of college (lol) and basically it went bad because the guy just wanted to hookup. im already super reserved around guys but i think that incident made me put my walls up even more because i don’t wanna go through that hurt again. i haven’t done anything with a guy since but the older ive gotten the more i think there’s something wrong with me. i wish i wasn’t so reserved with guys but it’s really just the way i am. i don’t think ill ever find a guy who will be patient enough for me to get comfortable. i think im just scared of getting close to guys because i don’t wanna get hurt. im someone who loves deeply and i just know a breakup would completely ruin me. 

i understand and well aware that a lot of not being able to find a bf is my fault. im always too shy to start the conversation or anything like that. im honestly trying to get better at it but at this point i don’t even have anyone interested in me. im also not a fan of dating apps and hope to meet someone organically like through mutual friends. 

sorry if this is all over the place, just been really thinking if there’s something wrong with me and it’s really been messing with my head.

After spending the last year working on myself so I could be in a healthier relationship I think it is finally paying off. I met a man in October and at first I wasn’t too sure I was into him. I typically go for eccentric arrogant men, and he was the complete opposite. He was shy, kind, and open to commitment. Now we are officially together, and the amount of support I receive from him is unlike anything I’ve ever felt. I actually trust him. When I go home at night, I am at peace knowing that I have a partner I can turn to. I don’t feel alone anymore. I don’t feel like I have to carry the weight on my shoulders. I have someone to help me carry the burden. We have been taking things fairly slow. But I honestly feel like I understand what it is suppose to feel like now. I think I’ve only known superficial, passionate, and toxic love. Before all of my relationships would be focus around my partner’s needs and not my own. Now it feels like it is about us. It feels so good. I feel like my eyes are open. Has anyone else ever gone through this? I don’t know if me and this guy will last forever. But if anything, I am so thankful to feel this with someone.

We're not from the same school and he lives like an hour drive from where I am from. We didn't formally met and interact but I grew a crush on him.

I admit I stalked his socials and view every highlighted stories and stuff. I kept visiting his profile on and back.  I grew a bit of an obsession for him in short span of time and I also liked him despite I can only see him through social medias. Based on his profile I didn't see any hint that he got a girlfriend like not even one, he didn't even mention anyone. But now a week later since I followed him, stalking and kept viewing his stories and my day. He began posting about this particular girl and limiting me and delimited after two days(that means I can't search for his profile anymore in fb) He then mentioned this girl, I presume, for the first time in fb for a sweet post, and one of his friend commented 'the girl from the south will probably be dead jealous' I am certain he's referring to me since I am from the southern area of the province and he's from the north. 

Based on one of the comments I found out that the girl was his ex. Just now, I again visited his profile and found that he un followed me in ig and blocked me in facebook.

#Background:
----

I have long believed that meeting a potential date in person is the premier way to initiate a relationship. Not only is it a massive compliment to her when done properly, but it's also a huge demonstration of confidence on your part.

As a 23 year old man who can turn on the charisma when necessary, but who generally avoids social settings (hi, welcome to Reddit!), I've always been conscious of girls I *could* approach publicly, but of course have rarely done so. Nonetheless, it's something I fully intend to practice and become comfortable with as I grow and age.

#The Story
---

I had a flight to catch back home today, and I arrived at the airport early. I made it through security and noticed a cute girl in an adjacent line. I considered asking her out for coffee on the spot - I always tease myself about being dramatically bold, but of course didn't go through with this one.

I hunted around for a quick breakfast before my flight and decided on Starbucks. Wouldn't you know it, that cute girl happened to pop in line *directly* behind me. I decided this is was too substantial a coincidence *not* to ""make a move."" I teased myself further about saying something and then...

I waited.

And waited...

And waited...

And thank God the Starbucks line was about 20 minutes long cause I eventually decided I liked her puffy fleece jacked and told her as much.

I simply started with a ""Hey miss, that's a cute jacket""

I followed up by asking if it was comfy, then I delivered a short anecdote about asking for a pair of sweats last Christmas made from the same material - since I love how comfy and warm it is. Anecdotes are powerful ways to continue conversations - no natural conversation is comprised of firing questions back and forth.

She was happy to engage with me, and our conversation continued naturally with some natural pauses in conversation. I hate feeling like one of us must constantly be speaking in a conversation, drops in conversation are natural, so I typically pause and wait for them to fill the space or until I have something meaningful to say. (When they don't say anything, and the pause lasts a little too long to the point of awkwardness, I note that I admire their confidence in that they don't feel the need to fill the air with meaningless words just to keep a conversation afloat).

I put my order in before her, and she followed suit. I thought about how I would ask her for her contact info or ask her out. I had seen her on snap earlier so Id probably volunteer my snap and ask her to text me if she thought I was cute as well, offering her  a subtle way out. Unfortunately, after placing her order she either made or received a call and distanced herself from the secondary queue where customers were waiting for their complete order.

Perhaps she made this call to avoid continuing the conversation with me, or perhaps she truly had some urgent business to take care of. Regardless, I'm of the opinion that if she truly wanted me to ask her out she would have provided me a window - urgent phone call or not.

Not a true ""success"" story, but another stone laid on the path to success.  Importantly, this casual conversation didn't end awkwardly nor was it painful or embarrassing, so I'm more likely to do it again.

#Addendum
---
There is a wonderful, highly acclaimed book called ""How to win friends and influence people"" by Andrew Carnegie which highlights some social principles, strategies, and advice for developing charisma as employed by some of the most successful early 20th century industrialists. In it, Carnegie stresses the importance of ""being lavish with your praise"" and learning how to give compliments. 

I think it's an excellent exercise to go about your day focusing on things you can compliment others on. Don't overdue it, authenticity is key; but the more natural the activity of engaging with other humans becomes, the more natural, authentic, and practiced your approach will become.

Best to all of you, Merry Christmas 🎄",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rkhplq/approaching_women_in_public_a_positive_experience/

29,rkjcqd,1639992307,Why exactly age matters that much?,"Unfortunately yesterday was a pretty fuckind sad day to me. I met a girl online (dating app), was one of the most interesting persons i ever met, stimulated me intellectually and artistically,  beautiful, good to talking to... my expectation was on the moon ( oh boy, what a mistake) and i was definitely super happy when contemplating the idea of knowing better and be with she.
I decided yesterday to invite her to come to the rehearsal of my band, some people was missing so i found that could be fun, she plays banjo btw and that was super interesting.

 I was happy as hell during the rehearsal as everybody and than, she asked to everybody what was our age... when i told her that iam 22 (she's 27) her face changed immediately and everybody noticed, after the rehearsal she said to me that was cool until now but couldn't date me now that she knows iam younger. That striked me hard, specially because iam currently super alone and specially because i was with such high expectation, after that i cried in the metro about a person that i know only for 3 days... 

Despite this miserable description of my experience my question is why this matters so much? If you can't tell the difference that iam younger than you why doest it matter? People could not be seeing as individuals only? Which could be mature or immature independently of the age? (Don't mistake immaturity with sensitivity please) why this fixation with the culture that a younger guy (not that younger by the way) is not worth it for you?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rkjcqd/why_exactly_age_matters_that_much/

This guy I was dating would just disappear mid conversation, and re-emerge the next day after more than 24 hours, then disappear again. It happened almost every single time we talked.

My personal experience says if someone is truly interested, they will find 10 seconds between whatever obligations they have in their day to respond to your message.

My gf (20) broke up with me (21) after 4.5 years due to not feeling the spark and not getting excited when she saw me anymore. I started no contact once we broke up.


After trying to breadcrumb me a few times 3 weeks later she messaged saying ,”I’ve made the biggest mistake of my life thinking that I wasn’t happy enough with you”.


So we started talking and she was saying how she made a huge mistake and retreats it and everything so we started talking again but then she is saying she just wants to take it slow.


We have been seeing each other around 3 times a week and have been doing little things together like going out for food. But she still wants to take it slow which is okay as I don’t want to rush anything and ruin it.


It’s just confusing me as she is going out all the time which she never used to do and friends with lads which she has never been before and then she has gone and bought me £650 shoes for my birthday (22nd Dec) which to me certainly isn’t taking it slow as she has never bought me something that expensive in the 4.5 years we were together.


Any opinions and advice would be great as I’ve asked her what she means by taking it slow and she just says not rushing back into anything (she is kissing, cuddling and saying love you every time I see her too though).

Posting on a throwaway because I feel like this is gonna sound very arrogant which I'm definitely not. I was diagnosed with body dysmorphia at 12 and I to this day struggle with my appearance at 19

I get lots of compliments from strangers, people stare at me regardless of what I wear and I used to be convinced it's because there's something wrong with me or because of my clothes. I noticed especially in the past years that a lot of men who I don't even know treat me really good though 

I never left my house often but recently I found a friend who I go outside with every weekend right now in a park where people meet up all the time to hangout. She told me multiple times that it looks like all the guys there want something from me, she also said she's scared her boyfriend is gonna break up with her when he sees me. When she's not there they all come up to me, they always ask for hugs some asked for my numbers and some drunks told me they have a crush on me. They always offer me help or even money when I'm not asking. One of my guy friends there asked me if I don't realize that all the guys there are hitting on me and I said no most of them are they're just being nice or drunk

Is it true that this means I'm fairly pretty or could it be because of the way I dress? I wear very revealing clothes a lot of the time but it also happens when I'm dressed normal.

During my obsession, I found her alt social media accounts. Within them, she spoke of me and our relationship and None of it was positive. To be frank, it was really crushing but helped immensely in grounding me and my infatuation. Once confronted, she deflected and claimed them to all be lies and that she felt the opposite of what she posted. This opened this whole can of worms with privacy invasion and how I should seek mental health (booked later this week!) but now what she said on her alt account is no longer valid due to them being lies.

Listen, looking back I'm not proud of how things unfolded but I also don't feel like all the blame should be placed on me. I've since apologized for my actions but have yet to receive any kind of apology for her words. 

Am I wrong to feel this way? 

The comments made, false as they may be, still hurt.   


I find myself mulling over this experience a lot and no matter how I try to spin it in my head and tell myself ""it was all lies"" and effectively try to justify them, I still cant get over what was said.

Am I true all in the wrong on this one???

68,rkolcl,1640010757,was i too hasty? [22F],"so i’ve been out of the dating game for a while and went on my first date last night in about 4 months. i mainly went bc i was bored and i had nothing else to do and myself and the guy in question [23M] had gotten along well over text. 

i went on the date and things were going well until we somehow we got onto the topic of “icks”. he said one of his is girls that are hairy. i am someone who is probably a bit hairier than most and it’s been one of my biggest insecurities since i was young as i’m of south asian origin. i do remove hair semi-regularly but when it’s the middle of winter and i’m single i don’t consider it a massive priority if i’ve got nothing on. other than that i did have a good time but that thought was sitting in the back of my mind for the rest of the night and when i got back home as well. 

i did send him a message telling him that i didn’t think i wanted to see him again but i’m not sure if i jumped the gun and cut things off too soon. i am worried that if i did let things continue and they progressed further that i would feel like i would always have to be freshly shaven/makeup and hair done always every time i see him, which could become hard for me to manage. and it would also be a lot harder for me to end things if that did happen bc with a longer amount of time there would probably be more feelings involved.

just looking for some advice really, did i do the right thing by ending things there or should i give him another chance?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rkolcl/was_i_too_hasty_22f/

I don’t know what sex is supposed to look like at this point. Do I give oral until climax and then receive to climax?  Do I give oral to climax knowing I won’t last long and then screw to completion?  Yes, I really am this lost.  I’ve actually had quite a bit of luck, ever since Thanksgiving I’ve been with two women, and both of them I gave and received oral. But honestly, then I walk away wondering if I met expectations.

79,rkqn6i,1640016438,The quality of my conversation with matches have gone down and not sure why," 

In the last couple months, the girls I match with have been very non-responding in general! I know I'm not suave/charismatic by any measure(never had a gf), but I just don't understand at this point what I'm doing wrong. I know it's hard to give advice without seeing the context but I would like to keep my privacy in that regards, but I'll fill the details.

This year I surprised myself with the quality of matches on Hinge, after finally building a decent profile that shows my most flattering photos. But the issue is, I just can't seem to get to first date stage. I've gone on 2 dates from Hinge this year, which is not a lot but considering it was 0 before, I'll take the improvements. Both of those dates were girls who I asked for a date within 5 msg of talking. It almost seemed pre-determined if they wanted to actually meet me or not.

Both of those girls from Hinge ignored me after 1st date, which is a whole another issue on its own, but at least back then I had confidence that dates would finally be a regular thing in my life. But since then, most of my matches have been non-responsive. Half of them will just flat out not respond no matter what I say, majority of the remaining half will respond once and never do it again, and the few that's left will msg me couple times then go straight under when I imply we meet up/ask them out directly.

I know there are different approaches to msging girls, but I always try to ask them out within couple messages, because I'm not looking for a pen pal and I feel like texting should mostly be done to test each others vibes and set up dates(and I always ask them out to public places for something simple). In terms of first msg, I try to point out something in their profile and make it easy for them to continue the conversation. If their profiles are bland, I just send them a simple greeting. But like I said, it literally doesn't seem to matter in the grand retrospect. I almost know instantly if they are actually interested or not from the first msg, the disparity in effort/response time is wide and clear.

I just want to make sure it's my bad luck that's hindering me, not something inherently wrong with me holding me back. My brother found his gf thru Hinge, my two friends that I introduced hinge to found their gf thru Hinge, idk why I'm still single and lonely through the holidays but it fucking sucks. I've been single my whole life and really would not like to be for much longer.

80,rkqnei,1640016454,Next steps? Help!," My partner and I have been together since July. 
It has been absolutely amazing. 
We are together about four to five days a week...at the gym six days a week.

He sleeps over now four nights a week sometimes more. I love waking up next to him. The best feeling in the world is looking him in the eyes first thing in the morning, seeing him break into a huge smile and pull me in for a kiss. I have no trust issues with him. He makes me feel special and beautiful at all times. 

Our sex life is astounding. We cuddle all the time. We go on dates. It's been beautiful. He seems super into me and what we have. 

I have never been happier with a man. 

I'm starting to wonder if we should next level the relationship? As in giving him a key to my place?

I mean I absolutely don't mind waiting on that to see how it plays out as we've only been in this since July. 

But it's like that's where my head's at...he does randomly talk about moving in..but in an off hand way when we talk about leases running out...he will randomly bring it up.  Plus he is here almost every day..I even have his favorite snacks and drinks already. 

I always jumped in with two feet before the guy...and I'm trying to reign it in on my end and see what he does and how it goes. I don't want to be the person who falls first again.  I always fall first and hard...

All of us went to his place and drank more, and after all of them got drunk and left, I stayed at his place and talked alot with him and ended sleeping with him (no sex though) in his bed. 

After that he texted me one day later asking how I am. I texted him and He replied really slow - almost took half a day to respond but we texted back and forth.

I asked him couple of days later If he is free to meet me as my mom is visiting me for a month. And I can't meet him as I have to show my mom around to this new city I moved to. 

He said he got crazy week ahead for Christmas party and reunion etc... so couldn't meet me. So I said oh noo but hope he has good time with all those fun plans. 

He then texted our friends group to check if all of us are meeting the next following week.

I told in the groupchat that I can't join as my mom is visiting me.

And then after that nothing else from him.

No texts nothing. Just dead silence.!!!! 

I thought there was definitely something between us and I know that if guys are interested in you they will at least text you once in a while. So just dead silence after all that from him is really shocking...

I’m 21, he’s 32. Before anybody starts talking aboht the age gap - I’ve always felt way more mature than guys my age and always dated 24+ up. 

He’s an interesting person, we met through mutual sports and he’s been helping me to achieve my sports goals as he’s basically an expert in that field. We live i. the same country but there’s a rough distance between us so we mostly communicate on video chat and on the phone and text messages. We grew to like each other and he also started getting flirty, and here we are talking on FaceTime daily.

**However I find some of his comments a turn off. **He’s a very affluent single father and makes it clear he’s well off. 

He keeps repeating how he’s so successful for his age, and women who don’t take him seriously will be missing out a lot (implying that I’d be smart if I chose him?).

He also kind of brags about his money situation, is quite flashy with his cars and keeps telling me: “if we were a couple people would be breaking their necks seeing you sitting in a range rover with me” and all that stuff. He keeps saying girls look at him when he drives but he doesn’t even pay attention because of me.


Tbh, he’s very sweet and nice, always makes sure if I need something and buys it for me (like if I struggle to find some certain bag he takes care of it).

84,rkqz7u,1640017337,Would you date a woman you're seeing if she would stop stripping for you?,"Hello, 

So I've been seeing a guy for a while and I while I have a morning regular job, I strip 2 times per week too, doing occasionally extras. This man knows this, I wanted to be totally honest with him, and he is kind  and sweet towards me, though as long as I keep doing this I know its an obstacle to pursue any romantic type relationship . 
Would it be better to just stop stripping and maybe the guy show me more serious intentions? Or keep seeing him casually and focus on making money ?

I just wanna say that I prioritize human interactions always and I'm not a money motivated person. The truth is that working at the strip club, makes me earn good money fast and literally working as a stripper is like playing in casino - you can make a lot of money,  doing almost nothing, just dancing and having fun. 
Today he told me that he wants to talk to him more often , I usually avoid the constant communication even though I want it, from fear not to seem desperate, and I prefer him to make moves first . Last night I went to his house, and he was so sweet , he was hugging me all night . We have a really good chemistry and I really like him. I even did STD tests for him.. I was just wondering if I stop stripping,  is there a chance to take me seriously. He says that for him the past doesn't matter and doesn't judge from the past of a person.  Also he asked me if I keep going to the strip club,  I said yes, but only went 1 time this week and I plan to stop it. He told me that he doesn't go to strip clubs anymore and prefers to give money to people who really need or charity. Note that I met him at the strip club that I dance. 

Please tell me an honest opinion. What do you think about this ? Would it be good idea to stop stripping? I really like this guy but love dancing too. I know I can't have both. I could stop dancing if I knew he has good intentions or even wants to pursue a relationship like an exclusive romantic type one . How can I handle this situation?

91,rkredz,1640018506,I still have a huge crush on a dude who got mad at me because I refused to have sex with him.,"Hey, in September this new guy (M23) came to our school and I (F20) liked him for the first sight. Wasn’t super crazy about him, but genuinely thought he’s handsome. There was this one night when we met at a club and we danced together (kinda spicy one), he got me a drink and we had a really nice talk. In front of the club he started touching my hand, told me how beautiful nails I have and was putting his arm around my shoulders.
Then we arranged a wine meeting. We talked and it was really fun and I felt so good in company of such a handsome guy (muscular, cute looking, tall, funny). And we (I) got drunk. We started to kiss and I told him if he would be up to going to my place. I didn’t mean for sex tho. I just wanted a company overnight and get intimate with someone. He said he doesn’t want to go, but I kept telling him to. That my flatmate is gone and I don’t want to be alone that night (which was true). And in the end he went. We got home and got naked and kissed and we did some stuff (he ate me out and I did a BJ to him). But just before he got into me, I asked him, if he’s got a condom. He asked me why and if I’m paranoid or something. And then he said that this is gonna be for the first and the last time. At that moment I said that I’m glad it didn’t happen then and went to put clothes back on. He got super angry..
He told me that I’m obviously broken from the last relationship (1. Not true 2. He asked me about it before 3. Wasn’t my idea to talk about it or to even mention any details about my love life from before), told me that he even didn’t want to go to my place and that he’s leaving. I started crying and told him that I didn’t mean to hurt him. And he said that I only did hurt my self. 
I went downstairs with him to unlock the door and he said that he’s not gonna tell anything about this to anyone, that we’ll be just friends and gave me a bro fist. 
Even though this happened and I felt like a complete shit the next morning, I’m still super attracted to him till this day.

And my questions are:
1) Why the f*** do I still like him?
2) How do I get rid of it?
3) Did he only want a one night stand from the beginning or just to be friends or what?
4) Do I still have any chances after this incident?

I feel so bad and guilty because of this.. I hate the person I made from myself in front of him that night (I still insist that not sleeping with him was a good idea). And I’m so mad at him.. And at myself.
But I still have a fu****g CRUSH ON HIM! WHYYYYYY?!!!

Please help..",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rkredz/i_still_have_a_huge_crush_on_a_dude_who_got_mad/
92,rkrfpn,1640018609,How can I find my type as an introverted gamer?,"So my question is how do I find my type as an introverted gamer?
My type is someone who is basically just a female version of me personality wise.
But look wise that is definitely a hard one lol, but I will definitely not date someone who is fat with a crap ton of acne on their face, I’m the kind of guy who would probably date someone who has a good looking body and an innocent smile.
So where exactly can I find my type, the first few things that come to my mind are gaming conventions and game stores but I bet there is more than those two.
TBH some things that I really want to do is become a game designer, an author, a digital artist, possibly an animator etc.
So maybe there are some places where I can meet people that also want to do some of the same stuff that I want to do.
(Side note: I absolutely loathe online dating, I have done absolutely nothing but waste my time on them and will hopefully never try them out again for multiple reasons that I will not go into, however someone suggested a website for me called meetup.com where you can meet people and from what I can tell it’s not specifically designed for finding dates, it is designed for finding pretty much anyone, but literally every event that I’ve came across has like 4 attendees or below, like bruh is this site a f*cking ghost town.
Anyway I’m probably never going to use it)",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rkrfpn/how_can_i_find_my_type_as_an_introverted_gamer/
93,rkrkje,1640018978,Can’t tell with this girl,"Hey guys, wow, it was a struggle just coming up with a title. Anyway, I haven’t dated in a really long time let alone online. Tried two popular apps and have been very successful so far. There is this girl who looks too good to be true (and she just texted me as I was writing this lol). I commented on one of her pictures, which led to a few messages then getting my number. We have been texting for days now. The thing is her text seem slightly off. Like they weren’t always directly responding to my text or it just didn’t make any sense in general. I’ve read about scams and stuff, but she never has once asked me for money or assistance (quite the opposite actually) or WhatsApp and we are going a date soon. I asked one of my friends with more experience in this, and he thinks she’s probably just a foreign girl, which he has experience with. I looked up her country of origin and English is taught, but only for the sake of testing and not conversation, and according to people from that country the English education is not great. 

Does anyone have experience with this? Did they end up being real or was it a scam?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rkrkje/cant_tell_with_this_girl/

I’ve noticed that when girls bring up their past/body count, it is usually lower than mine (unless they’re lying) and I am hesitant to say mine because they’ll make judgements about it. 

If you had only had 5 partners, would you consider a relationship with a guy who you know has had 30? Why or why not?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rkrzez/women_what_do_you_think_of_men_with_high_body/

99,rksia8,1640021491,Looks vs personality,"I am well aware that personality can take you a long way. However, sometimes it is a little suspicious to me in certain situations. 

For example, I am currently talking to a russian model who looks even more attractive than the stereotypical russian model. I think im an alright looking guy, but by no means at all am I a model. 

My question would be, do you think she could just be using me for a greencard/something along those lines? We’ve been talking so far and it seems like we click pretty well. However, I’m just a little suspicious of the looks aspect. She’s a 15/10 and I am a normal person😂. Its also not like im rich either. I have a job but not a big baller. What do yall think? Am I just being insecure?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rksia8/looks_vs_personality/
