I'm a 5'4 man and it seems like theres hardly an women thats pleased with a guy thats shorter than like 5'7 at least in this shitty shallow country that I call the USA. Women shorter than me say i'm too short, i've come across more women that have a height requirement of either 5'10 and up or like 6'1 and up than not giving a shit at all.

another thing thats important to point out tho is that i wasnt sure about being exclusive for a while when we were together. not while we were official, but just when we started talking and had only been on a couple dates. i didnt know what i wanted and i expressed to him that i still had urges to be with other people, which he understood all the way up until we were basically official. we had established having really strong feelings for each other and everything but i was still a bit confused and i think it scared him. the next day though i came to the conclusion that i wanted to be with him much more than i wanted to be with anyone else and i cut off everyone, i havent thought about it since. 

once that was done it was done. we are official, we dont get jealous of each other and are very honest about who we are talking to and what about. we trust each other and want to be with each other. the problem is is that now that i know i want exclusivity, my fear of being cheated on creeped back up on me, so i started periodically checking tinder to see if his profile had updated. i did this because my last ex‚Äôs profile changed once when i was preparing to delete my account and what do you know, he cheated on me. i know this is wrong, i admit that by doing this im letting my trust issues get the best of me and its u healthy, i wont excuse that. but every time ive checked it hasnt changed up until now. the only thing thats changed is his pictures, it added two new ones, and im wondering why this is. i want to believe benefit of the doubt and say it just took a long time updating, but im really not sure and im very very veryyy scared im being cheated on. i dont want to point fingers and accuse him of cheating on me either and im scared he‚Äôll think i was using tinder to cheat on my end. what should i do?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oklkct/my_f18_bfs_m18_tinder_profile_updated_even_though/

44,okmndn,1626328740,I (18F) am already CONVINCED I'm going to die alone...,"I've never been in a relationship or had sex or even kissed anyone before. I'll be starting college in the fall and while I have no intention to search for a relationship during my freshman year, I know what at some point I will want to later on. However, I've come to realize the absolute hellfire that modern dating is and I don't think I'm built for it at all and now I'm just convinced I'm just going to die alone. It sounds awful. I saw a post earlier about modern dating and it was something like ""modern dating be like: woah woah woah, let's have sex before we rush into dating"" or something like that. The number of people replying about how that's how things should be kind of scared me. I'm not that kind of person. Everyone seems so mortified of commitment, views sex as both casual but also the most important thing in a relationship above all else (going back to the previous post I mentioned, people were saying that you should have sex first because getting to know a person is pointless if the sex isn't good....even though dating/relationships about getting to know a person and learning communication so if something like sex isn't immediately spectacular you would learn each other and your bodies and become compatible sexually, right?), and people don't want to put effort into relationships. When the going gets tough, people just run. 

Everything that modern dating is about is just not what I want. I'm the type of person who would probably want to wait months before having sex, I value commitment and monogamy, I find communication and being upfront to be important and I like to work through problems rather than running away from them, and I feel like you should allow room for growth for a partner and not expect a perfect person from the very beginning, but I feel like people nowadays would just call me clingy and a prude. It horrifies me. 

I remember watching a youtube video where a girl was talking about her parents and how when her mother was dying she told her husband that he didn't have to be there at the hospital all the time with her and he basically said ""where tf else would I be?"". And the daughter was talking about how much love they have for each other and was like ""do people even love like that anymore?"". I wonder that too sometimes and it makes me sad. 

Did I also mention I'll be attending college in Los Angeles too? Isn't that like peak modern dating? Yeah, I think I'm screwed...Am I being dramatic? Are things as awful as they seem? Am I definitely going to being alone forever? What do I do? How do I adapt? Can I? Should I?

My bf on the other hand, I like spending a lot of time with him. He makes me very happy and I enjoy his presence and our time together. We‚Äôve recently made 2 years not too long ago. I‚Äôve been thinking and reading up on how to improve our relationship, and it all starts with me. 

I tend to get super jealous when he goes out. Sometimes he invites me to go and hang out with his friends, and I do, but there‚Äôs most times where he just goes. I‚Äôve become so emotionally attached that every time he goes out without me, I breakdown. I sob and sit in my room for what it seems hours, and waiting until he comes back the next day. It‚Äôs hurting me so much. I‚Äôve done this so many times. 

What sucks is, he wants to go hang out and he finds me super upset with him leaving, that he too gets upset. He doesn‚Äôt want me to be sad when he tries to go hang out with his friends. Then i feel terrible because i just made his happy mood turn into a sorrowful one. He ends up staying with me instead of hanging out with friend, which leaves me being regretful. 

Ive been trying to read up on how to stop being so controlling and jealous and trying to find how to be happy, alone, but it‚Äôs so hard. I know if i keep this up, he may wake up one day and realize he doesn‚Äôt want to be with me anymore, especially because of my behavior. I want to be mature about this, but right now i‚Äôm not. I‚Äôve realized that i can‚Äôt take away what he enjoyed doing before i came into the picture. 

I don‚Äôt like that i don‚Äôt have any friends of my own to hang with.

Girl friends seem cool, but i‚Äôve had too many complications with them, they just don‚Äôt seem right for me.

i‚Äôd love some advice on this situation because i do think i need to remain calm, cool and collected. i 23F broke up with my toxic ex boyfriend about 6 weeks ago. after a week of being single, i downloaded tinder for the first time. matched with this guy 24M, super hot at first glance and he wanted to get coffee after a few hours of chatting. i politely declined as i was a busy, and we kept talking with loose plans for the weekend after. a few days after talking to this guy, my ex pops back up and wants to work on things. i was a bit of a mess so i said sure, and i deleted my tinder account and blocked this guy i was planning on getting coffee with on instagram and deleted on snapchat as it felt moral to do so. 

however, with my ex, nothing changed. it was just 4 weeks of bullshit, and i kept thinking about this new guy. i blocked my ex for good and unblocked the new guy and said i was so sorry, had a bit of a breakdown and explained what happened. he said ‚Äúoh i had a feeling you got back with your ex‚Äù and i said no we didn‚Äôt even get back together and it was awful. he then said he still wanted to get coffee and organised it for sunday morning just gone. 

prior to the date, i remade tinder and super matched with him as a joke and he said ‚Äúyou can delete this now, we‚Äôve found each other and i‚Äôve deleted mine‚Äù so i did. he also said he wasn‚Äôt looking for anything serious or to get married, but he‚Äôs not ruling anything out in case i‚Äôm the right person for him. so i thought fuck it, why not give it a go? i‚Äôm looking for something serious eventually and i bet a lot of people say that until the right person comes along. 

the date was amazing. he was so kind, polite, tall, gorgeous and he kissed me at the end of the date and said he wanted to see me again this week coming for dinner and that he‚Äôd pick me up and organise it. at this stage we have just talked normally, but on sunday night i turned the conversation sexual/flirty. monday rolls around and he asks to come over tonight (because i kept being flirty) and i said sure. we had sex, it was mind blowing. see my most recent post for deets! i said ‚Äúare you still taking me to dinner?‚Äù and he said ‚Äúwell doesn‚Äôt this count as something because we had take out and watched a movie? we‚Äôll see next weekend because it‚Äôs my bday this weekend.‚Äù

and tuesday morning he messaged me saying ‚Äúhave a great day xx‚Äù so it‚Äôs not like he has ghosted me but the frequency of texting has now gone down. he still messages me good morning every morning and asks me how my day has been when he‚Äôs home at night, there just hasn‚Äôt been much else. i‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs because he‚Äôs working and we were originally texting over the weekend, he can‚Äôt be on his phone much at work but it‚Äôs already annoying me and making me feel like saying ‚Äúwhy aren‚Äôt you talking to me as much as before?‚Äù and ‚Äúare you slowly ghosting me?‚Äù

i don‚Äôt know if these are red flags or if i‚Äôm over thinking it. all of my friends think i am and i don‚Äôt know how to remain calm.

65,okp73k,1626340532,I want to share a story and ask for advice,"Hello everyone,

(First of all, english is not my native language, so don't expect it to be perfect :P )

I met that awesome girl (Let's call her Jen) in my sports group and since I'm actually a pretty cliche male redditor (introverted, never dated and well.. you may guess the thing I never did), I would like to get some opinions on how to proceed in this particular case. We're both part of the same sport group, which I joined roughly two years ago (a bit before I joined, she took a break due to health issues and just returned). During that time, I got to know her parents and brother, which are part of the group as well.

So, lets skip to the more interesting part:   
After training, I was sharing some apples with people I care about/trained with. With my second last apple I went to Jen's mother and asked her, whether she wants that apple. While asking that, I heard a female voice (Jen) from behind my back saying: ""I'll take that one!"". And a hand came from behind, grabbing the apple.  
So, I turned by a 90¬∞ angle (with Jen's mom facing me from the left) and wanted to scold the ""apple thief"", when I first looked at Jen. I was smitten. I didn't think ""Boy, is she looking good!"" or something similar, but ""Holy fuck, she looks exactly how she ought to look!"". If someone asked me, whether I've a type, I would show them a picture of her (if I had a picture...). It took me a couple of seconds to process that (3-5, I guess). And my face probably showed that .( I know, that I raised both of my eyebrows and opened my mouth....) In front of Jen and with her mother looking at me from the left.... (Good thing is, her mother likes me. We train together, chit-chat etc.). Jen smiled, her mother stared at me...  
We then talked a bit, during which I tried to make them laugh and to give a good impression.  
They then went home and so did I.  
Couple of days later, I walked about that issue with a common friend and... what shall I say.. They want to support me, because they think, that Jen and I match in character and humor very well. But neither of us knows, whether she's single or not.

I'm not sure, whether I'm insanely lucky currently or just my imagination is running wild.   
But Jen wanted my attention, didn't she? She didn't need to ""steal"" my apple.   
At least her mother does think positively of me (her father and brother probably as well).  
A common friend supports me, because we're a good match in character and humor (according to the friend).  
Am I insanely lucky after never getting a date before and after a 3 year period of self-improvement? Or am I going insane from solitude and me feeling unloved and unloveable?  


In retrospective, I'm happy I didn't ask for her number on the spot. Handing out ones number (or turning me down) in front of her parents and brother would've been weird. But I think, I should try to train with her next time and spent some time with her, getting to know her and so on. And if we click (and I get the feeling, she's single), I could decide to ask her out. 

There are also 1 or 2 (1.5?) reasons, not to do so.   
First of all, we're part of the same sports group, which is unique in our area. If things go south, we can't avoid one another without stopping to attend. And since some males only join cetain groups (e.g. yoga), to pick women up, I actually wanted to avoid flirting in the group. Except, if she initiates. Which in general never happens, but she kinda did, didn't she?  
And on the other hand, I don't know how old exaclty the is, but according to my guess, she's at the beginning of her twenties, while I'll turn 31 in a couple of days..... :/

67,okpfgk,1626341702,Am I casually dating a narcissist?,"(23F) just got out of a ridiculously toxic relationship and started casually dating again. I‚Äôve been seeing this guy (28M) for the past month and a half and it‚Äôs been super great (10 dates total). Totally respects me, takes me out on dates, picks me up, surprises me with thoughtful gifts. We have fun together and bounce of each others sarcasm. The only red flag I‚Äôm getting is that he tends to say stupid shit just to get a reaction out of me. For example, he‚Äôs not a political person AT ALL but will make jokes about how much he loves Trump/dislikes BLM and will explicitly say that ‚Äúhe‚Äôs just trying to get some emotion out of me‚Äù 

I also want to mention that I have no issue dating someone with a different ideology, but the fact that he doesn‚Äôt even believe what he‚Äôs saying is just weird. Is it too early to say something?

68,okph1d,1626341927,"Without looking like a total fool or being too thirsty, is there a way to make a dating profile (app specific or not) that would be tailored to a certain desired type of person?","I personally have a deep set interest in certain types of women like anyone else, but like any reasonable man I understand that its not exactly amazon shopping and everyone is different. That in mind, my preferences are kind of vague and the only specific traits I actively look for are a little rare in this day and age, like tomboys, or redheads, girls under 5Ft 4in, or girl who are into the outdoors, or working out/lifting. If you wanna get even more into me Im a little bit of a LOTR nerd and I like Viking stuff, why not find a girl into all that stuff too ya know?

End of the day, you get too specific or wordy on a dating profile and you're now lost to the world and credited as either thirsty or creepy for simply knowing what you want. and I wasn't born yesterday, I know there is no magic formula that will win me my souls desire tomorrow, but what if theres something close?

what if I could depict myself, and write certain things, in such a manner that those specific girls/men that myself or yourself- are into? How do you know what redheads, or axe women, or Celtic singers are into beyond their foremost title? 

biggest question, not just how-2-appeal to them, but how could you draw your ideal partner to you through some magnet magic filter, and not turn down every other gem in the mix who could be the one and just not be hitting all the criteria, without pushing them away?
