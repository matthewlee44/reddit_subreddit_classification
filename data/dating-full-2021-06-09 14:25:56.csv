## Obstacles to finding love

Are you single and looking for  love? Are you finding it hard to meet the right person? When you’re  having trouble finding a love connection, it’s all too easy to become  discouraged or buy into the destructive myths out there about dating and  relationships.

Life as a single person offers many rewards, such  as being free to pursue your own hobbies and interests, learning how to  enjoy your own company, and appreciating the quiet moments of solitude.  However, if you’re ready to share your life with someone and want to  build a lasting, worthwhile relationship, life as a single person can  also seem frustrating.

For many of us, our emotional baggage can  make finding the right romantic partner a difficult journey. Perhaps you  grew up in a household where there was no role model of a solid,  healthy relationship and you doubt that such a thing even exists. Or  maybe your dating history consists only of brief flings and you don’t  know how to make a relationship last. You could be attracted to the  wrong type of person or keep making the same bad choices over and over,  due to an unresolved issue from your past. Or maybe you’re not putting  yourself in the best environments to meet the right person, or that when  you do, you don’t feel confident enough.

Whatever the case may  be, you can overcome your obstacles. Even if you’ve been burned  repeatedly or have a poor track record when it comes to dating, these  tips can help put you on the path to finding a healthy, loving  relationship that lasts.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,826789,public,self,Dating Tips for Finding the Right Person,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nvxdel/dating_tips_for_finding_the_right_person/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,

We'd meet once in a month but when we used to meet, other than doing it, we also used to cuddle, watch movies, sleep, talk about our lives and he also made me meet his friends.
This one time he started giving me mixed signals, and when I reciprocated, he decided to backpedal saying that he just got out of a relationship yada yada yada which I respected. 

In 2020, I decided to end things as I started to feel little attached and I realised we were not in the same boat. He knew that we weren't in the same page but he just couldn't stop texting me. so to stop all this, I had to lie that I was seeing someone. Later, even he started seeing someone but he didn't tell me. Still he didn't stop texting me, which confused me to the core because I couldn't understand why was he texting me when he's already in a relationship.

Now, just a week ago,  he texted me saying that he misses me genuinely and this time it is not for the sex. I asked him that isn't he seeing someone to which he replied that he was but he broke up. Also he said, 
""I've been thinking about you alot, I want to spend some time with you away from the room. I'll always cherish the times that we've spent together. You should know that even though I've had the best of the times when we've been together and trust me when I say the best of best I still feel this void.

In the sense that you morally deserve to not have a girlfriend. Basically, in one way or another, you are a terrible person that women say “ewww” at for obvious reasons. Every man that has never had a girlfriend is a “nice guy” basically. That’s what people assume on this sub.

So people tell any guy that has never had a girlfriend that they feel entitled and they need to get real and realize that they don’t deserve a girlfriend. No girl owes them that. When these people’s agendas are actually looking through a lens of “deserving or not.” They are saying this while also thinking that they are bad guys that don’t deserve a relationship.

If you want to look through that lens, logically you have two groups of guys. Guys that morally deserve a relationship because they are good guys and guys that don’t morally deserve a relationship because they are bad guys. If you aren’t looking through that lens because it means you’re feeling entitled if you do, then it has nothing to do with whether the guy is a good or bad guy. Women want what they want. Independent of all of that.

Basically we keep switching the lens we are looking through. Your boyfriend is a “good guy,” because that’s how that works. Why would you choose a bad guy? Any guy that has never had a girlfriend before is a bad guy, because that’s how women work. They don’t choose bad guys. But if a guy that has never had a girlfriend before says that he thinks he is not a bad guy, now you tell him it has nothing to do with being a good or bad guy. Women don’t owe you anything, you never deserve anything, so you feel entitled. But you actually have been believing the whole time that he is a “bad guy” and that’s why he has never had a girlfriend. In fact, you are actually believing that him feeling entitled is what makes him a bad guy that no one wants. Even though that is a logical fallacy. Either it has nothing to do with him being a good or bad guy or it is because he is a bad guy. It can’t be both at the same time.

What is ridiculous is anyone that knows anything about what it’s like being a man knows the vast majority of men that have never had a girlfriend are in that boat because they’ve never asked a girl the question, “Would you like to be my girlfriend?” before. Or they haven’t done it much.

So all this other shit is probably usually missing what the whole problem is. No matter what you tell yourself you see in the guy (no matter how bad you want him to be a bad guy). All of that probably really is besides the point.

Of course, I'd love to stay friends with her. I genuinely enjoy spending time with her.

Background: M late twenties, successful guy from a poor immigrant family, fit (very fit actually), I have acne (but in real dating life it was never a problem), have personal issues like many other people, and I have a few hobbies.

Discussion: I built my dating profile putting low effort, with simple pictures of just me smiling or with my friends. Nice convos.

I put effort when sending messages.

Result: I've had Hinge for a few weeks now, and I managed to get only one date, among very few non responsive matches (that I obviously removed).

Discussion of the result: isn't this normal that you get a bad result?

I tell you now what I think, and why I put low effort in my profile.

Dating apps are both bad for men, and women too (even if they have way more chance). But here I will focus only on the men part, as I think solving this will automatically simplify the problems of the other half.

Dating apps have to change, we need new types of dating apps.

* **On dating apps, here is what requires to be successful as a male:**
   * For the profile:
      * You need to be handsome, and/or
      * Tall, and/or
      * Have a VARIED set of pictures, where you do several activities, or you are in different settings (to signal how amazing your life is, and how others could be part of it)
      * with the necessary condition of quality pictures regardless of the above points
      * and maybe, maybe good prompts or simple bio
      * plus, you want to display confidence and/or non neediness
   * After the match:
      * you have to compete with others, and be wittier, funnier, ....er, and/or
      * have a nice conversation (if you have a super great profile)
      * then hopefully you ask out!

This is a lot of effort. Really a lot of effort (especially if you have to build all of this, because maybe you were always poor and did not have a chance to go to vacations or dress nicely for example). I will not start talking about the mindset induced by the most popular dating apps, mindset that I consider a danger for our society.

But....

By the end of the day, we are all just people, and dating shouldn't be something where we have to compete with others. Dating should be something, in my opinion, where you as a guy take the risk to ask a woman that you like out (or the opposite).

In real life, it does not matter how amazing are the things you do, or your status, or how tall you, are.

It only matters who you are, and how you are as a person.

* **In real life, here is what requires to be successful in dating for men:**
   * you have nice and respectful conversations with women, and sometimes you catch someone you might be interested in
   * just be (almost) yourself, and maybe put a temporary facade to have the balls to ask a woman you like out
   * it does not matter if you are tall, handsome, or whatever. When you create a connection with a person, it is done.
   * in real life women like more the way in which you say things, how much you are focused on your goals, your personality, and so on

The most important thing is that, apart of asking out, in real life you do not put much effort. You are just there. And because of this, I decided to make a low effort profile, to reflect real life.

In real life I have always attracted women, beautiful women, normal women, smart women, etc... It did not matter if I had acne, dressed bad, or was depressed, or I had more handsome or taller guys in my group.

It could be biased what I am saying, as this happened mostly in uni, but I really think that dating is something that should come at low effort.

You just want to be yourself, and live your life.

Because of this, I think I am going to leave soon dating apps.

**I hope somebody codes a better, more real dating app.**

In the meantime, I am going to join clubs, volunteer, do sports again, go to bars, bookshops, and hopefully meet women in real life.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,826972,public,self,Dating apps have to change!,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nw03ev/dating_apps_have_to_change/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,

Other things he's done include deliberately asking questions or starting a story if I so much as start typing on my phone to keep my attention on him (he's admitted that he does this). I have other friends outside of him and it really sucks that I can't interact with them without it mentally affecting him.

My girlfriend and I broke up last Wednesday. We dated for 2 years and 8 months. The relationship started off full of so much love and desire but we were each others' only best friends. After a year went by, the toxicity began to seep through the cracks in our relationship. We could have ended it a long, long time ago but we continued dating for the sake of our mutual comfort, security, sexual desires, and need to feel loved. I recognize this as a huge mistake on both of our parts but the relationship continued nonetheless.

Almost two years had already passed in our relationship and I began reconnecting with some childhood friends I hadn't spoken to in a few years. I invited my girlfriend to join our discord server and for a long time, the group of the five of us were really good friends. We spent lots of time together in person and playing games such as Minecraft and Valorant but patterns started arising that made me feel deeply insecure and jealous. At first, I wanted to ignore these feelings out of respect for myself and my partner, but they kept growing stronger as more and more instances kept happening.

For the sake of ease, I'm going to call my lifetime friend who she likes ""G"". Her relationship with G started out as nothing more than her relationship with the rest of my friends. She was very impressed with his skill in Valorant, but I was too so I didn't see it as anything. I started getting concerned starting February of this year. Her and G started doing literally everything together. They would sit in the discord call all day together during online classes and when class was over, they would play videogames together until the next day and repeat. She still came over to see me at this point but she started saying extremely weird things. She knew that I was jealous so she would tease me by saying things like ""should I make my crush on G less apparent?"" and she would say his name during foreplay to get me upset but at least she never said it during actual sex. She started laughing at everything he had to say even if it wasn't a joke but she kept telling me she doesn't like him and she kept shutting down my insecurities and my concerns. By May their relationship had deepened further. She felt and would express that her and G were inseparable. They texted 24/7 even when she was over at my house. They would insist on being on the same team during our nightly custom games on Valorant for the sake of ""chemistry"" and if they weren't on the same team they wouldn't shoot each other but just sit next to each other passively and laugh and ""flirt"".

I didn't want to assume that they liked each other yet because it's wrong to want to take a friendship away from my girlfriend when all she has known is me for so long. I just felt that I was being replaced and I wanted to stop it before it got too far.

Breaking news, it got too far. In the last two weeks of our relationship, she started coming over to my house far, far less saying that she's too tired and then going to play videogames with G. I can understand the difference between physical exhaustion and emotional exhaustion but it still hurt me. We stopped having sex nearly as much as we used to and I started to worry.

By the next week, she broke up with me. Three days after she broke up with me, she confessed her feelings to G and G said that the feelings are mutual. It really broke my heart because I saw it for such a long, long time and I couldn't figure out a way to fix it or stop it. She told me that she has very strong feelings for G and wants to date him. She wants to spend time alone with him and hug him and be more than friends as she put it. She said she doesn't want any sexual commitment but I know that sexual feelings can grow from emotional feelings in an instant and you can act on them by impulse before you even have time to think about what you're doing. At this point though, I'm not her boyfriend anymore and it feels seriously wrong for me to tell her what she can and cannot do. I have the side of another friend from our friend group who agrees with me that they should not date for my sake and for the sake of the friend group. G so far has only said that he agrees. He is a good person and a smart person despite what he let his relationship with my ex get to but he still has respect for me, his lifetime friend. At this point, I don't know what they are going to do and I don't know if she is going to try to manipulate him into becoming her boyfriend. She has no regard for me whatsoever and thinks that I'm the only person who doesn't approve of them dating. I wouldn't be surprised if she tried to date him in secret to avoid being judged but I don't see how anything good could come of that for her relationship with him. Frankly, everyone is in an absolutely horrible situation. I feel emotionally cheated on, and her and G feel like their love is forbidden.

At this point in time, I want to let go of her. I can feel how strong my attachment to her still is and it's causing me a lot of pain. I think that I can better accept the reality of the situation if I can get rid of my possessive mindset. All that I want is to be able to let go of her so I can start looking into myself and sorting out my insecurities.

I want to thank you so much if you made it all the way to the bottom of this post and I ask you to leave me your thoughts and opinions. I really need the help right now, I just don't know what to do.

TLDR; my girlfriend of almost 3 years broke up with me after our relationship progressively died partly due to her interest in a boy (my lifetime friend). Right after our break up, her and said boy confessed their feelings for each other and now she is obsessed with the idea of dating him while he is still very reluctant out of respect for me and our friend group. I'm worried that they will date in secret but I want nothing more than to break my emotional attachment to her so that I don't have to feel all the pain of this reality.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,827013,public,self,How can I (M18) let go of my ex-girlfriend (F18) who developed strong feelings for my lifetime friend right after our breakup?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nw0u15/how_can_i_m18_let_go_of_my_exgirlfriend_f18_who/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,

So for a little background, I [23] am really interested in this one girl in my college classes [29] and over the past month we've been texting quite a bit and hanging out a few times outside of class together. She was the person to initiate the texting and over text it feels like she is trying to flirt, but when we hang out in person it honestly feels more like friends hanging out with a little bit of flirting thrown back and forth. We joke around with each other and we laugh a lot but other than that not much else has happened. 

So onto what I need help with. We have hung out 3 times outside of class together, and after the second time I asked her if she was looking for a relationship or something else. Because I'm an idiot, I'm sure I worded it poorly and she looked caught off guard and only responded that she got out of a serious relationship a year ago and we ended up just saying goodbye. She later apologized that night for making it awkward and she just said she was caught off guard, but she still never answered my question. Despite this, we still text a lot and we even hung out a couple days ago for the whole day and it had the same vibe as before with a tiny bit of flirting. 

I really like her and I think it would be cool to try and start a relationship with her, but if that is not what she wants I am totally okay just remaining friends because I genuinely enjoy her company. My problem is I don't really know what to say or do without sounding stupid or jeopardizing the friendship. I was thinking of just asking her on a date (maybe for bowling and dinner) or the next time we hang outside of class just tell her that I like her but if that's not how she sees me then I'm totally cool with remaining friends. Would one of these be able to get my point across better that I would like to date her? There's a movie she wants to go watch and I was thinking of taking her to see it then get some ice cream afterwards and then tell her what I think of her. I'm pretty shy, so this is new to me, but I know if I don't say anything about how I feel about her I will regret it.

**Therapy:** I have had several therapists and while they helped me overcome some of my anxiety and depression they are at a loss about this situation or what to do.

**Coaches:** Honestly this is just a waste of time. They didn't know what to help, the few ones that did try to ""help"" gave some vague and general advice and nothing more. One just outright said I should get used to living alone.

I met her at one of the sports clubs I attend to regularly before corona and she approached first by giving me her cell phone number. I invited her out once and she could not make it that day and provided a rain check for the following week. However, she did not come that week as well and I ceased contact with her, only to get texted by her some months later. To be honest I was pretty enthusiastic about this lady and I have been single for 5+ years, but had to play it cool as she was probably dating other men.   


To cut the long story short after regularly spending some time at the sports club, I invited her over to home as the corona restrictions were being enforced in the place I live. She did not comply at first, but she later on contacted me again telling me that she wanted to come over. So we arranged a get together without calling it a date for the first time. Later onward over a period of 3-4 months, we sort of met each other at my place as sort of gym partners, went for walks holding hands, went to dinner etc. She was pretty reluctant with physical and emotional affection and she told me that she is afraid of corona. However, being extremely lonely and a little too enthusiastic about a budding relationship I kept seeing and meeting her.   


Later the frequency of her messages decreased, she no longer called and did not meet me anymore blaming corona as she is living with her parents. Interestingly I was pretty invested in this girl and wanted to know what was wrong with her only to get heartbroken when we talked on the phone for the last time when she told me she did not want a relationship and did not feel the spark. In person she was not the talking type and did not communicate much by leaving some of my questions hanging and being unresponsive in general. I went to an extreme debug mode as I felt that I blew a great opportunity and never contacted her after the break-up.   


I felt humiliated and played with after this girl and it really got to me. I also felt hopeless and I returned to my dateless life. I am having extreme difficulties finding dates and online dating does not work for me at all. Also I am not a fan of calling every one-on-one meeting with a girl a date. This particular girl also told me she wanted to be friends and wanted to get to know me and so on, yet I did not believe in those.  What do you think of my situation and this particular girl? Do you have suggestions to improve my dating potential? 

I think I have the capability to love a person and cultivate a relationship, but I always come across cold and aloof ladies. This subreddit shows that there are caring ladies who are not in the mindset of modern dating that people are disposable and might be even willing to form a real friendship before dating. I think it is very hard to come across such people in real life and let alone dating apps. 

I feel like I am cut out for a single long-term relationship and I will be single for a very long time as evidenced by my past. I improved myself a lot, got a decent job abroad(I live abroad), respect people and value communication over anything, but this does not seem to be enough.

My concern is, I feel as if all relationships are temporary and it is just a matter of time before they end. My biggest fear is that I would invest all of my time and years of my life into a relationship with someone only for one of us to eventually grow bored and move on or betray the other person. And by ""bored"" I mean anything that could cause either of us to become disinterested or look elsewhere.

This conflicts with the kind of relationship that I want, which is one where I can consider the person family and my best friend who will be there for me for the rest of my life. I understand that risks are necessary and I have to be willing to take a chance, but I feel more and more that people cannot be relied upon.

I 24F work in the office with a 20M, and lately i’ve been noticing him a lot more. I sometimes catch myself just admiring him.. We work in an insurance office, so most of the agents aren’t often here, since they’re independent, however he is. 

Anyways, I pretty much get along with all the agents that come in to the office, so with him it wasn’t any different. I’m nice, friendly.. but never too friendly where it comes off as flirting. Every time I’m in my personal office, he will come in and sit in the desk beside me and just talk to me, or just sit there. He comes in and he will say “Good morning” and give me a hug. I’ve been sort of crushing on him, and i try not to make it obvious because he has a girlfriend (or almost girlfriend). He will often mention her to me in conversation, like for example last week he mentioned how she got upset because he works a-lot (he does) &amp; how she was mad that he hasn’t asked her to be his girlfriend. 

How do i stop feeling these feelings? especially knowing since they’re not reciprocated &amp; he’s pretty much taken. 

I hope there was enough info in this post for your guys’ help. LOL.

I was a shy and aloof kid growing up. I’m an introvert who likes her own company. I never dated in school and college because the guys I liked never liked me back.
Another huge factor for me not getting into the dating pool was my eating disorder. My eating disorder was accompanied by severe body Dysmorphia and idea of being naked in front of a guy absolutely terrified me. I basically worked on myself and overcame my eating disorder over the years but that led me to be distant towards men because I was still learning to get comfortable with the idea of being intimate with someone.

I have had very limited experience with guys. I have kissed 4 guys till day and went to 3rd base with 3 of them. 

Then the pandemic came along so meeting someone became even tougher. I have tried dating apps (way too many times to even count) but most guys on there only want something casual and I’m not about that life. So I eventually gave up finding someone genuine on there

I’m currently in therapy and working on this though.

How can I tell if someone will be respectful of boundaries and they understand consent before things get sexual? What are some green flags and red flags that I can look for before I end up in a scary situation?

I’ve had three men in the last 2 years where, even after explaining consent, they didn’t seem to understand. So I want to avoid these situations in the future.

- Guy 1: went on 2 dates and then he invited me over to watch a movie. I was freshly single after my 8 year relationship so I was a little naive to what this meant. He put the moves on me, and I said “no” many times. I had to rebutton my pants multiple times, and remove my hands from his crotch multiple times since he kept placing it there. I felt so uncomfortable, I left early. The next day when he texted me to schedule our next date, I told him how I felt. His response: “but I didn’t get mad at you when you said no”

- Guy 2: a man I had been dating for 2 months knew a hard boundary for me was condoms and he tried to put it in without one. When I said no, he said he wasn’t going to put it in. I said no a few more times. But he then put it in anyways. When I talked to him later about how he didn’t respect my boundary, he said “we both made that mistake”.

- Guy 3: this guy I dated for a month and a half. first time he kissed me, he asked so I thought that was a good sign but then the first time we made out (very innocent, not hot and heavy), he choked me without asking or without prior discussion, with both hands, thumbs pressing into my windpipe. I told him I liked to be choked occasionally very lightly w one hand pressing sides, not front. The next time we made out, he choked me the same way but very hard, I couldn’t breathe. I explained to him I didn’t want to see him anymore because of this.  That I thought he was a good guy and I know he didn’t mean to hurt me but I feel uncomfortable. He said “this is your shit not me. Its complete bullshit that you’re putting this on me as if I did anything wrong. Okay yea i put my hands around your neck in a way you didn’t like, I’m sorry, but to sit there and tell me any of what I did was completely out of line is insane. I’ve never run into this issue so it sounds crazy to me.”

There must be some red flags I’m missing before it gets to this point.

So in my(25F) previous post I mentioned I was going on a date with a guy(27M) who I’ve been friends with for a long time. On the way to meet him, I felt a little nervous as I knew this wasn’t just going to be as friends but as soon as I met up with him, the nervousness went away, I can be myself around him as we’ve known each other for years anyway. We went to the cinema (usually I’d not advise this as a first date if you don’t know the person) but after we left, we went to Starbucks to get coffee, I offered to get them as he had paid for the cinema tickets but he politely declined and paid again and then we sat down and talked for a while. 

Things were going well, I was asking him questions I wouldn’t even think to ask as a friend and I was quite happy with how natural it came to me, he didn’t really ask me any though. He made me laugh, like really made me laugh and I think in the 7/8 years I’ve known him I never knew he was that funny and I just instantly looked at him differently and found myself not really wanting to leave his company. Not sure if there was an instant spark per say, I think some things take time but that’s when I made the decision in my head that I’d definitely like to go out with him again. 

After talking for a while, he walked to my bus and waited until it came and there was no awkward silences or anything I think it went great. He hugged me before leaving and I said I’d text him when I got home he said get home safe. I messaged him when I got home and thanked him and said I had a really nice time. He replied with “so did I, thank you for coming”. Now not sure how to take that, just gonna let him process and see what he wants to do but I was genuinely expecting him to ask if I wanted to go out again since it’s no secret he’s had a thing for me for a while.

I always thought this ""relationship"", more like situationship was doomed from the beginning. Anyway, I met this dude on Tinder in September. We really hit it off and started talking a lot on there. I am very picky about guys, and back then I had just gotten out of an emotionally abusive guy with a really horrible dude who gaslighted, manipulated me and critized my body. Therefore, I found comfort in this new guy. Unhealthy, I know. I wasn't fully healed back then (I was, and am not emotionally unavailable. I'm not scared of commitment. I was just dealing with some really bad self-esteem issues due to the abuse back then), but I didn't really let it seep into any conversations or actions, to be honest. When I talked to this new guy, I was feeling so happy. He was genuinely interesting to talk with and we had great conversations. But they were all on tinder. When we moved over to Snapchat, I noticed his replies were always very very late. I have little patience, and it irritated me. 

He replied to my snaps after many hours of leaving me on delivered, resulting in us having 1 conversation spread over 3 days, that we could've finished within 20 minutes in reality. His active status told me he wasn't ignoring me. After we had talked for over a month, with nothing happening, I told him honestly I wasn't satisfied with his late replies. He told me he had turned off notifications on all apps, except for on Tinder (which is why he was faster to reply on Tinder). He told me that being on his phone stressed him out a lot, which I understand, but we were not able to communicate this way. Sometimes he'd be on for about 30 minutes, and we'd talk consecutively for 30 minutes, and then he'd be off his phone for 6, sometimes, 10, and sometimes over 24 hours. At this point we'd talked for two months. He complimented me a lot and seemed genuinely interested in me. I started looking forward to getting snaps from him every day, and I'd check my phone all the time to see if he had sent me something. I always felt so discouraged when I saw he hadn't been on for many hours. All I wanted to do was talk to him. And I think I told him over 3 times at least, that this wasn't working for me. He only lived 20 minutes away as well, but he never initiated any meet-up. 2 months of talking, with living 20 minutes away from each other, but no meet-up.... It just wasn't working for me. I sensed I was becoming quite attached to him and got hurt whenever he spent over 20 hours replying (without even meeting the dude jesus christ what's wrong with me), so I just deleted him off Snap after I had complained about it to him for the last time. Yes, I told him I wanted to meet him and wasn't shy to bring it up at least twice. He just came up with an excuse every time. After deleting him I felt a bit sad. I'd spent so much time focusing on a stupid dude I hadn't even met. I still had him on Instagram, so if he really was sorry, he'd probably message me there. He didn't.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward 5 months or so later, he started liking random pictures on my profile after no contact ever since I'd deleted him off snap. He liked my photos with his main account and private account. I figured he wanted my attention somehow. Though it'd be better if he DMed me, instead of being so halfassed. I went into our DMs just to check what was there from before, and a message request popped up. I hadn't gotten a notification of it either, I just saw it when I went into his DMs. I accepted, but nothing was there. I'm not particularly shy and pretty straight-forward so I just simply DMed him myself and asked him if he had meant to send me something. He told me no (it might've been an old message he just deleted, maybe?) but then in the next message he said, ""but maybe it's the universe trying to get us to link up?;)"". Apparently, he was still interested. We started talking again, and he asked me to add him on Snapchat again. He told me he had missed talking to me. I had posted a selfie that same day, and he told me how hot I looked in it. It made me very happy. Anyway, we started talking like normal again and I also told him why I deleted him.

&amp;#x200B;

After talking for over a month since I had just re-added him, we had gotten to know each other even better. And we even talked about meeting up, so one day we finally set a fucking DATE. Ugh. It had taken so long. He told me he wanted to pick me up, meet my dad (???what), my dog, go for a lil trip, and then go to his place. He told me he wanted to see a romantic anime movie?? lmfao. It was cute, and I was very much excited. At 5 am the morning of the day we were suppsoed to meet, he tells me he'd been vomiting all night and therefore couldn't make it. It sounded a li bit suspicious to me, after everything that had happened. I told him that I was a lil disappointed, but that I hoped he felt better soon. He said he wanted to reschedule, not cancel, which comforted me. Several weeks go by... At this point I had tried to find a new date we could agree on, probably 3 times. But no. He was soo busy. Keep in mind, this dude is 20 and doesn't have a u fucking job, he spends his time gaming and being a slave to his mother apparently. He has used his mom as an excuse for than once. I got very discouraged, once again, and decided it was time to stop trying. When he snapped me, I didn't really feel like talking to him like normal anymore. I was later to respond and I didn't respond at all to his dry texts. Which resulted in him always double or triple snapping me. He sensed something was wrong apparently, because one night when I'd been particularly distant, he had sent me a loooong paragraph  at 3am that covered the entire screen (even more) explaining how much he doesn't want to lose me again, that he's so scared I'll delete him, that he wants to see me, etc... He told me he had trust issues and didn't meet new people often. I told myself to hang on. In the message he told me how much he admired me, that I wasn't like other girls (cringe to hear imo and very over-used). He mentioned FIVE times ""please don't delete me!!"". Don't know if he'd had something to drink or not, but I was shocked to see his message in the morning. 

Later when I ask him straight up what he wants out of this, he tells me doesn't want anything serious. I ask him what he wants then, and he says he doesn't know. I told him ""dude if you want something casual, like a fuckbuddy, why can't you say that? I don't like the relationship vibes you're giving off, talking about meeting my dad, my dog and when you say you get jealous when I'm with my guy friends?"". His response was ""noo, I don't want a relationship, but I don't want something casual either. I want something with feelings even though there shouldn't be"". Bruh. I just ask him ""so basically you want someone you can spend time with, do relationship things with, meet their family, have sex with and cuddle with, without it being labeled as a relationship? You want a relationship without the label"". After I asked him this he told me he was stressed and wasn't sure what he wanted. ""Can't we just meet and then we figure it out???"". BRO THATS WHAT IVE BEEN TRYING TO DO FOR THE LONGEST FUCKING TIME. So - we finally meet.

We met for the first time over a month ago. He picked me up at my house. I was actually extremely nervous. I have hooked up with 2 other dudes from tinder before, but somehow I was very nervous to see this one guy. I couldn't see him in the eyes for a long time, for some reason, because he stared so deeply into my soul. He told me I looked so beautiful in person and on the pictures as well, but more so in person. We went on a lil trip into the forest, and we'd walk side by side, talking. Talking to him felt very natural to me and very easy. He is not at all shy in person. I noticed he'd try to get close to me several times, but I somehow escaped every time, until I sat down on a log and he sat down beside me, leaving no space between us. He took my hand, touched my hair, studied my features... We looked at the ocean. The sun was setting. Suddenly he just goes in for a hug. A really long and tight hug. Later, we walk further into the forest and he holds my hand (because he was apparently scared I was gonna trip over the branches) for some time before we sit down at a vantage point. On a rock, with ocean view. Sun was still setting. He lied down on a flat rock, and pulled me down with him. He started kissing me. I think we were making out for an hour, cuddling and making out. It was amazing. Can't believe it had taken us so long to do this. Long story short... we had sex outside. It was cold. But he made it so romantic. He was so gentle and loving. He even asked me if he could go down on me. I have never met a man before who wanted to do that on the first time we have sex. I felt it was a bit too intimate, and I was hesitating a bit because I am self-conscious of my vulva... He sensed I got tense, so he took it as a no. Then we had penetrative sex. The sky was pink and orange. He was so gentle about everything, asking me all the time ""are you comfortable?"", ""please tell me if you ever feel uncomfortable"". I just felt genuiney cared for in that moment, that when he dropped me off at home later, I felt incredibly sad. When I was getting out of the car, he got disappointed because I didn't give him a goodbye kiss. He grabbed my hand and told me to give him a kiss before I went, so I did. It didn't feel casual at all. I knew at that point I'd gotten attached, and I was prepared for heartbreak one day. I was scared he'd ghost me after this. He didn't. He sent me several snaps the minute he got home. 

&amp;#x200B;

However... A month after we'd met for the first time, we hadnt' set up a new date for our next meet-up. Although he told me he wanted to see me, he was too busy. I just can't see how he can be THAT busy when you netiher go to school or have a job and you're up all night... It's a matter of priorities. I was having the busiest school week of my life, yet I'd be willing to meet up with him any of those days... I just felt legitimately hurt and betrayed, because the last 2 weeks we communicated, he was only online once a day, or LESS. His activity status would even say ""active yesterday"", because he was just always offline. He told me to send him text messages, instead of snaps. So I did. We talked about my dad, that he was going to get cancer treatments for the first time... I had been in a very dark place, and I wanted to talk to him further about it, because we've previously talked about his own deeper problems. I sent him a text message asking if we could talk over the phone. And he just... never replied to it. 2 days went by, no communication. I felt like I was annoying. It was embarrassing. I was sad and angry, because he knew I wasn't feeling great at the moment. So I deleted him again. Just off snapchat. I don't know if it sounds immature, but I figure that when I've told him so many times directly about how he hurts me, and he's not doing anything with it, then he should be able to figure out why I deleted him again. For the last time. He knows where he can contact me. He has my number, my instagram... It's been over a week since I deleted him now. No contact. He never replied to that last text message.

&amp;#x200B;

I do miss him. I feel lonely. But maybe it wasn't love. It couldn't be love, could it? I always thought I'd be able to change his mind about wanting a relationship, rather than a situationship. I know what you're all thinking; that was a stupid thought. You can't ever convince anyone to want a relationship with you. But I still do wonder sometimes, what did he really want? When we only met once, why did he still want to keep in contact with me? I just don't understand. Sorry for this long post. I just needed to vent, but I realized I had been going on and on forever. I kind of want someone to tell me what to do. But also I know what you're all going to say. I feel stupid for this, but I still think there could've been something great out of this ""relationship"" thing.

I lost a good amount in 2020 and I'm halfway to the amount of weight I want to lose. Something still feels off though since I do want to experience something like I've already mentioned. I guess a part of it could be feeling lonely since I do lack social interaction with friends. I've tried to ask people if they want to do things like grab a meal, or go to the gym with me. But, everyone is just busy and it leaves me with just myself. I definitely feel like I'm drifting apart from certain people. It's honestly normal though after High School so I don't feel completely bad because of it. I just wish I knew of a way of finding people I can relate to.

The owner of the server invited his friend onto the discord server.

I asked him who they were and he told me it's a girl he'd tried to bring into games before. I go ""ah, her. Ok just checking who the random person we'd be playing with is.""

So it's around mid March and she gets on with us. I say hi then continue chatting with the guys doing my usual thing. We get to work on what we need to do first and I start adding commentary while I'm busy. She hears what I say and replies with the same understanding and energy that I have. Now I'm not like guys who sees a girl and immediately wants to date her. I just thought ""sweet! New friend who can take what I'm fishing out AND serve it back to me!""

So we stay talking all night until 6 a.m. that's right, 6 a.m.... no other friend has done that! So we chat about our lives, likes, and dislikes and realize our lives are basically parallel to each other to the point where she has a sister with my name, lived in my town for a while but moved a third of the state over, and her birthday is exactly a month from mine. Her life was also developing at the same pace as mine even though her family is more involved than mine was. So I start giving her some pep talk because I got my license at 19 and she just passed her written test the day after we met. She's 18 and will be 19 this year while I turn 21 a month before her.

So I have fun chatting on and off but I share this with other girls I've met from gaming so I'm not as emotionally involved as someone else would get. Then April hits and mid way through my mom passed away. She is now texting me at this point and I tell her about the bad news. She says she will always be available to talk if I wanted so I thanked her. 

A week later I went to my sisters place across the state where my mom lived and told my sister I might come back with a friend to have fun and distract myself from my mom not being there.

Now I'm grieving at this point. I'm drinking vodka while playing video games with friends. Then she starts messaging me and I mention the trip to my sisters and that she can come if she wants but I'd understand if she doesn't want to. My logic being she's on the way and my family in the town over is respectable and fun to be around so she'd have a blast knowing the things she tells me. She says yes and I went ""real $#!+?..."".

Then it's late April to early may. I'm slowly testing her boundaries to make sure I'm not misreading her intentions. I say she doesn't have to go, she says shes ok with going. I say we can do a movie and she says we can do that later (introducing me to vampire diaries, but I don't mind) 

so at this point I've streamed the Incredibles with her using Disney's share feature and we talk constantly until the time of 3 a.m. She'd be graduation on the weekend, I'd be meeting her parents and maybe the rest of her fam if they're around next week when I'm off. And she'll meet my personal family on our trip on the weekend. Life is good, I got a job, a house, a car, a plan for a career path, and a girl who actually cares about me. Then the BS began on may 16th... The day my heart stopped for 15 minutes.

It's her graduation weekend, I worked night shift for a year since I was 19 so I've been waiting until Monday to talk to her about it. Just the usual ""don't be sad it's over, be glad for what's to come. I'll help any way I need to!"" And she texted me Saturday she wants to speak and I say I'm at work and can't verbally talk. The next night, Sunday, is no different except for new info I would only worry about if I was paranoid like I am today. 

Her ""Hey can I call you?""
Me: ""sorry I'm at work, I've failed you again 😔""
Her: ""no it's ok, just have fun at work!""
Me: ""yes ma'am!""
Her: ""I got asked out today!""
Me, feeling light headed: ""did you say yes?""
Her: ""I sat next to him so yeah.""
Her: ""I gave him my number yesterday""
Her: ""we're grabbing coffee next weekend!""

I had to stop messaging to stop my hands from shaking. Apparently they met at graduation, she thought he was cute, gave him her number, and the guy was dumb enough to ask her out the second day and she. Said. Yes... I was done!

I figured we might've been friends in the first place so did my usual check in routine with her. Then she never responded until later and told me he was exactly like me (but a cheap rip off version I assure you) I told her I didn't like this guy and she pushed it off as a joke. I had to work so I said bye and left. Since that point she had been ghosting me and a week after the graduation she told me she wasn't going to tulsa anymore and that she would be introducing HIM to things he never watched. 

I snapped at that point! I told her that she was gas lighting me on purpose. I'd understand our plans changing and the lack of talk but to keep messaging me about him and saying they're doing what we planned to do was unacceptable. I got a few things off my chest and made sure her next actions couldn't be taken as arrogant misjudgements on my feelings. I was making an effort everyday to talk like we used to for the month of march and early April.

Then the next week I tried not talking to her but a tornado warning hit me and her area so I had to break my silence and check if she was alright. She actually spoke to me like she naturally did but then stopped again. I waited until Saturday before effectively giving her one last chance. I told her I'm not pretty boy but I'm still me and that I only wanted to keep talking to her but she only gives me a small empty reply and then a wall Everytime I try making a conversation happen. 

I waited half an hour before giving up and gave her my final message for her to decide if I'm gonna stay in her life. I effectively said ""fine, case in point, I feel used and now I am done. You know the spring I've had and how I feel. Ill give my graduation gift I have for you to our mutual friend and be done with you. If you actually want to talk now, I'll be waiting for a call. I think I deserve 10 minutes after 2 weeks of anxiety about this!""

She actually messaged back saying she was sorry and thought avoiding me would make me feel better. I said I only wanted to know what was going on. We got on a call and apologized and talked about things. I had to go so I said bye and hoped there weren't any more hiccups to be concerned about. She said I was permanent and he was only a thing. 

Last week after clearly waiting for when she had nothing better to do than amuse my anxiety she kept saying how great he was, she showed him movies he never saw and in her last forced message said she met his family. Only one pseudo conversation was started afterwards on Saturday. She hasn't messaged me since and now it's Wednesday afternoon.

The only sanity I can find is in calling her an ex that cheated on me and I should move on and only stay friends if she would put effort from her side like she did before. This whole post is a vent since I've exhausted my family and friends with this chaos. I haven't covered everything but enough to know what's happened. If you have any questions I can answer them if it doesn't threaten her or my privacy. Thank you!

We have been seeing each other for about 2 months now, I have met her family she has met most of mine, things seem to be moving quite quickly, we are basically inseparable. 

Once we arrived home, her Mum shows up while we are relaxing after unpacking and cleaning. Her mum walks in and sits down on the bed and starts saying how she wants to kill herself and how life is unfair. Now her mom has to take care of the grandmother who is 92 and suffers from Dementia and is basically bed ridden and doesn’t stop talking/winging. On top of this she also had an operation in which she is in agony but won’t do anything to help herself (she won’t eat healthy or stop smoking etc)

During all of above she then snaps and asks my non offical gf for $150. The GF knows this is for the pokies and the mother starts using excuses about having to get out of the house, needs to eat (which she doesn’t) wants to socialise. The GF is adamant that she is going straight to the pokies and these are just excuses so holds off for about 30 mins while a fully grown 55 year old has a tantrum. Now I have seen addiction behaviour and my god where my senses running high. In the past 7-8 years I had known her mum I have never seen her act like that before. 

The GF eventually gave in after having expressing that this was damaging their relationship. The mother then took the money and left quickly (crying on the way out I’m not too sure). I was then asked for advice in which I could hardly say a thing except that if she has done this before and continues to do it, GF should call the police if she refuses to leave because by giving her the money she will be back for more. My advice was not taken well (I knew I should have just shut my mouth and not said boo).

We uncomfortably sat on the couch for about 5 minutes before she put the movie back on in which I didn’t want to watch. Then sat awkwardly for the next hour 1/2 watching a movie and all i could think about was wanting to go home. Now I knew that going home was a bad idea but was it unbearable. I feel I had been in a fight even knowing nothing had happened. I didn’t know wether to comfort her physically, leave her alone, ask how she felt, I just sat there with my thoughts manifesting into weirder more damaging thoughts.

I didn’t end up leaving but expressed I wanted to leave in which the GF seemed shocked and confused.

I was planning to meet him this week until he made his actual intentions clear. He said he’s open to anything from being a friend with benefits to a relationship with me. 

I posted about it on another sub and the comments were pretty clear about him wanting something causal with me.

I built a friendship with him and we speak daily. He’s become a part of my daily routine and we both tell each other about what’s going on in each other’s lives. I’ve advised him on multiple occasions and he’s been there just to speak to me when I needed it too. I know I can’t be his friend.

I just need some advice on some nuances to this particular ghosting that’s happened. 

Background:

Three years ago I met this girl at work. I basically drive a mobile bar, and her and her friends were out celebrating a birthday. Her and I really hit it off and pretty much talked the entire time, but right before I could get her number at the end of the ride her friend asked me for mine. 

I was stuck in a pretty terrible position where I couldn’t deny her friend my number and then turn around and ask for hers in front of her friend, so I just said I wasn’t really looking for anything and accepted that I would probably never see her again. 

Flash-forward to this past Halloween. I saw her on Hinge and we ended up matching. We had some good conversation and she said she was up for getting drinks, but because it was Halloween weekend we both already had plans. I said I would text her the following week to set things up, but when I did she ghosted me. I accepted it and moved on, but she continued to like my Instagram posts, watch my stories, etc. which I thought was odd. 

Anyways, two weekends ago I was out at a bar with my friend having some drinks. She walks into the bar with a few friends, but I don’t acknowledge her and try to mind my own business. A few minutes later she gets up from her booth, walks around the bar and sits next to me, starts eating my chicken tenders and initiates a conversation. 

Needless to say I was surprised, but I was also skeptical. So I pull out my phone, to back to our previous conversation and ask her why she ghosted me back in October. She said Hinge dates are weird and awkward for her, and just didn’t follow through for that reason. 

Fair, I guess, so we continue talking and things are going really well. We leave the bar, run around to a few more, and the night ends at her place. I wake up the next morning, she’s happy to see me still there, and before I leave I ask if she wants to do it again and she enthusiastically says she does. 

So naturally I'm feeling pretty good about my chances here.

I give it a couple days and text her the following Monday, basically saying that I had a good time and that I couldn't believe I ran into her, ending the text with ""I would love to buy you that drink if you're interested, maybe sometime this week or this weekend."" 

She responded very enthusiastically. She ""hearted"" my message (iPhone) and said she would love to do it again, but that she would be really busy with work this week for an event she's planning the following Monday. I just replied acknowledging that I remembered her mentioning that the prior night, and that I would text her next week to set up plans. 

So that's exactly what I do. I texted her on Tuesday of this week and made a bit of small talk, just asking how her event went, to which she again responded very enthusiastically. I didn't make much small talk other than a few comments, and then went straight to the point, asking her what she is up to this weekend and if she would want to grab that drink we talked about. BOOM. Ghosted. 

Like I said, I've been ghosted before. I can handle that, but I've never been ghosted by someone who has expressed such genuine excitement and interest in-person. So much to the point that she went out of her way to leave her friends on their night out just to hangout with me. She also liked all of my instagram activity since then (three posts) which I would find strange for someone to do then immediately turn around and ghost. Coupling that with her enthusiasm over text, I'm a bit confused. Normally I would let it go and move on, but that's what is holding me back. 

She told me numerous times that she's looking for something serious, and I do believe that. I know people that know her and she doesn't have the reputation for dating a lot of people or running around. I'm also thinking back to her comments about Hinge dates and dates generally being awkward for her. When we went out it wasn't really a date, we just found each other at a bar and took it from there. No prior planning, no pressure. 

So basically I'm going to double down. I just don't know how. I've thought about being very clear why I'm double texting her, saying something along the lines of ""I'm only double texting because I know you mentioned setting up and going out on dates is awkward for you, but I really do want to get to know you better and to take this seriously."" I've asked a few friends about their thoughts on doing so, some of which are women, but I've gotten mixed reviews. 

What's my move here? Do I double down but do it in a less forward way? Or do I just accept my fate despite her actions and words (aside from the ghosting) indicating genuine interest? I also wouldn't send a text until the end of this weekend.

I’ve been in the talking stage twice, but it fizzled out mutually. And growing up, when someone I was into liked me back, I always panicked or convinced myself I was not good enough or just “seeing things”. Just for reference, I’ve made out with two women, nothing else. I’ve been on Bumble and Tinder, honestly just to see if anyone would be attracted to me, and I even got a few matches! But in my head, I think “how the fuck are people doing this”. Like when I get a match I instantly panic. Dating gives me so much anxiety/adrenaline. Like I overthink, and even the thought of going out with someone or being physical gives me nerves to the point I shake. What if it goes bad and I mess up? Or I show up and she instantly regrets being there? My biggest fear is going out with someone and them thinking I’m cooler than I actually am, and in her head she’s like “damn, this guy sucks”. You know?

I think it has a lot to do with self worth because of being bullied growing up as a kid. As an adult now, people generally like me. Coworkers all go out of their way to talk to me and will be in stitches just from me joking around, and my friends that I recently just linked up with again we’re really happy to hang out with me again. But in the back in my head I think “fuck, there no way I’m that interesting/funny/attractive etc to date”. It’s the vulnerability of putting myself out there that I’m scared of. But I really want to push myself to get over this fear.

Could some people on here give me their personal dating feelings or their insight? It would really help to hear women’s perspectives too and their thoughts about dating and insecurities.
