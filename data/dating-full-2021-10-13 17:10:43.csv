I decided to finally try it again recently.

I started dating this girl who runs a karaoke show at the local bar I go to. We were talking since August. I'm a regular there. I started vibing with her, and we started talking and we started dating. As I got to know her, she is a really sweet girl, but she told me about her previous history and how she has mental health issues. I didn't want to disqualify her for that, so I carried on and wanted to empathize with her situation. However, her mental health starting making the dating situation rough. She went through cycles of being skeptical about my motives or why I was treating her so nice and even said ""maybe we shouldn't be dating"". I just told her that we are still getting to know each other and that I'm being empathetic to her mental health.

It has been a rollercoaster of emotions. I thought maybe I could deal with her mental health issues (the mood swings, her being skeptical of me, etc, etc), but I started realizing it was bothering me more and more. When things got toxic in my last relationship, I had a bad habit of balling my feelings up and trudging along. We started moving too fast, and when we realized that, we hit the brakes, but she never did. She had gotten too drunk one night, and I let her know what happened the next day, and she was embarrassed and made me feel bad for telling her. Last Thursday, I jokingly said something about how I wanted to smack the person making me a sandwich at some late night food spot we went to (the employee was rude as hell to me), and she lashed out at me because what I said was triggering to her (she had a physically abusive relationship in the past). She didn't want to talk to me anymore. Last Friday, one of her high school friends passed away, and the way she mentioned it to me was like if he was a passing acquaintance. Since she said she didn't want to see me anymore, I went about my day, went out to hang out with my friends. She randomly hits me up at 1am the next day asking if we could link up. I told her I wasn't around. She then lashed out at me saying ""I figured I could see you because I just wanted comfort after being at this funeral.""

The next day, I went to an event at the bar. She was there. I was cordial with her. She was playing music. I was there hanging out and had some drinks. A random girl comes to ask me to dance. Things got pretty close since it was a dance that was borderline sensual. Of course, the girl I was talking to then rips me for afterwards and told me there is no chance we are fixing this. The next day, she is groveling at my feet (via text) saying how much she misses us and how I am only human and can make mistakes and wanted to talk about it, but the mental Olympics I allowed myself to be a part of stressed me out. What kills me even more is that the dancing with that other girl incident was what I used as my ""out"". I told her I felt bad about that, and that it showed that I wasn't ready to date, but in reality, it was this incident and all the mental health hoops that she put me through that truly led me to end it. I felt like me telling her that her mental health affected me would hurt her immensely.

 I think she's a really nice girl, but I don't think I'm ready to date, nor is she. I was very brief with her after that...trying to get her to understand that I didnt want to pursue this relationship any further. She said she would stop messaging.

This Thursday is karaoke once again, and I'm always there. She will be there too of course since she is the host. I want to go so that I can prove to myself I'm capable of being cordial and not awkward, but at the same time, maybe I shouldn't for a bit because this is a ""too soon"" type of deal. I can see myself being at least a friend to her in the future, but nothing more.

We were chatting like that, and at first she was sending me pictures of herself. One time even she sent me a boomerang video of her while showering.

We get to 16th September, my birthday party. She was acting kinda warm, she hugged me and wished me a happy birthday when i turned 17. So the same day i said ok let's invite her out. I texted her and invited her out and she told me she has been seeing another guy. So i replied with ""listen i don't care if you are going out with another guy, that doesn't bother me"". And she said ""that she isn't that type of a girl "". So i told myself ok and called it a night.

I started to take more time to respond to her photos like 4-6 hours and when i started doing that she started replying immidietly. I did not initiated contact, nothing I  just pulled away. 

And on 26th of Septmber I left her on seen, because why would i text her when she does not want to even go out with me?

She also would bump in to me and get close to me when it wasn’t necessary but then would pull away slightly when I noticed and made visible contact back but then would get close again. She also reapplied her lip stick in front at a random time because we didn’t eat anything. We did kiss a few times and she didn’t pull away. After the date she texted me late to make sure I got home safely and added me back on snap right away after I added her. When we text it seems like she is not interested I know it’s early on but I’m just trying to figure out if she is playing hard to get or not?

So it is the typical. I (M20), a CS student, never had a girlfriend. Because of this I can't talk to girls very well. I usually run out of topics. However I'm not an introvert, I have friends and can talk to everyone but I'm not too comfortable when I'm with a girl alone. By never having a relationship makes me more depressed lately.

Now I have a group of friends girls included. I am really happy when I'm partying with them. But there's one girl I am extra happy to see. Now if she does not come or I can't see her for a longer period of time it makes me even more sad.

And now the best part. I finally managed to be with her alone. I've managed to talk to her for about an hour. I've never talked this long to a girl before alone. However she did not fail to  mention inviting her boyfriend to meet our group. Yeah classic. But this was as close as it gets to being rejected for the first time.

Now at least I know not to waste time trying to get her. However I am still sad when I'm not with her and I have to constantly think about her.

TLDR: How can I move on and accept that I won't find a relationship anytime soon and stop being depressed about it

There were also a few issues involving a psycho ex that tried to murder us on the hwy for 2 hours straight. And after that I told him I didn’t want him to talk to her. And I had to find out for myself that he was still talking to her and he would deny it when I asked him if he was still talking to her then I would pull out the proof. He said this was manipulative and I told him I was legitimately trying to test his honesty. I feel like he never told me the truth.(how I feel because of his actions) he asked me to stay when I was leaving and I really wanted to but I couldn’t play the guessing game anymore. I was tired of always being on edge. I thought that once I finally found everything out he would be completely transparent with me but I was wrong. I wanted him to be the one so bad that I ignored every red flag thrown at me I’m still contemplating going back because i feel like im gonna die of sadness or at my own hands. He made me strong for both of us. And I now feel like I can’t live without him.

I don’t think he’ll miss me I think he’s glad I left so he can pursue other girls especially his old life style he mentioned he missed so much picking out of a mystery box (tinder,bumble, plenty of fish,etc.)

I like two people and I feel horrible trying to choose, I don’t know what the right thing to do is. See, there’s one girl(girl 1) who is very pretty and nice although I don’t know if I’m in love with her personality. The other girl (girl 2)is also very attractive and nice as well, and she also makes me laugh and she is even friends with my own friends.

Thing is, girl 1 is actually attracted to me. She clearly shows that she has some form of feelings for me. I talk to her every so often and I enjoy it, I’m still very awkward.

Girl 2 seems to think of me more as a friend as far as I can tell. I love talking to her but I can tell that I am extremely awkward because of the feelings I hold for her, and I feel like it makes me less appealing.

Everybody knows that girl 1 likes me and is pushing me to go for it, but I’m afraid of if I’ll be dating her and still have feelings for girl 2.

I am a fairly attractive tall guy but nothing too crazy, I’ve never dated a girl in my life as I’ve never taken an opportunity and not many girls think I’m all that as far as I’m aware. I want to go for girl 2 in the deepest part of my heart but I think she doesent like me and I don’t want to ruin our friendship, I feel cornered because If I do decide to ask girl 2 to go out with me then girl 1 will lose interest and feel betrayed. I think I may have led girl 1 on too much and I don’t want to hurt her. 

Also I feel girl 2 doesent know  my true personality because I have been very depressed lately because my dog of 13 years recently died, I haven’t been myself and have been pretty quiet because I haven’t told anyone and don’t know if I should, I don’t want to ruin the mood.

I started work on my project and she stopped and sort of watched me. I asked her ""what?"" And she said ""nothing"" and turned away. She's really cute and really smart and honestly I think I'm starting to feel for her but I can't tell if she feels the same. 

It was quiet in the computer lab so Instead of talking we made texts in our notes. And I got sick of that and asked for her snap (should of got a number, doh! )
I added her but she hasn't added me back yet.

I am very attracted to him and our first few dates were great. He's currently in the process of switching to a new job and moving to a new apartment so he has a lot of free time during this transition, in which we've been hanging out a lot. However, over time, I've noticed his behavior towards me becoming more and more cold, even though he still regularly wants to hang out. He'd do things like ask me to come over, buy me dinner, then be on his computer the whole time or repairing and packing stuff in his apartment. When I try to talk to him, he either completely ignores me (I can tell he heard me because he looks my direction) or gives me short answers or seems disinterested. 

I'm also aware he was dating other women or at least looking, as have I because we haven't established what we are and I can tell that perhaps he's keeping me on standby while he looks for someone he likes more. I know that me knowing this, I should just run, but I can't help it. He lives so close to me and we enjoy the same music and food and get bored at nights and like to get together to have a few drinks and watch a movie. I feel like we're heading more towards a friend like relationship but we still have sex occasionally. I'm not really sure what to make of this whole situation. I also realized despite how hot he is, the reason he isn't constantly dating or dating the same person is because he has a bad personality. He has anger issues and if he doesn't care about something, he's not engaged at all, even just to be polite. He doesn't seem to have any friends and he has a toxic relationship with his identical twin brother, who also seems to have anger issues (he broke a bunch of stuff in his apartment). Last week, his brother's ex who still seems to have a key to his apartment, broke in while he was at work and stole a ton of expensive camera equipment. I was the only person who helped him and stayed at his place apartment sitting while he got locks changed and allowed him to store stuff at my own place and stay over for a week. I bet I'm the only person who will help him move as well. 

I know deep down inside this relationship won't work because I don't like the way he treats me, there's no affection and the way he obsesses over stuff and ignores me, but I also wish that he would see that I've been there for him when no one else has and maybe he should be nicer to me to keep me around.  I've been thinking of telling him I need more out of whatever this relationship is otherwise there isn't really much in it for me. I don't really want to end a potential friendship but in the end, I know if he starts dating someone he really likes, he will ditch me... but the odds of him finding a woman that would tolerate his crap seems low.

I am worried I may have been roofied in December of 2020. 

I was coming back from a 3 hour road trip to spend time with this guy I’ve been seeing. I wanted to go home and shower first-a normal request. 

However, he was super adamant about me getting to the apartment at a certain time. I thought it was odd, but shook off those thoughts. 

I really wanted High Noon Vodka Soda when I got there-it’s my favorite, however he claimed they were too expensive and he wanted to make his own instead. 

When I got there, he handed me a mason jar of vodka soda, and before I’d even consumed half, I was the most intoxicated I’d ever been in my entire life. 

I don’t remember having sex with him that night, just waking up in his bed the next morning. I don’t remember anything after I drank half the glass of vodka soda. 

So I’m beginning to wonder if his insistence of me getting there at a certain time meant he put something in my drink. 

I am not a lightweight by any means. I can handle my alcohol.

I (28F) had a summer fling with a man (27M) and it made me realize how I want to feel when I'm with a romantic partner.

We started talking in May, and by July he had let me know that he didn't see himself dating me further. He tried to friend zone me but I had a deep feeling in my gut that even if I did allow him to remain my friend, he'd never speak to me again anyway, so I politely thanked him for being so kind to me while we were talking and declined the offer. He told me that I helped him during a difficult time in his life, and we left it at that. I unfollowed him on instagram and chose the option that made his account unfollow mine as well. I unfriended him on snapchat, and I deleted our imessage thread (I'm a very sentimental person and I like reading old message threads to feel nostalgic and happy. Deleting this thread was a big deal for me.) 

Over this two month period we spoke to each other every day. From waking up, all the way 'til going to sleep, we had a consistent back and forth. We went on a couple of great dates that he raved about, and we slept together once. I've had three relationships in my adult life-- a girlfriend of 1 year, girlfriend of 2 years, and then a boyfriend of 1 year. Compared to these three people of my past, he immediately was treating me better and speaking to me with more respect than any of them. It was refreshing. I also had never been the type of girl that was given pet names, never been the type of girl that was lucky enough to feel taken care of or petite/small (in a good/protected way, if that makes sense?), but he came into my life and did these things for me. Called me baby and other silly pet names, sent me sentimental messages at random or let me know what he was thinking about me, and was very vocal and kind in the way he expressed what he liked about me. I felt protected and desired. I was finally talking to somebody that wanted to give me the kind of care I'd given my exes and never received.

I'd never felt that good before. I've always been the more caretaking partner of the pair when I was with my girlfriends-- and my ex boyfriend was abusive (physically, mentally, and sexually), so I never got the chance to *really* feel like a girlfriend considering the fact that he put a lot of effort into making me feel ugly and undesirable. Talking to this man was patching up my self esteem from this bad track record. I felt beautiful for the first time in years. Like.. I, for the firs time, viewed myself as beautiful. It was so different compared to a friend or a date giving you a compliment and you awkwardly accepting it. But I guess that doesn't make sense.

It wasn't until he rejected me that I realized I felt more for this person than any of my past partners. It was a punch in the chest. I have a long track record of driving people away when I open up, so I didn't share any of the above information with him. I didn't want him to see me as this sloppy girl with a tragic backstory that suddenly is falling for him after two months of knowing him. I guess there's a part of me that wishes I'd gotten a little emotional/messy on him and expressed myself. But I'm pretty convinced that wouldn't have changed anything.

If you've read this far I appreciate you, because this is where my dilemma is:

It's now October. I spend time with my best friend, I get outdoors and hike with my dog, I go do my nerdy dnd stuff with my party on the weekends, I'm killing it at a new job, and I actively go on dates with new guys from Tinder and Hinge in hopes I'll connect with somebody. But I still think about him every day and it's not getting easier. I never check his social media and I've never had the urge to text or contact him whatsoever, but I still think about him periodically throughout the day. It's miserable. I'm miserable. I feel myself sinking into a pit.

I'm not connecting with any of my dates-- even have tried multiple dates with the same person, but I don't feel the spark, or the butterflies, or the desire. They're nice, but they don't make me feel beautiful or confident like he did. I just want to feel wholesome and good again. I want to be somebody's girlfriend so badly, but I don't want to commit unless I can feel the way he made me feel. it doesn't even need to be him. If there was anyone that could make me feel similarly, I'd welcome it with open arms, which is why I'm still out there dating. But I genuinely feel like I'm just wasting everyone's time. It's kinda hopeless.

I'm sorry if you read all this. I just needed a good vent. I've never spoken about this in this much detail because quite frankly, I feel like a fucking idiot for being this torn up over somebody I barely got to know.

I (mid-late 20sF) moved back in with my parents at the start of lockdown last year. It made sense for a lot of reasons - finances, they have a garden, it stopped them worrying about me, etc. But it's a small town, I don't really know anyone here - and even if I did, I couldn't go out and meet them because my mum is clinically extremely vulnerable and unvaccinated (note: on doctor's advice!) and case rates are high here. I basically haven't left the house since March 2020. I haven't seen any of my friends since March 2020, and I can count on two hands the number of people outside my family that I've spoken to in person (people like ""the nurses at the vaccination centre"" and ""the cashier at the local takeaway"")

It's especially frustrating because I felt like my life was finally on track - I'd spent years clawing my mental health back together after some bad experiences, got a job, got an apartment, made friends, was looking to date, then boom, covid. It wasn't so bad at first, even up until this summer I was coping, but case rates don't seem to be going anywhere and the rental market here has just gone crazy. If I move out now, I'd be able to meet friends without worrying about bringing a killer infection back to my mum, but I'd be paying something like 60% of my income on rent before utilities and food, and prices for those have gone crazy too. So even though I'm in the best physical shape/have the best body confidence of my life (I lost 13kg over lockdown - feels good!) it doesn't matter because I can't meet anyone. It feels like I'm wasting my mid 20s stuck in my room, while all the people I know seem to be getting married. They're not - it's a FB echo chamber thing - but it feels like it. 

tl;dr Avoided dating for years to deal with my issues. Finally had a glow-up but now I'm stuck at home where I know no-one and can't go out safely, and probably will be until spring. Getting on a dating app seems unfair/pointless currently when I can't meet the people I'd match with. I've been trying to keep in touch with friends/make new friends online, but it's not the same.

Great connection. So understanding of current mental health issues I am going through, but also because he is going through similar. We hang out often despite having very busy lives and we both have a very strong interest and love for dogs. He has two and I have 1. When I first started talking to him, he actually had just picked up the second puppy from Montana. This is a weird part; the dog was bought for him by a girl that he used to know in high school but she is married. I do believe he lead her on and at some point she was very upset about it. Then he limited communication with her and still has the dog.
Red flag right there. Hello.
Flash forward to my idiot ass. One common interest we had is the breed of dogs we absolutely love. I randomly meet a lady who knows a breeder about an hour away. I start to correspond with her but at the time they had a huge waiting list and didn’t expect to have available puppies soon but said I can come see their facility. While there seeing the place I developed a friendship with the older lady that runs the breeding facility. Due to my line of work she actually hired me to do something for her. In the months that I was going up there to do work they had 4 litters (2 being accidental). They knew I was obsessed with this breed and encouraged me to pick out a puppy I liked. I picked one out over pictures and then later saw a different one and contacted them immediately and said please hold this one for me instead.
Every trip I would make up there to work or just spend time with the breeder, I held and played with my puppy.
Because of some issues at home I couldn’t bring the dog to my house right away and wanted to make sure he was potty trained and just well behaved before I brought him home full time. This is where my friend comes into play. 
Over the course of about 3 months and knowing I’d be bringing this puppy home and initially it would go to his house. I was very nervous and somewhat paranoid and I would always ask/clarify that we would be sharing the dog and he would not ever keep it from me. He promised profusely. Even though I had picked out the puppy via picture the breeder encouraged me to come see all the pups because some were very unique. I invited my friend to this and as usual with anything I plan for us to do he either slept or didn’t feel good. So I gave him an opportunity to pick out this puppy with me and he didn’t. Finally the day came to bring him home and he went with me. The puppy is beautiful, smart, well behaved (for a puppy), sweet as can be. My youngest daughter is obsessed with him and my other dog absolutely has the best time playing with him.
I keep him sometimes for up to a week and then he goes back to my friend and the other two dogs for a few days up to a week. In the time he is at his house I still see him. I stop by to let him out to potty or sometimes I hang out at my friends house.
My friend and I got into a disagreement. During this argument I said just give me my dog and then you can block me or whatever.
That’s lead to him blocking me in all forms. Threatening to pay me for him so I can just get another. I paid the breeder for him at a huge discount but still costly, done all the vet visits, recently signed him up for school starting Monday. I have puppy insurance on him, the chip is in my name with my friend as backup.

But I spoke to a somebody tonight that blew me away and made me reevaluate everything that I thought I stood for and what I am looking for in a man.
We will remain strangers but this experience has been incredible and enlightening. 
I thought I had everything figured out and was a strong, independent woman..
Turns it that I still have a lot of growing up to do and a hell of a lot to learn.
I am nowhere near ready to date and I don’t think I actually want to now that I have had a long hard think about what I want out of my new life.I have worked very hard and will not let anybody ruin my progress so far.

I have realised that there is bigger and better out there than anything I could imagine and that some men are extremely Dangerous and powerful.
I have always been attracted to powerful men but have been taken to another level tonight.

All of this time I have been messing around with little boys that have tried to control me and keep me locked away to themselves, don’t want me but don’t want to share their toys.
Wimps.

Now I’m ready to have some real fun and find my true self and will never go back to what I thought I wanted, I don’t need any man to be happy.
My eyes have been opened wide and I don’t think think things will ever be the same. I’m ready for an adventure and new experiences and tonight I’m going to start a new piece to commemorate a crazy day.
I’m inspired and very excited and don’t think I will get much sleep, if any at all because my head is spinning.

I also have chronic pain but I'm used to it. Everything else I can do. However, I've had to be finding a job because of not being able to lift over 20 lb.

I have met some shit people and had terrible times, but am still looking to hopefully find that life partner.

The thing that I struggle with after having my now ex-wife cheat her way out of the marriage is trying to balance giving trust and being open without overlooking behaviors that could signal problems. This problem, I think, is compounded by the OLD environment, where at any given time when you meet a person they are probably at least talking to or likely involved with other people. My question is, and hope I can get some constructive feedback (from both male and female perspectives), how during the first month or so you are with a person, probably having sex and building a relationship are you able to cope with the fact that they might be doing the same with others. Obviously without trying to be possessive or clingy, but sometimes it just fries my circuits thinking about it and either waiting to be cut out or see an errant text or for everything to go fine and just move forward.
