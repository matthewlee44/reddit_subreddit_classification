10,mwjg5u,1619139306,Question for All you Wonderful adults about bedrooms.,"Okay so I was with my ex wife for over 22 years since I was 19 yo. We basically grew up together. And before her I was pretty much self raised and forced to be an adult at an early age. Anyways enough of a back story. So here is my issue. I am fully divorced, yay!!! And have been on my own with full custody of my daughter. Now I haven‚Äôt had my own room in two decades and before it was pretty much just been a basic plain room. 

So anyways, I got the room to myself when my ex-wife ran away. And I went kind of crazy. I decorated it the way I wanted to. With stuff I like. So My daughter who comes to my room to use my apple Tv to watch her K-dramas recently said that my room does not look like an adult room. And she added that if I ever get a girlfriend she will think I am immature. I laughed, because I am mature in the sense that I handle my bills, work full time and take care of my family without anyones help. But technically I am still just in my enjoying life stage, not trying to be serious about life. So in my room I have several framed movie posters, some of my Funko Pop collection, my katanas, My TV, A big shoe rack, my wine, my guitar and my Archery collection.

So I have two questions. One is do women care what a mans room looks like? If I have my own place, and it is clean, does it matter how it is decorated?  

And second how should a newly single person decorate their room? 

I don‚Äôt want to scare any potential girlfriends off but I want to be free to be me.

11,mwl41u,1619144675,Recent OLD Experiences,"Alright y‚Äôall (I‚Äôm from the south and really use that word), let‚Äôs just talk about some recent OLD experiences, shall we? I‚Äôm a 42 year old woman who‚Äôs been married once and has no children, if you need a frame of reference for this post.

I decided to go back on one lousy dating app after my last relationship ended at the end of last year. That relationship was a tough one to get over, but I won‚Äôt get into that here because that‚Äôs not the point of this post. I may still have some things to work through regarding that relationship, but I‚Äôm not looking to get married tomorrow, and I figured some taking-it-slow dating couldn‚Äôt be too terrible. Yikes, I might have been wrong about that. Allow me to share...

I‚Äôm just going to skip talking about the annoying ‚Äúhi‚Äù or ‚Äúgm‚Äù messages to which I don‚Äôt even usually respond. I figure if you can‚Äôt put more effort into a first message than an abbreviation for good morning, I‚Äôm not guessing you‚Äôre gonna bend over backwards getting me off if we ever even make it to sex, so I‚Äôm already out. And I‚Äôm not going to get into the open relationship people looking for a third or an extra girlfriend or whatever. If that works for y‚Äôall, mazel tov, but it‚Äôs not my thing. The younger men, sorry, I‚Äôm not here to be your Mrs. Robinson. The older guys, ehhh I‚Äôm not ready to be a grandma to your kids‚Äô kids yet, and the scammers pretending to be in the ‚ÄúUSA Army‚Äù, well I come from a military family, so you‚Äôve got the wrong one if you think I‚Äôm believing all that. So let‚Äôs get down to the actual conversations and/or dates, shall we?

1. The first guy I went out with was ok, but he was kind of gruff and not the most polite person, he definitely lied about his height because I think I was taller than him, and I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4, and when he mansplained me after the second date, I completely checked out. Thank God we only went out twice and got nowhere close to sex.

2. One guy I was having some decent conversations with, but it just fizzled out. I‚Äôm not sure why and figure he was talking to a few people and maybe started dating someone. Bummer, but I‚Äôll live.

3. One guy I had some alright conversation with, nothing to write home about, but he was like an old man, set in his ways and kind of negative about a lot of things. He sent a lot of wink face emojis or just ‚Äúlol‚Äù, it got kind of juvenile and annoying, and I was over it. He also was a bit of a drive away, and I can only get so enthusiastic about someone not in my area.

4. One guy who also wasn‚Äôt too close to my area seemed to get annoyed because I couldn‚Äôt meet up right away. Maybe I didn‚Äôt express myself well in this particular scenario, I‚Äôm not totally sure, so maybe it was my bad there. The point with this one is that unless we are just going for a quick meet-and-greet date, I‚Äôd kind of like to know a bit more about someone first. And even then, quite honestly, I can save myself the trouble of even the quick date if I chat enough with someone to know I‚Äôm not interested. Why do I need to put on a little makeup, straighten my hair, and drive 20 minutes to find out I‚Äôm not feeling it if I can find out with a bit more messaging?

5. One guy who wrote perfectly and was really nice to chat with, and then I found out that he had some kids he didn‚Äôt live near and wasn‚Äôt really helping raise. I can‚Äôt with that. On a superficial note, his idea of getting ready for church with his mother on Easter Sunday was wrinkled jeans that looked previously worn/dirty, and a jacket that was too big. I‚Äôm a Jewish girl from the Bible Belt who has been to church with friends plenty of times, and I know what a lot of y‚Äôall wear there, I believe in dressing appropriately for certain events, so geez Louise, no. The kid thing was the nail in the coffin though over and above anything else.

6. One guy who I cancelled on for a first meeting because well, he got on my nerves. Sue me. He knew nothing about me (again, more messaging might have been better for me personally), yet he told me that he was interested so many times that you know what happened? That‚Äôs right my friends, I was no longer interested! You know very little about me but are interested? Sounds like you ain‚Äôt picky and might just be looking for a warm body. How flattering.

7. One guy who seemed like an all around good catch, we met for a quick coffee, and sadly, he was quite feminine. I don‚Äôt care what people do, who they love, I support anything that makes people happy and doesn‚Äôt hurt anyone else, but I‚Äôm not personally physically attracted to men who have feminine qualities, not to mention he was pretty small (I‚Äôm slender), so he made me feel kind of like a whale next to him. He was definitely also fresh out of a divorce, and it was kind of cliche. He did not seem to relate well to anyone other than 9-5 types with kids, he had lived in bigger cities, I‚Äôm not a city girl, and he just didn‚Äôt get me I don‚Äôt think. Not a bad guy, just maybe not the guy for me. I could be friends with him, but nothing else.

8. And for the coup de gr√¢ce, we have the date I went on today. I can appreciate a southern gentleman who works hard if he‚Äôs well-rounded. This guy didn‚Äôt wear a mask, said he would never get a vaccine from the government (I‚Äôm waiting for my second dose), he thinks one of the vaccines makes people sterile (huh?), and he thinks he can‚Äôt get COVID because of his blood type. When the server asked if I wanted lemon for my iced tea, I said yes, but she forgot it. He told her I wanted it without me mentioning it (it wasn‚Äôt a big deal, and I would not have asked for it), he wasn‚Äôt that friendly to her, and I don‚Äôt think he tipped even 20%. As someone who tips well, that is a big no for me. Especially because I think she gave him his beer on the house since he didn‚Äôt like one part of his entree. I think I also caught him motion at her one time. Not like a come here motion, but a kind of hand wave of some sort. Oh and he was an interrupter. Rude, rude, rude. Ok, we are done here. 

Anyone know if you can donate your vagina like you can a kidney? Clearly I‚Äôm not using mine, and maybe it would help someone else? Let me know.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/mwl41u/recent_old_experiences/

13,mwpr1f,1619162260,Just broke up,"with a girl after 6 months of dating. It was a really odd relationship. One like I‚Äôve never had before. We also work together,  live about 45 min apart as well. I‚Äôm 42 and she is 29. So there‚Äôs a little background. Anyways... We started off normal for the first month or so. Sex a few times a week. Talking all the time etc etc. We work 2 days one week and 5 the next. Rotating every other week. 
     So I have been in many relationships. Was also married for 7 years. I know better than to fall hard and fast. Or at least know better than to show my hand so quickly if I do. But I could not help it with this girl. Won‚Äôt go on and on, but I‚Äôve never found as many qualities that attract me in one single woman as I have in her. We communicated about where we wanted to be. We both agreed that this was monogamous. And I agreed to take it slow. Which is what she asked for from me. But I didn‚Äôt. And I basically pushed her away. She started responding less and less to my texts. Wouldn‚Äôt look at me at work. Wouldn‚Äôt smile etc. And yes, this hurt. I knew what was wrong, but at this point I just couldn‚Äôt let go. And the less I tried to be around (because I knew she needed a break or some distance) the less time we spent and harder it got for me. But she would go hang with her friends all the time and when it came time for us to hang, we would just stay at her house once or twice a week at night. She didn‚Äôt really take the time to get to know me as a person either. I just got so many mixed emotions from her. We talked several times and agreed that we‚Äôd still hang and set aside at least one night a week to stay together. But we would slow down. Basically me slow down. Also, we both have kids. Me, full time. She splits time with her ex. There‚Äôs a ton more to this, but I‚Äôm not gonna bore ya‚Äôll. But we went from talking many times a day, and telling each other good night and good morning, to just small talk maybe 2-3 times a day. She stopped saying goodnight and it felt like I was the only one putting ANY effort into it. So it finally got to the point where I got really pissed at her for ignoring me and snapped and just unloaded all of my frustrations. The final straw was that she told me she was too tired to do our weekly night together. This is after she had been at the beach for 5 days with her friends. 
So after I snapped we had it out and both said we were done. I didn‚Äôt want it to end on an ugly note, so I went and talked to her about everything at her house. I told her that I really didn‚Äôt want things to be over, but I couldn‚Äôt do what we were doing anymore. I just needed more. Even a little. We agreed to try and be friends and not make things weird at work. Because it was really weird for a minute. So I got all my stuff and went home. But before leaving she said maybe if we got through this and things were ok, that we could possibly start hanging out again. But this time would have to take things slow from the start. 
I am really crushed Bc I knkw what I could have done in the beginning to prevent all this. Just laying back a little. I just screwed up. 
Bottom line.... any advice on how to go about handling this? I REALLY feel like if she knew me like she should then she would definitely fall for me. She says she just didn‚Äôt feel that spark, but that‚Äôs because we just never really got going. And little things like we kiss differently so it would be awkward while having sex. I should have fixed that by bringing it up and working on a way to make that work but I didn‚Äôt. I feel like kissing good is a very important factor in relationships. At least the sexual part. So what should I do to try and win her back? Please no negative shit. Ya‚Äôll all know you‚Äôve felt like this before. Obviously she doesn‚Äôt feel the same for me, but I KNOW if I had just a legit opportunity, I could win her over. If she went into it with totally open mind and just let go and let things happen without just looking at the negatives all the time.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/mwpr1f/just_broke_up/

Not that I ever felt less confident in myself in any situation, but I tend to get myself in odd situations, to say the least.  I think it's because of the challenge it presents, or it could be just a waste of time. I met this 45 YO woman online. She's Spanish like most of the women I meet...no problem there. We started chatting over the phone a bit and shared some past stories and getting to know each other. I'm an easy talker and I like to get a woman to open up to me. So she tells me she's Hundorien and she's here claiming asylum from her country. Ok... She came with her two children and she's explained about the ill-treatment she went through while she was in the holding facility. I felt bad about that. She also went on talking about she's still married to her husband in her country but she's going to divorce him. She also has another child, much younger that remains with her husband. If she wins the case and gets to stay here in America, she wants to have her child to come here. She's been dating older men, some of them even married. Some of the men are rich or have money, and they spoil her from time to time. She never hides the fact that she's ok with the arrangement's but she's picky of who she spends her time with. I get the feeling that she's very dominant in how she's talking and what she says. She's not really even my type as far as looks go, but she makes me feel like I should meet her of the sheer fact that I'm totally curious. She claims that she never gives a guy a second chance, and she likes to be in control. I kinda take her as a challenge, but on the other hand, I feel like it just a waste of time.

20,mx2nur,1619204875,Shoot my shot? - Courage needed to ask out a male friend.,"I have done lots of thinking around a person I've known since last September. Me - early 40's, him - the same. 

I am thinking of asking him: ""If the opportunity presented itself right now - if you met someone that was interesting to you - would you go out on a date with her?""

If he says yes, then, I would say - ""Would you like to go with me to X.""

I feel a 100% confident that if there's no interest on his end, things will not be weird, at least, not for long. We are on the same co-ed sports team, but have now known him long enough to feel that he would definitely handle the situation with discretion and class.

He broke up with his live-in girlfriend (of 7 years) since January. I understand that a 7 year-relationship, even if it was on-and-off (he implied as much) is still very significant. Who knows, maybe they'll even get back together. However, I am clear that I am interested in getting to know him beyond just friends and feel like I should act sooner rather than later. I want to be careful, but I also want to be brave. I'm ultimately interested in something long-term, but for right now, I'd just like to see if there's a there there.

He asked me once whether I was interested in anyone in our sports league. He has asked me to hang out after games and mentioned on several occasions that we should hang out, but has never asked me to hang out with him on any specific day or time, but often pays for my drinks. He has mentioned several times specifically to me that it's good to see me. However, at some point it seemed like he was trying to set me up with someone else on league, too. He could be hesitant since he is the captain of our team, but he might just be friendly. All of this is neither here nor there. He for sure likes me, but I'm just not sure if he does ""in that way.""

33,mxe2la,1619245053,Just a blip on the radar ?,"I met someone yesterday. I was fishing and in addition to the locals there was a young (late 20's ?) Woman there. I could tell she was new to fishing but I didn't want to invade her personal space so I didn't make any advances.Besides, when I see a woman the last thing I'm gonna think is 'she wants me to come talk to her'.

At some point she got a tangle and I helped her free her line up. A short while later she asked me how to set up a trolley rig. I walked her through it , showing and explaining all the steps to her. Then I helped her cast out her line .not trying to make her sound inept, she was far from it. But when your not used to casting out 10 oz weights it can take a little practice. While waiting for her bait to swim out we chatted. We ended up standing there talking for almost 3 hours.

My friends were pressuring me to ask for her phone number, but I'm a little older than them and don't assume that any woman that talks to me is 'interested'.

But then we got onto the topic of targeting snakeheads (a fish).This is a fish i have never targeted or cought.She seemed very excited to share her experience. I suggested that maybe at some point she could teach me. Then she said that was a good idea and offered her phone number.

About an hour later my friends and I were packing up and she too was getting ready to leave. I was hoping to walk with her to the parking lot. But she left before my friends got packed up.

As we were loading the truck she came running over to give me a couple lures that we had talked about earlier. We all said out goodbyes and she said she would be fishing tomorrow and would see us there. More like a casual 'see you if your there ' than a planned date.

 When I got home I texted her that it was nice to meet her and I look forward to hanging out with her again.

I had planned on going fishing today , primarily to see her again. But when I woke up this morning I was aching too bad. I did text her asking what time she was going fishing, but got no response. I called about the time people usually pack up. Intending to ask if she went fishing and how it went but got no response. 

So at this point I'm not sure what to think. I'm gonna wait a couple days and try again. The one thing I'm not going to do is to make any assumptions. She might be only interested in me as a fishing companion. But even that would still be nice.Time will tell",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/mxe2la/just_a_blip_on_the_radar/

The nutshell version is he is homeless and wanders from place to place. The last quote I got on a divorce was north of $5000 due to a child being involved, the need for out of state process servers/perhaps PIs, and legal notices if he can't be found by the process servers. I technically have it between my tax refund and the stimulus, but I will likely need a new car soon. A car gets me to work in an area where there is no public transport and a ride share from A to B back to A is cost prohibitive, never mind adding in C. A long overdue divorce will not pay my bills. So the car is winning right now.

I've dated‚Ä¶ok hooked up sporadically. I disclosed in those situations but the majority didn't care. I want to really date now. I'm tired of being alone. I'm want more than Mr. Right Now but I'm not gunning for Mr. Right. I have a (much shorter) script prepared to address the long separation issue:

""I need to tell you I am still legally married. My ex's decisions after the split made divorce financially untenable for me. He is completely out of the picture and the state. If you want to know more we can discuss that. I understand if this is a deal breaker for you and will respect your decision.""

What would you add/subtract/modify in there? I know there's no magic words to make someone say ok. I'm just curious how you would react to that script or a version of it

37,mxgzap,1619258686,Meeting my bf‚Äôs friends and family?,"I (43f) met my 48 yo boyfriend in July 2021 via Bumble. He introduced me to his 5 year old daughter a month later and we went on a 2-week cross country trip‚Äîin a moving truck in late August!

We said ‚ÄòI love yous‚Äô in November and deleted our dating apps together. We‚Äôve discussed kids and I‚Äôm off birth control; he has said he wants to have a future with me and raise he daughter with me too. He shared that his dad asked if he was happy with me and he said yes.

And we recently spent a week for spring break in NYC with his kid; met the ex briefly as we returned the 5 year old. 

So after all this, is it weird I haven‚Äôt met his parents (whom he lives with because he takes care of them)? Or his twin brother and closest friends who are all local?  

Yes, I know COVID has made meeting hard but I‚Äôm responsible and tested negative more than once. I just got vaccine #2 and his parents have also been vaccinated.

When his dad was very sick, I offered to drop by and help out, or even drop off food and he refused. He says his mom is embarrassed of dad‚Äôs condition and not being himself.

I‚Äôve introduced him to my best and closest friends (in my pod) and even spent my recent birthday with him plus my closest friends. I invited his twin and friends to the outing on a 630 acre winery but I don‚Äôt think he ever asked.

He said his BFF and college roommate invited him and his brother to visit this weekend (in my hometown, not too far from my parents) and said he wanted to see me on Sunday after he came back. 

Of course I want him to see his friends. They‚Äôre important but I‚Äôm also thoughtful to include and connect people who are important in my life.

I thought it was a guys only weekend but after I texted him to see how he was doing, he sends me a photo showing his twin‚Äôs and BFF‚Äôs wives there at the house ‚Äúparty.‚Äù

I feel left out. I get he hasn‚Äôt seen his friend for more than a year (they text every day) but is it weird that he didn‚Äôt invite me? He always says I‚Äôm too good for him, or that he‚Äôs not good enough for me; worried he‚Äôll embarrass me in front of my friends. Then why does it feel like he wants to keep me separate from them?

I asked him about it in February and he said I‚Äôm the best, most beautiful, kind and smart woman that he‚Äôs proud to be with and that I would meet them soon. Nothing yet.

Note: one thing that happened was on my birthday last weekend, he Facetimed his daughter so she could sing me happy birthday. As she did, a message from ‚ÄúSo and so HINGE‚Äù flashed on his phone. I didn‚Äôt say anything immediately but I was uncomfortable since my friends were just rolling up for our wine tasting. He noticed and I said just wonder who that was. On our way home, he said it was a woman he had talked to but never got anywhere with. It turns out his new hire‚Äôs girlfriend is best friends with that girl, and that she was messaging him because she and the gf wanted to surprise the employee at work this past Wednesday. They needed my bf to get them access to the building. I decided to give him the benefit of the doubt. I asked how the surprise went on Wed and he said it didn‚Äôt happen because the guy was called to duty for national guard related to the Chauvin verdict....he later wished me good night and ‚ÄúLove ya.‚Äù Maybe I‚Äôm reading too much into things....",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/mxgzap/meeting_my_bfs_friends_and_family/

My urge it to move out, setup a new place and, eventually, find someone new. The thing that I don't want to leave is my kids. So, my question for single women, if I met you and told you my story - would it put you off?

53,mxv88f,1619305265,59F considering dataing apps..what do you think?,"Hi everyone, I (59F) spent the last 35 years of my life being the primary breadwinner in our marriage,   
 building a career and raising 3 kids.  My husband was basically a second caretaker for the kids and nothing more to me.  I think we were incompatible from the start, and if I'm being honest, I think saw a great dad and childcare provider in him, someone who would allow me to continue in my career while deferring a lot of the childcare to him.  

About 10 years ago I saw how empty my life was and started to search for my happiness.  It's been a long, slow road, but i have finally separated from my husband and am starting a life on my own.  I own a duplex with my husband, and as a first step we have each taken a flat to live on our own.  It isn't much but it's a start.

I have literally one (1) friend who I can count on to tell me the truth.  Other than that, I spend my time working in my high pressure job or doing chores in the house.  Long story short, I am desperate for some companionship of the opposite sex, but I am terrified of the dating apps.

I don't want to rate myself, but I would call myself fit and cute for 59.  People say I've taken good care of myself relative to my late 50s peers. 

I would like to work in my job for a few more years and then retire somewhere warm, hopefully with someone nice to share it with.  Thankfully I have the means to do what I want in  retirement.

I feel like my life is at a crossroads.  Either accept eternal singlehood and get on my with my life, meager as it is, and learn to live in solitude.

OR

Build my confidence/thick skin/etc. and get on the dating apps to see what I can find.   

I am one of those quiet intellectual types who loves a witty conversation covering wide ranging topics, and I am pretty unsure I'll find what I am looking for on the dating apps.

I'm planning on moving forward in late spring and am considering hiring someone to help me put together my profile, take photos, etc.  Is this just a colossal waste of time that will only result in unhappiness?  If i base it on what I read on reddit, dating late in life is tough.  Would love your input.

54,mxv8w0,1619305322,Dating a player,"I am going to skip through some details and get straight to the point. Last year I was in a really bad place when I met this guy who was devastatingly handsome. I knew he was a player and he also lets on a lot of details about his dating life which normally is a major red flag for me (including sleeping with other girls while having a girlfriend) At the time I wasn‚Äôt really looking for a relationship at the time and saw him merely as a hook up / casual relationship person so the red flags didn‚Äôt bother me. Within 3 months the whirl wind of lust / sex ended for me. I decided I needed to stop seeing him before I got too involved. I started distancing myself and went no contact for a while. No matter how long I stopped texting him, he would somehow get back in touch with me via text. Initially I told myself that there was no reason to be rude and we could be friends. I would meet him for dinner etc but made it clear it wasn‚Äôt going to end up with us having sex ever again. He seemed happy to stay in touch even without sex. When I asked him explicitly why. He told me ‚Äúsex is easy to get, but not everyone is worth keeping in touch with‚Äù ( English is not his first language, I got the gist of it as being I was worth keeping as a friend). After that I thought it would be easy just to stay friends but the regular texting and the meeting up regularly started getting to me. Although he has a ton of red flags , I find myself thinking about him romantically, I tried dating other guys but still inadvertently started comparing others to him. 
He tells me he has a rotation of 5 girls he sees regularly. I don‚Äôt see him giving that up for me so I don‚Äôt see a point talking to him about my feelings since I doubt he will say what I want to hear and the likelihood of being hurt inadvertently is very high. To date, we have known each other for close to a year, we even go to the same gym (I got the contact from him) . It feels much harder to go no contact suddenly without feeling more of a sense of loss. Should I take a chance and tell him how I feel?

55,mxxn3g,1619313491,Staying friends with your ex,"My ex and I are good friends who never should have married, but we did, and it took a long time to figure out we shouldn't be. We separated 2 years ago, and not long after I met my BF and we really hit it off. He was aware of my relationship with my ex and my feelings for him being platonic. We moved in together 1 year ago. I had two cats with my ex, both who I love dearly, but one clearly liked him better, so I took one and left the other. I still miss her greatly, and being great friends I would go over on weekends to visit, occasionally bringing my other cat, and boyfriend when he was up for it (we're both chronically ill). Last summer we had an issue where he felt I was going over too often and expecting him to go over too often. I didn't understand because I thought they liked each other and he knew I had totally platonic feelings for my ex. Over the winter the visits were less frequent, but since spring is coming I've wanted to go hang with my cat in the backyard and visit more. I hadn't been for over a month and then went over a few weekends in a row, and I guess this is an issue.

Full disclosure: I have difficulties with social cues and norms and have from a young age, relating a lot to autistic posts on the matter, and sometimes I don't see things clearly as others do, which is why I'm asking here if this is not okay.

Talking to my BF about it last night, I somewhat understand how it would upset him. I run errands on weekends when I'm not working after appointments and spend a few hours there with my cat on one day. My BF is more of a homebody though and doesn't always want to come, and I get lost shopping with a few hours passing by in the blink of an eye, so I'm not spending my full weekend with him, and as I miss him, I know he misses me too.

So I need to know, in your opinions, what is a reasonable frequency to visit my cat? I know she's not a human, but I feel a great deal for her. I've had her 8 years. I can go when my ex isn't there, but I appreciate being able to see him occasionally. So, what is appropriate? My BF doesn't like how intertwined our lives are still (we still are both on the mortgage), but honestly he feels like just a good friend. I've never looked at him like a lover, and that's why we shouldn't have been married. At the same time, I was with him almost 20 years, and I'm still trying to learn how to live a different life. How long does it take to make this change?

56,mxxrpe,1619313932,Situation with my work crush making me sad and uncomfortable after we hooked up a few times. Would love any insight/advice,"As the title states, he's my coworker. I'm 40 he's in his mid 30's. We're both single. I've been single two years, he got out of a serious LTR about a year and a half ago... I suspect he's still a little hung up on her. We've worked at the same place, but different departments, for the better half of a decade. I've always had a low key crush on him. He's flirted with me quite a bit in the last year or so.

We hooked up once about a month and a half before the new year, then he ghosted me (didn't respond to a text I sent a week after the hookup. Honestly, was just trying to start up a conversation, though we never texted before the hookup.) So... I avoided him for a couple weeks, and then he started blowing hot again. I had been casually seeing someone in the interim between the first hookup so I blew him off a little, until a couple months ago when that fizzled out, then I reciprocated. We hooked up a few more times over the course of 3 weeks, and then one night I was quite inebriated and asked some prodding questions.

He made it clear he's not looking for anything serious, but that he liked me more than a friend and felt close to me.

The sex was some of the best I've ever had, the cuddling intense and wonderful, I was high as a kite for a full day after seeing him.

Then the reality of the fact that his actions say he's not as into me as I would like would crash down on me, and my anxiety went through the roof.

The last time I stayed with him, I said to him I was thinking of ending things because I was not feeling as if I was being pursued in the way I like... and he implied that *he* felt like *I* was the one pursuing *him*, which made me leap out of bed (for whatever reason, I felt insulted), begin to get dressed, and mutter that he wouldn't have to worry about me ""pursuing"" him again. He got up and apologized and said that the way it sounded wasn't what he meant, that he had been pursuing me too, and he looked pained. We quickly switched topics and discussed lighter things before I left (it was morning) and he seemed to be trying to get me to stay longer. I felt uncomfortable but I think I hid it well.

Since then I've done nothing to try and seem interested in chatting more at work than is polite and professional. He seemed to try and strike up conversation for a few weeks, but now he mostly ignores me, two months later.

I hate this. I like this guy. I want to be with him. I don't know how to change this. I know he's terrible for me... the way I feel so infatuated with him sets off sirens in my gut. I long for him, yet I try to avoid him and not even look in his direction at work.

Seems genuinely sweet, funny, smart... but he seems really disinterested in learning anything about me, even when I make it super simple, like sending him a link to my web site.  He also doesnt share too much about himself.  But I think he likes me... and then at some point we finally kissed, and then he came over my place for the first time last night.  Around 6 and the plan was to get pizza and watch a movie... I figured we would probably fool around and maybe more, but didn‚Äôt have a particular expectation.  I‚Äôm 43F by the way and he‚Äôs about the same age.  So... he said he wasn‚Äôt hungry and we never ate, and therefore also didn‚Äôt speak much.

62,myad1q,1619363917,Are You Really The Prize?," I'm more of a speaker so check out this link: [https://youtu.be/8qilvhwsQ0U](https://youtu.be/8qilvhwsQ0U)

if you prefer to listen. Let me know what you think about the message down here or preferably in the youtube comments.

**Introduction**

In the manosphere, the concept of ""You are the prize"" is often advocated for men who want to find success in many aspects of life, whether that is in dating, in social relationship or in a career. It is usually prescribed to men who are victims of a conditioning mindset, always prioritizing others needs and feelings before his own, which is often the cause of men perpetual exhibition of undesirable behaviours such as chasing and pedestalizing women that we see in the modern world today. In many sense, the prize mentality sets the foundation for an alternative and arguably, a better way of thinking for men about his roles within the external world, to get what he wants, and to achieve what he desires

**The Prize Mentality**

""Being the prize"", the modern man can think differently and have higher regards for himself, and by doing so, in theory, he is expected to translate those thoughts and beliefs into the manifestation of characteristics and actions that are psychologically perceived as more superior and of higher quality. This display of great self-esteem becomes his way of communicating to others, both on a conscious and subconscious level, giving a great impression of who he may be and what he might capable of. That is a powerful way of influencing how people view and treat you, as a prize that glows with greatness and potential. as a prize that demands respect and admiration. That is a prize to be competed for and chased after by others.

**Limitation of The Prize Mentality**

This is in accordance with law 34 in the 48th law of power: Be Royal in Your Own Fashion: Act Like a King to Be Treated Like One. ""You are the prize/I am the prize"" is a powerful mindset, and its effect is as real and undeniable by most. However, like many other guidances within the manosphere, the prize mentality is only advised as a tool, and it being a tool will require you to understand and more importantly, be skilful with it, that is to know its potential and its limitations. Knowing how to use a hammer does not make you a great builder, and likewise, having ""the prize"" mentality does not actually make you the prize, and with it failing to critically and objectively address if you are actually the prize or not is one of the biggest limitations that the advocate of the prize mentality experiences among men.

**Are You Really The Prize?**

Ask yourself the question: Are you really the prize? Perhaps in the short term, it does not matter, but for most men out there, the ability to give a definite answer will likely determine if they can truly internalize such a powerful mindset. Acting like the prize while not actually being the prize is no different than living in delusion, and while that does not defy its utility, the internalization process becomes a life long struggle when your set of beliefs and behaviours are backed up by nothing that reflects your true reality. Thinking ""You are the prize"" when you truly and deeply believe that you are not will either send you a ticket straight back to your miserable self or keep you in a state of delusional, never getting anywhere far or achieving anything meaningful.

**The Truth About The Prize Mentality**

No amount of repetition of ""You are the prize"" will make you the prize. No amount of encouragement of ""You are the prize"" from others will make you the prize. No amount of ""fake it til you make it"" will actually make you the prize. As a man living in a modern and feminized world, adopting something that is at the core of the way women think and believes is a disaster to a man's life and his success. Yes, unfairly, it works for women for many reasons, but not without consequences of course, yet this difference between how a man and a woman get to becomes the prize is the true harsh reality that most men can not comprehend nor accept coming into the space of the manosphere.

As a man, you can not just be the prize. You have to become the prize. To have the prize mentality embedded within you, to act like a prize, to think like a prize, to behave like a prize, consistently, continuously across all situations and over a period of a lifetime, you have to actually build yourself to a point where you are reinforced with progress and success to confidently believe that you are, always have been or can potentially become the prize. Just like how respect is earned and not given. The prize is never given to you. You have to go and chase it. You have to earn it. You have to become it. There is no shortcut for men to achieve what he wants, what he puts in life is what he gets.

**Conclusion**

If you don't want to put in the work, settle for mediocrity. If you don't want to be exceptional, settle for conformity. If you don't want to become great, settle for the lesser prize. You don't just wake up one day and think you are the prize. You wake up every day to become the prize yourself, and not just any prize, but the prize you want to be. What you have achieved, how far you have gone and who you have become will be the living proofs for the internalization process of the prize mentality within yourself. The point is to never in doubt of yourself ever, but in doing so you need to show that you are truly worth it, not just to other people, but to yourself, because you are your mental point of origin.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/myad1q/are_you_really_the_prize/

My apprehension is that FF/WV fans tend to be young. Like my daughters (20s) age range. But the music is upbeat, fun and doesn't come off as the same old as Danny Tenaglia and other older DJs seem repetitive or old in their sound (IMHO). And I'm hooked.

67,myiub1,1619388329,Anyone else vary rarely interested in a second date?,"I‚Äôm 40F and have been dating post-divorce for the past several years. I‚Äôve had a handful of short-term relationships and one longer, more serious one that broke my heart pretty badly when it ended. Over the years, I‚Äôve gone on quite a few first dates and I‚Äôve found - especially since my big heartbreak - that I very rarely develop enough interest in someone to go on a second date. 

My dates aren‚Äôt bad. In fact, most of them are fun and I enjoy the company and conversation, but I walk away without any strong desire to see the person again, even though we had a good time for the 2-3 hours that we spent together (dinner/drinks). If I feel chemistry on the first date, I will go on a second, but at that point I‚Äôm still largely in the ‚Äúfeeling it out‚Äù stage to determine if I‚Äôm truly interested in someone romantically and I feel like the guy almost always interprets a second date as a sign that there is romantic interest and tries to progress things with a kiss, which totally kills the vibe for me because I like some desire to build before kissing. 

I‚Äôm guessing I‚Äôm in the minority here and I don‚Äôt know if this demisexuality or asexuality or just a personal preference, but it‚Äôs really making it hard for me to pursue a relationship. Pre-heartbreak, I developed romantic interest for people much more easily, so maybe I just have major walls up, but it‚Äôs been 3 years since that breakup and I‚Äôm definitely over the guy, so it‚Äôs frustrating to think that it might still be affecting me and impacting my ability to connect with someone new.

The next day he asked me for a dinner.  He treated me and we had a little walk by the pier. I really enjoyed the dinner and the walk. First friday since we met, he asked me for a lunch. We both work from home and live close by so we met for a quick grab. And he said his son is coming over the weekend so his availability will be limited. Ok I totally understand that.  Since then,  we met almost everyday on weekdays after work for a walk dinner and/or dessert. I really liked how the date progressed.. Casual coffee meet to nice evening stroll after work. Things seemed to be clicking fast and we got intimate pretty quick. We met almost everyday after work on weekdays and had sex everytime we met. But when I try to plan something on weekend, he's busy. He has different things that he needs to do every weekend that is very important to him. Like.. his child.. parents.. friends.. Now I'm thinking maybe he has another love life on weekend?

74,myll39,1619397149,Here is what I decided and why,"I had written a post a few days ago detailing how I met a woman who disclosed to me on the second date that she had herpes. Thank you to everyone who contributed, I think that was a very honest and compassionate discussion. I did a bunch more independent research and talked to a doctor as well. I was asked for an update so here it is. 

I am going to pursue a relationship with her. Here‚Äôs why.

First, she was honest. She was terrified, but told me on the second date. She had been married for over 20 years, and then slept with one man.  She felt devastated and worthless. She had also grown up in a conservative religious tradition and that compounded everything for her, but she had the courage and integrity to look me in the eye and tell me. That kind of makes her a badass and a catch. My ex cheated, so honesty is important. Also, since so many asked, I have had a full test  after finding out about the affair, and included herpes. I do not have it. 

Second, from what I‚Äôve read the risks are not much greater if you are with a diagnosed person who is on medication and is sensitive to their body and understands outbreaks than if you are with a random undiagnosed person who might have it and not know. Doctor confirmed this.  I am not a guy who sleeps with someone early into a relationship. Months, not days or weeks. So I broke a potential future out into three segments. Bear with me, I‚Äôm a bit of an analytical geek. First, a couple of months of not having sex. Ok, no problem! Second, having sex in a committed LTR. There is like a 1% chance *per year* of me getting it if we are safe. So then say it would be at least 2 years before committing to a marriage with someone. So there is a 2% chance of me catching a not that bad thing, all while in a long term committed relationship. Third, marriage. If marriage came, I would still take precautions, but because the disease isn‚Äôt that bad and it‚Äôs really about the stigma and possible impact on other potential relationships, I really wouldn‚Äôt care as much at that point. If having 1% chance per year of contracting something that gives me a small chance (most don't have symptoms) of occasionally having a minor rash is the only cost of finding the right person, I‚Äôm in. 

Third, It really does seem like the disease isn‚Äôt that bad. I had the ‚Äòscare you into abstinence‚Äô sex ed as a kid, and then was married 17 years so never thought about it. As I said, I‚Äôm not one to jump into sex early, so I really didn‚Äôt need to reassess my thinking about STDs until she told me about this. Most people are asymptomatic, and even the symptoms are controllable and not that bad. For most with symptoms it‚Äôs a rash and uncomfortable for a few days. Big deal. It sounds like it was made into a big deal by a media scare in the 70‚Äôs and 80‚Äôs. I can‚Äôt help but think there were people who were gleeful about scaring people (and shaming women in particular) into not having sex who were pushing this. This woman was raised in a conservative culture where women‚Äôs sexuality was repressed at best, viewed as whorish at worst. That shit is *so* damaging to women. Be pretty and feminine! But don‚Äôt be a whore! Never think sex thoughts! Make sure you please your husband! Pass.  

Anyways, even after saying all of that I am still actually a little nervous. It is hard to change something that you‚Äôve been afraid of your whole life. But, aren‚Äôt there things in any relationship to be nervous about? Gotta just push through it and do what I think is right.

83,myqkxf,1619415502,Just venting and thinking 'out loud' - will I really get what I want in a relationship? Doubts creep in...,"Been thinking a lot about what I want, I mean *really* want in a relationship.   Since I was 25, I've been with 2 men- one was my husband (together 15 years), one was my boyfriend (together 3 years).

These men were different in many ways, but I feel that in the end, it was like I was with the same guy.  I rarely received compliments, I did not feel beautiful to either of them, and felt almost like they were jealous of me instead of appreciating that I was fit and healthy (they both gained weight and had some physical injuries but I still found each of them beautiful).  The intimacy diminshed over time with no effort nor interest on their parts to do anything. I carry a lot of shame for wanting to be physically and emotionally expressive with my partner as a result.  


Husband- He was affectionate and loving but rarely wanted sex, it was always very distant, he got so defensive when I asked if we could explore anything whatsoever other than 'status quo'. Never wanted to be intimate in the light.  He would look at me as  thought I repulsed him frequently, it was awful- but we never spoke about it b/c I didn't know how to process this, other than asking him if he was still attracted to me, and he would say yes (but no action).

Boyfriend- the sex was great, and at first it was more intimate: kissing, looking in the eyes, etc. He was like a dream come true for about a year. But as we got closer and more familiar in real life, the sex became less intimate. He could not do emotional intimacy very well, got defensive at any intimate talk, deflected it, almost like an awkward teenager who didn't know what to do.  


I realize that a top need I from partnership is exceptional physical and emotional intimacy. By exceptional I mean, that I want someone who can look me in the eyes and smile, who will kiss my forehead, who will hold me for no reason at all, who will at time wrap his arms around me from behind and kiss my necks/shoulder, etc. Someone who feels free to express his love to me.  


I want someone who has a sex drive that matches (or close) to mine, and who can be playful and actually LOOK AT ME when we have sex and not make me feel like I'm a stranger when I even try to confront that issue.

I want someone who lights up when they see me, at least some of the time. I get that this won't happen every day or in the midst of stress, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Where I'm at now is that I have serious doubts I'll ever get this. I feel like both men showed me one side at the beginning that ended up not being the case as time went on. How can I trust myself when I feel like things are going to be good when I'm 2 for 2? I was friends with both of them first (I move slow).  We had explicit talks about intimacy multiple times, and I was told  things that made me feel we were in alignment.  When my boyfriend starting seeming less loving to me after being more loving than I'd felt from any man before, it felt like sand slipping through my finders. How could all that have been an act. He used to look at me with this amazing, piercing gaze, hold my head in his hands and kiss me passionately. He was the first to bring up the ""L"" word, only to tell me later in in the relationship that he never said it to anyone  at this phase of his life unless he was going to get married (not true, I'd heard stories from him when we were friends about how he's pour his loving soul out to his ex).

I have a limiting belief that even if it looks like something amazing, it's just going to get taken from me, and/or that what I want is just not out there.

&amp;#x200B;

Am I being unrealistic and romanticizing middle-aged love? I know that not everybody needs or wants expressions of intimacy like this, but I guess I do, and I want to feel safe and supported in having my needs honored (and I want someone whose needs are congruent with mine).",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/myqkxf/just_venting_and_thinking_out_loud_will_i_really/

But now I keep seeing him on dating apps, and one of his pictures is honestly pretty terrible. Would it be rude if I commented on it or sent him a text letting him know that it's not a flattering picture?

My thought is that if I did send it, maybe it'd open up communication with him again, as friends (which I'd like). Or, at the very least maybe he swapped out that picture he'd start dating someone and make it easier for me to move on, and I'd stop seeing it every time I open the apps üòÖ",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/myunhu/would_this_be_rude/

My question to the group is this: is it a reasonable expectation for a man to expect a woman  he has just started talking and whose name he doesn‚Äôt even know - to ‚Äúwait‚Äù or remain single or be celibate until he can meet her in two months? 

I know if I was working out of two for two months, and was chatting with someone sporadically whose name I didn‚Äôt know and whom I hadn‚Äôt met in person, I wouldn‚Äôt expect him to be single when I finally got home.

2. You won‚Äôt find someone if you‚Äôre addicted to the attention you get from dating apps

3. Time swiping &gt; Time on dates? = FOREVER ALONE

10. Treat yourself like crap? You‚Äôll attract those who like to treat people like crap.

11. Dating is a learning experience. Rejection and failure are all in your head. Get over yourself! It‚Äôs not a rejection; it‚Äôs redirection!

13. If you don‚Äôt remember what they said on the date, you won‚Äôt know if they‚Äôre right for you. Pay attention and listen.

19. Don‚Äôt look like crap on the first date. First impressions count. Take a damn shower and trim those nose hairs.

22. Are you finger happy when it comes to swiping on dating apps? Enjoy the single life with your fingers.

23. Are you extra picky and judgemental? Go look in the mirror. You aren‚Äôt who you deserve.

24. Stop dating people you know aren‚Äôt right for you because you think you can change them. People aren‚Äôt your pet projects.

25. Think you can convince [them to like you](https://sumonsleeve.com/2019/03/how-to-think-straight-when-youre-dating-and-you-feel-like-youre-going-crazy.html)? You can‚Äôt. They don‚Äôt like you.

She's been dating someone wonderful she met on POF. Says they're giving it a full year (his suggestion), to see how well they mesh. She described the best night of her life in a mostly empty restaurant (bc covid), with a beautiful view and a live band, seemingly playing just for them. They danced together but alone in the restaurant, watching the sunset. 

Recently she invited him to meet her and her son at a crowded patio bar. He arrived and ran into the son first, but they ""recognized"" one another instinctively, immediately started talking, and discovered some commonalities.

Sounds preposterous/too good to be true, I know. She wasn't some hifalutin/cougary GILF type, either. (TBH, I might've guessed she was older than 57.) I asked her if she was *as* attracted to this particular man, as compared to the horrible dates? (or at least their pictures) She said she was.

Is it ever a good idea?

We dated and really clicked but ultimately things did not work out for us at the time. There were major factors in our lives causing us to be incompatible, but now those factors have changed.

I recently reached out and he has been enthusiastically there for me and encourages me to continue to reach out to him. It seems he is really trying to let me set the pace of communication, though. While we ultimately agreed to end things, he was more so the one who did not want things between us to end. 

I‚Äôm realizing my feelings are still there for him and now that those factors have changed, I‚Äôd like to explore a potential relationship with him again, but I am unsure how to bring up the idea. At this point, we have only had text conversations since getting back in contact.
