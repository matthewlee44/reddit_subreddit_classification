My friend is getting sick of me being upset that I can't get a girlfriend but I don't blame him in that regard. Everytime we talk about it his solution is always either go to a bar or go on tinder. I always have viewed dating at the bar and on tinder as a sort of meet market and the few times I have done that I really didn't find any girl that I felt I would have any sort of connection with. I try to explain that I'm not the type of person that can just casually date around and talk to woman just because I might find them attractive. I explain that the type of girl I like would be more of a nerdier girl that I can do stuff with like play video games and watch Sci-fi and those sort of things. I don't want someone who is just sitting down with me to be with me, I want somebody that will actually participate in the things I enjoy and she enjoys. I just don't know where to go and what settings to put myself in to increase the amount of females I find myself compatible with. Does anyone have any advice on how to do that?

I told him i’d love and accept him even if he was bi, but he denied it. He has a very close relationship with his best friend, and is constantly complimenting his appearance even though he never compliments mine.

11,p69dgn,1629225006,Need help with conversion openers.,"So my biggest problem when it comes to talking to people is finding a conversation opener. I'm a pretty quiet guy and generally keep to myself, but there are times when I'd like to strike up a conversation with someone. Thing is is that I would prefer to start on a topic that this person might be receptive too. Usually an article of clothing with a pop culture reference is an easy starter, but beyond that I have no idea of what to say. 

Discussing stuff like the weather doesn't really have a follow up, recent news articles can be hit or miss and are potentially inflammatory. Complementing about a person's hair, eyes or other features will make me feel like I'm being a creep, as does eavesdropping on conversations they are having with someone else, (and I hate butting in on someone else's conversations).

16,p69xsk,1629226673,Help me in my Strategy for online dating please ? I don't know how to find someone who accepts me inspite of my career situation.,"Hi, i'm a guy in mid twenties. I'm stuck in life. I want a relationship first. I believe it will give me strength and motivation to work on my career. 

Idk what's good about me or how I will attract a woman.

I don't have too high requirements , i'm ready to compromise. 

I have this urgency to find relationship because i'm nearing late twenties. After 30, my hair will start balding, i'll lose libido. Also,  it's very lonely and sexually frustrating without a partner. I don't want to go to a prostitute because of lot of reasons but primarily becoz I don't think my future partner would like such a history of mine. And I wouldn't be able to lie to someone about my past if I really love her.

Also, my career path and family situation is highly confusing. I need a wife's guidance in that.  Because I am not sure what's the right way for me to earn money.  If I know my partner's desires, lifestyle, financial situation,  etc, I can tailor my path accordingly for her. 

Because I have no personal desire for money,  except to provide for the girl I love. Nothing materialistic excites me. Cars, foreign vacations, jewellery etc don't excite me. I don't care where I live, what I wear,  what my status/respect in society is. 

And if i'm unable to earn money in future and my savings finish, i might not have strength to continue anymore. I'll of course try my best to find a career,  but sometimes,  even high efforts don't yield results. So, i'll just ask her to find another partner for herself,  leave her some money as a compensation for the inconvenience I caused to her and exit from her life.  I'll of course tell her all this in initial stage only,  well before she gets too emotionally invested. I don't want to break anyone's heart.

I believe in doing things for my loved one. I want to maintain my fitness and put in effort to please her sexually.  I want to make her feel loved emotionally and logically try to understand her life issues and empathize with how she feels.

I'm a college dropout.  I won't get a job easily,  most require a graduation degree.

And i'm not motivated to,  until I find a relationship. It's like I need support of a partner to give me the drive and reason.

Can't poor people marry? And i'm not hard fixed on marriage/kids. Even medium term relationships would do.

Right now, since past 6 months,  my whole day goes into messaging people on reddit.


I am alright looking.  (6/10 ) in looks.
I'm tall, fit.

should I attract someone on basis of my looks or words?  Should I show my pic right in beginning or after talking for a while? 

I really want to be loved and I have a lot of love to give. I have zero relationship experience. 

I have almost 99k $ savings (inherited )

And I'll receive a lot more hopefully someday... around 500k - 1 million $.

I don't have a job or degree

How should I present my profile? 

**Notes :**

Offline dating wouldn't work for me. I don't get matches on dating apps. So only platform for me is reddit.

17,p6a3o7,1629227121,Is there something happening between them?,"I know my gf has a bunch of coworkers and they mostly have women there and a handful of guys. I never really payed attention to anything or had insecurities until a certain moment that happened. I was driving her to work and she received a text message but quickly flipped over her phone and didnt respond to it. While we were getting gas I looked at her lock screen and text was from her dude coworker asking her to bring him coffee. Idk why she would hide that??? I met this guy once.

Ever since then I was a little suspicious and have been getting interesting info from her other coworker. Apparently this dude and my GF flirt a lot throughout the day. They hang around eachother a lot and even do some of the tasks together. She seems very happy around him and she is happy around her and shes always giggling alone with him in a room. So they had a bunch of physical interaction. In the break room he was holding her hand and playing the ""palm reading"" game. Another time they were holding hands at the table while playing some other game. In hallway they playfully hit or push eachother and do other things. Another time he tied her hands with a piece of yarn.

it makes things worse is that she called another girl names for standing and chatting/flirting with him while she was there and that ""he can do better"" so i am assuming she is jealous or something.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p6a3o7/is_there_something_happening_between_them/

I want to be clear.  I’m not getting any sex anyways, so even if they’re waiting till marriage I’m okay with that.

I’m okay with them praying.  I’d be down to go to church with them if I’m bored.

But I’m not really much of a believer.  I have no clue if there’s a God or what happens to me after I die.

23,p6al5g,1629228546,I realized this at the age of 30,"1:Except for your own pain or the pain of losing a family member or friend, which is real, all other pain is brought to you by your own values.

2：The inability to read quietly and the impatience are caused by the gradual growth of age and too much utilitarianism.

3：Those who really stick to the end rely not on passion, but just the right amount of like and commitment.

4：It is much more important for a person to know what he or she can do than what he or she wants to do. The former requires setting a realistic boundary for oneself, a dutiful diligence, while the latter is a passion spawned by caprice, often from ignorance and conceit about the world.

A person, who must know himself clearly.

5：Do not take the marathon of life as a 100-meter sprint, too hard love not only makes you tired, but also makes the people around you tired, and ultimately difficult to complete.

6：Blame and complaining in marriage is not because ""I love you"" but because ""I am not good at managing my emotions"" Blame is not love, it is a marriage killer.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p6al5g/i_realized_this_at_the_age_of_30/

32,p6bg32,1629231110,Does she(15f) like me(16m)?,"Yeeeeeep its another one of these posts. Sorry to bore you but I'm new to experiences like this (homeschool gang!) and would really love some personalized advice for my situation.

So I'm a Junior at a completely new school within a completely new city. Not really ideal for social situations but, fuck it, right? So school started last week on Wednesday and pretty quickly I hit it off with this one girl. She's also new to the school so I guess we have some things in common which makes bonding easier. Anyways, I just made small talk with her one day in 7th period when we had a fire drill, and I noticed she was walking right next to me to the football field so we just started chatting. It was honestly shocking to me how well we got along together so quickly, we both seem to be at the same wavelength, y'know? So anyways for the rest of the period we were just blabbering to each other. About our favorite shows, things we hate, what our old schools were like, etc. And we kept talking after the bell rang when we were walking to our cars. She offered to give me her socials so we could keep in touch, which felt awesome.

During the weekend we talked a lot, mainly about a show I told her to watch. But something really interesting also happened. Okay, so the class we share, our 7th period, is an AP elective. Its pretty study intensive and not at all a requirement for graduation. She mentioned that she had already planned to switch classes because she didn't want to study that much. Now obviously I was pretty bummed that the only friend I had made wasn't going to be in one of my classes anymore, but even more obviously, I didn't want to let her know that, so I just messaged her back something to the effect of, ""Well that's a bummer, you're pretty crazy, it'll be scary not being able to keep an eye on you."" She stopped reply to my messages for about 10 minutes and messaged me back, ""Actually I'm gonna keep the class, me and my mom are going to buy supplies."" Just want it to be known that at that moment I felt like the coolest fucking dude on planet Earth.

So, fast forward to yesterday and today, we both sit together alone on the top floor of one of the most secluded building in our school, I've given her like 4 show recommendations, all of which she's written down in her phone so she knows to watch them when she's done with the one I currently told her to watch, when someone took her seat next to me (no seating charts yet) she got a chair from somewhere else and sat next to me anyways, she offered to show me around the city whenever I'm free. And above all that I've just noticed she seems to go out of her way to run into me.

Don't get me wrong, I understand completely that I'm not only overreacting, but overanalyzing everything to fit a narrative I really, really want to be true. I get that most likely she's just lonely, like me, and is really thrilled to have found a friend. But despite all that, I'd still love some outside opinions on this. Personally I'd be fine with just being friends, but its always good to know what your options are.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p6bg32/does_she15f_like_me16m/
33,p6bq6n,1629231945,Why do I feel grossed out by intimacy?,"hi, i (18,F) had this question in the back of my mind for a little while now.

i've experienced crushes and felt shy around attractive people like regular teenagers do, so i never felt like there was anything wrong. it was only up until recently i had realized that there was an issue with how i reacted to when the tables turned and people began making advances with me/having crushes on me/etc.

this happened with both audiences: people i've had crushes on and people i don't have crushes on. though, usually, i would just play the flirting off as a joke with the people who i don't feel anything towards romantically

i can totally imagine myself in a relationship with specific people and i initially WANT to make advances with them, but these feelings halt immediately the moment they show signs of genuine interest.

the feeling is hard to describe; there's like a pit in my stomach, and a feeling of ""oh wow if i date them this'll be my life now, everything's gonna change"" and a little bit of ""wow, thats stupid of them to say that"". the thought about people flirting with me- and even looking back at what people have said to me- doesn't provoke any strong feelings like that at all, it really only effects me when i'm currently in the moment. this is probably why it's so hard for me to type out.

i don't know if it's worth noting, but i tend to show interest in people who show toxic traits (possessiveness, jealousy, aggressiveness, etc.) and pick them over people who are genuine and sweet. i'll also mention only have one (ironically my first ""actual"" relationship) relationship that evolved into a mess of unhealthy behaviors. did that experience ruin these future feelings that i have? maybe i have trouble with blurring the lines of sexual 'wants' with my romantic 'needs'?

i don't get it, i'm genuinely lost. is it rooted in insecurity? am i simply just not as interested in the person as i thought i was? am i overthinking? is this some kind of response, maybe a learned behavior? i don't need a direct answer, i just need a little pointer to lead me into the right direction.

36,p6bt98,1629232207,"When we stop texting, what does it mean in different senarios??","I was datiny my coworker for the last 4+ months. We have been regularly going out once a week, we enjoyed each other's company, calling each other every other day, intimacy but I was delaying sex till I see what kind of a guy he is and since I'm conservative little bit.

Lately he started not texting regularly, so I opened up and asked him if this is normal that we don't chat for 4+ days. He said he is like this usually and he should've be better in communication.

Last month, I belive I was the active person who is initiating conversations and text, although he is interacting with me always, but if I don't text for 2 days, he won't initiate anything. I asked him that I'm not happy with this communication and we should know where things are etc. He said I'm not in love with you yet and I don't know when I will be. I told him I'm not yet as well but if we don't talk, how we will go to next level and I told him I'm more than ok to have a break from each other! He said its not about break.
Next morning, he texted me good morning and I replied and then nothing after that.

Since then, it's been about 10 days we never had any communication. He keeps liking my social media picture and watch my stories but never texted/called me. 

I thought I'm being too much by trying to call him/text him everyday and I wanted effort from him as well 

We don't have any friends in common. He has been with the company for a year post covid and I work next building but there is a chance we may run to each other since we r in the same department a d have same job.

I'm a professional 37F with good career, family, friends, highly educated and good life. The only thing is he (42m) never been married and I was! I also have 1 child (12m) from previous marriage. Is this a problem for him? The first day he asked me if I'm single, he knew I have commitment with a kid a d he said we will spend weekend together and he is very interested in me! So I didnt hide anything from him!

What is your advice? I'm not into this century dating and I dont wanna gobout with 10 guys every month just to get attention. I want 1 person's intention and to settle if they are the right person. I had hopes he is a good person and I have interest in him but I don't be too much or push myself on him.

40,p6bvd9,1629232375,Advice needed: I think I have developed a very strong feeling for someone who’s not available and lives in a very different time-zone.,"I’m soon to be 19(F), I’ve found this guy on social media (19)  who lives very far away. We have 12hours difference in our time zone, when it’s day time for me it’s night for him. I don’t even know how we got to be friends on social media and I texted him unknowing that he had a girlfriend and we talked about everything and connected on a deeper level. I haven’t felt this way about anyone. I know it sounds cliché but it’s like wave of emotions i go through whenever I see his texts on my screen, and by talking to him I got to know he’s a really good human being and I helped him with his sadness, and by while trying him to console him about his emotions about family/school I fell in love with him. He is exactly what I have always wanted in someone. We speak different languages yet we connect like magnets. He makes me feel so good about myself and he said that I make him better everyday. Our dreams match and I can be vulnerable to him, and he can be vulnerable to me. I feel like I love him wholeheartedly. 

His personality, his voice, the language he speaks that I don’t understand, his kindness, his everything. I don’t know how to write about this feeling, it’s not like i don’t have any friends or family who doesn’t care about me that’s why i jumped into the first chance i got, it really is not like that. I have people who care about me deeply and I have bestfriends. I like to go to parties and I’m used to having fun. And about my dating life, people are confessing to me everyday, but I don't connect with them like I did with him. I sent him my badly written poetries and some good ones and he sent me his poetries and the stories he had written. He shared my poetries publicly and he loved them and shared his deepest feelings about people around him. 
We share the same dream and we plan what might happen if we could ever meet and I confidently said that we would but things would be much different and we both know it. 
The connection we have is something more than friendship, he compliments me and I him, and he cares about me and my health.  And I care about him so much that it makes me sick to my stomach. I want to touch him and be touched by him everyday. And I’m demi sexual, I don’t feel anything unless I have a deep bond with someone. When he sleeps I feel some kind of peace knowing he’s asleep and when I wake up randomly in the middle of the night because of my insomnia he’s always there for me. 

I stalked his profile and found out that he has a girlfriend, whom he never mentioned and even after knowing that i didn’t ask him anything (gosh, I feel so embarrassed) 
I felt maybe it would ruin the bond we have? 
Or maybe I felt he just sees me as a friend but my gut feeling tells me that he doesn’t, as does his subtle texts and everything. I always hated cheating but is it cheating? I don’t know, and I feel like this is so unfair. Why does he need to be so far away from me and why do I feel this way? And I couldn’t have met with him until the next 4 or 5 years after I’m done with my undergrad. I don’t expect him to be with me honestly, long distance won’t work, it’s obvious. 
How do I move on? He’s my support system, we share a lot of things, I don't want to stop talking to him, he’s making me a better person and for him I want to be a better person, he brings so much to my life. 

I love how cute he is, how cute his texts are, how beautiful everything between us is. 
I don’t know what to do, i really don’t 
This is my first post here so it might be a little messy but I’m desperate for advice and support. 
And I’m really sorry if I’m doing something morally wrong but I can’t imagine losing him, imagining him not being there for me, even if it’s virtual makes me anxious. And I can’t go to therapy because I don’t want to upset my parents, they’ll worry so much about me. And I have a lot on my plate right now, with my A levels exams in January and extracurricular activities but I love him. Why am I being like this?

43,p6ccpu,1629233832,I feel like all of my friends never listen to me when they try to give dating advice. It makes dating feel impossible and me feel lonely.,"I'm a 34 y/o man that has pretty much given up on dating. But I still try to talk about it with friends in some vain attempt to figure out my problems. The issue is that everytime I do, they just talk past me and never listen. In the end I just feel more hopeless AND then get the sense that they respect me less for showing some kind of vulnerability. 

Case in point. In a conversation I had yesterday, I said that I have issues asking women out. My friend took this as an opportunity to wax about how I had to ask women out because they naturally don't have the ability and men do. I responded that that seems kind of funny since I have never felt naturally confident around women , so either he's wrong or I am special. And if I am special , I need some different or new kind of approach. He then just repeated that ""all"" I had to do was go do it. 

I then proposed the idea of asking out random women to practice and get better at it, and he said to NEVER do this because it isn't the right way and it is sociopathic. He proposed finding female friends to ask out . But he later told me not wait too long or they would assume I am not emotionally strong and lose interest. I then said that this was my original problem, that I have issues asking women out. 

And it is like this for EVERY conversation with EVERY person I have. I think people just assume I have some kind of innate level of confidence because I'm male. OR they think I can change my fears and emotions sheerly through force of will. OR they think my dating woes will just magically sort themselves out since ""I haven't found the right woman yet."", as if my 9 years of being single serve in no way to indicate that there is a problem I have. 

I think the worst part of this is that no one just lets me be single either. If I say I am 34 and single its always, ""Well you should have figured this out by now."" or ""What are you doing?"". That is how I get into these frustrating conversations in the first palce. I actually accepted I would be single a long time ago, especially after trying to take the, ""You'll find someone when you least expect it."" kind of advice. I'm not the happiest but it isn't so bad, especially since I get to do everything on my terms. But no one will accept me for this. Or they assume that I am like this because I want to be which I am not. I get a lot of ""How can you be single if you are empathetic, kind, and aren't resentful towards women?"". Its like, if I knew this, I wouldn't be single.  

Every time this happens, I just want to tell people about myself less. It is abundantly clear that no one understands me. So I find myself being less vulnerable and cutting myself off from people. It feels like I can't be who I really am and have people accept me. And I am getting lonlier as a result. I don't even care about getting a girlfriend. All I want is for people to actually listen and see me for who I am. I don't even think therapy is helping this , since simply knowing that I am not someone that people understand is enough to feel isolated.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p6ccpu/i_feel_like_all_of_my_friends_never_listen_to_me/

I  (19M) met a girl (17F) on a dating site, exactly one month ago.

As the night went on she became less and less open and at one point I caught her on tinder when I looked down from the table.  I'm worried i did or said something that put her off which I can't for the life of me understand what I would have done that changed her tone so much. Anyways, I texted her last night after  her friend gave me her number but she hasn't responded at all. 

Any idea what might be going on? I'm so confused by the situation. The text I sent was not romantic at all it literally just said "" hey was nice to see you again last night x (my name)  her friend also sent her my number so she could have texted me If she wanted to.

He asked about my best date so far too and I told him. He said that I’m beautiful so he’s not surprised and I complimented him back and thanked him. I think he got a bit triggered by it so he called me a weirdo and I hung up.

68,p6fhyu,1629243839,"Wife lost memory, need to reconnect…","Lots of context and history to this but I’ll make it as brief as I can.

My wife had her first brain surgery for an AVM (anterior-venous malformation, a mass of dangerous and potentially eruptive blood vessels) a year after I met her. I stuck with her through it, and she was in chronic pain for 10 years. The AVM had eventually grown back and she had a second brain surgery, this amplified her chronic pain by a lot. I still stuck with her but it has been insanely rough.

To deal with the constant chronic pain, we were informed about ketamine as a treatment. If she could be relieved of at least 50% of the pain, she could do other things like go to the dentist and be social comfortably. 

Turns out the ketamine treatment was a life changing mistake. The doctor insisted to go with double the dose in half of the time to accommodate her condition and agoraphobia. In short, she had been given too much too quickly, and it poisoned her and burned her brain and memory, causing a lot of cognitive damage and even visual distortion.

She does have some memory of things, but she doesn’t recognize me like she once had. She’s explained to me how I feel to her, and that I’m like a stranger she doesn’t know yet. She wants to know me again, she likes me, but I basically have to start over with dating. It’s tricky because (and I must admit) it is difficult to not think of her as the person I knew before. She’s not entirely that person anymore so I need to get to know her again as she is.

So, the idea is to date and woo her all over again. I actually have too little experience in doing so, she was my second girlfriend I’ve ever had, and we liked each other in the beginning so much that it came so naturally. We don’t have much money, and she can’t leave the house.

So I pose to you, any advice, tips, or ideas? However creative, whatever you have is greatly appreciated.

76,p6gfif,1629247181,Need help with awkward situation after sort of asking out coworker.,"So awhile back I was working this job and I was taking to this girl who I thought was really cute and cool. I ended up leaving that job snd asked my female friend if she could get her Instagram for me, and I sort of just threw that out there but surprisingly my female friend did it. The girl said she would follow my friend so that I could get her Instagram and it never really happened until recently, so I just found her on Instagram anyways and followed her, but she never followed me back so I thought was that.

I end up getting called to this job again, I see this girl and we’re cordial, but I just felt super awkward bc I thought I got rejected. Well my female friend told me that they were talking about me and she said I was cool and funny, and even asked my age. Today I saw them and my female friend said the girl felt weird bc I didn’t say hi to her, but I didn’t mean to I was just nervous and didn’t want to like look at her again if that makes sense.

She comes up to me during my shift today and says that she didn’t mean to ignore me (she told me she doesn’t check her requests that often) and that she followed me back. She then started trying to make small talk but I was just sort of mumbling and was too anxious, and she just asked me when I was working again and that she would see me tomorrow. 

I just feel so dumb for acting like a shy little kid but I just couldn’t help it bc in my head I though she just ignored me, and I thought she wasn’t interested and I’m not sure if she’s just being nice now. I hate awkward situations like this and I felt my flight or fight response kicking in and I usually don’t get nervous taking to girls, but when I have a crush I turn into a second grader. 

I was wondering if I should just leave it at that or what I should do? I feel like it’s too awkward for me now but at least I know I’m not repulsive and she didn’t mean to do that. On one hand her coming up to me and saying that made me feel good but I just don’t want to make things any more awkward.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p6gfif/need_help_with_awkward_situation_after_sort_of/

86,p6h4f6,1629249772,Guy I'm seeing wants to take a break to focus on making money but still wants sex,"This is my first post on Reddit so bear with me.

I (F24) met this guy (M25) a few weeks ago and we really hit it off! I have never felt more comfortable with a man before in my life. He's tall (6'2 which is great because I'm tall for a woman 5'10), educated, kind, funny, a little geeky but I find it charming.

He's also Nigerian, which is not a problem at all for me, I am a Black woman too. The issue is, the conversion rate on Nigerian money and USD is horrendous, and he told me last night that we can't hang out anymore because he wants to take a few weeks to make money and pay for college things. His classes start at the end of August, and the reason why he's in America is to receive an American degree.

I am not a materialistic woman at all. I do make a decent amount of money considering I'm a recent undergraduate myself and I am planning on going back to school for my masters. I also like to invest in nice things, like my tiny Coach bag and expensive perfumes (these are my splurge items tbh, but most of my wardrobe is from thrifts shops, small Black-owned businesses, and occasionally Zara). But now I think that has intimidated him and he's pulled back.

Last night he texts a long text telling me that he's a first-born son of an African family. Back home (he was in the medical field in Nigeria) he's used to being a provider and in America, everything is overwhelmingly expensive. He wants to take some time to find work and sort out his finances, which, of course, I want him to be financially stable. But on every date, he has INSISTED on paying for everything, even the smallest things like coffee. I am more than capable to pay for dates but he's stubborn and says it's a ""blow to his ego.""

The last thing he texted was that he still wanted to see me at his place, meaning he wants to have sex. We have not had sex and I wasn't planning on it until I was his official girlfriend. We've both had sex before with other people, or one-night stands, but I really wanted to ""do it right"" this time and take it slow with this guy because I can see a long future with him. Should I have sex with him while on break? Or should I just wait a few uncertain weeks and risk him moving on?

TLDR; My International fling wants to take a break to focus on college and making money, but he still wants to have sex. I'm not ready to have sex without the title of a girlfriend.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p6h4f6/guy_im_seeing_wants_to_take_a_break_to_focus_on/

We had, for what I thought was good conversation via dating app with seemingly similar interests, and he was the one who brought it off the app and made the plans/place to meet up. I was pretty nervous, but we meet and have some drinks and have good conversation - for which we talk about a wide variety of topics, including family, what I look for in a guy, and that I have only been in one long-term relationship and that he is divorced. I did react to that but ultimately, told him I don't really care about it. I give him my number and the day after, I text him, as I had a good time, don't really care for playing the waiting game and ultimately, wanted a second date to get to know him even more. He asks ""hey, how is your day so far?"" type question for which I respond with a meme (lmao). Since sending that, haven't received a text back and a couple of days later, I send him another message to check in - no response. We both have jobs that keep up relatively busy so while I don't expect quick responses, I expect some type of message along the lines of ""I don't see this going anywhere"" to be polite. it's been almost a week since we met up and about 4 days since I followed up.

2：Learning to entertain yourself alone is a necessary lifelong ability. The vast majority of life's long journey is spent playing alone and being alone, so it is important to like yourself and fall in love with yourself.

3：Women who maintain lifelong learning and growth will become more and more temperamental. In addition to learning in school, it is important to maintain daily growth after graduation, and to have a good temperament, it is important to read more and travel more, and make more mentors and friends.

4：Have the ability to support themselves, economic independence, in order to personality independence, independent thinking.

5:Finding a beloved career is more important than finding a beloved boyfriend. Your love for your dreams and your faith in this life is a path to freedom and liberation. When you have a dream and find a beloved track, the more you live, the better you will be.

6：Do not forget work and dreams at any time, because having work and dreams will make you shine in love, a woman who does not shine is also withered in love.

I’m pretty good at self reflecting and my main issues have been unrealistic expectations like the love of my life is just going to appear (mostly when I was younger) and self confidence issues with my weight and inexperience that I have finally mostly put behind me.

I met this girl I really like, that I would like to pursue more but I want to be honest with her while not turning her away. I know obviously I’m not going to bring this up on our 2nd date but I think my fear of this conversation has led me to avoid many 3-6 dates and been my downfall.

Are there any good ways to approach this or should I explain my self-analysis I just typed here.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p6hzp4/is_my_relationship_experience_an_issue/
