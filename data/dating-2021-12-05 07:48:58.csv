0,r9g3xj,1638712168,Women want men with an edge and some balls. Looks aren‚Äôt enough,"There are tons of guys out there who on the surface appear as if they should be highly successful with women‚Äî they are naturally good looking, have good careers, and are able display status through material items such as nice cars or clothing. Yet, these guys are somehow still struggling with dating.

Having status and your shit together is extremely attractive to women, but it certainly isn‚Äôt enough. The problem is that these type of guys are too safe‚Äî they assume that since they fit the mold of what society says women want,i.e. stability, that they should automatically be successful with women. Wrong.

Women are drawn to men who have some edge to them. This doesn‚Äôt mean being aggressive or a dick. You can still be kind and have edge and some balls. There are some elements to this:

Style: conveying polarity and masculinity is more important than being naturally handsome. Do you notice that you‚Äôll see attractive women with guys women who have tattoos, or have some element to their look that is atypical of what you see every day? This is an element of polarity that draws in the most attractive women; they are drawn to guys who stand out physically and don‚Äôt necessarily conform to what society expects them to do. This doesn‚Äôt mean you have to go out and get tattoos, piercings, or dress strangely. It does, however, that you shouldn‚Äôt be afraid to take some chances with your style, and incorporate that into how you project yourself. Think of how you want to convey masculinity in your look, in a way the makes your comfortable. If you‚Äôre balding, take the step and shave your head; if you‚Äôve wanted to wear certain colors that are outside of your comfort zone of what you typically wear. Or wear a cologne that makes you confident, but might be considered a little bold or polarizing.

Attitude. It may sound arrogant on the surface, but you have to carry the belief in you that you are an interesting person and any woman would be lucky to be with you. Again, there needs to be balance to this because it will veer into arrogance, but research has shown that people are attracted to those who are superior to them in some manner. Focus on areas in your life that you excel and can offer to others. When you are interacting with a beautiful woman, you can‚Äôt hold onto the belief that she holds all the cards. Beauty is common.

Physicality. Quite simply, physical activities that allow you to compete with others or push you physically provide an almost immediate sense of confidence. Whether it is boxing, MMA, lifting weights, playing pickup basketball, the examples are endless. When you consistently put yourself in situations that stress your body or you are directly competing with others, you will have an air about you that will translate into your social interactions.

Opinions and boundaries. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure, what do you think?‚Äù should be removed from everyone‚Äôs lexicon. Women who are attracted to men who are decisive, and know what they want. Too often, the oposite occurs. Men are afraid to have balls, to say what is on their mind, even if it might offend or be met with disagreement. Sometimes this can be uncomfortable. However, being too deferential and nice is the quickest path to having a woman lose respect and attraction. This doesn‚Äôt mean you have to be a rigid asshole who doesn‚Äôt consider the opinions of others, but you have to lead. When a woman makes the majority of the decisions with her man following, the masculine and feminine energies are flipped.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r9g3xj/women_want_men_with_an_edge_and_some_balls_looks/

&amp;#x200B;

There is this guy that sent me a message on instagram asking me out on a date. We don't personally know each other but have been following each other on social media for a few years and have exchanged a few messages in the past. We have similar interests and I think he is cute. However I don't want to lead anyone on and told him that right now it's not the best time because I am extremelly busy with work and there is a lot of chaotic stuff happening in my life. By the way, one of those things is that I am dealing with cancer and he already knew about it before asking me out

His reply was: ""That's ok, I understand. Don't worry, honestly. If there is anything within my power that I could do, if you need anything that would make your life less chaotic, let me know"" and 1 hour after that messages me again saying ""Who knows if we bump into each other  üòÇ"". I replied with a GIF of Joe from the ""You"" series and told him ""this is what came to mind when I read your last message"". He then said ""Hey, I'm not one to do this üòÇ (exactly what a stalker would say to throw off any suspicion)"". I replied with ""Hahaha now I fear that I'm being observed üëÄ"" and his answer was ""Maybe you would even enjoy it üòÇ""

Later on in the night we ended up complaining to one another about not having a FWB in the city live in. He asked me to go smoke a j with him back at his house. One thing led to another and we made out his couch, but I was quickly not into it. He asked me to go back his bed with him and I refused. He kept trying to put his hand around my neck, looking back I think it was an attempt at turning me on. Anyways I sat there awkwardly afterwards and left. He begged me not to tell anyone and I totally agreed. Fast forward a week and I ended up mentioning it to two co-workers I trusted. They were shocked but unsurprised. I only planned on telling those friends and never mentioning it to anyone.

   Fast forward two more weeks after and I don‚Äôt have my original shifts posted on the schedule. Downgraded to one shift a week. My manager tells me I‚Äôve been getting complaints about me. The issue is resolved but still , im assuming he didn‚Äôt single me out  because he talked to another employee.

I ended up complaining to a lot of the other staff, this wasn‚Äôt a smart move but I felt like I needed to tell people in case he were to fire me .I am alone in a very new, big city with no family and few close friends.

    A few days later I confronted him and asked verbatim if my choice to not sleep with him Influenced his decision on taking my shift away. He was basically sweating and denying the whole time which is unsurprising . Anyways I felt like it was resolved and things were going back to normal. Now he treats me even worse.

28,r9idso,1638719146,Dating is far more exciting when you go out and approach people in person than on any of the dating apps,"Having recently moved to a new city after graduating college, I‚Äôve found initially myself leaning in dating apps to meet people both romantically and platonically. However, I find that I am way more judgmental and non-committal when using dating apps. It‚Äôs incredibly easy to get a match, feel the rush of dopamine from feeling desirable, and never committing to actually engaging matches in conversation on the app or, more importantly, following through to meet in person (ghosting, if you will). 

Basically, dating apps are really bad at fostering genuine connection, despite how deeply intertwined they‚Äôve become in the social fabric of modern dating. The app developers intentionally make it that way, so we are dependent on repeatedly deleting and redownloading the app when we start to feel isolated/lonely. 

Similarly, it feels like people are typically very antisocial when they go out to clubs, bars, social spaces, etc. with a group of people. Despite the conventional wisdom being that we ‚Äúgo out‚Äù to meet new people, it feels people today are content sticking to their group despite (likely) wanting to foster new relationships, especially after isolating alone or in small social circles as a result of COVID.

Anyway, after running to the same problem with our love lives on dating apps, my roommate and I committed to going out with our friends, but branching out as soon as we made it to the venue. Although we initially stuck to our group out of fear of rejection and fear of appearing ‚Äúcreepy,‚Äù we eventually swallowed our pride and started approaching new people in a friendly and open way. We both found immediate success. I go two numbers, one for a potential date and another for a potential friend. He was successful too and landed the phone numbers of three potential dates. I‚Äôve decided that we have been ‚Äúgoing out‚Äù all wrong and that you actually have way a more fulfilling experience by talking to strangers when ‚Äúgoing out.‚Äù People of all genders want to be approached when in social spaces, but we self-isolate out of our fear of being shot down. Although it won‚Äôt always work, the dopamine hit from striking up conversations with strangers in person feels 1000x better than swiping on a dating app from your bed. Delete your app. Get out there. Say hi. Be open. You won‚Äôt regret it.

TL;DR: In theory, dating apps are convenient, easy to use, and offer access to a large pool. However, in practice, most dating apps fucking suck at what they were initially designed to help us do better. A lot of people approach ‚Äúgo out‚Äù the wrong way by not breaking away from the groups/people they go out and not taking a moment with to chat with stranger/new people. You have an infinitely more fulfilling experience meeting new people in person rather than on an app. Despite it requiring a bit of intentionality and courage to do so, going out and talking to strangers is the better way to find people to date/be friends with.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r9idso/dating_is_far_more_exciting_when_you_go_out_and/

However I wasn‚Äôt expecting it to happen that night and when he initiated it I felt very nervous and the night ended up lacking the confidence I usually have and lacking sexual chemistry I feel we would normally have between us if it happened again. However after the night he started texting me more and we talked intensely everyday for the next two months. I was confused as to why we hadn‚Äôt hooked up again but still felt our connection was growing deeper. Finally he came to my flat to watch films and nothing happened to my surprise so I texted him after admitting that I was confused and couldn‚Äôt sense the vibe between us. He was ambiguous in his response at first but when pushed a little admitted he didn‚Äôt feel romantically for me (he didn‚Äôt think) but saw me as a close friend who he valued a lot. I allowed the conversation to close as I was embarrassed and upset but now I wish I had brought the night up and told him I thought it was awkward too but due to circumstantial reasons and I felt we would have more if it happened again. However I need advice on this as a few days have passed and I‚Äôve ignored a couple of his message which have gone back to his usual, everyday chat. Is it creepy and desperate to say I still need to talk to him about it even though the convo ended and he rejected me?

35,r9isc1,1638720332,Dating app fatigue,"Recently I found myself completely uninterested in the use of dating apps. 

Some background: 2 of the 3 relationships I‚Äôve been in have been the result of using a dating app. These relationships didn‚Äôt last for one reason or another, with the most recent one ending mid summer this year. 

After taking some time to myself and focusing on my mental health. I decided to give the dating thing another swing but as of late, I can‚Äôt seem to spend more than 10 minutes on a dating app before become utterly exhausted. 

Between the various ways these apps try to capitalize on your loneliness or the quality of people &amp; conversations that you typically find on these sort of apps. It just becomes exhausting and frankly discouraging very quickly. 

Now a days, I see myself downloading an app and deleting it within the same day in most cases. 

But dating apps are kind of a necessary evil for someone like myself. Who struggles striking a conversation with complete strangers. Let alone flirting with one. 

So my question is, has anyone else experienced something like this? And if so, how did you combat this?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r9isc1/dating_app_fatigue/
36,r9iw2r,1638720626,I'm hilarious but only serious women like me,"It's been like this since I was a teenager. 

I've almost always been turned down by women who crack me up and vice versa, which I love and find absolutely attractive. Bonus points for being a down to earth nerd. The only exception was my very first girlfriend, whom I loved to death. We were practically glued to each other during the day, gamed all night, could laugh both with and at each other. Unfortunately she discovered a year later that she's a lesbian. 

It got confusing when I noticed I do attract incompatible people. I've only been with broody, poetic women wanting to explore the world with me. Nothing wrong with being that way and I like a good poem and trip, but I need to be able to laugh my butt off. Not *all* the time mind you, but at least with some *frequency*. Anyway, they end up feeling offended or cranky because I ruin some spiritual moment by comparing it to a scene from GTA5, or because they find me flat out immature. I will never forget the sour face of my ex who wanted to travel to India with me and I surprised her with an Oculus headset so we can do all that in Google Earth without actually having to go anywhere. (I still don't see why it's so different)

Enter the age of Tinder, which seemed like the perfect solution. I deliberately filled my profile with a wall of hilarious insanity to make sure I scare away the people who don't match, swiping right at the slightest sign of non-copy paste humor or whenever I could spot a Playstation in the background.

The first like came in from a girl posing on a graveyard while stroking a tombstone. After that, someone on a hilltop staring broodily into the distance. The third one wanted a man who will invite her into his heart so they can dance there. I thought that one might have been a parody, but her photo was black and white so probably not.

I decided to not judge a book by its cover and gave the tombstone girl a like back. She asked me how I would win her heart, and I told her I'd give her a small, stuffed tombstone with my name on it to pet and hug at night. I got unmatched without a word.

Then I dropped it altogether and joined the masses by also swiping right with any woman that simply looked pretty. I got a match with a woman who had ""be yourself"" and the ""comedy"" interest in her profile, which seemed promising. Nonetheless I felt that this time, I might try and take it a bit slower with the ""be yourself"" part this time. Playing by the book by exchanging interests and asking about careers went surprisingly well. 

Came the day after, when she asked me what I was doing and I decided to be myself now. I told her I was constipated on the toilet, but discovered how it's not half that bad when you pretend you're a medieval king on a throne blaming the constipation on his minions who tremble at this baseless accusation, but no one dares to call me out on it. Unmatched without a word.

Whereas honestly, if *whatever* woman would give that response to *me*, I would just fall in love in an instant.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r9iw2r/im_hilarious_but_only_serious_women_like_me/

If there was someone you were interested in dating who had a kid. Would it be a deal breaker for you if they still lived with the other parent of the child? Even if they had been broken up for months and there was nothing romantic involved? 
For backstory. I (f26) have been broken up with my 3 year old sons dad for several months, but we are currently still living together purely for the sake of us both being there for our son full time. We get along for the most part, but there is absolutely nothing romantic involved, and we have our own bedrooms. I have not ventured back into dating yet, but have been getting more curious, and wonder if guys I date would be okay with this situation?

We met on Tinder, early 20s. There were quite a few ‚Äúred flags‚Äù that communicated to me that his intentions were purely sexual. 
Like, 
- shirtless selfies on sn*p
- only surface level conversations
- trying to get me to his house as quick as possible (I declined the first date there but was fine with 2nd date being at his place)
- and a sexual joke that he made to test the waters before inviting me over. 

Before me going over to his place, he told me that ‚Äúsex isn‚Äôt the only thing on his mind‚Äù. I knew he was lying - a guy wouldn‚Äôt even had to tell me that if it wasn‚Äôt so. 

I was fine with casual - we had sex, I enjoyed it, but as you can imagine, his interest and texting rate dropped down after that meetup.

**I‚Äôm fine personally, but I‚Äôm worried about the girls that fall for these men that can‚Äôt be straightforward about their intentions and lie in order to get sex out of her**.

I'm 28, 5ft6, and Asian. I just don't know what to do anymore, I've had flings here and there, but they all transpire to nothing, and I am always back where I started, alone and isolated. It's a really shitty life not having anyone to be intimate with, and over the last 2 years of this lockdown, I've felt more and more lonely, I am envious of people who have relationships and have someone there to be intimate with. I've never really had that. 

It's gotten to a point where it's made me colder, and empty. Each day, I just feel nothing but emptiness and start to lose sentiment for people around me. 

It just does not seem fair to be this alone, I have taken multiple breaks for trying to find someone, so at this moment I am in limbo. 

I've never loved anyone, nor has anyone loved me. I also don't think I will ever feel love, in a romantic context anyway. At this point, I honestly think I am incapable of having any feelings for another human woman (again in a romantic context).

I met her at a party after we made eye contact across the room a few times and she introduced herself to me when I walked past her. A day later, I slid into her dms and asked for her snap and she gave it to me. However, after I got her snap, I found out from a mutual friend that she had a boyfriend so I texted her infrequently just to get to know her better and talked to her at parties, but did not flirt with her. After a month of knowing her, I found out that she broke up with her boyfriend so I began to text her more frequently and flirted with her a little bit. For example, I asked her what she was gonna be for Halloween and she told me and I said that it was a boring costume for someone so interesting and she saved it in Snapchat. I was at a Halloween party with her and I flirted with her and put my arm around her and she flirted back with me because she put her hand on my chest for a few seconds, was comfortable with my contact, and shared a drink with me. Many Redditors agreed that she was flirting with me. 

I decided to ask her to dinner as friends because she just got out of a relationship and didn‚Äôt want to rush anything and make her feel uncomfortable. She said she‚Äôd get dinner with me, but added that she‚Äôs not looking for a relationship right now. I said that I understood and we‚Äôd get dinner as friends and she agreed, but the day before the dinner, she texted me and said that getting dinner together was a bad idea because we have different expectations and that we don‚Äôt get along that well. After she rejected me, I cut contact with her for two weeks except saying hi in passing. 

Then at my friend‚Äôs birthday party, I talked to her and had a casual conversation with her for 5 minutes and planned not to talk to her for the rest of the night. However, when I walked out of a room, she was standing nearby and walked up to me and started playing with my hat for not reason and I asked her why she was doing it and she said why wouldn‚Äôt I be playing with your hat. During this conversation, her face was really close to mine and we were making deep eye contact. My drunk ass really wanted to kiss her, but I decided to go for a hug and we hugged for a good 10 seconds.

Then, a few days ago she came over o my apartment to hangout with me and my roommate and she showed me a video and put her hand that was holding her phone on my hand. And a day after that, we were at a party together and she came up and talked to me and she fell forward a bit and I had to catch her and I kept my hands around her waist and back and she didn‚Äôt pull away.

Was she just using me for attention or just looking for a hookup and got scared off by my feelings? Is she attracted to me or is she only flirty because she‚Äôs drunk? Why did she say that we don‚Äôt get along that well, but flirted with me and initiated touch and conversation? How do I get over her? Sorry for ranting, but I just wanted to get it off my chest. Also, I understand people might see me as the bad guy for going after a girl who just got out of a breakup, but I would rather get rejected immediately than wait around for her so that I can move on.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r9jrb3/is_she_attracted_to_me_do_i_have_a_chance_in_the/

I was REALLY digging nearly everything about her............. Well except when it came time to make plans. She blew me over several times, We talked for 4-5 weeks - AND NEVER HUNG OUT / WENT ON A DATE EVEN ONCE!!! The only reason that I even know for sure that she's real, is because my weekend job entails me delivering food - and I jokingly said one day that you should order food and I can deliver it to you at work and we can talk for a few minutes. 
So after about 2 weeks of talking and being blown off by her twice I was about to say goodbye, because she hadn't answered me in a few days. So I was just going to tell her good luck in your endeavors and all that blah blah blah. And the same morning that I was going to say goodbye she orders a fucking delivery!!! So I got slightly attached again.

Only to be blown off another couple times. Today was like week number five that we were talking and I finally just had to say goodbye. I told her that I couldn't deal with the up and down roller coaster emotional ride anymore. Told her how she knows that I was serious cuz I told her and that I needed the same in return.

Fortunately though, I overcame all of this with the exception of the focusing heavily on school bit. I'm really passionate about what I'm studying and have ambitions to make a positive change in this world.

As for where I am now, the thing is, I don't feel as though I have any sort of confidence issues. In fact, I am extremely extroverted, I can talk to strangers very easily (including someone who I might be interested by simply introducing myself and striking up a conversation), I like engaging in public speaking and as for the aforementioned fear of talking to women/ rejection issue, I no longer fear that. In the event I do get rejected, I tend to smile, laugh it off and tell the person who I was interested in to simply take what I said as a compliment. It cuts the tension and they usually smile so I take comfort in the fact knowing that I at least did that even if things didn't go anywhere between us. Admittedly, though I have only asked out maybe ten women tops in my life loool.

So my question is where do I go from here?

P.S. I tend to have an aversion to social media (ironic considering I'm post this here). But I am open to trying dating apps.

Thank you so much for reading this :)

As for that pun I promised, what do you call a fake noodle?

62,r9l3ur,1638726861,I ruined things with someone who really liked me for the first time in my life,"I'm a 24 year old guy who's socially awkward and has never been in a relationship before, and only a handful of dates over the past few years. Two years ago I started talking to this guy on tinder. He was basically the perfect guy, at least to me. He was very attractive and talented, a former model, he could sing and play a lot of instruments. He told me when we matched that he thought I was very attractive and hot, and that I was the cutest guy in town. We started messaging each other on snapchat and he started talking about how he wants to do all kinds of dirty things to me. I told him that I don't like to talk sexually with someone when I don't know them that well, we've only been talking for a few days at most at that point. He told me that I made it seem like I didn't want to have sex with him, and that I should because I know that he likes me. I told him that I would like to have sex with him, but that I to take things slow, and said he understood.

He went on a first date and it went really well. We had lunch at a diner and then made out, which was my first time. We lived an hour away from each other and he told me that he usually wouldn't drive that far to meet someone and that he didn't think he'd be trying to get into a relationship so soon after his last one ended a few months before then, but that there was something about me that changed his mind on those things, and he held my hand for a bit while he drove me home.

We kept texting afterwards and the told me me that he's obsessed with me and falling for me, how he can see himself spending his life with me, and how the reason other dates I went on didn't lead to another one was because no one else is as smart as me, and that he's probably my perfect match. I told him about bad experiences I've had with people on dating apps before and he said that I must attract crazy people, but now I have him, and he'll sing me to sleep at night. I was elated to have this guy so into me. It was everything I've been wanting for years. 

He told me about how his family was being kicked out of their house by their aunt. He texted me at the bank before he was about to find out if he could get a loan for a new house for his family and I sent him encouraging texts. He told me that I was his sunshine and that he liked how attentive I was.

We planned a second date and he said that he wanted to have sex with me on the second date, and that we'd be boyfriends if it was good. I was a little hesitant, since I'm a virgin and he told me that he was well endowed. He said that I just had to get over it. He also wanted it to be unprotected, saying that he wanted to cum in me.

One day I brought up that I wasn't sure if we were sexually compatible, since he told me a few times that he needed to know if his sexual needs would be fulfilled if we were dating and I didn't really want to have sex with someone that I only knew for a few weeks. He said that he couldn't be with someone who was debating whether they wanted to be with him or not. I really liked this guy and didn't want to lose him, so I sent him a bunch of texts begging him to reconsider. I know it was a very desperate move and I'm not proud of it or justifying it. He said that I acted crazy and made him lose all his feelings for me, and that maybe he could get them back if  I had sex with him. I was going to at first, but after a few days I realized that I didn't want to do that, still wanting my first time to be with someone that I knew for a bit and had a good established connection with, and also we would have had to have sex in his car since his family was losing their house and I couldn't have sex at my house since I still live at home too, and I wanted my first time to be in a bed, and we stopped talking.

Since then I went between thinking that he just wanted to have sex with me to being upset that I lost a really attractive guy who really liked me, the first time anyone's liked me like that in my life. Last month I wanted to know for sure, so I messaged him on social media and asked him if he actually liked me and I ruined it or if he just wanted to sleep with me, and he said that he really did like me at first, and then I ruined it. I regret asking. I know it's dumb to ask a question and then get upset when the answer isn't what I wanted, but I don't like knowing for certain that I ruined things and I'm having trouble coming to terms with it.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r9l3ur/i_ruined_things_with_someone_who_really_liked_me/

64,r9lhxt,1638727869,Is this disrespectful? More interested in what women think.,"I was recently on a trip with a now ex. We couldn‚Äôt see eye to eye on a subject. She found 2 things I did highly disrespectful and said all women would agree. She also said my exes were weak because they didn‚Äôt tell me my behaviour was disrespectful. 

My counter was that not everyone sees things the same way and the true disrespect would be in continuing to do something that she found disrespectful. I let her know that now that I knew she felt it was disrespectful, I wouldn‚Äôt do it. 

So, here‚Äôs what she found disrespectful. 

We were in Vegas and leaving a buddy‚Äôs lounge. The 2 valet guys were standing at their podium, I had just opened the door to the car and shut it for my girl. As I was walking around the car my overly drunk buddy kept harping on the fact that we weren‚Äôt sticking around to party. I said we had other things to do. He said, like what? I said, starts with s and ends with x. He immediately shut up as I said I enjoy sax practice. I knew what would finally shut him up. She claims the valet guys motioned to her that they saw it as disrespect and wanted to know if she wanted help. Regardless of whether they did, I just see it as a joke. She doesn‚Äôt. 

The second thing that came about was when we were standing around in the mall in Vegas, I held her from behind and at times would squeeze tightly with a little, unnoticeable hump (for lack of a better term). Up until this point we were very sexual with each other. 

Also, to this point we hadn‚Äôt spent much time in public and were still feeling out how each other works in public spaces with people. 

This caused long discussions and we ultimately called it off as we agreed we wouldn‚Äôt see eye to eye. 

Everything else seemed great between us and we were very communicative. In fact, we dealt with this situation by talking instead of arguing or fighting. Our communication was on point.

I see it everyday with my friends. There‚Äôs the ones who can hold down a long term relationship, have men fawn over them, and who have been proposed to at least once, if not more times. And then there‚Äôs the ones that can‚Äôt hold a relationship down and have never had a man consider marrying them.

My friends are all equally gorgeous women by societal standards, all have very fun and lively personalities, and have fulfilling lives. After knowing them for so long, I honestly don‚Äôt see much of a difference in any of them.

They‚Äôve come to a conclusion that there‚Äôs a vibe these ‚Äúwifey material‚Äù women give off that the ‚Äúnon-wifey material‚Äù women don‚Äôt have. But we can‚Äôt exactly pinpoint what encompasses that vibe.

73,r9m71o,1638729716,What's your unpopular dating opinion? Something you really believe but would get down voted to all hell if you said it?,"I've been on fifteen Bumble dates. Here are my unpopular opinions based on my lived experiences:

1) If a first date doesn't go to a second one, I think the most common reason is because of lack of sexual attraction.

I've been on first dates where convo flowed well, venue was great, some laughs were had, and then boom ghosted. I'm willing to bet the woman looked at me and within the first 30 seconds thought ""nope, not fucking this guy."" I feel like both men and women essentially know if there's going to be a second date within the first few minutes of meeting.

On the flip side I was once met with starry eyes and giggly smile. I immediately knew we'd be dating for awhile, and I was right.

2) I can't speak for other people, but me personally, honest closure closes it. I so wish people would just be honest for the reason of the 'break up.' ""Sorry your income and penis are too small. I just can't."" I would prefer that a million times over the cliche ""I didn't feel a connection, spark, chemistry, we didn't mesh.""

My OCD brain kicks into high gear wondering what the real reason is, and if I just knew, I'd be at peace. Again this is more of a 'me' problem than a dating problem, but still.

3) It sucks dating as a guy. I have to initiate the convo, ask her out, logistically plan it, pay for it, ask for a second date, then initiate any touching. The heavy lifting gets tiring after awhile.

I recently matched with a woman who lives an hour away. Guess which one of us had to drive the distance to meet?

74,r9mbeb,1638730037,Is she interested in me?,"I [M18] am having a huge crush on my new co-worker of my age who started working 2 1/2 weeks ago. 

I remembered from her first workday that she was a little uncomfortable and silent (which ofc is expected during somebody's first workday) and as I noticed I tried to talk to her a little and make her more comfortable, which ended up working... and building up my crush for her.

I managed to make her talk more and now we're pretty much ""work-buddies"", we like to talk together, we always laugh at each others jokes and even end up having awkward eye contact sometimes. 

As we haven't worked together for long I questioned myself if she was just pretending to like me, maybe I was just annoying (I am pretty insecure about myself) untill she told me that she doesn't like that we haven't been put on (lunch)break together yet. I guess that would be a confirmation of her liking me?

Getting to the point, I really dont know what to do. We only see each other during the weekends so I don't know that much about her and haven't had the moment to ask her more questions as we dont have a break together. What im most afraid of is that she sees me as a friend, somebody she just enjoys spending time with during work while im having a major crush on her. 

Anyone who could give me any advice, what should I do/ask her? Does she like me too? Any info is super appreciated to me

I (21M) had a crush on this girl (21F) for about 2 months. I met her at a party after we made eye contact across the room a few times and she introduced herself to me when I walked past her. A day later, I slid into her dms and asked for her snap and she gave it to me. However, after I got her snap, I found out from a mutual friend that she had a boyfriend so I texted her infrequently just to get to know her better and talked to her at parties, but did not flirt with her. After a month of knowing her, I found out that she broke up with her boyfriend so I began to text her more frequently and flirted with her a little bit. For example, I asked her what she was gonna be for Halloween and she told me and I said that it was a boring costume for someone so interesting and she saved it in Snapchat. I was at a Halloween party with her and I flirted with her and put my arm around her and she flirted back with me because she put her hand on my chest for a few seconds, was comfortable with my contact, and shared a drink with me. Many Redditors agreed that she was flirting with me. 

I decided to ask her to dinner as friends because she just got out of a relationship and didn‚Äôt want to rush anything and make her feel uncomfortable. She said she‚Äôd get dinner with me, but added that she‚Äôs not looking for a relationship right now. I said that I understood and we‚Äôd get dinner as friends and she agreed, but the day before the dinner, she texted me and said that getting dinner together was a bad idea because we have different expectations and that we don‚Äôt get along that well. After she rejected me, I cut contact with her for two weeks except saying hi in passing. 

Then at my friend‚Äôs birthday party, I talked to her and had a casual conversation with her for 5 minutes and planned not to talk to her for the rest of the night. However, when I walked out of a room, she was standing nearby and walked up to me and started playing with my hat for not reason and I asked her why she was doing it and she said why wouldn‚Äôt I be playing with your hat. During this conversation, her face was really close to mine and we were making deep eye contact. My drunk ass really wanted to kiss her, but I decided to go for a hug and we hugged for a good 10 seconds.

Then, a few days ago she came over o my apartment to hangout with me and my roommate and she showed me a video and put her hand that was holding her phone on my hand. And a day after that, we were at a party together and she came up and talked to me and she fell forward a bit and I had to catch her and I kept my hands around her waist and back and she didn‚Äôt pull away.

Was she just using me for attention or just looking for a hookup and got scared off by my feelings? Is she attracted to me or is she only flirty because she‚Äôs drunk? Why did she say that we don‚Äôt get along that well, but flirted with me and initiated touch and conversation? How do I get over her? Sorry for ranting, but I just wanted to get it off my chest. Also, I understand people might see me as the bad guy for going after a girl who just got out of a breakup, but I would rather get rejected immediately than wait around for her so that I can move on.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r9ne83/is_she_attracted_to_me_do_i_have_a_chance_in_the/
87,r9nla9,1638733449,Really don't know what to do honestly dating wise.,"So it's been about 3 months now since I broke up with my BF and it's not like he's a terrible person or anything, but we just had too much problems going on in our lives and decided to split, but a good ex nonetheless.

Fast forward to the present and the breakup is taking a heavy toll on my mental health sadly, before and after the split I've kept telling myself multiple times I'd be cool with us parting but its been the opposite. So on one hand my mind wants to jump on the dating scene and try to fill that void in my heart or at least find someone to spend time with on a more intimate level, then on the other hand I feel like being alone is 100% better for me at this point and better myself...But its driving me crazy, I've been trying to keep myself distracted with this like exercise and gaming but the idea keeps presenting itself.

Before my boyfriend, I've been single for a long time and I guess I'm afraid I'll just jump back to my old ways and lock myself mentally once more, any tips, criticism or advice is appreciated, thanks for taking the time to read this, and have a good one!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r9nla9/really_dont_know_what_to_do_honestly_dating_wise/
88,r9nm9m,1638733520,Should I give up on dating until my 30s?,"A general philosophy I've had while growing up as a straight male is that if I can't be hot then I can at least be smart. Probem is, all of the people I am in competition with are just as smart as I am and they are generally conventionally attractive. Six foot, broad shoulders, fit, white, wealthy. I can only lay claim to the last one in that list and even then I'm only upper middle class. I'm also almost certain that I have undiagnosed autism but I would never claim definitively to be autistic without a doctor's diagnosis.

I used to be unbothered by my situation but I am starting to feel the pressure of potentially growing old by myself, eventually dying without having loved. When I see all of the people around me forming relationships in our class and experiencing young love I feel a part of me die inside. I desperately want to break out of this miasmatic cloud of insecurity that surrounds my thoughts at all times but it's difficult because I am surrounded by reminders of how I have failed to ""be a man."" 

The only brightside to my current situation is that I will be a doctor in a few years and can finally start making some good money/be respected for my profession. I've recently been thinking about just giving up on the possibility of experiencing romance before 30 but I am afraid that will result in me becoming more and more depressed. 

I wish I could explain myself better but I don't want to write a giant wall of text.  Sorry if I come off as bitter but it's hard not to when it feels like I'm a boy in a society where only men can date. 

TLDR: I'm not what women want so I'm thinking about just giving up on dating until later so I have time to learn what everyone else seems to know already.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r9nm9m/should_i_give_up_on_dating_until_my_30s/

90,r9nmda,1638733527,Should I COMPLETELY forget about romantic relationship with an old ex/my closest female friend who's in a on and off relationship for 3 years now?,"Have you ever been in a similar situation :?

We've met back in 2016 but since we were both in school and our schedules were different we had almost no time for US so the only reason we've broke up was because of time.

In present days we are really close with each other - we talk for whatever we want, we text daily, we go out quite often, we sometimes cook together and play video games, when outside we always have amazing time together.

Well, as I've mentioned she is in on and off relationship with her boyfriend - I've told her that I don't really wanna know what's happening with them but from the things I know - he is really bipolar, selfish and arrogant. At the end of the day it's her choice!

Here is the thing - she is really emotional person. She listens her heart instead of her head most of the times - her last 2 break ups with him were her "" LAST "" but everytime he goes to talk with her - she goes back to him.

Last time this happend I was over with her but after few weeks I went out with a close friend of hers and she shared with me that during the last break up ( which was 2 months) my friend had thoughts to talk with me about a relationship since we are really cool together - ofcourse after some time passes, so she could totally forget about that guy and don't use me as a rebound.

I've asked her if that is true and my friend confirmed that she had these thoughts twice while not in a relationship with that guy.

&amp;#x200B;

How should I proceed with her ? Should I tell her how I feel/ should I just be there for her or talk about no communication while in a relationship?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r9nmda/should_i_completely_forget_about_romantic/
91,r9nprl,1638733796,"Am I misunderstanding the term of ""Nice Guy"" because I see they get a lot of hate","I have seen posts floating around different subreddits hating on ""Nice Guys"" and a whole subreddit dedicated to the hate. I am just not sure If I truly understand the definition based off of the posts. Sure I have seen a few where the guys are misogynistic jerk bags right from the start. with proper context you can tell they are bad people. But I have noticed more than one that the guy looks like they are just being fed up for being walked on. and people in the comments seem to be ripping them apart. 

while I don't agree with the ones who are jerks right from the start I wouldn't call them ""Nice Guys""  and and outside of that is where my understanding might me muddied a little bit. 

I tend to see some where the guys were actually nice and then when they get their hearts broken by someone they get bitter and upset because It happens to them time and time again. I wonder if I see those differently because I might be that type of nice guy I am not sure.

 I know once when I was a kid I was told by an older cousin ""Treat women like shit they will come running to you"" But the way I was raised I was always told to treat people with respect until they give you a reason not to. So for most of my life I have had 2 modes first you get my respect and I treat you with compassion and kindness and for some love. The other is you're dead to me and I am going to basically be a Jerk to you because you don't deserve my kindness or just completely cut ties with you and never speak to you again its not worth my time or energy(which I have done in the past). 

I constantly get told I am wonderful and I do nothing wrong from the women I date yet they break up with me. And from my married friends that I am ""fantastic and a great guy and they need to find me someone"" As I continue to get hurt, knocked down and repeatedly kicked while I am down there I am moving past being sad by it and becoming more angry at not the person themselves but the universe and myself. 

So am I misunderstanding the definition of nice guy because I might be one Or are the ones that stand out to me and I feel bad for are not necessarily ""Nice Guy's"" they just took out their frustration on the wrong person at the wrong time and it ended up in a post somewhere.?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r9nprl/am_i_misunderstanding_the_term_of_nice_guy/

He is a really nice guy but I felt so uncomfortable and somehow lost all that attraction, I just wanted to go home after the first few minutes. Is it weird/wrong?

I have literally nothing interesting to say; I have the self-steem of a japanese guy in the middle of a BBC gangbang; I involuntarily avoid eye contact (specially if with a cute girl); When I'm talking with someone my voice is either too loud or too low; When I'm next to a guy I deem more attractive/extroverted than me I tend to shrink and try to leave as quickly as possible; Whenever I'm talking to a girl I'm overly obsessed with not looking/sounding creepy. If I'm at a bar and at the next table there is a girl who seems interested in me I don't do anything because I don't know how to approach her.  
God, I hate interacting with other people so much; But I need to do it now because I recently realised my teenage years are already behind me and I never had sex. I had a girlfriend before, but she was the one who approached me first (probably because she was desperate and knew I was easy prey). I'm not one of those guys with a checklist of every little thing a girl needs to have me attracted, I just want someone to hug, cuddle and fuck sometimes - but for that I have to fucking talk with people.
