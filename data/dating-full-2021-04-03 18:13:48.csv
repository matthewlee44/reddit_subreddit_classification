I'm 27m (due to be 28 next month) and I haven't had a girlfriend since I was 14.

After I broke up with my ex back then, I did make attempts at asking other girls out when I was at school but got rejected every single time. Got into college and I ended up keeping to myself, didn't approach any of the girls and I didn't have anyone taking an interest in me.

When it came to my 2nd and final year at College, I did notice one girl who happened to be the sister of a friend of mine. Added her on Facebook afterwards and chatted away with her for a while. Didn't see much of her when I was on the College Campus but on the rare occasions that I did, I was too terrified to approach and speak to her in person. When it came to the end of the year, I ended up popping her the question over chat and got rejected again.

That rejection finally hit the nail on the head on how much confidence I had actually lost since my last relationship broke down. At that time I was 18 and I pretty much gave up hope on ever finding another girlfriend and stopped looking all together.

Between then and now, I've had a brief stint in the army, worked a 2 year job with unsociable hours and I'm now currently in a daytime job with a wage that isn't enough to allow me to live comfortably on my own. I have an introverted personality, I can be shy around new people but perfectly fine when the ice is finally broken and I suffer from social anxiety. I have no social life after work and I have no social circles at all since all the friends I did have have nothing to do with me these days.

I'm not desperately seeking a relationship at the moment as I'm currently working towards getting a better paying job so that I can stand on my own two feet finally. On the other hand, I don't want to stay single forever but when it comes to dating and relationships, I was never good at it in the first place and I am worried that I won't be good enough for whoever I meet up with and that I will mess up again.

As much as I would like to be with someone again, I'm just not sure if I'm ready to put myself back out there after so long.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,695374,public,self,Considering putting myself back out there after a very long spell of being single.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mjefbz/considering_putting_myself_back_out_there_after_a/,all_ads,6,,,,,,

And yeah while I think he’s cute and I love him, I do have a typical type. 

I like guys that aren’t too tall, skinny, with softer features. Dark hair and eyes are nice. Being petite and a bit more fragile looking is really attractive to me in a man. I can’t stand body hair, particularly facial hair. It’s always been a huge turn off for me.

For women I actually like more masculine looks and the ethnicity doesn’t really matter. The stereotypical butch look if I had to sum it up is really beautiful in a woman to me.

So I like male physical traits that are found in a lot of places in certain parts of Asia and a lot of of my preferences aren’t really found in my area of my country overly often (USA). 

I also like more masculine women. I’m been told a few times that maybe because I lean towards women more that I tend to just prefer female looking features in men and gravitate towards races/ethnicity’s more likely to have them.

Asking this question ignores our current reality, that online dating has given people more options than ever before and the grass is greener on the other side mentality that is prevalent. But even more importantly that dating is actually NOT easy.

Some of these people in relationships got lucked out and found their one and only when they were younger, or by random fate. They did not go through the rigorous dating process of today and completely live in a bubble when it comes to how hard modern dating really is and finding someone long-term, where you have compatibility and chemistry. They don't understand how many swipes you have to go through to find one match that you align with or how many bad dates you have to go on to find one where things just flow naturally.

So please, for future, refrain from asking a single person this question. It doesn't make us feel better about ourselves as if we are a catch.

I'm getting back in the game after a couple of months single. My break-up sometimes still stings, but I'm doing pretty good. 

I matched with a guy a couple of days ago and we've been talking all day pretty much ever since. The conversations happen really naturally and I'm relaxed while talking to him. I think he is quite cute. Like, physically he is my type. But, the thing is... There's no flirting between us. I get this natural desire to talk to him and know about his day, but we don't really flirt... We just talk. I only assumed it is a date because we matched on a dating app, but maybe I'm mistaken? 

I'm a little worried. I think he could be a really nice guy to have fun with, we have a lot in common and as I said, I suddenly have this feeling or urge to talk to him. Like... It just feels natural and healthy. But the ground doesn't shake under my feet. I don't have butterflies. If I daydream about him (it's something that I always do, not in a ""I'm in love"" way, I guess it's just a habit and a product of my anxiety) I imagine myself having a really healthy relationship with him. But there's no passion. I can't really say if I'm sexually attracted to him or not, because I'm just getting to know him, but this feeling is new to me.

I believe there a certain critical questions one should ask right from jump, so that neither person wastes the other's time.

So during the date I asked the important stuff like ""What are you actually looking for? A relationship? Something casual? Friendship?"" I am looking for a serious relationship so this was key. I also asked whether or not children are part of his plan some day and gave a very vague non-response basically.

His response to the latter question was ""Yeah well, it depends on the woman"". So I asked what exactly does that mean, and he pretty cursorily said ""It depends really what the situation is like with the woman I'm with, whether or not I'd like to have kids"".

So it's not a straight forward yes or no.

Am I internalizing it too much by assuming he meant, he wouldn't want to have kids with me, in particular? I had this suspicion because we do come from different cultures and races. So perhaps he is not to big on the prospect of raising mixed kids?

Nevertheless, despite the fact that the date as a whole was quite lovely, I am inclined to ditch this guy because he also seemed to not be entirely sure whether or not he would like a serious relationship in general.

Please don't misunderstand me, these were general questions as it was a first date. I was not saying he *must* want to be in a relationship with me specifically. Just asking whether that is something he wants in general, same with children.

Thoughts? Do I let it go at this early point?

I have been dieting and working out so I lost around 10 pounds. I was feeling better about the way I look, feeling prettier.
But when we were in bed, he asked me how much weight I lost and started complaining because my ass was smaller now. He even made a joke about focusing my Chakra on losing fat all around my body except my ass. He made a few comments about it, not just one. And it actually made me feel bad, like less attractive for him when I was actually feeling prettier before seeing him.
I became very quiet and he asked what was wrong. So I told him he made me feel bad and that he shouldn't make comments about other people bodies if he gonna be implying they look worse than before. He said nothing in me is worse than before, but it still made me feel a little bad.
And I don't really know how to take this comment. Am I exaggerating? Maybe I'm not confident enough about my body and that's why I'm upset with him, but I don't know.
