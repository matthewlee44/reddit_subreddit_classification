Like on a Saturday when my daughter isn't around I can wake up and watch 3 games of English Premier League if I want. And eat whatever I want for breakfast. And I can watch films late at night or hop on Warzone until 3. And when the pandemic ends I can go out dancing again or to live music or shows. And get back to playing sports and going to watch sports. And travel of course too! 

My point is that while I miss some things (kissing and whatnot) and sometimes I feel a bit sad/worried that I'll be alone forever most of the time I love the freedom I have and can't imagine giving it up.

I'm sorry if you don't believe in 'types' and I know I am using stereotypes but for the sake of expediency..

Me (36F) and my partner (44M) have been dating since Sep 2020, exclusive since Dec 2020. When we are together things move mostly harmoniously, and we do all manner of things together.

I had been deluding myself that my partner was mostly secure. We had a deep conversation last night, and he finally revealed to me what the problem was. He says that he finds it very difficult to make long term commitments - would think very far ahead and try and control how things can turn out. He wants to be absolutely sure that things would work out before taking any next steps. He tends to return to his default state of being single as he is mostly happy with life this way and is afraid to change things. He gets scared when it feels like it is time to make a major decision and when we were getting more close and connecting more deeply, he panicked and pulled away.

More importantly - he told me that he did not yet feel a 'love spark'. He admitted his emotions were mostly grey.. and he's never fallen head over heels for anyone before. He had a similar period with his ex wife where he questioned whether what they had was enough - but once he got through that he claims he never looked back. He says he didn't know if it would take time with me or if it would ever come. He thinks that is why he \*sometimes\* feels less than 100% sure with me. He's tried looking within for answers - could it be that I am so different from all of his previous relationships (he's really never had many long term serious relationships in life) - but those that he had, were with  'girly girls', whereas he says i'm more of a tomboy. But he was upset at himself that this could be the case because he feels shallow. He also questioned whether this was on the flip side also the reason why he felt so comfortable and natural whenever he is with me. Like he can really be himself. He also said that it was rare for him to connect so deeply with someone and that he knows that I am special. By telling me all of his most honest thoughts, he's afraid he is destroying something good and that he may not be making the right decision now by doing so. I was the one who started the conversation yesterday that led to this revelation. 

Furthermore, he does not know if a love spark can grow with time - in his past he claims it always took time. And so he can't give me any promises and told me he knows it isn't fair to me to drag things out while he is figuring things out for himself. He wants to get married and have kids, but on the other hand, is afraid of making a wrong decision. He wondered whether this could be influenced also by his previous marriage.

(sorry in advance is this is rambling all over)

At start of pandemic I (48/m) met someone (41/f) online--we persevered through the not being able to see each other part of if, and as things loosened up we started getting together. And everything was awesome. No arguments, spending the night, seeing each others kids, etc.

As we progressed she had explained that she had recently gotten out of a 10 year relationship, most of that time they had lived together. Then she moved out, they dated a bit more, then that ended. Then, within a month or so, she met me-and because of the pandemic it was phone calls, video chats, etc. We couldn't really get together--so it didn't seem overly serious. At the same time, because of the pandemic there wasn't a lot of time for her to get out, see her friends, and all that kind of stuff.

We eventually, as restrictions loosened, did some of that as a couple--but it was also the first time she was getting to see many of her friends in months. We also spent a weekend away. Then, her ex saw pics of that weekend and contacted her and we had a slight tremor in our relationship, but quickly got back to where we were.

He texted and called her from time to time, and then finally, in late Feb this year, told him that she was 100% done with him, that she couldn't give him what he wanted.

However, instead of that launching us higher, it caused her to realize that with her previous relationship finally, 100% over, she was never really alone at all to deal with that. She essentially went from that relationship to already being serious with me. And she pulled back, saying she wasn't really sure what she wanted.

On some levels, I completely get that. Not that I want her to be single and ""out there"" but I get her realizing she never had time to herself. That said, we were happy. And to me, that's the point. But she ""needs space"".

This happened 3 months ago--in that time we have seen each other a few times. A lunch. Met up for a walk. But nothing physical beyond a hug, although there are clearly still feelings on both sides. We still text a lot, although obviously not as much. I have never pressured her to change her mind. And I have told her that I can't wait for her, but she knows, at least right now, that I still want to be with her.

I guess I just want to hear from others, especially women--does that make sense to you? That, even if you are crazy about someone, that you might need some time to decompress before starting anew, especially something serious?

And re: neediness, if I start texting too much, or pushing for a ""friendly lunch"", is my neediness just going to push her away?

As part of that I have let my friends know I'm open to dating and sought some advice.  And now I'm a bit disheartened.

I have always appreciated having female friends.  Women have given my perspective and insight I might not have gotten from male friends.  Naturally, through conversation, they helped me improve my communication and listening skills because they interact with me differently than my male friends.

I was already a bit sad when many of our friends became her friends after the separation and divorce.  

But now, some of the ladies I thought were my friends have expressed an interest in dating me.  The first one I thought I could just nicely say no and we could still be friends.  Didn't turn out that way.

Now another friend has texted me the, ""I love you"" text and a third has told me I should have been considering her all this time.

I don't want to hurt either of them or lose their friendship, but I'm not interested in them.  I just want to enjoy their friendship.  I love their personalities but I'm not attracted to them that way.

And it kind of sucks that maybe they only wanted to be my friends because of their interest in me?  And at least one of them didn't express any interest a few years back when I was very out of shape and less healthy.  That makes me wonder too, although in fairness to her I was still married then, so maybe that's just me overthinking it.

I have been going to see a physiotherapist once a fortnight for the last 3 months due to injury. She is a really good physiotherapist and goes out of her way to do beyond what is expected of her role (replying to emails at night/weekend, giving me exercise bands when others pay, able to find/fix my exact injury)

I've started building attraction for her but since medical professionals are not allowed to have a relationship outside of clinic (morals and code of conduct) I have decided to find another physiotherapist before my attraction grows anymore but I told her I was able to come in more frequently (once a week) just last week!

But even before that, I've always been pretty guarded.  I've never been someone that could easily show my interest or love for someone without worrying that I'm showing my hand too early, worrying what they think of me, worrying about getting hurt.  On top of that, I am just not an ""omg I love you so much"" kind of person.  I don't tell my family I love them much, the L word just isn't super easy for me to say.  I much prefer to show my love through my actions, and I'd be way quicker to dole out some playful sarcasm before I would gushy love stuff.

My last relationship was no exception.  We broke up for other reasons after a year, and I am not sure it would have helped....but, I do wonder if I had been less guarded, if it could have made us stronger, and maybe less susceptible to the reason we broke up.  Or at the very least, made our time together a little easier and more enjoyable, if I could have not been so guarded.  He questioned my feelings for him a lot....I think he knew I liked him and even loved him, but maybe wasn't sure it was on the same level as he had for me.  

So I'd really love for my next relationship to just be all in.  To not worry so much, not guard my heart so much.  If I want to text or call early on, even when I was the last to do so, I want to just do it.  I want to be able to make my feelings known, without being so scared to do so.  Basically I want to be able to do things based on whether or not I want to do them....not based on ""will I be coming on too strong, what if I like him more than he likes me"", etc.  Of course this is way easier said than done, but I'd love it if I could accomplish this.  I guarded my heart very heavily this last time, and I was still so devastated and hurt when we broke up.  So being guarded really doesn't help anything, and maybe even hurts because it makes me seem less invested and not as into someone as I am.

My question is, has anyone successfully done this in a relationship, when they've been very guarded in the past.  How did you do it?

When the real teacher calls off, I would fill in. Everyone had a sub before.

When the kids were distanced learning, they brought back small groups of failing kids in ""cohorts."" A cohort is a class of 15 kids, and I had one for 6 months. I saw them every school day, and my job was to get them caught up for they pass. I was with the same group of 9th graders everyday.

I am now ""teaching"" summer school math. My district uses long term subs to teach summer school.

I am now in the credential program at Cal State which is 2 semesters long. First one is classes and the 2nd one is your internship. I am currently living at home with parents while I knock this out.

So here's the problem. For some reason my job appears to be a turn off for women. I don't really know why, but it is.

If I say:

1) I'm a substitute teacher. It's not really fair to me because I do SO much more than just sub.

2) If I say I'm a real teacher, I would be lying through my teeth since I don't have a credential.

3) If I list all of my job duties in detail, it just screams with insecurity / omission.

I used to give this 3 minute speech of ""I'm not a real teacher, but I'm a teacher."" Doing so never led to a 2nd date.

I don't really know how to word this at all. One girl I went out with, I just told her what I did, and she assumed I was a teacher nestled in a career when I'm not. When I later clarified, it painted me with ""ick.""

To provide some context and summarize, I decided to end my long-term marriage due to verbal and emotional abuse. I have a huge crush on a guy, who is divorced and has no SO. I'm currently suffering from depression and I have suicidal thoughts, unrelated to the crush. 

The guy gave me ""mixed signals"", told me lots of  very personal stuff and asked me about the end of my marriage, and wanted to know if I had an SO. I have him a small present in return for a favor (we're neighbors) and he was very pleased. But he didn't give me his number or ask for mine, neither did he ask me out, even when he got the opportunity. He said he had terrible experiences practically all along his life (being ill-treated and humiliated by spouse &amp; later SO), he's ok by himself but sometimes he'd like to have ""somebody who loves him"".

I don't love him or anything, I just have a big big big crush on him. I want to get to know him better, little by little. I'd like to ask him out (he's been asked out before and then ghosted!), so I assume he's comfortable with women asking him out. I'm not, but well... 

I'm depressed and the last thing I need at this moment is  rejection. But if I don't ask him out, may I miss my chance? 

Is it possible that he's into me but just scared of failure/rejection, or he's just some idiot who says random things to ladies? 

I'm 39, he's 50.

Normally I wouldn’t date someone in this situation, but he was very intelligent, well-read, and we were into the same music and type of art.  As we continued talking, he seemed a little self absorbed but I dismissed it.  

Our relationship has ended as of three weeks ago.  Think I may have been dealing with a narc.  At the very least, I believe I was being gaslighted.  Here are few of the last texts I received:

“I know I go on and on about how my time is meaningless but this stretches the limits of even that assertion. Give me a fucking break already.
What the fuck fucking ever. Seriously, fuck this shit. If this is what it means to you why the fuck am I getting on a fucking bus in the first place” (side note - he has no car).

“You still don’t understand, do you. I work on the opposite side of the planet. Notice how I keep falling asleep when I come over to visit? That’s how I pay my rent. That’s how I eat. Any time I come to see you while you’re awake, it’s the equivalent of you staying up until three in the morning to sit around and chat with me. What about this still does not compute with you”

“You’re still not getting it.  And ultimately, I guess it doesn’t matter. I don’t know why I’m doing this. I made sacrifices to see you. To show you that it meant something to me. And you took them for granted. Good luck with that.”

This was over him coming to see me on Memorial Day.  He asked what time he should come over and I said 2.  I kept apologizing to him because he accused me of not valuing his time…

We are both single parents, I have every other weekend off from my kids, while she just about laways has her 13.y.o. daugther at home. The issue is, since mid-May I have not seen this woman. As Memorial Day weekend approached, I invited her to go with me on a date, as I had a kid-free weekend. Her initial answer was kind of wishy-wash, she'd have to get back to me. After two days,  she eventually texted me. During the exchange, I had to follow up on what was her final answer, and she declined. The reason was kind of weak, but not far-fetched. I did come realize I had been initiating the contact and the dates in the recent weeks, plus she seemed to have started to pull-away. Having realized this, my response to the decline was,""OK, you let me know the next time you'd like to get together."" To this she said,""OK"". 

It is now almost end of June, and it still hasn't happened. 

Don't get me wrong: I have not waited around. I've been connecting with various women from Match and eHarmony, been on dates with a couple that are heading toward 2nd dates, and have done my best to keep busy and not let her be too much of my focus. I've consciously cut back messaging. When she's contacted me, it's mostly pleasantries and jokes. She's reached out for support on some things, has asked me how my  son played in his baseball games, and we still send flirty/raunchy humor messages to each other. On Monday, I finally caved and asked her out for this Saturday night. I just felt the time had come to see whether this should continue, see if the in-person chemistry is still there. Her answer was ""Saturday is a possibility"". After that reply from her, I didn't bother responding. Well, she hit me up tonight, asked me how things were going, and I eventually cut the exchange short as I wanted to see if she'd bring up Saturday. She didn't. I do not plan on asking a follow up this time around. She's not airheaded, she knows the invite is out there.

All the dating coaches I follow say as the male, it's not the best idea to be the one to propose the ""What are we?"" conversation, and I can tell you as someone who's put himself in the lower hand of a relationship, I see their point. However,  I do have a genuine affection towards this woman as she has essentially become a close friend during this time we've been in each other's lives. She did tell me a few days ago she took a personality test and was disturbed it came up as Logican INTP-A, so her awkwardness and lack of initiating dates does make some sense to me now. Still, I don't want to be just friends, and I just can't have her in the back of my mind, to be fair to myself and any woman I start to date. 

At this point, because of the length of time we've been at this, I think it doesn't matter if a conversation about ""us"" happens. Maybe it's just a conversation where I lay out my boundaries or my expectations.

I’m moving to a new city soon where I don’t know anyone, so put a post on a local social media group to ask whats to do, how to meet new people etc… (at this stage, dating hadn’t really crossed my mind).

A girl reached out to me, said we could meet up for dog walks and that she’d happily show me round and introduce me to a few people, which sounded great. From day one we were messaging a lot and seemed to click straightaway. I arranged to meet up with her a few days later for a stroll but again, nothing about a romantic interest was mentioned at this stage. However, when I got home she’d posted on her stories that she was heading out on a date! 

We got on great, she made me laugh, she was very open and we shared a lot of common interests. We met up again a few days later and spent the day together; we had a walk around the town, had a bit of lunch together and generally got on brilliantly. 

The messages definitely ramped up a bit after that and we were starting to express an interest in one another and were planning what we could do next and what other things we could look to do in the future. I explained to her that I felt a bit nervous as I wasn’t expecting to meet someone so soon.

We then met for the third and from the start it was clear of her intentions. She made a point of kissing me on the lips when we greeted eachother and was very tactile - lots of touches, leaning into me etc… We went back to her house and had a great talk and she really opened up about past relationships, her fears, hopes and said it was refreshing to be seeing someone kind and that she already felt safe around me. We ended the night with a kiss.

We kept chatting every day and one particular day she was hit with a migraine, so I sent her a little bunch of flowers to cheer her up.

Our forth meet was very different. As soon as she opened her door to me, I could tell she was different from her body language. She told me she felt nervous, but didnt know why. We went for lunch, spent some time at hers and then parted. There was no tactile touching and her body language was quite closed, but again, ending the date with a kiss. Since then, theres been a big shift. Her messages have dropped off, the tone has changed and they’re generally quite closed. Because of this, I’ve been holding back as, even though im new to this, im not an idiot. We are due to meet again this weekend, but nothings been set in stone yet. 

So, am I just overthinking this, or has it fizzled out already? I’d like to discuss it with her, but don’t want to come across as needy. I don’t enjoy how the uncertainty is making me feel, but can’t figure out whats caused the change. Maybe I’m naive, but its confusing how we can go from her sending lovely “I wish you were here” “I’m looking forward to lots of adventures with you” “I really do fancy you” messages to this in the space of a week.

If this is dating in your 40’s, then I think I'll remain single.

I am 42 f with a five-year-old and he is 45 with two kids 16 and 12. 
As you know it's hard to date with kids involved and he lives about 40 minutes away from me. We work different shifts and we try to see each other 1 a week and usually no intimacy maybe once a month.  We started dating about 7 months ago and I have yet to meet any of his friends (who are friends with his ex of 3 years that he has not mentioned to me, I seen it on social media ""pictures"") or any family. I have met his children and they are awesome. I have to tell you though this guy has a serious problem with his phone. He wears a smartwatch too. He always gets ""notifications"" and I have asked him on more than one occasion if we are exclusive. He told me we established this when we first started dating. 
He has paid for a vacation for all of us recently and a few times I woke up during the vacation and he's on the couch fully clothed sleeping with his phone that was going crazy with ""notifications"" all day. We are friends on social media but he isn't active on it and he has so many posts from his ex of 3 years before we were together on his feed. 
I don't know what to think, I have tried talking on the phone with him about ""us"" and meeting his friends and the only answer I received was "" I feel like your attacking me"" so it's like I can't even voice my feelings and wonder where this is going. I feel like I should dump him because I don't want to get my daughter to get attached to him and I don't want to get closer to his kids because that's not fair to anyone. Being single for 5 years puts you in a place where you can be none negotiable with feelings, used to being by yourself, only what's best for you and your kid. Does anyone catch my drift?

After my last relationship failed and I realized that I was very comfortable being uncomfortable with a partner, I saw that it was time to do some digging into the depths of my psyche and belief system.

Over the past few weeks it's been glaringly obvious that I had been denying to myself what I truly wanted because I've felt like I didn't deserve it, or that what I want doesn't exist FOR ME.

Well, fuck it- this is what I really, deeply want.

I want a long term commitment with a loving partner who is also excited about having both me and my son in his life. I want to build a life w/someone.  Maybe we marry, maybe we don't, but the commitment to one another is there.  Ideally he's probably a father too, but it's not essential, but he has to want to be present in a child's life (again, this is LONG TERM, so I'm gonna take my time with integrating the kid). I want to have more good days than bad, I want a partner who can offer empathy, a partner that I can laugh with, one who can express affirmative/loving feelings toward me and others, one who can have mature conversations about difficult matters, and isn't going to gaslight/stonewall/deny facts/lie/turn the story around on me every time there is conflict (sadly this was a normative thing in my past 2 relationships). I want a guy who doesn't run when things  get hard or just shift blame onto me so we can never actually overcome a relationship challenge.

Here were all the excuses I have been making to deny what I really want:

* I'm divorced, why would I ever risk being that close/dedicated to someone again knowing how hurt I could get
* Nobody will want me AND my son (even though I have many examples of people in my life who found love and the person love their kids too)
* After the death of my sister and best friend w/in 2 years (both were under 40) after my divorce, I was scared to love, because love = loss
* Old childhood programming  had me believing that long term commitments meant sacrificing what I really needed to keep the relationship together. Happy relationships were for OTHER people, not for me
* What if it fails and then I'm hurt again  but now much older and my son is hurt again? The son part definitely has me planning to move SLOWLY with someone
* My role in a relationship has been to just accept what my partner throws my way, to ask the universe for a great love is selfish.
* I simply don't deserve it. Who am I to get my heart's desires fulfilled? 

Well I say bullshit to all my excuses.  
This is what I want and I felt some need to share it with you all as a way to own it and state it out loud, so to speak.

It sound silly, but it's a big deal to me to claim what I want and accept it within myself.  I think I'll have a lot better chance at attracting in without all the layers of BS and fear that I'd been covering it up with.

I can't remember how long it's been since I felt this comfortable with someone. It's very rare that I can connect with someone like this. Every time we kiss I feel enamoured.

At this stage, I have no expectations. I know I'm romanticising things as things are still new and we're both trying to be on our best behaviour.

I can say with 100% clarity that not one of those people would have worked out. I spent my life thinking when it’s “the one” (the fabled one from story books - like my parents, my sibling and wife, others I know) that you just “know.” The only epiphanies I’ve had are the moments when I realize there is no gd way it will work. 

People ask me and my family members with concern about why I’m not married - am I not lonely (sometimes), don’t I want kids (if it happens it happens), who will take care of me (I suppose the state if it came to that?), don’t I want to be married (yes without a doubt but not just to be married). 

But I think it would be impossible at this point to find anyone I could pass for “the one.” It’s like I know too much now. I probably could have gotten away with it at 25, and ok maybe if I were love bombed and drunk today, but given a moment of thought I don’t think it would make sense. 

I think if I weigh the positives of good times in relationships against the negatives when things go south, that it doesn’t even equal out to 0, it’s a net loss. I do appreciate some memories but in general I look back and wonder what I was thinking. I feel like it’s likely I’m not compatible with anyone, like another post said if you are dating for 30 years how could you have just not settled down by now. Or like in some movie they said - at some point you just need to pick someone. I don’t think that can happen for me because I’m too concerned about the outcome. I know I will never have a fairytale wedding with a big white dress and being something i looked very forward to my whole life, that is a bummer. But I was never comfortable being the center of attention so maybe it’s for the best. Maybe I don’t really even want a relationship but have been conditioned to feel like I do. Anyone else considering the need for relationships at our stage in life?

My problem is trying to sort out what people mean. I am finding that many people who put relationship down aren’t necessarily thinking that way. I just saw a person for a few very casual dates and he talked about how I turned him on but when I said sex is awesome especially as you get to know each other he said no thanks (even though he had said a relationship is his goal and he talked to me about family and past relationships and outdoor activities that we could do together). So it seemed like he was really only down to have sex with me.

What should I be looking for on a dating profile or when I first meet so that I can tell that sex isn’t the only thing they are interested in? I am a 51 year old female who loves sex but want it as part of a relationship (or at least dating that involves other things than just sex). I feel like a fish out of water trying to figure this out.

My own profile is pretty clear about looking for a relationship and my own values. I don’t swipe on those who mention hook ups or nothing serious. What else can I do to screen out those who are just looking to have sex and move on? *I understand that many people want this but it’s just not for me.

Movies, TV, fairy tales, etc have been feeding us a line of bullshit about the “spark” or the “connection” that’ll tell you when you’ve found the one.  It’s already led to people being a bit too selective in finding a romantic partner.  That’s not necessarily a bad thing if it’s just turning down the dealbreakers, but combined with swipe culture making one believe that someone better might be just a swipe away, I think it’s led to a rise in depression and loneliness in modern society.

We find ourselves in positions where we meet people who check all the boxes, like the same things, and generally would be good matches, and then metaphorically (or literally) swipe left because we don’t feel this thing that Hollywood says should be there.  I know I’m guilty of it myself.  I’ve fallen prey to the grass being greener elsewhere mindset more times than I can count.

We met through some mutual friends/ acquaintances, and after some conversations, we decided to go on a date last weekend.   


We've pretty much hung out or talked on the phone every day this week when we couldn't get together due to parenting schedules. We've had some deep conversations about relationships and life in general that I wouldn't typically have with people I date. We text all day long, and when we're with one another, the rest of the world doesn't exist ( her words, not mine). It's also rare for me to have so much in common with someone. While it's only a week, we both agree that we connect at a level that we both haven't associated with a budding romantic relationship. 

&amp;#x200B;

Last night when we were cuddling, she dropped a bomb on me. She's been in a long-distance relationship for about 4 months. I sort of sense that this was the case when she said she doesn't date multiple people early in our conversations. 

&amp;#x200B;

Usually, I'd be cool with the situation since we just started seeing each other. Then, I found they're meeting up next week, and now I'm conflicted. I realize this trip was planned before we even met, but I also can't help but feel a little disappointed at its timing. 

&amp;#x200B;

After asking some clarifying questions, she expressed that she doesn't feel like her LDR will be permanent. Mainly because they both are geographically constrained by custody orders and co-parenting situations. She also told me that she feels genuinely conflicted about the situation and knows she'll have to make a choice at some point. 

&amp;#x200B;

I certainly don't envy her position. While she's expressed that she sees a possible future between us she feels like she knows the other guy better. 

&amp;#x200B;

We have a few more dates planned before she leaves and I'm starting to get a little insecure about her going away.  I was cheated on early in some relationship in my 20's and I think that that impacts some of the insecurities that I'm having about this situation.

My story: separated in February 2020. Started OLD immediately. Me and my ex had been living our own lives for years by that time, I left specifically because I did not want to go looking something new while living together.

In total, went on 6 first dates over 4 months (I only had time for dating every other weekend (work + 50% kids) + California lockdowns). Had multiple dates with 2 women before meeting my GF (I never date several women at the same time).

Enjoyed meeting all those people. No horror stories. Was never disappointed with appearance (e.g. profile photos were true), they were interesting to spend time with. Don't know if I had been their first date horror story...

Biggest annoyance with OLD was how time consuming it was. I was trying to limit time I spent swiping and messaging (e.g. I would talk only with 5 women at a time, go back to swiping only after a conversation dies off).

During messaging I was mostly trying to filter out bored women who were there just to chat - willing to be entertained. I pushed very directly for an in-person meeting.

I was swiping in range 37-44 (being 40 myself at the time). Going through the divorce + having two kids 50% I did not think I would be able to move the relationship fast.

I had feelings of anger after going through my first and only fwb phase.

We both work in an isolated, rural area, but in a different departments of the hospital. I had a crush on him, and when he kissed me for the first time, he was so soft and so delicious... you know that kiss that's just perfect? His lips, tongue...body perfume. It was just wow! We have many things in common. He's inteligent, interesting, a bit sarcastic but also very kind, has so much sex appeal, hidden tats i was pleasantly surprised to discover, a bit dominant (unfortunately i learned later on was due to lots and lots of porn he was watching).  The more i continued seeing him the angrier i became and fought with him often. I was angry with me for letting someone use me as a piece of meat (because he wouldn't want to stay the night and cuddle, would text out of the blue wanting me to send him pictures of my private parts, or would spontaneously want to come over in 30 minutes for sex and then leave, super careful not to be recognized by anyone, asking me over and over to keep this between us). I became angrier and angrier for realizing that I'm letting him do all that because i was so lonely...the sex wasn't that great, he'd come really fast and not really trying to make me come. I then became angry with him because he would call me all the time and not taking no for an answer (after blocking his number and telling him i just can't do it) I really couldn't resist him...his voice.
