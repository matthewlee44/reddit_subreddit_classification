we start talking again, things are okay, we’re planning on being friends for the time being. We get to talking and reminiscing about funny old memories, it’s going really well. And then, she’s on her bed and says “you can come sit closer yknow…”

My heart stops and I’m so confused, for months she’s been keeping me blocked and at this strict level of contact. I’m instantly like turned on and emotional, but I just sat down and asked her straight up, “Are you sure?” And “Do you think this is a good idea, I just don’t want to us get hurt.”

And she says, direct quote, “I don’t think so, but if your asking, I’m not using you haha”
Just like that. With that adorable laugh at the end. I just dove on top of her. We’re getting into it and like 10-15 minutes, in the middle of being naked, I’m about to vomit. I get up and it’s like music and throw up noises.

And she’s being so caring, like bringing me stuff, turning on her mom voice to make sure I’m okay, helps clean me up and cuddles with me it’s just impossible not to feel loved at this point alone.

And then she fucks the absolute shit out of me, like I rarely see this side of her, it was like it was her first time again, I was so turned on but I was so happy. I told her I love her and she said it back…

I drop her off at work, we avoid her friends bc she talks with them a lot about me.

And then we go to hang out again, shit starts going sour because I can tell something is wrong. She got angry and said she thinks it was a mistake, and that she was just confused. But that thing she said about using me just echoed in my head, and I was wondering what made her change her mind..

And now I’m blocked. I was gonna ask for advice, but no one says anything except “just break up” as if they’ve had anything close to what we’ve had and been through. I just wish I could go in a time machine and see if this is all worth it or I’m just gonna be her ‘high school boyfriend’ for the remainder of her life..

Context: Had a 3 year long relationship end about 2-3 months ago. It never like officially ended other than like the empty break-up threats. She dumped me tho and moved into her own place 4 minutes away. We’ve argued a lot, but it was more the frequency rather than the subject. We were such a great team in that way… shit has been stressful since we were homeless in high school, 3 years ago.

I’m like tf we could’ve went to longhorn or something. Lol. However, the food was underwhelming for the price. He agreed. The salad was bomb though, and the setting made up for it. He paid for the whole thing! But anywho, he was super sweet and never ran out of ammo for a conversation! Complimented me a lot telling me how beautiful I was. We talked about life and goals. He’s a pretty chilled dude. He seems like a guy who cares you know. He explained to me how his long time girlfriend/ex of 4 years cheated and had a baby with another dude. Noting ever since it’s been hard for him to date. You can really see the hurt in his eyes. But I feel like the date went well. He held doors for me and made sure I was always in front of him never the side. Telling me to text him when I get home after after he dropped me off.

But this one girl wanted to ask me the truth and dare question.I joked for a bit and almost reached the entrance of the class.
She pulled my bag and after some scuffle we were in the hallway and she told me to go for truth.
I didn't do a dare as these girls would give me something crazy to do so I thought truth would be better.
The girl later asked me who I had a crush on in the class .I paused for a few seconds and told that I had a crush on her .
She just smiled and was in disbelief. 
She is my classmate and I have hanged out with her a few times and I consider her a friend.
She didn't know what to say and I was just looking at the other 2 girls and my buddy was beside me .
After a few seconds I looked at the girl again and she repeated the same question.Who do u like ?
I tried to remain calm took a breath and didn't laugh 😅 and looked her right in the eye and told her I like her.
She again started smiling and was speechless .
Her friend told her to not cry  😂 and I was just waiting for her to say something.i faced my friend and told him that she didn't like the answer.I told them that if they want to play truth and dare this is what happens .
There is no doubt in my mind that the girl thought I was joking .I was really straightforward and just told it from my heart ❤. I didn't care much and the girl told that enough of all this ,let's go home .We started walking downstairs and we said our goodbyes .The two girls went to the bathroom and we were just chilling near the canteen. They came back after 10minutes and then I looed at her walking from the hallway gave her a glance and knew she was not comfortable after what happened .I told my friends let's roll and we left the campus. Neither me not he mentioned what happend .
I was looking back to see if the girls caught up with us as they were just a few meters behind us but I couldn't see them .
I made the girl uncomfortable but if the truth made her feel awkward 😅 I don't give a f**k.
I wanna be good friends with her .
I don't wanna make things weird .
I haven't messaged her yet ,but I know she will try to talk about it .




I still didn't understand why she couldn't reply something. I mean anything would do .
But she just stood there and was smiling and when I told her that I like her, her friend told her that she knew that I liked her.



I didn't make a move earlier on this girl cause she was more than friends with this 3rd year degree guy.
I n her are in 1st year .

I've decided to ask a question on here to get some insight from other people. 

To make long story short: I met a guy at the beginning of August. I was in a club and noticed someone looking at me. You could see that the moment he saw he was crazy about me. He approached me, he was very much into me. We chatted, we danced, we spent the morning looking at the sunrise. We kissed (nothing else sexual happened). The connection and chemistry was strong. Unfortunately, he lives in another country (we're both from Europe, though). He asked for my contact and followed me on Instagram. For the next three weeks, he contacted me every day, he said how special I was to him, and basically: how crazy he is about me. Every single day he contacted me asking how I was. He asked me to come and visit him, or that he would come later in the year to see me again.

In the week four, he was still contacting me but not every day. I could see he was busy as his friend came to visit him so I didn't think much about it and understood it... After that he slowly stopped writing to me, so when after 1,5 of not messaging me, he asked how I was I replied saying why he's interested if he basically ghosted me for over one week now. He apologised, said he had work, and friends visiting him. I replied saying that I feel like he doesn't care about me anymore and that it shouldn't surprise me since he knew me only for a few hours... he replied saying I seemed very special to him and he still thinks the same thing,that nothing has changed, and that he's aware it was only a few hours but ""what hours they were"". I replied saying the whole situation between us is upsetting me. He said that the problem is the distance between us and if we lived closer we would be together, he also added that he fell in love the moment he saw me, and if he saw me again, he would fall in love again, and ended saying that everything is very difficult. Maybe I misunderstood it, but it sounded like a goodbye to me? So I said that I don't think it's that difficult but if he thinks so... and added that his message is giving me mixed feelings and sounds like a goodbye? Also said that if he thinks it's difficult and not much can be done, then let's break it off now and save ourselves from unnecessary heartbreak later on. And that I'd prefer to laugh and joke around something else with him but I took him seriously. I ended saying that regardless of everything I'm in a good mood tonight and not to worry about me.

He didn't reply. Instead he posted a story from some walk in the mountains + a very sad song about social distance with the person you care about.

And... he deactivated his Instagram !!! He's gone. At first I thought that maybe he blocked me, but no - he just disabled his Insta (I checked it).

Did I break him so much? Did I fuck it up?

So after leaving my boyfriend’s house on Wednesday evening (details in my previous post), I have not received any communication from him. For the first one, even two days I wasn’t particularly concerned; it has occurred before. But it crept around to three days and I sent him a pic of a pretty rainbow yesterday that came on the sky, he responded not too long afterwards saying “Oh beautiful. How are you?😊” That was yesterday at 6:14pm. I waited a little and responded that I’m okay, my dad came out of surgery, etc., and here’s what’s happened:

HE NEVER RESPONDED.

It’s been yet another 24 hours past now, it’s 6:42pm. I haven’t heard anything from him, and he’s online a lot today too. One strange thing, yesterday night from about 8pm he was offline, and wasn’t online til this morning. STILL didn’t message me today. This is something I’ve never even dreamed before in my worst dreams. So, I’ve messaged him asking if he’s alright, and if anything’s wrong I’d love to talk about it. I’ve sent that about almost an hour ago. He came online once since then. Still not even going on the message.

I’m super super scared. I just want to get through to him somehow, understand what’s happening. Why can’t he send me a line in 5 minutes &amp;this has never happened before! 
I’m going to call him in a little while but I am now clueless what to do. And if he doesn’t pick up...

We were doing some shopping and the car passed by the local courts. She just casually mentioned that she actually has an ongoing assault case which started in 2019 due to a spat between her siblings and neighbors, Being familiar with these trials, I asked about some details and found out that a neighbor and her sister were engaged in some altercation, and she retaliated by hitting the neighbor with a piece of wood.

At this point I was genuinely worried because my girlfriend just finished high school and has absolutely no knowledge with the law. She assured me that she's confident the case against her is going to be dismissed since there's no concrete evidence of injury. However having worked in a law office before, I know for a fact that District Attorneys don't elevate cases to Courts without substantial evidence and I fear she may have inadvertently admitted to something early on.

Having been the subject of criminal charges myself (how false they may be), I know the stress of undergoing trial. No matter how confident you are, no matter how many ""friends"" are ""helping you out"", the possibility of conviction, however minute, bothers you into your sleep. I suffered anxiety attacks for months due to my criminal complaint and mind you, I was already in a better position than her since my friends at the DA's office were also helping me out.

She must have her reasons why she didn't tell me about this all these time, but I just feel guilty that I didn't tell her about my previous work at a law firm. I just never thought it was relevant to disclose it. Had I disclosed it early on, maybe she would have told me about the case while it was at the DA's office. Maybe I could have helped her out, or hired an attorney for her. Had she told me, I'm fairly certain I could have gotten it dismissed even at the D.A. level. Instead she had to go through unfamiliar and dangerous territory on her own.

Before this he was very into the relationship. Wondering if I got love bombed?

When we first started dating he was very into me, would take me on fun dates, would talk about the future after only knowing me for a month. He asked me to be his gf after only 5-6 weeks of knowing each other which felt a bit fast for me but things were going great. He had an elaborate gesture with a big meal and a little custom menu, champagne, etc… 

For the last month I was very overwhelmed with my job (doctor). He told me I wasn’t myself and I confided in him that I was burnt out and overwhelmed. He said he understood but he kept talking about “month 1-2 me” being way more bubbly and fun than “month 3 me” and that he didn’t want to be with someone who’s miserable. I asked him to wait 3 weeks til my deadline was over and I was in a better place mentally and he agreed

For the last week I’ve been feeling like myself again and felt great about things. In person he was loving, affectionate and attentive, but then when we were apart the effort felt minimal compared to how intense he was before. I had a gut feeling and called him to ask if he was okay. He was quite ruthless - said he felt nothing for me, no sparks, doesn’t care about spending time or making effort, is ready to go home within an hour of coming over. He was frustrated he felt this way but said there’s no going back once the feelings are gone.

I have a hard time accepting someone went from super into me and going above and beyond to being that savage during a phone breakup. Is that love bombing? I appreciate the dating took a hit for a few weeks and I wasn’t my best self when I was struggling (I was more irritable, tired, complained about work) so I feel responsible for turning him off of the relationship. 

TLDR: 4 months of dating went from over the top gestures and affection, then pulled away when I was struggling with residency burnout.

I tried to keep it as short as possible &amp; not digress, so some details have been omitted, but I will be happy answer any questions with more details in the comments.

(1) My bf have known each other for a few years, but we were only friends even though we always had a special connection with each other-- we both dated other people during this time. One day, I get invited to his new Discord server and we play games together with his friends. One of his friends (19F) I notice, is very forward and openly had a crush on him. He (25M) does not reciprocate the same energy, but he also does not shut her down-- kind of just a 'polite' response. One day, I get upset about his flaky behaviour and feels as if he does not appreciate our friendship and I choose to leave. What's odd is that the first thing that comes out of his mouth is ""Listen, it's not what it looks like"" and ""She will *never* be you,"" keep in mind we were just friends and since we've both dated others, I was not bothered about her behaviour towards him-- I was upset at his behaviour which was completely unrelated. I have also never mentioned anything about her at this time so I find it odd that was the first thing he said.

(2) I left and our friendship distances once again until we reconnect a few months later-- once again as friends. Our friendship eventually progresses to become a relationship and I notice his friend (19F) becomes more and more agitated and starts acting out by relentlessly leaving and rejoining the server-- she will sporadically join/leaves for hours, days, weeks, and months. Our friendgroup believes that she does that for attention as she wants to be reconciled and invited back, but since she's done it twenty times in the past, nobody really cares to do anything anymore. She's never snide to me, but there's always been this passive-aggressive hostility. For example, if she's in a voicechat with our friendgroup and I join, she'll leave minutes later. She makes her discomfort clear around me and my bf has never done anything to address it.

(3) I also notice that he cuts *a lot* of slack for her. She start drama from scratch (she didn't take an opportunity, so it's not petty) she quite literally orchestrated every percent of it, but only gets Admin taken away as the main perpetrator while another guy who participated got banned. But she leaves on her own anyways. And she returns a few months later (4 months into our relationship), doing her join/leave ritual . I would also like to mention that when she joins, she usually checks for hostility and since people don't seem to care, she start re-adding people again, but as soon as she leaves, she'll unfriend them.

(4) During this time, he has mentioned a few times how annoying and stupid she is and how she must have a miserable life to start drama and join/leave as entertainment for her life. I've also made a joke that she was his ex and he got extremely assertive and defensive saying how that was ridiculous and implying that she was just a pathetic person who was thirsty for him and that it would be insulting to even think that they were 'together'. On another occasion he brought up her weight, saying that she is ""huge"" and how he found that ""disgusting"". Despite all this I have asked him while she is still in his server due to the fact that she's started drama twice, keeps leaving and joining, and nobody minds but also doesn't care about her presence. I just didn't see any positives nor did he ever make anything seem positive. He gets aggressive and asks ""What do you want me to do? Tell me. You want me to be the asshole that bans her from playing with her friends because she made a mistake? Just because someone made a mistake doesn't make them a bad person.""

(5) The last 2 times she joined, I notice my bf (25M) and her (19F) are friends again (we are at 7 months into our relationship). This means that she has joined, friended, left, unfriended, my bf twice. I'm confused as to why they have to be friends as it does not further enable anything as they can message each other w/o being friends on discord. It bothered me because I see it as a symbol of reconciliation. But then she leaves again.

(6) At this point, my bf are at a disagreement that stemmed from something so small and he wants to breakup because we have had 2 really bad arguments (over a span of 9 months) that started from very small things. He claims that us being in a relationship together is insanity as the cycle just continues. I told him that since we were friends for a while but have progressed to dating, I think we are in too deep to go back to being just friends. I have told him this before we started dating, I did not spring it on him suddenly. This means that if we break-up, him and I will be strangers as I move on with my life. I'm not going to be best friends with my ex. He tells me ""Do what you want"" and that he doesn't care what I do; if I stay we'll be cool and friends, but if I go, then it's on me.

(7) I know that he was under a lot of stress in his life and I figure that he is just desperate to take anything off his plate and just feeding into his emotions, so I tell him this: ""I know you're under a lot of stress right now so I'll let you cool off. I'm going to give you space, so I'm not going to reach out to you, but I'll be here if you want to talk or just update me on your life.""

(8) He leaves my message on read and the net day, I notice he and the girl (19F) are friends again. A few hours later, she's back in the server. This is backwards as 95% of the time, she joins for a few days before adding people again. I'm 90% sure that this time, he reached out to her and invited her back to the server. I have since then not talked to him, opened his texts, or picked up his call.

(9) I later find out that they dated \[between the time I left for his flaky behaviour and came back, about 4 months\] even though he strongly denied it. And that he texted paragraphs to her number apologizing for hurting her and that he didn't want her to be upset at him 'especially since she was a big part of his life'.

What does this mean? What is he doing? Could someone please interpret what he might be feeling?

I made us some tea, we ate some sweets, cuddled a lot and took our time.

And that got me thinking: What would you want your first night at your boyfriend's to be like? Is it most important for you to feel safe? To have a romantic time together? Or what do you think is most important? Feel free to also speak from experience if you want to share yours.

We would drift on and off but he would always try to text me throughout the years.

He texted me after not texting me in a few years. He would text me good morning, compliment me, and ask me how my day was. A few months later, we met up. He came to visit my state and see his friend and we figured we’d meet up. We went out to dinner. I didn’t expect them to be dates but he paid for the dinner and he kissed me towards the end. We then went on another date and went for a walk. He was dancing with me and we started to open up. He then drove back to his state to go back home. 

After the dates, he would always invite me to see him but due to Covid (this is when it first started), I didn’t feel comfortable. I was terrified. He said he understood but would continue to invite me. I would say I would go but then don’t follow through with the plans because of my fear. 

He then drops the news that he’s moving to a state that is further away. I immediately thought there is no way this is going to work. But he continues to invite me. 

Someone in his family passed away and he goes back to my state for the services. He invited me to go to one of the services he also invited me to meet his friends and family. Also invited me to Thanksgiving. But again, I said no because of Covid. I felt so guilty. He said he understood and said he would make me feel comfortable during my stay. He said he could treat me good and appreciate me. He also mentioned that he hasn’t found the one, but has liked me for a really long time.

Eventually we went out separate ways (don’t blame him) and he got a girlfriend. They only lasted a couple of months (super curious as to why they broke up). After a few months of breaking up, he reached out to me again. Now we are talking again and he mentioned that he’s coming back up to my state and would like to meet. I asked him if he’s looking for a hook up or is genuinely interested in me and he said that he’s genuinely interested in me but likes hooking up…whatever that means lol. After I brought that up, he didn’t speak too much to me today. But I could be overthinking.

I’ve been serious with one for almost two years without making her exclusively my girlfriend. I’m not really attracted to her like I used to be. After moving to a different state, she occasionally comes to see on my days off. 

Sadly enough, I am also talking to one of the most beautiful girls i’ve been with in awhile and I think things may get serious. I’m introverted and enjoy my space so I think this is why she likes me. We had sex and I couldn’t stop laughing when I was alone, because I thought about this one thing. 

How is it that when I had an Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat, and Facebook, I couldn’t deeply connect with girls. It was superficial and never amounted to anything. I’m 22 now and last week made my 11th “experience” with someone I still can’t believe likes me. We are laying in bed and I thought, “Wow, I am practically seeing two women and I don’t even exist on the internet.” 

They both know I have a YouTube channel, but I don’t want anyone to really know so I never tell girls I’m seeing. The new girl told me that not having social media makes me different and mysterious. Ironically, the girl I am no longer attracted to met me when I still didn’t have any social media. It’s like women go crazy when they find out. 

So yea dudes. Try staying off the internet and going ghost to improve yourself so you can come back as a new man. Be careful though, since this is a red flag to some women.

You can see in the social media the negative feeling (stress, resentment, anger, disappointment) girls feel about guys.

Sex between a guy and a girl mainly consists in her being a full blown-up sex doll that gets the guy off in 5 minutes or less. Guys do not even make to the top 5 of things girls fantasize about.

Actually girls love and admire each other. Any ladies' night out, girls have much more fun and have an amazing time than awkward, boring date with guys. Girls go out in groups and got each other's back. There is a sense of union, bond and sisterhood among them. They can share everything: clothing, experiences, jewelry, girl-code tips, etc They can go shopping together and have a nice girl talk. Observe how girls are with their female friends, they bond naturally and get along so well like you'd think they are in a relationship except without the sex component. girls are better lovers, better kissers, better seducers and better at performing cunnilingus.

Girl-on-girl sex is the epitome of equality, lust and passion. It is not rushed and a great highlight is put on the foreplay and mutual pleasure. Girls have more chemistry with each other more than they would like to admit.

#1. She has alot of male friends
#2. Maybe not as significant but a massive body count.
#3. We had sex the second night we met.
#4. She's still on Tinder, (where we met) I sort of get it cuz we're not a thing.

But what really happened was she visited her grandparents Monday and then went out on a yachtish like boat with who I don't know and did not come back till Thursday.

And we have yet to hangout again, she has cried in my arms before and I was there for her but every time I interact with her she is very cold acting, I initiate a lot of the physical interactions because she said she likes it but never does the same to me.

Hi im a 21 yo guy, I think im pretty successful in getting someones attention and having nice conversations.

Whenever a girl gets closer to me and is doing these little touches or leans on me i get insecure and dont know what to do.

I dont want to feel like a creep and touch her somewhere and i dont even know how i would initiate that. I feel like i give off the vibes that im just interested in a platonic friendship.

A reason to this might be that im really inexperienced because i never had a relationship before, while everyone else i meet is kind of the opposite.

male (17).

So I was at this party yesterday with my entire class (including the girl I really like and im 99% sure she likes me too in that way.) + 2 random girls.

The girl I like started talking with a guy who already has a girlfriend. I got jealous and as stupid as I am I started talking with 1 of the random girls. We talked pretty good, went for a little walk.

Later on she wants to kiss me in the kitchen in front of everybody. The girl I like's girl friend was also there and she just kept asking ""have you done this, have you done that? will you make out with her?"" like if she was asking for her friend (the girl I like).

The girl I like from my class seems to get upset-numb so she finds this other guy and kinda flirts with him. Nothing interesting happens between those two.

Keep in mind that me and the girl I really like have been talking for a little while now and we're pretty interested in each other.

And now today after the party I just regret everything that I've done. I regret ""flirting"" with another in front of the girl I really like.

What should I text her? Should I admit that I like her and just tell the truth about my jealousy? Or should I just be like ""I regret everything I did yesterday with that girl..""?

I just want her to know that she's still my number 1 and I wouldn't ever trade her for a damn girl at a party... I don't recall feeling this big of a regret ever. (sry if there is anything misspelled or misplaced.)

TL;DR how to make a post uni long distance relationship work?

I [21M] will be moving from the north of England (where I go to uni) down to London next year.

My girlfriend [22F] will be staying in the north of England for uni for another 3 years. 

My grad job will require me to work 5 days a week so I’ll only really have weekends free to see her, and it won’t be every weekend either as we’ll both have other stuff on.

Does anyone have any experience with this sort of scenario? Does it work, and if so do you have any tips?

My worry is that it may impact my future career, and create lots of issues for our relationship.

Recently went to this event in California that consisted of about 100 people max. Towards the end of the event, I was in a circle, having conversations with about 4 people &amp; I noticed that there was this guy that looked like he was very stressed out. He would constantly walk back and forth and look towards my area, I didn’t understand why. I didn’t notice this however until someone I knew told me he did this. Well, after about like 10 minutes I noticed him looking slightly in my direction, he was adjusting his clothing and took a deep breath and we locked eyes for about 10 seconds. No smile, just starring at my face while he was walking towards me. He didn’t smile, I didn’t smile either so I broke the eye contact and looked at my friend. Then he stopped walking. Then I looked back a second time and he was still looking at me but not at my face, and tilted his head maybe in confusion. Then turned to talk to someone by him. I was wondering why he was doing this. I learned that he has a girl friend of a year now so I was just wondering, was he into me? Did he stare maybe since I was the one to notice him first or was he attracted. He could’ve possibly thought I liked him and made him uncomfortable but I didn’t notice him at the entire event.

I see a lot of people on subreddits and other things get matches from women all the time. These are conventionally attractive guys that look like they could be models.

In my real life I know a lot of good looking guys like pretty boys and I know that there is not a lot going on upstairs. They don’t have ambition, a solid career, they are pretty dumb and have low social intelligence. However they are good looking. 

Girls match with these pretty boys and then the guy will send a message that turns off the girl. Like a dick pick or something over sexual or whatever.
