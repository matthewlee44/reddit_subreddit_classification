I've tried different apps, joining clubs and other social groups, but just never find any girls with whom I can connect. 

After doing some soul-searching in lockdown, I accepted that not having a girlfriend isn't the worst thing in the world. Or at least that's what I want to accept.

I really want to be happy being single, but popular culture is constantly in our faces with how important relationships are.   Turn on the radio, ninety-nine percent of songs are about falling in or out of love. Half of movies, no matter their genre, have  romantic or sexual elements in them somewhere. I  love shows like 'Euphoria' and 'Sex Education,' but they can be frustrating because watching the characters go through relationship drama reminds me of all the experiences I missed out on in highschool. Not to mention how depressing it is seeing more and more of your friends announce engagements year after year on Facebook or Instagram.

Been going back and forth with a girl for a little over a month. Run into each other once every other day and text back and forth a few times a day for most days. Initial dates didn't work out due to schedule conflicts. Read it as a sign of disinterest. 

Well, we got a little more friendly in person and started texting again after a few weeks went by and I invited her to a sports event in person which she agreed to. There was a burst of texting after that happened. I went with some better seats that were around 150 dollars each. She asked how much they were and I told her and she said ""let me know how much I owe after everything"". Well, I said ""I have you if you're fine with that"". She said ""Awwww thank you"". 

From that point to the game was around 2.5 weeks. Ran into each other a few times and talked and texted back and forth. But during this time there were numerous times of her just flat out ignoring me. Talking about friendly conversations, questions, or asking to go out in a group to bowl. Would respond like 1-2 days later with ""lol was out at the bar"" and start talking about herself. I started getting really confused and at my age (28) and experience I was finally like,"" Would anything change if I viewed this game as a date? Just want to be straightforward and not put you in a weird position"". She didn't respond for two days and left it on delivered. She even has a Macbook and an Apple watch. Two of my buddies told me to stop putting up with that and put her on the spot. Left something like ""Well, I guess I have my answer. Don't sweat the game. I can find someone else to go"". 

Keep in mind I had already paid and we were less than six days away from the game and she still hadn't replied. I know I'm not entitled to anyone's time, but I felt like this was a little different. Sure that text was a little passive aggressive, but the game was still coming up and I had to figure out what was going on. Sure enough she read it really quickly and responded fast with a long text stating a family member is going through some stuff (not health related or related to death or anything like that at all) and she wasn't intentionally ignoring me. Then went into how she hasn't been around me enough to know what she would call it (talked for over a month and like 8 hours in person btw). And also stated she didn't know what to call the game and how she wasn't too focused on getting into dating. 

I responded with a really friendly response to all of that stating things along the lines of hoping her situation gets better. That we all have preferences and I enjoy clear rejections and honesty. How I am still extremely open to her coming to the game. She responded with something along the lines of ""It's all good. Not sure if coming to the game is the best right now."" And went on to talk about the family member. I just told her she had my number and knows how to get in contact with me if she wants to go out some time and that family matters deserve space. 

&amp;#x200B;

Am I the asshole for this? Most of my friends and their girlfriends stated that I am nowhere close to being an asshole and felt like I was being used. But one buddy went off on me for being defensive and needy for her not getting back to me and she saw that as red flags and backed out.

Originally rejected him becuz he drank too much on the first date but we did have a good convo so I gave him a second chance.

We’ve had about 6 dates now. I’ve met his friends and siblings. However this past weekend we went out with his siblings and friends to a bar and he got super high on weed and drunk. He tried fighting a guy in a bar that I had to stop (and he got mad at me for stopping him fight the dude). He then left me in the bar by myself with his family to go smoke weed and when I told him I didn’t like that, he got mad at me. That night when we got back to his place he told me (while again high and drunk) he didn’t care what I thought about him and didn’t think this would work out. I still slept over becuz I knew he was high and drunk and then the next morning he apologized and said he didn’t know why he gets mean like that when drunk.

However he reiterated that morning that he thinks we might be incompatible becuz I won’t have sex with him. He also said we’ve had six dates and he still isn’t sure what he wants with me and feels like he should know by now. Somehow I ended up staying longer at his place and we ended up going to breakfast and watching YouTube videos at his place and laughing. 

He was still a bit distant and cold the morning and afternoon though. I finally left and before I left asked him if this is what he still wanted and he said yes and said he would tell me if this wasn’t what he wanted anymore. We gave each other a kiss and hug and then I left. He hasn’t called or texted me today at all and didn’t say as I was leaving that he would text or call me like he usually does.

I called him and ended it last night. And he said he agreed it wasn’t working. I said we could still be friends and he’s still going to help me go apartment hunting on Thursday. Is this a bad idea?

Especially later when they’re like “saw your update, why are you still with that jerk?” And you’re like “you don’t understand! SO really is a great person!” 

It’s too easy to write off as “immature” because it can be hard to express your true feelings with a relationship at stake. It can be easier to vent to a third party. 

But is it healthy? Should the third party be someone who knows you both, or someone completely objective and confidential like a therapist?

This isn’t the first time I’ve caught her in a lie. Earlier this year, I had written some goals and detailed notes about how I would achieve them and left it on my desk - I find that the paper is missing and ask her if she’s seen it or done anything with it. She denies touching it and then I open the bin and it’s in there, scrunched up buried in rubbish. She said it’s because I was too focused and prioritising my goals instead of focused on her. I decided to move on as I understood where she was coming from - she said she wouldn’t lie like that again. 

2 months ago: 

I thought our relationship was great and it was going well - then I randomly receive screenshots from a lady who was married to my gfs tutor (30m) , which was a conversation bashing me and how I wasn’t paying enough attention to her (I’m with her everyday single day and I was studying for exams) - I broke up with her because the messages also mentioned that they should swap partners and they would be happier together… we broke up for 3 weeks. I decided to give it another shot because she was really apologetic and showed up repeatedly 8 times after I slammed the door in her face. 

She has been amazing since then and been trying to make up for that incident - she takes me out for all meals and always travels to my place everyday (1hour bus one-way since 1+ year ago) to study and work at my place together. 

Today:

We ordered bubble tea and we were working and drinking. She took a sip of my drink to try and I tasted her drink in mine (the level of the drink also increased and I could see her drink contents in my cup). I drank my drink and she said nothing. I asked her if she did anything to my drink and she repeatedly denied it ~10 times of me asking her and edging her to tell me the truth. She finally does and she admitted it. I know it doesn’t seem like a big deal but im sick of the lying… which she always says she’ll work on it and it’s a bad habit but I can’t keep falling for it.

I apologize for the lengthy post, but I feel that it helps to tell the whole story. So, a little background on my recent online dating experience. Joined eHarmony in February 2020. After 2 months I completely hated it. I had someone who has photography experience take pictures of me after getting my hair done by a professional hair stylist. Also dressed in a nice polo, and struck a few poses. Also included some pictures of me with my dog, and some of me in different places on vacations I went on. I am in average shape, I do have a belly, but wouldn't say that it is that noticeable. I also had a few different people proof read my description to make sure that it was detailed and eye-catching. I'll also mention I am a software developer working for a company that is known for high job security, and I am making over $80K a year. During the first month I talked to a few people, but didn't really get to meet up because they said they were busy, and often a lot of the people who replied lived very far away, so it made meeting up for dates challenging. Then in March of 2020, you guessed it, the pandemic happened and everything was terrible. Still chatted with some women on the app, but a lot of them became very busy with helping family members, trying to find new jobs due to either being laid off, or work conditions being really bad, etc. Just lots of people who cut contact in the process of all those situations. After my year subscription ended in Feb 2021 I was very disappointed with my experience and wrote a nice email to customer service asking for a full or partial refund. They responded and gave me NO REFUND, they did offer me a special discount, but I decided that I did not want to use eHarmony anymore because it was so difficult to meet up with people since everyone was scared of getting sick, getting family members sick, etc. Now don't get me wrong joining again is something I could definitely afford to do, I just choose not to because it is a big risk at this point in time in my opinion. Fast forward to the present, and I'm on every free app you can think of. Bumble, Tinder, OkCupid, Coffee Meets Bagel, you name it, I'm on it. And after 9 months of actively using these, I haven't gotten anywhere, all conversations have ended. This has also brought a lot of emotional stress to deal with all the disappointment, so much that I contacted my psychiatrist whom I haven't talked to on a regular basis since high school which was about 12 years ago. If anyone has any advice, that would be great.

She also says she likes to go really really slow, which I'm OK with as long as she wants it to go forward. She also said she does not really like physical touching much from any guy (she said whenever guys do this, it turns her off), which I have kept to a minimum. We have been so kind to each other and enjoyed every moment together. I know she has because she has always has a big smile on her face (and smiles with her eyes too), has been completely open with me (except not telling me she didn't feel chemistry until now), tells me how much fun she has, and never flakes and responds promptly via text/phone, and initiates often. So I'm just really confused. If she doesn't like touch, and our pure kindness to each other constantly and having literally everything under the sun in common isn't ""chemistry"", then what is? Should I point this out to her?? Or is this just doomed? Any ideas to salvage this? Or things I should have done differently?

I (22F) recently had surgery to get rid of my colon due to a chronic illness (Ulcerative Colitis)

I now have an ileostomy which means I have a piece of small intestine that sticks out of my stomach and empties into a drainable bag. This is how I go #2 now. It doesn’t smell (unless I’m changing the bag itself or emptying it in the bathroom) and you can’t even tell I have an ostomy unless I make it obvious (I can even wear a bikini and you wouldn’t be able to see my bag).

What I’m curious to know is:

Would you date someone with an ostomy bag?

When would you want to learn that your date has an ostomy? (On the dating profile, 1st Date, Couple Dates In, Only Before Hooking Up?)

Right now I’m planning on telling people after a few dates/before hooking up. (I’d also talk more about my health journey over the past few years at this time since it’s pretty personal to me and something I wouldn’t want to share with everyone because it’s a little traumatic to talk about because of medical PTSD)

My reasoning for not disclosing I have an ostomy right away is that I want people to form their opinions of me based on who I am - not based on my disability (plus it’s not normal for abled-bodied people to talk about their bathroom habits on the first few dates so why should I?)

I worry though that some people might feel misled because I’m not open right away about my disability since it does impact how I look under my clothes.

So for a little input, I'm a complete scaredy-cat who had never talked to a girl I genuinely like before. I've casually flirted with girls before, but girls I don't really see on a daily basis or girls that ill probably never have a future with (sorry if that makes me sound like a douche bag). So recently I moved out of my parents house to a new city where i could start a new life (Toxic family, TMI) I got an incredible job with amazing coworkers that pays well. From what i understand, there is no serious consequences for work relationships so I'm good on that end.  


The Actual Story:  
Id say on my 3rd day of working there i noticed this really beautiful Nepali girl. She had looked at me and i looked at her and we both turn our heads away really fast (this happened multiple times.)  I was curious about her, so i had asked my friend who had been working there for some time now about her. He told me that our other coworker in our little group is good friends with her because they are both from the same country. I eventually mustered up the strength the week after that (today) to ask that coworker about the one I'm interested in and she told me a bunch of stuff about her. Like how's she single and a bunch of other stuff. She also mentioned that because she hasn't been in a relationship for a really long time, she is also very shy, as well as that she is very traditional when it comes to stuff like this so she would prefer the man to take the initiative in a sense. on that same day, my coworker had mentioned to me that she told the girl I like that I like her. She mentioned that after she told her, she had said she kind of knew from the beginning that i might have liked her (I'm not exactly the best at hiding how I feel when it comes to romance if you know what i mean). So now she is entirely aware that i like her, like, like like her. and im stuck in a situation where i know i have to take the initiative, but I seriously don't know how to.  


Finale:  
So, please reddit dating gurus, what do i do? I dont know what it is about this girl but just thinking about her gives me butterflies in my stomach and completely distracts me from what im doing.

She was stationed in Florida and I was in California. We hit it off and had plans to meet up. We talked, mostly text a lot. Then she got orders to spain. After the communication got scarce. I got her some flowers for valentines day and a bear because I told her I liked her and wanted her to feel special. Took her two weeks reluctantly to say thank you. I was like that's messed up. I called her when she went to spain and her answer was, ""what do you want with my life""? That was in march of 2021 and she told me I don't like talking on the phone. I'm like how was I supposed to know if you don't say anything to me? One thing I told her was look, I like you but your communication sucks and on messenger, you leave me on read, or don't even respond. If you're busy or not intetested, just let me know. I wanna get to know you more.  Idk what I did to her to have her answer like that. Ever her friend said I should let that go. I clearly didn't listen. I wanted to travel spain even before I knew she was going so I went for a month. I messaged her multiple times during her deployment and just said, ""hey, thinking about you, hope all is well, imma be in spain during this time, hope you have some time for me"".

She then accused me of telling people I came to see her which I said it would be cool if I could but not the reason why I came. She said I have my daughter and you never asked what I had planned. But like I said I've been messeging you for months but no answer.  I'm always the one reaching out, checking on her, which she did for about a month, then stopped. I even sent packages to her as a surprise because she mentions she doesnt like it over there. While I was there, she said she was staying behind when the ship leaves and we can do something for a couple days. I'm excited and happy. I finally get to meet her. I'm messaging her for 5 days, just leaves me on read, then finally she messages back and saying she has plans with her daughter the same days she planned with me. I'm was like why even bother tryna meet up then? No answer obviously. After that I told her how I felt with all these games, etc and BS. NOTHING AGAIN. Fast forward to my last day in spain, we talk and I'm like let's meet up for a drink or food since I'm leaving tomorrow and still haven't met her. She's like, ""you leave tomorrow""? I'm like yeah I told you this before. I'm hitting her up, she says can you stop blowing up my phone. I'm like wow, I just wanted to see you. October she hit me up becsuse I helped her study for an exam, asked her multiple times did she pass, but no answer. I found out she didn't make the list even tho she passed the exam in march🙄. Then she accused me of catfishing her and posing as someone else to get us together and I told her why when I have your number and social media. I've been tryna get with you but I say I'm interested, you blow me off or say nothing. I said I like you and after 10 months, you say I gotta think about it. I want you, but you say no one wants you lol. I showed her proof i didnt do it but she still dont believe me. I asked her, ""so whats up""?

I (26M) have been dating (25F) for 4-5 months now. Things have been really great, and she seems like a cool person. We usually see each other every week at my place, the last time we met I dropped her off at her place and everything was fine
 

 I knew I would be busy with school and work for the next few weeks, so I asked her out for a weekend out of town 4 weeks out from now. She agreed. I think I miscommunicated because she may have been expecting dates in between? I didn't exactly tell her that I was busy juggling a lot of things. 

Either way, it's been 3 weeks since our last meeting. We have been communicating, albeit slightly lower than normal. I told her I was busy with exams, she wished me good luck etc. 
Then I get a message that she's calling the relationship off because things have been ""weird"". I asked her if she doesn't want to hang out anymore and she said ""I don't know, text me or meet me if you're still interested.""

I left it at that. The next day, she texted me - hey sorry, I went a little crazy. I didn't reply. Then she texts me again in the morning ""don't you wanna talk to me anymore?""
Then, when I didn't respond she messages me on instagram, I finally reply telling her I didn't like how she called things off without any conversation. She said sorry, that she got anxious and overthought and didn't mean it. What the HECK?  Then she texted me again asking if we could talk, and we did. She told me we used to talk so much and now I don't text her anymore, and that we haven't met in weeks. Fair enough. I apologize, tell her I'm sorry, that I was busy, and if she still wants to hang out that weekend. She said yeah and apologized again. 


I still felt weird about it. Like she got too clingy. I was still processing what happened, and with work etc it's so overwhelming. I don't know if this is indicative of bigger issues in her like anger management or abuse? 

Anyway, all this made me realize I really just want to be with my ex, whom I truly loved (not that I wasn't being since with this girl), so I told her politely as possible. She called me a turd and wished me a _very_ sarcastic good luck.
