I want to know if I am being unreasonable.

We have been friends for about 1.5 years and I am afraid we cannot go back to being friends after we break up. It is just that his depression really kills my mood even though that sounds very selfish. 

Whenever we hang out and he is in his melancholic state, he will shoot down any effort I make to try and cheer him up. He tends to feel this intense worthlessness from time to time and no matter what I say he just ignores everything I say with some rebuttal. It is so strange though because he will be depressed for a couple of days but then when he drags out of it and is his more cheery self I remember exactly why I fell in love with him in the first place. But it is always as if that person all but disappears when he goes back to the melancholic state. We are also both university students and I also feel like I am just spending too much time trying to fruitlessly cheer him up. 

I have tried talking to him and told him that when he gets in his depressive state that it makes me sad to see him like that and have him ignore all my attempts at cheering him up. Admittedly, I have only said this to him during his depressive episodes and he just ignored me. I am just too scared to tell him when he is feeling good in fear that it might trigger another depressive episode.

We went out to eat and then got some drinks as well. After the first drink he already seemed a bit tipsy. There is nothing bad about being a little tipsy, but then we both decided to get another drink.

I know my alcohol tolerance well and was feeling okay, but he started to get more drunk. Before drinking we had a really nice conversation and it was pretty balanced as well, meaning we both could talk and didn't interrupt each other. But as he was getting more drunk, he started to speak more loudly, which made me feel kind of embarrassed. He also was pretty much the only one talking, with me just nodding, laughing sometimes and the few times I actually spoke, he interrupted me and then kept on talking himself. He did notice after some time that he interrupted me and quickly said sorry and told me to keep on talking, but he still interrupted me a lot.

I know I tend to be more quiet and I like to listen more than talk, but it didn't feel nice to be interrupted like that. Asking questions and being engaged in the conversation is totally fine, but if you remember something when someone else is talking, shouldn't you wait until they finish to tell your story?

It was getting late and I decided to stop drinking after my second drink, because I don't want to be drunk when I first meet someone. He had also finished his drink and asked me how I was feeling and what I wanted to do. I told him that I was feeling a bit tired and he said that he understood me because it was late. We decided to talk a little and then leave. But then he asked me, if I minded him ordering another drink for himself. He was already tipsy and had acknowledged that, I told him a few minutes before that I was feeling tired and didn't want to drink anymore BUT he still wanted to order another drink.

I told him something in the lines of ""do whatever you want"", because we are both adults and we can make our own decisions, and I also wanted to see if he really would order another drink despite me being visibly tired and not drinking anymore. He did order another drink, which meant he got more drunk and I was feeling pretty uncomfortable. He didn't touch me or act like a creep, but drinking more than your date even when you are already more drunk just seems weird to me. Maybe I should have told him that I did mind him having another drink, but I feel like he should have understood that himself.

We went home after he finished his drink. I did enjoy the date before he got drunk, but I felt really disappointed when I got home and started to think more about what happened. When we were texting, he seemed really polite and considerate, so I was surprised that things went this way. Honestly, I am kind of happy that I saw this side of him right on the first date so I know now what he could be like. 

Even though we had a nice conversation and he seemed like an okay person, I just feel like this whole situation ruined everything. I don't want to create false hope and want to tell him as soon as possible that I think there is no future for us.

Long story short we met on a dating app 4 months, i didn’t feel a spark so we just stayed friends Bc we have a lot in common. 

Two months in I stated catching feelings for her, I told her , we ended up making out , she then tells me she didn’t feel the spark and wanted to stay friends

Cue to now , we hang out one or two times a week and text once a day usually always. Honestly we always have a flirty vibe going on, always only is two hanging , but we never kissed again.. recently we talked about taking a trip together as fiends 

I ended up straight up asked her if she was catching feelings for me , (though we should discuss this before we take a teip), we ended up talking and she told me she did like me, that she’s though about us together but is scared of it not working out and ruining our friendship all tougher… as to the vacation she tells me she really wants to go but she knows she is going to want to sleep with me if we go spend time alone on a trip (again scared that it may ruin things)

I told her I do not want to pressure her , we could sleep in separate rooms or not even go all to there … now we’re at a state we’re we are friends , we know we like each other , I know she wants to sleep with me but we don’t do anything on it (we even talk about each other’s love lives but alwAys come to the conclusion that we can’t ever seem to find someone right )

Since I had a 1-year pause from Uni due to personal issues, I resummed last year and I'm now in a new group and I haven't met a single person from my new class since we are using online meets for class.

  I've been added to the group chat and **THE girl** \[21/F\] asked if someone needs a mark on that same exam ( the one that I also need). I've sent her a friend request and she accepted me the next day.

  We had some information exchange and after that we had like 4 hours of chat about us - what do we like, fav music genre, movies and so on. She was texting/replying fast and I feel like she was .. I don't know - comfortable to talk with me. 

  It was already 5 AM and the exam was at 9 AM so we've decided to go sleep - she asked me if it's okay to give me her number and call her 10 min before the exam cause she has hard time waking up.

  Now, 3 days later - we text for random stuff every few hours. She is intiating conversations as much as I do. She even invited me to a club event but since I couldn't afford the ticket I told her that I would love to do it some other time - and she agreed.

Here’s the situation: We both express that we enjoy each other’s conversation and company, however we are both happy to just get to know each other and enjoy each other’s company, and aren’t particularly looking for a relationship. Both of us are dubious about entering a relationship so we do date but also sleep together and don’t talk about feelings, but we cuddle and text fairly regularly. 

He expresses his appreciation of who I am as a person and says he talks about me to his friends, which makes me think he could like me a little more. He also does open up to me a lot about stuff. However, he never actually says he likes me or any of this stuff and can give mixed signals (will some days be slower with texting than others). This doesn’t bother me since I am not emotionally invested.

He went on a night out with his friends last night and was drunk texting me a lot (I didn’t reply since I was asleep). It was nothing sexual, just videos of him dancing and general chat whilst he spoke to himself.

A couple of days ago (on a Friday), I left him on seen by accident. He went out with his friends on the Saturday and we didn't speak. On Sunday, I realised I left him on seen so I called him but he didn't pick up. It's now Monday morning and I haven't heard from him.

For context, this guy always calls me (I rarely initiate as I hate phone calls). On the occasion I do call him, he either calls me back or messages when he can call me. He hasn't done this this time.

My mind is going crazy. I feel like he's found someone else or he's pursuing someone else and is ghosting me. Or on the other hand, he's upset I left him on seen (which is a bit weird ..)

Yesterday we’ve been just laying for around 3 hours, just laying, looking at each other’s eyes and giving each other small kisses. In public we are not extremely affectionate but sometimes he might kiss my hand in a very cute way or my head and a warm hug.

My small penis (3 inches) has resulted in me being laughed at, talked about behind my back, cheated on, and left time after time after time.

I'm an attractive guy in a successful career, so women have expressed interest in me throughout my life. But it never lasts. I finally thought I had found someone who would be okay with it. We dated for 6 months which is the furthest I've ever gotten in a relationship. We were such a good match. I loved her. I still do. I thought she loved me. I caught her cheating and in a heated moment she told me it was because of my size. It genuinely brought me to the brink of suicide because I thought I was finally done being humiliated.

I'm at the end of my rope. Women have a right to preferences and it seems 99% of women prefer at least an average sized dick and many prefer larger. Even if I manage to win them over with my personality, without fail they eventually miss being filled up, or dominated. I try to dominate them and I want to but psychologically they can't get into it because I'm so small. I'm sick of people saying stuff like piv isn't eveything, etc. I want piv, I want it to be mutually pleasurable, but I realize that is too much to ask.

I've tried toys, I read She Comes First, I've watched countless tutorials, and I always try and usually succeed at making them cum (just not with my dick).

Sorry for the rant, this has been 15 years of failed romantic experiences built up without one success. But I guess I'd rather have no option than be the second option.

I decided on Thursday to message her cousin on snap asking if the next time she saw my crush, she could tell her I liked her. She said, ""I'll tell her when I see her again.

2) Wait it out until she is old enough to make her own decisions (turns 18) which would be 3 years from now.

3) Just ask her if she wants to date and tell her dad at a later point in time.

4) Ask her aunt if she would be able to talk with her dad or if she could tell us how to change his mind because its her brother.

I think entering a relationship, ""falling in love"" and ""staying in love"" is a choice you consciously make. I know that may seem obvious to some but I wanted to put it as a contrarian opinion that love is something that just happens, that a relationship is just something that comes to you over time like winning a game or sport. 

I say this because I've had dating experiences where at the beginning I was uncertain and my initial gut instinct was "" I like talking to her, but there's no romantic spark"". I'm sure many of you have experienced the same. But then I go against my gut reaction and spend a few more dates with her...if merely because I enjoyed the conversations. And you know what? Quite a few times my gut instinct was damn wrong. People that I initially thought I had no chemistry with....when I actively made the choice to give it a chance and see what happens...that chemistry develops. 

It made me think about how arranged marriages have lower divorce rates, and most of marriages throughout human history were mostly because of financial and life conveniences. It's only fairly recently in human history that marriages started with heavy romance first. What I think might be the real truth is that physical attraction is like a highlighter: it brings attention, but after that: what's being highlighted is far more important. 

I also think it's interesting how some nationalities have different priorities when choosing a partner. For some reason my dating profile gets the most attention from Chinese girls who moved to the US on a work visa: they usually have an MBA or engineering masters degree. I went on a couple of dates with this one Chinese girl whom is a software engineer just like me, and I asked her strait up: what is it about my profile that interested you most? She said without hesitation, ""financial planning and career success"". To her, those were the primary goals first in seeking a partner.  Not that romance was immaterial to her, but it was a secondary thing after financial goals. 

American women on the other hand, well they're all different. But what I've experienced is romance/sexual attraction is primary goal BEFORE career/financial in a partner. If I'm wrong please correct me I don't claim to have all knowledge this is just my lived experience. 

So what do you think? Is romance a choice in something you consciously choose to build with someone? Or is it absolutely necessary to have sparks / chemistry before anything else?

The whole concept of dating is crashing down in my mind and I need help. This may be largely an OLD issue too, but I moved to a new town and that's where I'm at for the time being. Though I think it would still be happening with anyone. 



I feel extremely uncomfortable with taking the leaps in intimacy that relationships require after so little time spent with relative strangers. Even when we really hit it off. Kiss them? Hold hands or curl up for a movie? I can’t make the leap. I have many valuable relationships with friends and family built over years. People I trust and rely on and love. How am I supposed to just shove some extra person in there?



I like this girl I’ve been seeing, as much as I think I *could* like a person I’ve known for a month. Really, from everything I’ve heard or seen we should be a great match and I can tell she thinks so too. After a date today we went back to her house while I waited for an uber, and it seemed like I was supposed to kiss her. And I don’t even know (as in actually conflicted) if I wanted to. I didn’t though. 



Part of this is personal discomfort that makes those steps harder. I’m a little late to the game in terms of physical intimacy at 22M. I developed severe OCD my freshman year which took me firmly out of the dating pool, despite some really wonderful people making an effort for me. Now after a difficult few years my symptoms are all but gone, and I’m trying out dating.



The focus of my anxieties tangentially intersected sex and relationships, with lingering effects on comfort. I feel very uncomfortable making advances, and when the person who wants me to kiss them or whatever has been in my presence for six hours total it’s very difficult to justify making the jump. If your answer is “go to therapy” don’t worry I’m way ahead of you. She says I don’t have to do these things if I don’t want to, which is technically true… but I do want a relationship.


Last time I dated was high school, where relationships were usually foreshadowed by a lot of pining, politics, and maneuvering on both sides and with someone I knew very well and spent time getting to know beforehand. Now I text them on tinder, text them on their phone, meet, repeat step two, meet… and eventually we’re supposed to… what?


Who are these people? Something is definitely wrong with me. Does anyone feel the same?

We almost instantly became close friends and it was clear we were both attracted to each other. She was going through a divorce and things were suboptimal. We went out a few times but she got together with another guy but told me she wants to stay friends. So we did, until her new boyfriend got jealous of me. We had a huge fight with her because she promised me she'd never cut me in favor of her boyfriend. I blocked her everywhere.

Turns out the guy was a controlling psycho, so after 2 years they broke up. He installed spyware on all her devices and things like that. Even though we acted like friends, I could never forget her and I missed her through the 2 years very heavily. She initiated contact with me 3 months after the breakup and apologized for everything and confessed that she fucked up by cutting me off and chosing him. She wanted us to build our friendship first and see where we'll go. This time however the circumstances were suboptimal again. She made a decision months ago to move abroad for a little while in April then later on probably for good. We talked about getting together, kissed, even slept together but she didn't want a long distance relationship and she didn't want me to move abroad just because of her. A few weeks later she met someone from that country online and they met IRL, started to spend time online more and more. I felt a bit of jealousy and wanted to know what is going on.

She came over to hangout and we have discussed everything. She told me she had me and the other guy as potential partners but she already made up her mind about going abroad and she doesn't want me to move just because of her and simply this is not the time for us. I kinda flipped out as I was already way to deep into the idea of being together (also got signals, words, etc) so she left my place, we fought through text then she went silent.

4 days have passed with many drinks and sleepless nights and I have apologized for my behavior and told her I miss her. She was reluctant at first to talk but we talked through the issues at hand and told me she missed me as well. She told me I put immense pressure on her by not ever settling for a friendship and she is afraid to get into a relationship with others as she knows she would hurt me.

We had established a friendship before that but I had fought off some advances of hers because she was very freshly single. After a while I developed an attraction and went for it, it was a lot of fun and we agreed after the second time we met up to do this exclusively for both frequency and safety.

I would say it developed more into a situationship as we never stopped talking as friends, and we are both emotionally supportive of what the other is going through with work family etc... The problem is lately as she switched locations and we don't see each other on a weekly basis, it has moved to more talking than actually seeing each other, I feel like I am an emotional support animal on the phone as opposed to the guy she pursued for sex. We also had a good argument this week that got pretty heated. She had once expressed interest in dating, at the time I didn't think it was a good idea. I brought it back up as something I was interested in, now she isn't entirely sure as I might be relocated for my new job in a few months.

Today on the phone I laid down pretty straightforward what her work schedule looked like and what mine did and that I will be asking her to come over and spend some time with me. She had plans for one day but the other was free and she said we will ""play it by ear"". If I don't get what I'm hoping for, am I justified to take a step away from the constant contact and being there as a friend because the sexual chemistry has taken such a back seat?

It started off casual, but in the past month it has gotten more serious with both of us agreeing to be exclusive. I think its going to lead to something official in the next couple of weeks.

Last Friday night I met her out for the first time after she told me to come to the bar. When I got there it was nice she was smiling her ass off and we danced and talked for awhile. I knew she was pretty drunk and she's a bit of a social butterfly, but I was a little surprised by how she was acting after that. Her friends came over and they just ran off without saying anything to me. I thought that was a little weird but I had some friends at the bar too so I just hung out with them for a bit. When I found her again though she was talking to some dudes which bothered me a little bit but I feel like I'd be warned about her being social so I just let it go. I started talking to her again but then her friends came over and they darted off again into the crowd. Probably after the third time this happened I found her again and she was hanging off of a random guys hip and her hand was on his chest. I'm not sure why but that really struck a nerve in me. I know he was just a random dude and not one of her friends or anything either.

I didn't say anything about it that night and I ended up having a good time with my friends and at the end of the night we went home together. Today I tried talking to her about it over text, I didn't know what I was looking for her to say, but I just explained how seeing her on that guys arm and with her hand on his chest made me uncomfortable. She told me she was blackout drunk, didn't remember it and that it probably just her being friendly she wouldn't give that energy off to another guy and she was just having fun.

I don't know if this is a red flag, or if I'm just over thinking it but it really bothered me. I'm afraid to push it further because I don't want to be a jealous psycho guy and I just don't know what to do. I like her a lot and like I said I don't want to be a jealous psycho, but I feel like one. Seeing her be that physical with a random guy on top of the fact she refuses any form of pda with me just really bothered me.

Is this a red flag for her?

She used to tell me everything, and she still does. 
I didn't have feelings for her from start but over last few weeks i developed them. She got to know that i have feelings for her, she also felt the same but not as much. Not enough to say yes. So we decided that we'd work this out together. We went on few dates, even though she didn't want to label them as dates those were dates. We kissed, we made out, gave her some hickies. She said she didn't feel weird when doing that. She told me that she was aroused when we were doing that stuff. Two days after that we didn't do anything of that sort, we just held hand together, hugged, talked and went for long evening walks. She doesn't want people to know that we are a thing because that would put pressure on her, and she won't be able to decide weather she wants to do this with me or not. I understand that, so she started pulling aways from me whenever there were people around. I also started doing that when her ex was around because he would then text her saying he feels weird when he sees us holding hands or even when my hand is over her shoulder. But yesterday he did that again and she got really pissed and kinda scolded him. Her mood was off all evening. I asked what it was and she said she is annoyed at everything and frustrated. she is not able to make even small descisions. she told me that all of the things that we were doing were really overwhelming for her. So I asked if she needed space and she said she doesn't know. I feel like she is holding back and not telling the truth because that would hurt me. I told her that if she doesn't want to date me it's okay, we could go back to being friends. She said she doesn't know if she wants or not, part of her wants but part doesn't. There are few situations in which she is really certain that she wants to date me, but other times she is confused. So I asked her if we should take a break. She agreed. So in the end we both agreed to take a break for a few days. We decided that we would get back together after a very important interview. We both are supposed to prepare for that. So we decided no hugging, no holding hands, no flirting and no late night walks. A week after her knowing that i like her we decided to take a break. 
I don't know what to do now. I dont know how this break is going to help. i just feel like we would grow more distant because of the break. i really want to date the girl and i have never felt like the same way i feel about her. But her being this confused is making me confused. I don't know if we made a right descision of taking a break. Should I have just ended it? That would be really sad.

I was his first girlfriend, and our relationship was passionate and incredible. We emotionally were at a stage where we knew we wanted a future together and talked about it all the time. We only broke up because his parents couldn't accept me as the white American I am (classic, I know). He did try to convince them to accept me, but they wouldn't budge. Lots of hysterics later, he couldn't disappoint his parents and so we broke up.

We have been in regular touch over the last 6 months, but he is now engaged to a girl his parents approve of. He picked her for being the most regular (i.e., non-dramatic, stable, reliable) choice, not because he particularly likes her. He told me that he's not even attracted to her. During our last phone call (which I told him would have to be our last ever), he told me that he still thinks about me every day and feels like he's emotionally cheating on her, he will never stop loving me, and he wanted me to know that he will never feel the same way for her that he feels for me. He's doing this for the happiness of his parents.

He told the girl about me, including the reason we broke up, and she asked him if he's over me, and he said yes because he didn't want to lose her. She's thrilled to be engaged to him, because literally the perfect guy just fell into her lap, and she doesn't know that he's in love with someone else. They have only met twice in person. He's a sweet and amazing guy, so I know that he will treat her well and try to make this work in the best way it can, even though he loves me.

**My question is this:** **Do you think this marriage is likely to last?** They plan on staying in the US, even though they are both from India. They both did their schooling here, so while there is intense family pressure, they are far away from their families. To clarify, I have 0 intent on breaking them up, and I do not plan to continue communication with him (even though he wanted to keep talking). But will her female intuition sense that something about him is distant? Would that even matter because she can't leave him because of culture?

He told me that he will be shameless and run back to me if things don't work out / if he realizes that he made a grave mistake in sacrificing his own happiness for that of his parents. He also kept everything I ever gave him (cards, letters, gifts) in a box, which he will never get rid of. And she does know about me, just not that he still loves me and always will.

I’m not sure if I screwed this up and I’ll be pretty bummed if I did. I met this guy online and we’ve been trying to get together but it hasn’t happened due to the fact I was away and only just got back. I reached out to him and we talked about how we both still want to go out. 

He messaged me letting me know he thought he’d be away for a few days but maybe today or a day during the week ti meet up but wanted to know when I could. 

I messaged giving my number and told him if it was easier he could just text me. I wonder though if he thinks it’s weird that he didn’t ask for it but I gave it and now won’t respond at all. 

And I just said I’d let him know about today but I was pretty sure I was busy already ( I really didn’t know until halfway through the day if I was still not available). So I realized when I got home I never said anything to him. Anyways, I also said that I didn’t think I had anything going on during the week and asked what was good for him. I also said weekends tended to be better but I was not sure what worked for him.. 

Did I mess this all up? I honestly like this guy and really want to go on a date with him.. what should I do?

In reply she said you’re too sweet , thanks and  take care of yourself too .

Long title so I’ll try to explain. My boyfriend and I have been dating for just over four months. I love our sex life, we’re extremely sexually compatible and both have high libidos. He cums from my blowjobs and handjobs. 

We’ve been having sex for a bit and he never came but believed it was because of using condoms. Today was the first time we went “raw” due to me having been on birth control for a few weeks and both of us being clean and monogamous. We had sex in a few different positions for more than an hour. It get great for both of us but he never even got close to cumming. I’ve noticed when he masturbates he’s only able to cum with a very tight grip and very fast, violent hand motion. It’s the same when I give him handjobs-he won’t cum until I go super fast, super rough, super tight. 

Basically I want to know if it’s an invasion/inappropriate of me to ask him to try and masturbate in a gentler manner. I think some of his issues with cumming during sex have to do with him conditioning himself to only cum with that stimuli. He was really upset about not being able to finish but was trying not to show it. I want to fix this so he feels better. We’re each other’s first if that matters. 

TL;DR: boyfriend can’t cum during sex and seems to have conditioned himself to only cum from rough handjobs/masturbation.

He met this girl last Saturday at a bar. (He’s 27M she’s 29F for reference.)  They’ve hung out 2x since then (she invited him to her place both times, I don’t think they’ve done anything besides kiss from what he told me.)  My friend comes on kinda strong and definitely talks a lot and pursues people HEAVY (like calling her everyday, maybe even more than once, telling her he likes her etc.)  Being his friend, I’m used to his personality since he’s the same way in a friendship but for some people he definitely comes on strong. 

He said she told him he talks too much and calls too much (not sure if she was joking or serious lol), he said he thinks that if he never reaches out to text or call..he thinks that she wouldn’t reach out. He also said he tells her he likes her but can’t gauge if she’s interested or what she wants. He said he seems to be the one initiating all the kissing and what not (he’s a very affectionate person) but he says it feels like she’s not like super into it. One thing he mentioned was tonight he texted her “good night Lauren 😘😘” (she’s Lauren lol) and she just wrote back “night night”- I told him not to overthink that but he wanted me to add that in here lmfao

He seems to think that maybe she’s like not over someone or is scared of getting to know someone (she’s been engaged before, said she was cheated on, also said that she won’t remove any photos of her ex from her Instagram even if my friend and her start dating and he asks her to. Def some unhealed wounds in my opinion)

I told him that I’m sure there’s some interest since she’s invited him over multiple times (and they plan to again on Tuesday—3 hangouts within 10 days of knowing each other.)  I also advised that maybe he scale back a little on how aggressively he pursues her because if she knows he likes her..what reason does she have to try and impress him like he deserves?? And I also explained to him to just be a little careful for his own sake because sometimes people play hard to get so much they eventually turn into hard to like.
