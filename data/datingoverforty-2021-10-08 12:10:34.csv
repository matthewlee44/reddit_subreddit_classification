26,q4t1i1,1633810323,Will this be an issue,"So I was in a relationship for 6 years, then she ended things.  It's been over a year now and I'm feeling like I'm ready to dip my toes back in the water again at 41.  But I have a situation and I'm wondering if it's going to present an issue.

We never got married, but lived together for 5 years.  Things ended amicably between us (no screaming or shouting matches etc, she just said we grew apart and we had no passion anymore).  I've moved on, she's moved on, but we're still roommates.  

The main reason we chose the place we did was because it was in a location that was absolutely perfect for both of us.  I'm super close to work, it's a newer building (we were the first batch of tenants who moved in), it was designed with literally everything within 3 blocks of the building, and it's easily one of the best deals for rent in the city.

So neither one of us alone could afford the place ourselves, and for me personally, anything I could afford on my own is A: mainly on the other side of the city and B: nowhere close to the same quality of space or neighborhood.  I've looked for roommates but I'm very hesitant to move in with a total stranger I've never met.  I have been saving up to possibly buy a house or condo, and I do have a friend who has offered me a place when he buys his house he's saving for...but neither of those are happening soon.

The relationship with me and my ex is friendly, as I said we didn't end things hating the other etc, but it's very clear there is no potential of anything rekindling.  I've talked with my ex about ground rules for when we both get back into dating and we have an agreement (mainly just common courtesy, we both agreed it would be better if nobody stayed over night etc if we were both home).

43,q57ruo,1633871478,Don't criticise my house when you don't have one!,"Sorry this is just a rant / vent.

I have posted here before how my partner is a train-wreck with all things financial. It's the main thing we argue about and it's a key reason we didn't try for a baby despite both wanting one and being 38 and 50 and both childless when we met. Anyway a few years have gone by now and I think that ship has sailed (the baby one, the  money thing remains to haunt us)...

Basically my partner + money = disaster :-(

This maybe belongs on AITA  but it's also a grown-up type of problem and they don't have much nuance over there so here goes...

We live in my house, which I bought before we met.  It is fairly small, a modern low-maintenance type of house. I bought it a few years ago after my divorce as it was what I could afford on my own, and it turns out it was a good investment as my suburb has become a bit ""gentrified"" and my house will be worth more than I paid if I want to sell it in the future.

My partner has lived his whole life paycheck-to-paycheck and has no house or savings and borrows money from me frequently. I should point out we do similar jobs and earn roughly the same wage. He is just a financial shitshow.

Recently he seems to have made a hobby of complaining about my house for 2 reasons:

1) It's too small for us both. I bought this house just for me to live in alone with my pets and I agree it's a bit small for 2 people. However it is  a 3-bed place, the 2 ""spare"" bedrooms are small it's true but I gave them both to him for his exclusive use as they were unfurnished when he moved in (I had a vague plan to go to Ikea one day and buy ""guest room"" stuff but it never happened) and he has all his furniture and clothes and TV and gaming stuff in those rooms and uses them frequently as a kind of ""Man-Cave"". I think this is way more space entirely to himself than most men would have if they lived with a partner.

2. I live too close to the trainline. It's true that the train track runs down the back of my yard, one of the reasons I chose the house was how convenient it was for public transport. It hasn't bothered me since about 2 weeks after moving in but he said he can't  sleep because of the train and it is a huge disturbance for him and is generally affecting his life adversely.

Well today after what feels like his millionth whinge-fest I snapped a bit and said ""OK as my house sucks so much I will rent it out and we'll move into your house instead. Just remind me of the address again...""

Of course that was met with stony silence then accusations of being unfair. 

After a bit of sulking he came back with the idea that we move and buy somewhere bigger together. I said ""Awesome, I'd love that. As soon as you have half of a decent deposit I'll be up for that.""

 Again silence then ""You're being unfair and I'm going to bed.""

I'm just at my wit's end. I am not saying my house is perfect, and of course a nicer bigger house in a better area would be lovely, but I am so sick of a man who had nothing in the way of assets before he met me (and still doesn't!) criticising the choices I made and the life I worked so hard for.

Well, I think that back in my 20s when I dated, I could flirt, be coy, be cute and all of those things people do when they date and are attracted to someone. Now? Not so much.

I feel like life and responsibility have gotten me to a place where that sense of mystique and coyness have been replaced by a near brutal sense of honesty and pragmatism. I don't know how to flirt anymore. I don't know how to be 'cute' anymore. I can have good conversations and flow but...yeah. I can't seem to hide my 'expectations' of man who is mature, responsible and has his head on straight. I may not be absolutely sure of what I want in a man but I am sure of what I *don't* want. This doesn't mean I am looking for a replacement Dad or solid 'husband material'...just that, with where I am, I don't have the emotional energy for vagueness, elusiveness and all the stuff we could all get away with in our 20s.

Is this a problem for men over 35? Do you guys still expect the sexy, sassy, flirty, 'live for the moment and anything goes' thing from us at this stage? Many of us can't afford to do that because we are still recovering from and carrying the burden of that from our younger days. Can anyone relate?

Men out there, what works for you? Ladies, how do you navigate all this? How do I *do* this thing now?

54,q5t86g,1633949412,Boyfriend talks about his living situation as though he’ll be there forever,"Let me preface this by saying that we’ve been dating for less than 2 months, and yes we’ve moved very fast but we are comfortable with the pace so far and neither of us feels rushed.

We are both established, high income professionals who own our own places, I have a house and he has a townhouse. He likes to talk about how he likes his area and would be happy living in his place until retirement (20 or so years away). However he knows I do not do attached housing and thus would never move into his townhouse, and yet he brings this up fairly often, a couple times a week. He also tells me about the renovations he has planned years down the line.

I get that it’s way too early for us to be planning our lives together, and I definitely don’t want to move in together any time soon…but every time he talks about this it makes me feel like he’s subtly rejecting me. If our relationship does work out, I would absolutely want to eventually move in together with him, ideally by selling our own places and getting a much nicer, bigger house that would be far cheaper for each of us after combining our earning power. I haven’t mentioned this to him yet, because again, it’s way too early.

I don’t know how to bring up the rejection I feel to him, or if I should even bring it up. We have talked about relationship goals, and he has said several times that his goal is to find a long term partner to grow old with, and that’s what I want too. But all this talk of staying in his townhouse forever makes me feel like he just wants a forever girlfriend who lives apart from him, and that’s not what I want.

Is there a way to talk to him about my feelings without coming off as the crazy girlfriend who has already started planning our future together?",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/q5t86g/boyfriend_talks_about_his_living_situation_as/

58,q5yifz,1633966573,I love dogs. She doesn't. Has it worked for you?,"This could be the one thing that breaks us.  We've been together for a little over a year and I just had to put my dog of 10 years down recently.  

I said I won't get a dog for a couple years but inevitably I think I'll want another one.  

I've agreed this time to get one that doesn't shed (as much - they all shed a little).  But she doesn't like them.  It's more than the poo in the yard and the smell in the house (which you get nose blind to).  

She was able to manage my situation with my dog when she stayed over.  But we are thinking of getting a place together and this gives her anxiety because if I want to get a dog one day and it is too much for her, it may end then.  

There's no way you can really give me advice because this situation is specific to her. 

Have you ever dated someone who thought there was 0% chance they'd ever bond with a dog but gave it a try?   How did it turn out?",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/q5yifz/i_love_dogs_she_doesnt_has_it_worked_for_you/
