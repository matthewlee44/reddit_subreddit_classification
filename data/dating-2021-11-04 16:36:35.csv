2,qmveqx,1636062064,Should the guy always initiate dates/contact?,"Hi everyone,

I am going to keep this as short and to the point as possible ...

Last month I started dating a girl and we hit it of from the first date. We have seen each other a few times by now and everytime we have a great time face to face, the conversation is great, the intimacy is there, the sex is getting better etc ...

However I have noticed that I am the only one who initiates texting and makes dating plans for the future. The only time when the girl has initiated texting me with was in two occasions when I told her explicitly to do so, when she was going on brief holidays and I told her to text me when she was back in town. Both of these times I was the one who ended up suggesting dating plans in the end any way... 

So I am wondering, is this girl not that interested in me? I have been told that if a girl likes you, she will reach out and text you or suggest plans ... Is she seeing someone else and just views me as a distraction? For how long is a guy supposed to initiate these things? I think that next time I simply will not text her anything and just wait and see what happens ....

24F and i have several male best friends, but there’s also been many times when i’ve wondered if i like them more than that or not, especially because people always seem to have lots of questions about it and that can plant the seeds lol

recently, i told one of my close friends i was confused and liking him more than a friend, he goes above and beyond for me, is touchy feely and we speak regularly, but when i told him he said he didn’t feel the same and he behaved this way because he cares about me so much
 (he literally said i think some of my actions might have made you think this so he deffo knows lol). he also said he won’t treat me any different and will continue this because he doesn’t want anything to change. i don’t want things to change either but his behaviour is part of the reason i thought i liked
him.

So there is this women I have some shared lectures with at uni. She recently reached out to me on social media and struck up a conversation, this in it of it self isen't that strange since I'm a very out going guy.

What I'm having trouble with understanding is that she is Iranian and I'm from a western country, and as far as I know that kind of thing isen't common over there. She keept calling me ""habibi"" which I belive translates into my darling or something like that. And going on about how sweet, funny or smart she thinks I am. I have had no interactions with her beyond online conversations.

Is she trying to flirt?
I have very little experience with people from the middle east but, where I live i would consider it flirting.

Also I'm general very outgoing and try to be friendly with everyone so maybe she is just shy and want to be friends or am I reading too much into it?

13,qmwejk,1636064745,Do men get uncomfortable when everything is too smooth?,"  I had started seeing a guy and things were going great. Never fought, so much in common, friends over a year before anything started romantic. We weren't anything official but we had talked about us and how we cared for each other and wanted things to go slow because of our past. I have my own house, own money, I work on my own truck and cook/bake. Which he said he loved and was impressed by. 

  When we last saw each other he said ""I'm so happy you came over"" before he fell asleep cuddling me, (sex was not involved that day). Two days later we talked over the phone about him not wanting to be fwb, not wanting to lose me in his life and then being afraid of ""toxic"" things he used to bring into a relationship but how he spent the last year working on those things. I asked what he wanted, he said ""i don't know"" he had never said that before as an answer. I said, "" thats ok, you're allowed to not know right now. I'm gonna give you a lil space so you can figure it out. I'm not going anywhere or anything, just giving you some breathing and thinking room""

  He had recently told me some less then favorable things from his past and I just accepted it, talked through any questions I had. He was surprised how ""that went a lot better then he anticipated"" our sex life was great, both very active partners, last time we had sex I was on top the  entire time (just over an hour). And he went on how much he enjoyed it and how he usually can't get off when his partner is on top. Soaked in the tub and I just washed his hair and body and let him lay on me during that. 

When he was being confusing at the end, he tried at one point to hurt me (emotionally not physically). Which was very out of character, had never had him behave this way. And I just said  ""I dont know whyd you say that, what happened, why are you acting like this?"" He never responded. 

 Can things just go too well for some guys? If need more detail I can message.  Im just wanting an idea of what happened from his perspective. I obviously can't make him talk to me about it, but I also want to give him the benefit of the doubt. Was just seeing if any men had genuine opinions of what maybe happened in his mind or his perspective.

I do like this man, he came across as a nice man, still might be, I honestly wouldn't know. He's got his own issues in the past, I have mine. We got drunk and talked about it all, slept together. Messaged briefly over next couple of days, decided neither of us were looking for something and left it at that. 

Except, I am a chronic over thinker and riddled with anxiety. Now I have so much regret about the whole situation. I asked him if he wanted to get a very much friend zone coffee, to be honest just so I could have a conversation with him where I wasn't revealing deep dark secrets and that I can in fact be a normal person. At first he seemed keen but I said to message when he was free and he never did.  I see him in work every couple of weeks and he's very pleasant, we just ignore the fact we slept together.

I just don't know how to deal with the fact I opened up to him about things, and if I seemed like a completely crazy person. And now I'm questioning if I'll ever be able to do this with a person. Has this experience just taught me that I'm better off alone.

I always imagined that the feeling would be similar to that of a stereotypical Disney or Romance movie. Always thinking of each other, super lovey-dovey, etc. But then again movies aren't always reflective of reality.

some have wives and flirt at work, talk to girls on the side, and follow half naked girls on instagram (not shaming, sex work and modeling is real work). some are just horribly insecure and practically force whoever they are talking to, to validate them or make them feel good about themselves. some lead on girls only to pull out when their ego has been satisfied, all while having a relationship the whole time. although i could be completely wrong about this, but i feel like i’ve noticed this far more in millennial men than any other age. these are in my experiences and people around me. 

perhaps it might be my location or a coincidence of the people i am around, but i was just curious if anyone else has noticed it. is it the idea that they are reaching thirty (a considered older age) and they want all the perks of stability but with the youthful tactic of not taking responsibility? are they desperately trying to cling onto their ‘youth’? just a thought that i had.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qmx9yi/why_do_millennial_men_do_this/

30,qmxkhe,1636068001,I brought up being exclusive after only 2weeks,"So I’ve been seeing this guy for 5 weeks now and he is way better than any of the guys I’ve dated in the past, for example he actually takes me seriously. We have been seeing eachother on average 1 to 2 times a week. And probably text eachother a few times a week. He takes me out on dates, I spend the night at his place, I’ve met all his friends, I’ve even met his coworkers and boss. Another really nice gesture is that when I casually said something about me spending all my money on something he replied back asking if I wanted him to send me over some money to tie me over. I’m not sure if that’s how most guys are in the talking phase but to me he seems to be treating me like a gf or at least heading in the direction? 
The only thing that is making me feel insecure is a convo that we had week 2 of seeing each other(so 3 weeks ago) 

So in the first week of us knowing eachother one night when we were both pretty intoxicated, we decided we were “dating” and “exclusive”. So a week after that (week 2) I kinda casually brought it up and he was embarrassed and said he can’t believe he said that after only knowing eachother for a week. He then went on to say something like:

 “I can’t be in a relationship for a very very long time. My last relationship we decided to jump into it after only knowing eachother for 3 weeks and the whole 8 months of it was miserable and we just broke up 4 months ago. So I don’t want to lead you on if you are looking for a boyfriend”

I of course played it cool and just said that I am good with how things are with us right now and that I wanted to play it by ear but am open to a relationship. He then replied “he takes relationships very seriously and he wants to make sure he can be ready for one”

Keep in mind this convo happened after only knowing eachother for 2 weeks. It has now been 5 weeks and he is still pretty consistent.
The only small difference is after that talk in week 2, he has maybe slowed down a little in regards to he won’t text me everyday like he used to in the first 2 weeks and he seems a little more chill but as for seeing eachother it’s still one to two times a week, I have met his boss, keep going on dates etc. 

I guess idk if I should bring this up again or what? I know it was crazy soon of me to bring it up the 2nd week. To be honest if it wasn’t for that conversation we had in week 2 I wouldn’t really be insecure about anything. So idk if I should just ignore that conversation bc it was only 2 weeks in and it probably flipped him out? Yeah the pace of texting has chilled out too, but I also feel like maybe that convo we had made him realize he was moving a little fast.

35,qmy6k7,1636069871,How to ask her why you like me?,"Im (30M) dating her (36F) for 3 weeks, we met twice and in confused.

Here the details in short:
- We talk daily but not intensive, a few messages a day. 
- She keep interest in me and texting first. 
- No kiss or any sexsual thing happened. 
- I feel no sexsual tension from her. 
- I walked her home every date and she went up ""tired"" not inviting me. 
- We have good vibe and talk but seems not a lot in common. 
- She is upper class with enough money, no kids, not divorced. 
- We met on tinder 

The biggest issue for me is not sexsual thing at all. I used to have kiss if not sex on the first date, sexsual attraction is big part of my needs. 

Since she does not seems to be attracted to me and we don't have much in common how do I ask her nicely ""why do you even want to date me?"". This situation looks fishy to me. 

I thought because of her age she may just trying to get a father for children ASAP and she comprise a lot but I don't want to be that cynical.

He did seem a little shy but I can seem intimidating to some men lol so I didn’t think anything of it. 
Anyway, there was a metro strike in our city and taxis were ridiculously expensive so I ended up staying over at his (I just moved here so I had no one else). Things got a little steamy lol and he revealed he was a virgin. I was shocked and a part of me was turned off at first, I don’t get it though, he’s handsome, has a social life and a good personality. 
I don’t want to dig in to his personal life about it. And I spoke to a friend and she told me he must have his reasons but it shouldn’t put me off as he was respectful to me and was a gentleman. 
We didn’t have sex as we drank a bit but did do some sexual stuff. My issue is I hope if we do sleep together, he’s only doing it to lose his virginity and not because he’s truly attracted to me?

Everything is literally almost perfect it feels like.

But… this girl has a dark past, a shit relationship with her mother who was an alcoholic, in general a bad mom, have men over when the kids were home and be loudly doing it, an ex of the mom sexually assaulted the girl I was dating when she was 10…

When she turned 14 she was raped by her first boyfriend, stayed with him and then 5 months later with him got pregnant by accident and had an abortion when she was 15. Shes since then been in terrible relationships, one guy would not go out with her until she had written a list of things she planed for them to do and he had approved it.

She has now in this past half year been with 9 other guys, has been / is currently sugar dating.

And she tells me she still hasnt told me it all yet… 

Our last conversation ended a bit shitty because I really couldn’t sit and hear much more of it, she also has this terrible tendency to talk about what sexual activity she has done with others (in unnecessary detail).

It’s all just abit much and I have never really been in a serious relationship before, only less serious stuff. So this is all very overwhelming and I’m not sure if my warning signals in my brain are justified or if I’m the asshole for having these things affect my thoughts of being with her.

I’m just a normal guy who has never had any kinda trauma like her and just want a normal relationship with a normal girl I like.

41,qmykv1,1636071041,Normal Timelines for dating and relationships?,"This is going to be long as I opted to include more than less so bare with me. 

I'm a 23F grad student living in, and from, Mormonville USA. I grew up in the church of Jesus Christ of latter day saints (ie LDS/mormon) but I've never really been seriously involved and haven't attended regularly since I moved out for college. 

For those of you who don't know, dating in the church is... weird. You're not allowed to date until 16 and even then its not until 18 when 1:1 dating is encouraged. People move very quickly from casually dating to marriage. For example, both of my older sister's met and married their husbands in less than 8 months, they were 20 and 21. I haven't had much success in dating, a handful of first dates that all went nowhere, no physical affection beyond hand holding. In part I think because of dating anxiety, my weird relationship with the church, and with my chronic illness I've always been a bit behind the curve socially. Not to mention I gained a fair amount of weight during my undergrad (recently lost 60lbs tho so that's no longer an issue).

I recently met a guy online (23M) who really ticked a lot of my boxes. He's smart, funny, attractive, wants kids, has a good career and a house, has been understanding of my illness and isn't scared of my intellect. Plus he grew up in the church as well so understands the culture and such, though he's much more nonreligious than I. We had a second date last weekend where we cuddled and watched a movie. He kissed me goodnight and it was wonderful. We have another date this week. I'm very keen on him and I don't want to mess this up. The issue is, I don't really know what to expect from here. Were we both still part of the church we'd be talking about marriage at this point (running joke among mormons is the 3rd date is the marriage date) but I don't know what normal expectations are. I'd like to be exclusive but I don't know when/if to have that conversation. To make matters worse, I've been planning to move out of state after I graduate this spring and I'm worried that's going to put a deadline on the relationship. I could probably find a way to work in the city for another year but I can't build a career here, he seems content here but I don't think he's completely opposed to moving sometime in the future. I know it's still very early but even for future relationships I'd like to know when these big conversations typically happen.

Would also love to know if these relationship boundaries/expectations I have are unreasonable:

1. No sex without a committed, monogamous relationship
2. No moving in together until we're officially engaged (nothing against long engagements)
3. While I want to get married sooner rather than later, the earliest I'd get married is in a year or two.

TL;DR Grew up in mormon church and met a guy I really like. I don't know the typical timeline for relationships and don't want to come off as too eager. At what point in the dating process do normal people become exclusive or talk about marriage?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qmykv1/normal_timelines_for_dating_and_relationships/
42,qmync0,1636071257,Should I let him know how he made me feel?,"It was a brief but intense romance that moved at breakneck speed. Lasted for six weeks. If it was longer, I wouldn't hesitate to let him know. 

However I'm on the fence about whether to send him a message - one because of how much it affected me so I want to get it off my chest, and two because it was so intense that it felt like longer than six weeks. 

It was intense because after a short while we were talking seriously about a future together and becoming official. He assumed we were in a relationship; I told him we hadn't had that discussion yet but it was heading there.

We spent a whole day together one day. It was lovey dovey. He was saying that he's so glad he met me and feels like it was fate, he can't wait to meet each other's friends and family, he sees a long term future with me, he's really falling for me, etc. It looked like we were gonna become official very soon.

As he left my flat we were joking around and I was being loud. He commented that the neighbours might hear; I assumed he meant i might be disturbing them.

The next day I popped over to his workplace to say hi (I usually did that as he works down the road from me). He was off with me and laughed off having ignored a soppy message I'd sent him after he left. His justification being that I was being very loud the night before, the neighbours could've heard and thought he was abusing me, they could've called the police on him and he could've been arrested, so he doesn't wanna date anymore because my loudness was a red flag. 

I was floored. I said if you were uncomfortable why were you laughing with me and how can you end things over that? He started to realise his mistake, that he'd overreacted and hadn't communicated well, and apologised then said that he's realised he doesn't have time to date. I told him it feels like he self sabotages (not just based on this incident but other things that'd happened and stories he'd told me about why he'd dumped his exes, eg he didn't like that one of them left her hair all over the place). 

A few hours later he sent a message to say he doesnt feel good enough for me. He didn't elaborate when I asked.

It's been a week now since we spoke and it's been getting me down.

I wanna let him know what a headfuck it is that he sold me the dream one day then pulled the rug from under my feet the next day, that his actions made me feel disposable, did he really catch feelings as he claimed when he could switch so suddenly?, my disappointment that I thought things were going really well only for him to abruptly end it, and just the mortification of letting my guard down only to be crushed. It's been eating me up so I just wanna get it off my chest. And maybe get an explanation as to why it went so tits up.

I do think he's a genuinely good person. I just think he has serious issues with attachment (fearful avoidant I think) and a strange pathological fear of having a woman falsely accuse him of abuse.

So should I let him know how it's all made me feel? Or is it not worth it? 

I can imagine he'd probably be apologetic. I just dunno if it's weird to send such an intense message for such a brief courtship a week after it's ended.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qmync0/should_i_let_him_know_how_he_made_me_feel/

I realized I have a bit of a crush on her, and so I started to pay a bit of attention to her out the corner of my eye. I found out then, that she stares at me a lot. She'll look over her shoulder if she passes me in the hallway, and in class she'll pause for a moment to look at me when she turns her head,  sometimes glances over and looks back quickly, or sometimes she'll just stare for a few seconds. We will make eye contact, maybe 2-3 times each class, but sometimes none as I try not to stare so much that I'm creepy. This goes on for a couple weeks, so I go over to work at her table in one of my classes, the teacher lets us move around. We definitely could hold easy conversation, and I could get her to laugh. 

Then, in conversation with a mutual friend, the mutual friend says she was talking about me to her. So, at this point I figure I'm lucky as hell and my crush has a crush back, so I ask for her number one day before she leaves class. I get her number, and I send her a text asking about soccer, as we both play soccer. It's been over five days and I haven't gotten a response. In those five days, she still was staring a lot, but I didn't get a chance to talk to her about it, as she moved tables in the class I did talk to her and now she doesn't sit with any of my friends, so I don't have an excuse to go over to her. She's pretty shy around new people, as she'll talk really quiet when meeting new people or when presenting something, but the shyness goes away once she knows them for a little bit, and she never was shy when talking to me. She's never walked over to talk to me, but if i end up next to her waiting before class, she'll turn and start talking to me.

We went to eat at a fancy restaurant, I told her we were just gonna walk around the beach, she got all dressed up, I came dressed up as well, and we were out for 6 hours.

I thought it went well, we were moderately touchy, there were a lot of compliments thrown around from both sides, and I let her know that I thought she was cute, and she said I looked like a model which was really nice. She asked me to help balance herself and I held her hand a bit, I’m just trying to emphasize that there was some flirting going on. 

She told me a bunch of times saying said she had a great time, thanked me for paying for dinner and everything, texted me after thanking me again and told me she had fun, and I was feeling good. I asked her out for Halloween day and at first she was down and then she said she had to reschedule and she told me she wanted to do something Halloweenish and I proposed a couple ideas, but then she said maybe next week would be better.

I was a little bummed and put off, but whatever, maybe Halloween’s a big deal to her, but she told me she just ended up watching movies when I asked her what she did today. Like if I liked someone I would be down to go out with them on a day like Halloween especially if I have nothing to do.

She doesn’t seem like a texter either, and idk do you think I’m just overthinking things or does she just seem like not that invested in things. We’re scheduled to go out this Saturday, and I’m hoping that I can make some moves and have her be a bit more invested.

I've noticed people generally only direct this hate towards the men.  It is actually pretty common for women to prefer older men and no one has a problem with it.

I remember in my early 20s I dated girls my own age and they would usually leave and get with older guys who were ""more mature"" or ""more financially stable"" and it always seemed like those were perfectly legitimate reasons.

But now the tables have turned, now I'm the older guy that's more mature and more financially stable and I still get with younger women and it seems like it's a problem for people

She goes yeah he is freaky. He wants to toss me around. She also said she told him she knows me and he said you’re a good girl, but he wasn’t in love. Then she says he wasn’t the right one for you and he isn’t your soulmate. Am I overreacting? I think she could have handled it better. She could’ve just asked me if this was M and not included any of the other details. I don’t want to lose a friendship over this.

I know in my heart she adores me as she’s mentioned to me on a few occasions that I make her comfortable and feel safe and she finds me funny and sweet, and when she asked about past date experiences I mentioned the whole ghosting and leading me on stuff and she thought that was awful and that people shouldn’t do that sort of thing.

68,qn0nkh,1636077596,Very conflicted feelings about a coworker.," 

So ordinarily I think dating a coworker is a big mistake, but my interest in this one new recent hire just creeped up on me against my better judgement

I obviously found this girl attractive since the first day she joined, but I didn't think much of it, attractive people have joined my workforce before and I didn't care, and knew to keep it professional.

Problem is she took a particular liking to my brand of humor and laughs at every joke and comment I make. Of course my humor is well liked among my immediate group of coworkers, so its not just her who laughs at what I say, but I started taking notice of her because she intentionally sought me out at work all the time and her, myself and my close friend at work now pretty much spend all of the time joking around, hanging out, going on walks and eating out. At this point we are definitely outright friends and not just very friendly coworkers, I think we ve shared enough of our personal life and vulnerabilities for me to say that with confidence.

At that's the thing, on the friendship alone I really like her company, I would feel bumped out if that were ruined, but at the same time I m have a crush on her too now.

My problems right now are fourfold:

1-She a coworker, so my job could technically be harmed if in the small chance that she does not take me expressing interest well and tells management. Or more likely it might make things awkward at work even if she sees it as harmless.

2-I like her friendship and I if I were turned down by her it could very well ruin that. and this is one of the rare cases where I care about this. In most cases I m willing to risk ruining a friendship with a personal I m crushing on cause that friendship wasn't very substantial to begin with.

3- Figuring out way to express my interest without causing the two problems I just mentioned.

4-There's a significant age gap, I m early mid 30s, she's early mid 20s, so about a 10 year gap. I don't know how much of a issue this is, I generally am told I look younger than my age but I do feel a little self conscious about the age gap. 

This whole thing has come to the forefront for me now because in my conversations with her outside of work while talking about past relationships she mentioned she didn't have a boyfriend but then she mentioned she was only ""partially single"" because she was seeing someone. Goes without saying that I felt jealous and bummed out when hearing that. My only consolation is before that came up she had said its normal for women to ""date"" more than one guy at a time before settling a relationship (which I agree obviously), but I still kinda feel rejected because I don't think a girl who is interested would mention another guy they were dating however casual they frame it.

So at this point I don't know what to do, I feel a greater urgency for doing something than before after hearing about her seeing someone but at the same time a part of me fears I ve already been friendzoned. I am afraid I can't judge whether she is interested in me or not just by observing her because my pessimism and wishful thinking just don't leave me with a very objective take on her. I would appreciate some advice on what to do next.

TLDR: I m crushing on my coworker whose become a good friend. I m worried I d hurt my job and or the friendship if I try to indicate my interest, but at the same time I feel a greater urgency to do just that because she told me she is casually dating someone. so please share your advice on this subject.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qn0nkh/very_conflicted_feelings_about_a_coworker/

81,qn1wke,1636081658,Experience with his ex,"When I first started dating my boyfriend he said he was friends with his most recent ex. I felt ok with it because I was also friends with mine. 

Our beginning stage was a bit rocky but we eventually got through it. Towards us spending more time together I noticed that messages from his ex increased. I noticed she would reach out to him when her relationship was failing or she needed validation. We weren't official yet so I didn't feel comfortable telling him how uncomfortable her messages and view of their friendship made me.

Eventually we became official (bf/gf) and I noticed she was still messaging the same. On occasion she would send him things that I found suspicious, such as old photos of their days together saying she was reminiscing and wanted to share. I pointed out that it seemed suspicious and kind of manipulative. He agreed but didn't want to tell her he found it inappropriate as not to hurt her feelings. It ate away at my anxiety.
Then I found out that during our dating stage she was messaging him saying she misses him, wants to cuddle and just needs him. Mind you, she was in a relationship at that time and is still with the same person.
It broke me to see those messages. I told my boyfriend I didn't feel comfortable with their ""friendship"" and behaviours, and hurt he didn't shut it down when he knew it was wrong.
He didn't want to end the friendship because he didn't want to hurt her nor does he like cutting people from his life.
He did message her eventually saying he was in a relationship with someone and her messages were inappropriate and they both needed time away from one another to focus on their own lives. But that in the future they could think of a friendship.

1 month later (this month) she messaged him randomly that she saw him while she was walking home. Which I was questioning why the need to message that??
Then she continues to say that she noticed how happy he is in his new life and she's upset he's moved on without her. Again she's still in a relationship...
This caused and argument between him and I because again he refused to shut down her inappropriate message. Instead ignoring that part of the message and just confirming he was the one she saw.

From this argument between us I also then find out that during our dating period he was confiding in her about his dating life, including about me. I found out that she was bad mouthing me to him (not having known or met me). She referred to me as ""crazy"" and would make negative comments on my appearance and character. 
What hurts the most is that he let this go on the whole time he and I dated and didn't shut her down or tell her to stop saying negative things about me.
I get that it was during a period where we had just started dating but I still find it inappropriate and hurtful not to defend someone who you are dating and interested in. And just knowing she hated me then and hates me still, I told him this made me distrustful of her even more and further uncomfortable with her ever being in his and our life.
He acknowledged the pain and hurt and apologised for hurting me but refused to cut off his ex or limit her access to him as he doesn't want to hurt her.

I've told him I don't want our relationship to end but something needs to happen because I'll never be comfortable with this person
While he hasn't gone out of his way in the past to message or contact her. When she has messaged, including most recently - he refuses to shut down he manipulative and inappropriate messages. 
He ignores those parts of the messages and I feel that's just as worse because it's not calling her out on her behaviour and making her feel ok to continue her actions.

Now I'm even more self conscious of my appearance and character (I had some issues before but this has heightened it). And it just feels like I have to compromise and suppress my emotions/feelings, or just get over it because he doesn't want to let go of her.

86,qn24qa,1636082422,"Met my childhood crush as an adult, is she into me?","Hi, I could really use some feedback...

Backstory - when I was a young boy in San Diego, maybe 8 or so, I had met a girl through my family circle who I instantly had a crush on. It was my first real taste of feeling a spark and chemistry towards someone, even if I didn't know it at the time. She was a bit older than me so I always felt that inferiority complex due to us always being at different stages of our development. She had never shown any sign of interest due to that obvious age gap. 

We crossed paths a couple more times, once when I was an early teen, and then again as a later teen. Again, we were at different stages of our adolescent development, but my crush grew everytime I seen her as she really was the most gorgeous girl I had ever seen. 

Today - fast forward and it had been years since I had seen her. Probably the longest time I had gone in my life without seeing her. I had forgotten about her and the crush I had until I seen her yesterday at a wedding. It caught me off guard. While I was a very awkward teen and young adult when it came to the opposite sex, I had developed and found myself, confidence, and sense of worth. All that went right out the window when I seen her lol. 

She is still as stunning as I remembered, and more importantly, such a kind person. We did the normal small talk and catch up, I was smiling the whole time. She couldn't believe how much I had grown into a man. That was to be expected though. 

I was trying to read her body language for signs as I was now pretty attuned to knowing if someone was into me after years of being oblivious haha. I think everyone is aware of the subconscious pruning we do around someone we like and I caught her fixing her hair while talking to me. Normally I would say that was a subtle sign. Need more than that though...

There came a time when someone joined a conversation and she made a comment about our age difference (only minor now we're adults) and then touched me on the arm and back. Again, only minor, I know, but could have been another small sign. I caught her looking my way a few times but I was always trying to get a glimpse of her, maybe i was trying to 

While we were talking an older lady had actually come up to me and said she was sorry for staring at me, it's just that I was so handsome. Wtf haha. I didn't even notice her staring at me. Admittedly, my eyes were fixated on one person though. The lady who came up was sitting with my crush though. Could have had a conversation? 

It came to the end of the wedding night and I went over to say goodbye and gave her a kiss on the cheek. I just felt that spark again. You know, that energy around someone your drawn to? It was a magnetic type of pull. It's hard to explain, but if you know, you know. She was the one who said how do we keep in touch, are you on Instagram or? I said I have Instagram but was taking a break from it. She then wrote it down anyway and I said I'll add you when I get it back. She said I'll give you my number as well. In my head I found that odd? Maybe she gave me it because I wasn't on social media right now I thought. That makes sense. Then a part of my thought, hang on, she gave me her number lol.

Now, this is where my silly male brain is caught up. Ordinarily I'd say there were enough signs but then the over thinking side of my brain is saying she just wants to stay in touch since our families know each other and we knew each other as kids?

I know I'm over thinking this, and yes, I'll message her anyway and see what happens, but I just need advice from someone who doesn't have my brain in their head haha. 

What do people think? Am I just over thinking this too much? Thanks in advance for any advice...",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qn24qa/met_my_childhood_crush_as_an_adult_is_she_into_me/

91,qn2l78,1636084057,Men’s advice. Using your fingers (while building tension) is your greatest asset in the bedroom,"Fingering is usually thought of a mild activity that teenagers engage in when discovering sex for the first time, not a key component of foreplay between experienced adults.

Many guys mistakenly associate foreplay with being a submissive, weak behavior that puts their own pleasure as an afterthought. These type of men are fools. Skipping foreplay is not dominant behavior.

Slowly building anticipation, kissing, touching, and using fingers to rub and stimulate their woman are crucial for the most satisfying sex. She will be wetter, less inhibited, and feel more bonded to you because she will associate you with pleasing her and engaging her emotions.

Here are some of the ways that I have personally found to be most effective. All women are different. Communicate, be observant of how she reacts, and see what she likes.

While kissing, sucking on her nipples, and kissing her neck, use your index and middle fingers to rub the general area of the head of the clitoris in a broad, gentle, yet firm clockwise motion. You don’t need to target the clit exactly yet, just build tension by stimulating her with this motion in the general and kissing her. After a few minutes, use those same fingers in a more slightly more vigorous vertical motion in the same area.

Enter her using your index and middle finger And use a ‘come here motion’, brushing up against the upper wall of her vagina ( imagine she’s lying on her back). This area is the over mythicized G-spot, which is a part of the clitoral nerves inside the vagina. Instead of using a come hither motion, you can also use the same fingers to press up against the upper vaginal wall with a pulsing, heartbeat-like rhythm

The upper ‘pinch’. If she is on her back, enter with only your index finger and use the ‘come hither’ motion mentioned previously. Simultaneously, use your thumb in clockwise motion that brushes over her clitoris. This requires a little coordination. When you are bringing your index finger back, you are moving over with your thumb, kind of like you’re pinching with the fleshy part your index finger and thumb, but not with the tips.

The lower or ‘perineal’ pinch. I learned this from the book ‘She Comes First’. If she is on her back, you enter using your index finger stimulating the lower ‘wall’ of the vagina, while your thumb ‘pinches’ the outside part, above her asshole. The feedback I’ve gotten on this is that it’s not as pleasurable as the ‘upward’ motion, but still provides a unique stimulation that hasn’t been experienced.

Adding oral. Using your tongue to flutter on the head of her clit while using the ‘come hither’ or the ‘perineal pinch’ motion will bring things full circle. However, if she indicates she is ready for intercourse, keep her waiting a few more minutes. Confidently, yet playfully say, “I’m not done yet.” This will bring with tension level higher, which will make the sex even hotter.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qn2l78/mens_advice_using_your_fingers_while_building/
92,qn2nwb,1636084340,When is the best time to ask a guy out?,"I like this guy at work. He’s been flirting with me a lot. I’m pretty certain he likes me too, but because of our work environment we are very rarely alone. I don’t have his number and don’t want to ask him out in front of other people. Men: if you are super busy/stressed at work, would it bother you if a woman you liked asked to talk to you in private and asked you if you wanted to hang out outside of work?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qn2nwb/when_is_the_best_time_to_ask_a_guy_out/
93,qn2x93,1636085272,How to take the next step,"I've (20M) known this girl for about 9 months, after we both moved down to college for spring semester of our freshman year. Throughout the semester, we would get dinner a couple of times a week and even sometimes just go for walks around campus. This year, she's been super busy and we've only met up a couple of times. We have lots in common and I'm thinking about asking her if she wants to be my girlfriend this Sunday, but I don't know the best way of doing so. Would it be better to just be blunt and say ""Do you want to be my girlfriend"" or should I be a bit more eloquent about my feelings?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qn2x93/how_to_take_the_next_step/

96,qn35t2,1636086140,I think I might have my first kiss tomorrow and I’m freaking out,"Ok so I (20f) have never kissed anyone. I know, I’m super late to the game I’ve heard it a billion times, I get it. I’m going on my second date with this guy (22) that I’ve been talking to for a while (as in we texted for literally a whole month before going on a date… not the ideal situation but moving on) the first date went super well and I’m seeing him again tomorrow. I have a very strong feeling that he’s going to kiss me and I’m terrified. Not because I don’t like him, I really do, but because I’ve never kissed anyone and I’m scared it’s going to be awkward and uncomfortable for everyone involved. My heart literally drops every time I think about it. Is there any way I can calm the nerves down and feel less anxious about it??
