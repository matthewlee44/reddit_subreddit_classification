0,pdppop,1630216029,My boyfriend's mom has essentially banned me from her house...for being kind???,"My boyfriend and I have been dating for about a year now. He is divorced (about a year ago) and has two girls. One is currently in the middle of medical treatments. His mom told him he could move in back home to save money and focus on her health (this was before we started dating). Before you ask why we don't live together, I'm simply not ready. As far as I remember, his mom has always liked me and always been kind to me. Recently, I've felt she's been very passive-aggressive towards me. 

She is a nurse and out of the last 47 days, she has worked 44 of them in the ICU for the COVID floor. She's one of the hardest working people I've ever met and I admire her greatly. She has 2 girls in high school-- they are 13 and 15. To help her out, I have picked them up from practice and school and helped keep the house clean and cook. I've even gone to buy feminine products when they were needed after realizing they were out. I don't mind at all and have never minded spending my own money and time on his family. I aged out of foster care, so in a way-- this is a small family of my own. I also believe in being kind whenever possible because I never know what someone else is going through. 

Yesterday, as she was leaving for work, I told her ""goodbye"" and she simply walked out the door, thus not even acknowledging me. I figured she didn't hear me but also took into consideration how she has treated me recently. I sent my boyfriend a text and asked if I had done something to upset her-- he replied and said ""I'm sure you haven't, she probably didn't hear you and is exhausted from work."" I didn't think a second thought of it and went on about my day. Not even an hour later, he came back and explained apparently she was upset. She sent in their family group chat a long message about how it was incredibly disrespectful for there to be people (me) at the house when she is not there. In the past she has told us multiple times there was never an issue with me being there even if she isn't there, I just cannot stay the night. I completely understood and have always gone home no later than midnight. My boyfriend, his two sisters, and brother all defended me saying how much of a help I am and how grateful they are to have me around. She works nights and is gone by dinner time. Her daughters explain that it's nice to have dinner and not have to order food. The mother replied saying it wasn't any of my business to be picking them up from school (I had permission), cooking, cleaning, or anything else of the sort. She continued by saying that there are not to be guests at the house ever, no one is allowed to cook when she isn't there, and if she is there, she is usually sleeping--so no guest over then either. She said it wasn't personal just a matter of disrespect. I mean---this woman had a super messy kitchen, I spent an hour cleaning it--and she actually got FURIOUS that I cleaned it. She said it was an invasion of privacy and an incredibly rude thing to do.

Today we celebrated his grandmother's birthday, she spoke to everyone except for my boyfriend and me. She didn't even acknowledge us or his kids. It was like we weren't even there. Not only was this humiliating, but it really angered me because for someone who said it wasn't personal--it felt very personal. 

&amp;#x200B;

I really want to send her a message or try and talk to her and explain how this made me feel. I don't know if this is a response from overworking or if I had done something to offend her and wasn't aware. But, I'm actually kinda upset about how she handled it. Am I the asshole? Was I too kind? Did I overstep?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pdppop/my_boyfriends_mom_has_essentially_banned_me_from/

Long story short, I'm a vendor at a Flea Market, working with my mom ( I don't want to embarrass myself, or make a scene) I see this lady, everyday I'm there, somedays I greet her (sometimes walking with family, so hard to talk more), somedays I act like I'm too busy moving items, and she still greets me (is she just being nice, and am I that lonely lol?) but I'm too chicken to say anything else, or introduce myself (in fear of saying something, that will make me look stupid.) How do I keep the conversation going and escalate it to something more, after just saying something simple about how the weather is, or how's business doing? We always make eye contact (kind of hard to smile with the mask) or (I'm a creep staring at her, and she's looking back, like what's wrong with dude) when she walks by.

We met on a dating app and we had been having decent conversations for a couple weeks and decided to meet up at a restaurant. I am open with likes, dislikes, deal breakers, me being a single parent, my disability, and my appearance.  I always include a few photos in the hopes people know what they're getting into.  I get there early, as I do for everything and I'm there for about an hour when I receive a text. It's from her and she tells me that she changed her mind. She then said that she was sorry but she didn't realize that I was that heavy.  She at least tried to sound nice as I've been called worse. Anyway, I froze and broke down crying after telling the waitress I'd be dining alone after all. I waited there, eating for a couple hours until everyone that had seen me cry had left. I get stood up a lot and I know my weight isn't for everyone. I get that. But I've been single for 10 years now and I'm just getting so tired of stuff like this happening.

He invited me again for third time at his apt and this time we went all the way through and had sex.

On the dates he was really nice too, paid, respectful, but he is kinda quiet and has serious face. He is phd very smart guy, so I wonder if it's his nature. But he did take care of me like got me tea I liked without asking. But now 3rd time we met and I had sex (yesterday) and he hasn't reached out, do you think he thinks I'm just some easy girl?

9,pdqbub,1630219168,Hilarious Dating Catastrophe,"I'm visiting Athens, matched with a nice Russian/Israeli hippie woman the next day we arranged to meet.

It started so well... a light lunch, a bit of ice cream, some coffee. She seemed a bit intense/argumentative but I'm pretty good at avoiding conflict etc and I managed to keep it light hearted.

She invited me to her apartment which was cute and bohemian, first thing she did was get naked and slide into her little makeshift pool on her balcony so I joined: so far so James Bond - all going very well and we spent an hour or so chatting and cooling in the sun.

She mentioned that she is a massage therapist so I offered to give her a massage (I love to give them) - we discussed boundaries and she was up for it. 

Then she asked a single question which triggered the derailing if this so far very smooth hippie date...

""Have you had the vaccination?""

Wellity wellity wellity: spin the wheel or craziness and guess what the correct answer is...

""Yes of course, I've had both jabs"" - I said proudly...

...that was the wrong answer it seemed because, suffice it to say, I had ""triggered"" her: and for the next hour I quietly and ponderously nodded along to her one-way psychotic ramblings about how the vaccine is going to kill me, how I need to purify my body, how I can no longer give her a massage because I am ""shedding RNA spikes"", how everyone (even those of us who are teachers with Masters degrees in philosophy) who is vaccinated is an idiot.

She had mental health problems I think.

""Perhaps""...""hmmmmm""...""I'm not so sure""...I don't believe you need to be worried""....I said. But eventually I kinda broke... started to get emotional...and before I left I said (tearfully):

""I came here for real intimacy and connection and to give you love and pleasure: and you just can't let this go, you're not talking with me but to me, and neither of us is currently having an enjoyable time - so I'm going to go.""

She was upset and begged me to stay, but since she viewed me as an RNA spike leper I knew it was just a waste of time.

I felt very relieved to be walking home and away from her.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pdqbub/hilarious_dating_catastrophe/

I gently asked her to remove it and so she did after apologizing and saying she forgot it.
Now she tells me she doesn’t want to come over next time because she is embarassed of the fact she already knows my parents while i still cannot go to her place because i don’t know hers yet
She has reassured me that i am not the problem and everything is going just fine, but i can’t seem to make peace with myself.

We knew each others for about 1 month (we met only 7 times due to both of us working full time) and things were going pretty good (or so I thought), but unfortunately ended up due to a different way of thinking. 

Last time I asked to meet with her, she agreed but not long after that she started to ask about my intentions, because everytime we met I wasn't being very physical (almost never touched or hugged her)
Since the very first date I always made clear to her that I'm not a very touchy person and I need time to give confidence and open up. 

Her last message was that she is sorry but she doesn't want to force the relationship any further as things should have been natural.

The point is that I really miss her, and I'm not sure of I should write to her or just let the time pass and forgive about her all together.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pdrjky/feeling_kinda_down_hope_to_get_some_advices/

I'm in my late 20s, have never dated before, have confess/ask girls out before but they all only see me as a good friend. I do consider myself an introvert but not to the extent of avoiding people altogether, because I have no problem talking to people. I have a balance group of male and female friends. Have never really met anyone through a dating app before, I did talk to a girl for like a week, but nothing happen after that, but I'm also not a big fan of dating app in general. Anyways. 

Main topic. 

So there is this girl at a bakery near my workplace that I see and chat with pretty often, unfortunately because we are both usually on the clock I tried not to used up too much of her time. However, recently both our workplace have been slow so I've been spending a bit more time talking with her. The last time I talk with her, she mention some things that made me think she might be thinking about me when I'm not around, of course I could be overthinking. Since then I've been feeling more inclined to ask her out.

But my record with rejection, 5/5, has really been a heavy anchor causing me a lot of hesitation.

Right now, I've been thinking I'll talk to her a bit more and than eventually ask her out to coffee or something that would allow for a much more casual atmosphere.

There are several red flags, let me start with the one that drew the line for my feelings towards him.

- He is illegal. That is a crime. He lied that he was on a work visa. He texted me he wants to be legal “eventually.” But I’m not sure how long that is. I was also Interested in joining the military in a few years, and I’m not sure he will be legal by then. Our dates would be a waste of time. I also would want him to become legal before we get married hypothetically, but I think he things he can fall in love in an American girl and get his visa. I am also not interested in paying his green card fees and stuff like that. I have a lot of things financially I have to work on myself. He is also naive because he acts like he can have this huge bussiness career. I gave me a reality check and said you can’t even open a bank account now.
- he is everything my parents would hate and my best friend said she’s going to be pissed at me if I don’t end things. My parents are conservative and my best friend is very progressive, both don’t like the idea of him being illegal. I’m an immigrant and we view it unjust to come here illegally. 
- He’s also very poor. Which is fine, I was still going to give him a chance but through texts it seems our plan for the future is different. I want to own a huge house, be financially amazing with several sources of income, and be able to travel. He seems to want more of the cookie cutter lifestyle and wants our own money to help the needy. I’m all for helping out but it sounds he just wants to give oit own money away.
- Issus: he is kind in every way, he has nicknames for me, his voice is adorable, and he is a gentleman. Personality wise I really like him. I am unattractive to his physic tho but I hope it grows on me.

I WANT TO BREAK UP WITH HIM FOR THE REASONS ABOVE BUT HE WONT LET ME. HE KEEPS SAYING THAT IM THE ONE. But like bro, we’ve known each other for only 2 weeks. I feel guilty breaking up with him and I don’t know how to do it. It’s not fair to just have him around for the attention.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pdu1g7/the_guy_im_talking_to_wont_let_me_end_the/

32,pdulb8,1630241134,Last several dates have all been with people obsessed with themselves.,"RANT

I've (27F) only been to 4-5 dates in the last year and a half (I've some commitment issues I'm working on and am generally ok with being single, so I don't really pressure myself to date). 

As title suggests, all the people I went out with only talked about themselves and didn't ask me more than 1-2 questions (some didn't even ask one)... 

Usually when someone says something about themselves, I acknowledge it and ask a question or two about it, and not just to further the conversation - I'm actually curious to know more about the person, considering that we're trying to see if we'd make a good match. 

However, when I say something about myself, they just reply with another story/fact about themselves.

This has legit become a pattern for me. I'm starting to doubt myself and wonder If maybe I'm doing something wrong?? Is this how people communicate now? Do I have unrealistic expectations? 

The worst part is that, while some of these people were terribly obnoxious and obviously obsessed with themselves, others seemed fine overall, but still only talked about themselves. It makes me feel like my date is not interested in me as a person when they do this. 

(It's both men and women, so it's not a gender thing)

Also, for clarity - it's mostly people I met on Tinder and went out with immediately because I don't like chatting much - I want to get a feel of their real life persona ASAP.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pdulb8/last_several_dates_have_all_been_with_people/
33,pdulcd,1630241138,Dating a Latina and family gatherings,"I have been in a relationship with this girl for 3 months now and Im really enjoying it for the most part, she is from latin America and has been telling me how her culture is different for example, she invited me to attend  her mother's birthday party, I had declined for a few different reasons, one I had spent the past couple days with her and this had given me a reason to go home and have some time to myself, secondly I felt a bit weird about it, In my family we don't make big deals out of things like birthdays. She had examined to me that when I chose to come to her family gatherings, it was a sign I was committed. I had met them already at a previous family gathering and they seemed like nice people, her Mom can only speak spanish.

Anyway she was a bit upset with me the past two days because I didn't go, I guess her family was asking about me, Just by talking to her I think she has turned the page as she said she is not mad anymore but it brings
up the point of commitment, we had discussed early on what we where looking for (serious long term, monogamy)

I was having difficulty with orgasming in the beginning of the relationship, but It has not been an issue lately as in one day last week I cum three times in one day, but I often have my doubts about us. I often think about other women which I believe is normal, but I'm also attracted to a type of women, hairstyle/dress style ect. Sometimes I pick up on things I don't like about my GFs style and just don't say anything or she might try something new for me.

34,pdv1zk,1630243016,Should I Make the Move?," I am a bi guy. I know a guy who has openly stated he finds me attractive. Calls me cute and hot a lot, amongst other very flirty gestures. Like weird sort of almost-kiss moments. But he has a long distance partner who I think he's been back together with for a few months. Said partner has mentioned they are okay with polyamory. 

And I mean...I wouldn't mind at all. I was part of a polyamorous triad back in college (M/M/F) for a couple years. Polyamory is neither new nor a deal breaker to me and if they are genuinely open to that I'm in no question. 

But at the same time I'm getting some mixed signals here. Other guy is hella flirty but sometimes makes statements that make me think he just wants to be with his partner in a  monogamous way. So I keep my distance, try to remain stoic, and try not to respond to any flirting...even though I want to. I don't want to be a homewrecker and if he's committed I am *not* messing that up for him because I want him to be happy. 

So...what do I do? Do I continue to ignore him to the best of my ability? Or is it okay for me to give him a sign that yes, I do like him and want to take things further.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pdv1zk/should_i_make_the_move/

All sorts of dumb shit that supposed to get me to talk to you I guess. 

But here’s the thing, if it’s your idea, then you gotta make the introduction. It’s that simple. Ive been introducing myself to women for 16 fuckin years. Ive never physically encroached on any of them or said anything other than,

 “Hi my name is ___ , I saw you over here and couldn’t help wanting to talk to you!”

I made it very clear that I had a boyfriend and he was telling me he had an ex wife he still missed a little. We said we’d hangout with each other another time and he agreed. The original plan was the go to Red Robin get the fries and then a movie. He didn’t see any movies that he liked so he offered to show me judiso (I can’t spell it, karate) moves cause he’s been in a class for years and he grew up fighting so he was going to show me how to beat someone up. I didn’t have any ill intention, after he showed me some moves he told me later when we were leaving he got blue balls from doing that. Then he started to be really open about his fetishes and he tried asking me some personal questions and I answered a few of them. It seemed rude if I didn’t cause he was telling me so much of his past. He drove me to work and afterwards he said if I gave him some money, he’d pay me back, he could show me how to smoke. So he picked me up after work and then I found out he talked about me to his sister. He was really open about being attracted to me but he said there was nothing to worry about, that it happens all the time with girls he’s friends with for the beginning period. He told me he would ask me out if I didn’t have a boyfriend, but he’d still like to be friends with me. He knew the whole time he wasn’t getting anywhere with me. I told him on the ride home that idk if I was comfortable in hanging out with him again, he understood but said it was a shame because he felt good about a future friendship he said he only has a couple close friends and that he gets a similar vibe with me. And I feel really icky about what happened, I told my boyfriend this whole thing over a video. I just didn’t mean for any of that to happen, he was being really nice about everything the whole time saying I respect your boundaries.

Anyways, after 3rd time I started to notice he is a bit slower to respond , but he was busy with exams and stuff (final weeks), then I kept encouraging him and politely mentioned that we should plan the next date and do something different than the prior ones which were mostly us riding in the car and chatting/kissing.

He said he will figure out something but wasn’t really planning anything. Then kind of I started to not message and he also kind of didnt.then he replied to my story , we hit it off again , then I hinted again and said in the end that “Hey if you dont want to see me just say it to me”. He never texted after that , but he keeps following me / liking my pics.

We havent talked since ( which is a month), and I could not help but wonder wtf. I have an urge to message him something , to ask why he acted like this, or just to say why do you still follow me if you clearly dont want to see me again.

49,pdx0h6,1630249885,"[rant] 28M virgin, not sure what to do"," In a few weeks, it will have been four years since I’ve had any meaningful romantic contact whatsoever.

I’m 28. I… guess I’m a virgin. That feels difficult to say, but I think it’s true. I was in a 3.5 year essentially sexless relationship. I’m not even totally sure why. It started out with a few awkward attempts that didn’t go anywhere due to a combination of phimosis and what I imagine was performance anxiety, which transitioned into not wanting to even try due to the anxiety, which then was exacerbated by her feeling less and less attracted to me (which I only really found out at the end of the relationship). That was the only relationship I’ve been in. (She was also my first kiss). We met junior year of college, and were together until I was 24.

I’m not unattractive. In fact, at this point I think I’m pretty attractive. I definitely wasn’t when we broke up 4 years ago. But since then I’ve been working on myself a lot. Most notably I lost like 60 lbs (and gained about 10 back in covid weight I’m still struggling to shed), but I also started caring a lot more about my clothes, my hair, my skin. I’m 6’2”, 215 lbs, I have IMO pretty great hair, I think I’m pretty handsome. I don’t think I’m just deluding myself, I get complements from women not *super* frequently, but often enough over the years that I do think I’m reasonably attractive. I’m still carrying some fat, especially around my hips, and while I started lifting more recently I’m still not that built. But I don’t think these things are what’s keeping me from having a romantic life.

For whatever it’s worth, I have pretty well-paying job. I could complain about my career trajectory which has been kinda rocky, but compared to other people my age, I think I’m doing pretty well. Honestly probably really well.

I use the apps, but like a lot of guys I feel like they don’t really go anywhere. I’ve met like 3 people total through the apps, all pre-covid, only one led to an awkward second date. If I’m honest, I guess the date was pretty fine until things started to get physical, at which point I kinda ran away and neither of us chatted after that.

I also went on one date with someone I met through a friend at a party, which just kinda fizzled.

I don’t think I have the best pictures, but I also don’t think they’re terrible. Even if they are, I’m not sure how to like, suddenly become more photogenic. Maybe I just need to put more reps in. But it’s *so* discouraging having invested *so* much time into them and having gotten so little out. It makes it hard to put additional effort in.

I don’t know how else to meet people. I have like, zero game in terms of meeting strangers. Like I feel like I don’t even know where to start. Lately I’ve started going out to bars just to like, be around people, kinda hoping something happens. But nothing ever does, and I just end up going home feeling more bitter (which is what happened immediately prior to writing this).

I have a handful of friends, but no real friend “circle” to speak of, especially since covid. I used to be a lot more social with people from work, but my company is still WFH at the moment.

I don’t know how else I’m supposed to meet someone.

I’ve been going to therapy for a while, and this kinda stuff comes up sometimes (a lot more occasionally), but it’s been like years (months with my most recent therapist) and I’m not sure how much that’s really doing anything.

I’ve been starting to feel more and more bitter about this stuff. For a while I think I just told myself my love life was on pause because of COVID, but lately, it feels like the world is coming back and I’m still just stuck. My feelings about dating range from ambivalence (which I mostly feel like is a defense mechanism) that prevents me from really doing anything, to more active anger when I try stuff and still nothing happens. I’m so fucking tired of nothing happening. (I’m starting to cry a bit now). I feel like I’ve put in so much work into fixing myself, so much time waiting, and still just like, absolutely nothing. I feel so embarrassed about my lack of experience given my age, which I feel like just fuels my anxiety, about how women are going to be like expecting a certain level of experience, and me just feeling like this dumb naive child.

I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. I don’t understand what’s wrong with me. :( I don’t even really have anyone to talk about this kinda stuff with. I just feel so lost and alone and sometimes I worry I’m just going to go on like this and get old alone without anyone noticing.

And I *know* that getting angry and sad and bitter isn’t going to help, but knowing that doesn’t just make those feelings go away.

I don’t know what I want. I guess some advice, but honestly just someone to talk about this stuff with. ",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pdx0h6/rant_28m_virgin_not_sure_what_to_do/

What is this??","He’s really nice, respectful, and easy to talk to. On the date itself, I was nervous at first but felt really comfortable after a while. I didn’t exactly feel attracted to him though. No butterflies, lust, etc. I left feeling like he could eventually become a really good friend. He’s not my normal “type” if that matters. In a sense, this was one of the best dates I’ve ever had because by the end I felt a lot of warmth and safety and I felt respected. Very different from most dates I’ve been on. 

And after the date, I felt like I wanted to talk to him and cuddle and hold hands or whatever. And I felt very lustful too. I’ve been dismissing these feelings because they’re so different from what I felt with him in person. And I’ve been resisting the urge to talk to him immediately after the date since I have issues with getting attached too quickly. I’ll end up thinking I’m in love after a week or two if I’m not careful. And also.. I shouldn’t be doing that if I’m not really attracted to him, right? But resisting it does make me a little sad. 

I guess I’m just trying to tease apart my own feelings. For context, I’m used to feeling infatuated and rushing into relationships. And sometimes I’d actually ignore when I wasn’t attracted to someone for the sake of being with someone.. anyone. I’ve since gotten more comfortable with being single though and it’s opened my eyes a lot.

One saw his now wife for the first time while at work and somehow knew then. One met his now wife on a camping trip we were on, she was a last minute friend of a friend.

I'm not picky but let's be honest, everyone has his or her type. And people seem to be able to luckly just...find that type! I recently moved to San Antonio for school so who knows.

I'm in my 20's, tall, beautiful - honestly a great guy to date, but I seems that I have unreasonable expectations when going on a date with someone - I expect the other person to show interest in me, witch doesn't happen at all, so as result 90% of first dates are the last ones, becouse they don't show any interest in me, they only expect me praising them or something, the other 10% make it to the second date, but usually they are only interest in finances witch is sad - I'm not a atm.

One could aregue that I go on dates with worng people, but I always try to explain other, perhaps they are shy or just bad at texting. Oh given the current situation of dating world - no sex was involved in any of my dates becouse I'm way too shy about it. So the main problem is that I can't find the right person, or should I just roll 20 and push it through get married with someone who is self absorbed just to get some action.

So. In conclusion no women no cry.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pdxmhs/omg_look_at_hes/

57,pdxsz6,1630252445,What's wrong with me?,"Texted this girl and we hit it off. I told her I have issues with texting cause it's hard to get a read on chemistry through text alone. She's awesome and we have two or three two hour long phone calls. She's cool, chemistry is good, and I think she likes me as well. 

Since I had bronchitis when we started talking and I knew we couldn't meet for a week or so I suggested a Netflix date where we use the teleparty thing to watch a crime documentary (her favorite). She sounds excited and wants to do it. 

Then the day comes and she wants to postpone. I say something along the lines of, ""yeah that's okay, stuff happens, but I appreciate you letting me know."" She says something along the lines of ""yes, communication is key.""

Then after this point she basically stops texting entirely. I checked in and asked how she was feeling when I knew she'd be off work once. No reply. The next day...no reply. 

At this point I'm just baffled. I have no idea why I got ghosted, and its just eating away at me since I don't know what I did, or didn't do. 

The last message I sent said basically, ""I don't know what's going on, if you have just lost interest or if this is all in my head...but this is how I feel so you know and I won't bother you again.""

In the past, I’ve gotten super nervous around other guys I’ve dated, felt butterflies when they’ve brought up sex, etc. 

But there is one guy I never actually expected to like who I now do, and he has never once given me butterflies.

He has always made me feel like I can naturally be myself and be calm. 

Im not a person who is into a lot of sex talk, a ton of public affection, or flirting. I’ve always just enjoyed straight conversation and no guessing games. 

And he gives me that. Truly in the last six months I’ve known him I’ve never once felt nervous around him. 

I also didn’t plan on liking him. It just naturally happened at the moment I started to want to give up on all guys. First it was noticing things about him like “Oh he’s got a black truck, that’s cool!” 

Or it was “Oh he’s got a nice smile, that’s cool!”

I just feel that it wouldn’t be optimal getting with a girl if I don’t have these things? That I would be lesser of a desirable person and that my chances would be lower.

But not sure how to proceed (27M+28F),"So after gathering the courage (this was terrifying to me and at least I'm really proud of myself because of that) I finally got the guts to invite my crush on a very low pressure casual date (just go hiking into nature). I'm also proud because invite was so casual, like it flowed easy. Plus I defeated my crippling anticipation anxiety. As you can tell I'm not well versed in these matters...

The thing is that I got a rejection. But I am not sure if this is a ""soft"" rejection and I should try once more or I am just lying to myself and I should just let it go. Her answer was that she couldn't make it because she had chores to do that same afternoon (laundry, cleaning home, etc.). Yet what's making me hesitate on trying it again is that she literally said afterwards that any other time she wants to come hiking anywhere, that she likes it a lot. So there are my doubts. Should I try again in a week or so? Or should I just move on? Should I let her bring it again? I would appreciate some guidance/feedback.

For a bit of context we are both young adults (+27) and we're acquaintances and we know each other for quite some time (+2 years). Meaning that I see her like once a week more or less due to common activities and group of friends. It can be also that I'm provably hardcore friend-zoned already. Who knows. Also I liked this girl for quite a long time but just lately something ""clicked"" in me and made me realise I wanted to explore a potential relationship with her.

I don't know what it's like to be kissed, touched, or liked. I've been through several unreciprocated crushes and unrequited loves. I've just never met anyone who was interested in dating me. I've only had friendships with women and they all became too emotionally taxing when I developed unreciprocated romantic feelings. I've been ghosted and rejected more times than I can count. 

Nearly all of my friends, family members, and acquaintances have significant others. People much younger than me have more dating experience than me. My lack of dating experience often causes me to feel like I have a serious defect. 

I've wanted a SO for a long time. I want someone to share my life with. I want the trust and companionship that comes with a healthy relationship. I want to feel butterflies for someone who feels the same way back. I want that connection with someone but I can't seem to find it in this world. 

I don't know what's wrong with me. I'm not perfect...I'm definitely shy and a bit awkward. I don't think people in my life view me as an asshole or a bad person, but throughout my teenage and adult life, nobody ever saw me as dating material.

64,pdz08y,1630256249,Is it fair to say you are lonely if you're unwilling to lower your standards?,"Pretty self explanatory. Applies to men and women. 

A lot of us say we are lonely or can't find somebody. But how much does this come down to an unwillingness to relax one's standards? 

If you are surrounded by willing partners, but are just unwilling to compromise can you truthfully say you are lonely? It seems you are lonely by virtue of your own actions and not that nobody likes you or your ugly etc.

An example of a compromise I have had to make is tattoos. I find 99% of tattoos unappealing and unattractive, but i quickly found holding out for someone with no tattoos was a statistical impossibility. I'm still not ok with face tattoos, but I've increased my tolerance from 0 to 3. 

What standards have you had to or think you will have to compromise on?

It was all cool and fun. EXCEPT I was still a bit drunk with afterglow, and went off and acted without any control, and kept talking about all kinds of stuff.

80,pdzsca,1630258659,Why are women with boyfriends the only ones attracted to me,"Hi y'all. 

I'll keep it short.

I have a nice face, but also pretty short (5'5) and at this point fairly obese. I carry my weight well as it gives me this masculine ""big teddy bear"" look (people are surprised when they stand next to me, they perceive me as being taller from a distance). I have charisma and have a vast array of knowledge. I guess I'm also viewed as ""confident"" (very debatable).

But as a whole, I'm not particularly dateable right now. I'm broke, unmotivated, and have been dealing with depression. My weight is an issue (currently working on it) and just don't feel up to putting myself on the market.

The last few women I've been with over the course of two years or so...well, we hit it off and hook up but then I find out that they have boyfriends after the fact. It fucks with my head; I have some theories, but I just want to hear what y'all think. I have much less success with single women. You can argue ""well since you're aware they have boyfriends, you probably become relaxed and your relaxed state is appealing and sexy to women"" but that's the issue; I'm NOT aware they have boyfriends until after the fact. A couple shamefully admitted it to me and sure enough, their insta has the proof. And mind you, these women aren't no duds; they've all been fairly attractive, a couple even a bit out of my league. And their boyfriends follow suit, tall handsome well-off and....*sigh* nice, I guess? (I'm also a really gentle guy so I don't think it's a ""BAD BOY"" thing...)

Does anybody else have experience with this? It is fucking with me and I'm going to start screening women a bit more before I jump right into it.

87,pe0cnu,1630260421,Everything we do in life is to get SEX!!,"I think if we look closely, the end of the things we do, ultimately ends up translating into getting sex and all the rest of is the means.

Eating well, gym, college, earning well, dressing well and so on. Why do we do all this? Isn't it to have sex after all?

Even if you want to date/marry, the end of our efforts in a good part ends up being attractive and attracting the opposite sex or the same if you are gay.

We are not exclusive because she is too busy with school but she told me I lied to her two weeks ago when I told her I went on a date last week and made out with some girls at a bar in June. She hasn’t spoken to me since then.

90,pe0itj,1630260967,Ghost virginity taken,"Well, it finally happened. I got ghosted. I guess it was bound to happen at some point in time, and boy does it hurt/confuse you. 

After talking for a few months during lockdown, we finally went on a date, and had an instant connection. We went back to mine and things escalated and we had sex. Everything went really well in my eyes, so I hit her up to arrange another date/meet up. She said she was busy, and so we rescheduled to another day. Then when the day finally came she said something came up and she rearranged for another day which I agreed to and told her to send me the details. Then boom - ghosted. 

Please share your fellow ghosting stories, or how you got over it yourself. I think my ‘error’ in the follow up was perhaps making myself too available? I just thought that since we had sex, that I wouldn’t need to play the game of not seeming ‘too keen’.

Good career, hobbies,social network, in shape. Never been interested in anything casual. Been online dating, just had a few dates with a man who would normally text me 5 + times a day, had ignored me the last few days. I think he’s not into it.

94,pe0zay,1630262415,How should I go about this?,"I am 18M and friends with 20M. My friend is open about his sexuality and his sexual endeavors. He seems to be really into hookup culture and overall a very sexual person. He’s also expressed he’s looking for a relationship but I’m not sure how serious of a relationship he’s looking for. 
I’ve started to catch feelings for him. I find myself feeling envious of the people he pursues and of the amount of people that like him. I really do like him and think me and him could have a great relationship together if we took things slow and there was commitment. He’s hinted that he’s interested in me but I’m not sure if he’s interested in me for a hookup or exclusive relationship.
I want to talk to him about this but don’t want to ruin our friendship. I don’t know how to tell him these things without coming off as weird or obsessive in any way. Everyday my feelings for him grow and I RARELY find someone I like. The last time I caught feelings and pursued someone we were in a relationship for a few years. I would hate for us to start something with a lack of commitment and short lasting.
I really want to shoot my shot and at this point feel like I have to.
It’s important to note we do hang and talk everyday. I’ve also never been with a guy before so we’d have to take things slow and I’m not sure he would really be down for that.
I just want it all to work out for the best. Any advice is helpful.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pe0zay/how_should_i_go_about_this/
95,pe10ft,1630262516,Some Girls Get An Ego Boost From Friendzoning,"I know this is controversial. But if it doesn't apply to you or anyone you know, ignore it. I'm just speaking from observations. 

Some girls see guy friends crushing on them as an ego boost. They'll claim that they friendzoned a guy friend who had unrequited feelings. But deep down, its almost as if theyre secretly validated by it. Thinking theyre too hot to resist. 

That they're so perfect that almost every guy friend falls in love with them and they cant help it? The only reason most men think about their female friends sexually is because of their high levels of testosterone. Especially during theyre in their teens and 20s. Their hormones are at their peak. Its not always because youre objectively beautiful. 

Even 30s but by then, they've learned or found ways to control it. They could sleep with a chicken nugget, golf hole, or Ms. Trunchball from the movie Matilda. I think society conditions girls to to base their desirability from this type of thing.

27
Corporate Recruiter 
Single with no kids 
6ft 175 
Black
College graduate

I currently live in Ohio and I’m relocating to San Antonio this fall for a fresh start and new opportunities in my life then being stuck in my awful state. 

I visited the state and enjoyed Austin a lot more but was too expensive to live so I chose San Antonio and got an apartment already approved for me this fall. 

How’s the dating scenes and are the women in SA or Texas in general more hospitable and nicer than the Midwest women? 


I don’t ask a lot I just want a feminine woman who won’t discard me for someone else and isn’t full of herself, somewhat active and without children since I don’t have. 


Is it best to cold approach or go to events to meet women? My tinder account got banned but I’m mentally over using dating apps due to the low results and being rigged for women to make things happen and start and end relationships and conversations. I refuse to participate in those apps anymore due to constant disappointments and being unmatched after I asked for a social media or number after hitting it off with a woman due to her unlimited options it’s frustrating as decent guy to deal with shit like this. 

Any advice or tips of San Antonio dating or Austin dating will greatly be appreciated. I would like a relationship but it seems like situationships and flings are more popular I don’t want that no more something real will be nice.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pe14i5/dating_in_san_antonio_and_austin_texas/
