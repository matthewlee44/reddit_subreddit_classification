It's really difficult for me to understand because we rough house and play with each other, we've slept together, we cuddle, but I just can't get into the mood to commit to sex.

To add a little detail she lays in bed dead asleep acting like she wants me to just take her and fuck. She tells me I should wake her up and just do it, but my sex drive doesn't operate like thay. I need foreplay and there just isn't any. I try to give her foreplay and she just lays there... Sometimes she just falls asleep and snores. I'm not feeling it.

So basically Alex is when someone falls in love with you i mean really in love with you but you just cant seem to love them the same way now theres a clear difference to having someone like you and you just not give a fuck and hen theres them liking you or loving you and you wanting to return the same feelings but your unable to 


Now Rex however is the complete opposite of Alex the story of rex goes that Rex basically likes this girl that sits next to him in this class and i mean they talk and what not they exchanged numbers you know there friends now over time Rex actually develops a type of love for this said girl and valentines day is coming up so he plans out everything hes gonna do. So valentines day comes around and hes getting ready to ask the girl to be his valentines but then he sees her go to someone else someone whos a lot better then him in all aspects and at that point Rex onew that no matter how much he loved this girl she was never gonna love him back the same way he does. Basically Rex is the feeling of loving someone and i mean with all your heart but knowing damn well they will never love you back the same way

We had been platonic friends for two years at this point. I was ecstatic when he told me because I always really enjoyed spending time with him, we had incredible chemistry, and I felt like we brought out the best in each other and was looking forward to exploring a romantic side. Immediately after he told me he started avoiding me, acting distant and telling me that maybe we shouldn't go down the dating route. I was heartbroken but respected his wishes. In the months after that our friendship had completely shifted, even though he told me he didn't want to date he still tried initiating sex and tried hooking up with me. After a couple months of this back and forth, I told him I didn't want to be strung along like this and told him either he commits to dating me or we need space from each other for a while. He broke down and told me, and I quote, ""You're too good for me, I sit on the couch and eat ramen while you travel and make money, I'm only going to hold you back."" It was honestly one of those most gut wrenching moments because I swear I always thought we would be perfect together and I always voiced to him how much I cared about him. Since then we have both dated other people, but the what-if of ""what if N and I actually gave each other a shot"" is always in the back of my mind.

I don't think I'm perfect nor do I think I am out of his league or ""too good for him"" but I (27F) make six figures while he (26M) is still in school and I understand he is insecure financially which I think is the main point of his insecurity. I never made him feel bad about this, and on the contrary, always supported his dreams and ambitions and paid for our activities together cause I knew he was low on cash. He always makes jealous, passive aggressive comments about the guys I do date like: ""wow you hit the jackpot with that dreamy boyfriend"" or ""I'm happy you finally found someone worthy of your time.""

We slept together recently (for the first time!) after I drove down to the city he lives in for a super romantic weekend and while we were being intimate N said ""thanks for slumming it with the peasants"" and it completely ruined the moment. We've had sex a couple of times after this and he always makes these kinds of comments and it makes sex uncomfortable and I feel like I can't even be myself around him anymore and that the real intimacy is just not there. I really do feel like we've just gotten into this really crappy positive feedback loop and our time together is not playful or fun like it used to be. I just really don't know how to convey I care for him and want to date him because I'm just scared his insecurities will stop him from pursuing a relationship with me. It's just been hard to see him date other girls the last while, because it feels like he will give other girls an actual chance and wont take the chance on me. I desperately want to tell him how I feel I just don't know how because we live in different cities and he just never really seems to make the effort to pursue anything with me. I just don't know what to do, I'm not sure if I should put all the cards out on the table and let him know how i feel because then maybe he will feel comfortable opening up too or maybe just understanding he probably is just not that into me.

1, I only have her on LinkedIn &amp; corporate email - I'm not sure if it's kosher to use either for a personal thing. 

2, I'd like to ask in an easy and non-embarrassing way to shoot down, if she's not interested, without anything becoming awkward. 

Something like

&gt; Hi [person], it's been a few weeks since we met at [other person] dinner, and I feel we didn't get to chat enough.  If you have a free hour this week, want to grab a coffee?


In my mind, if she's not interested, she'd be like ""sorry, I'm busy this week"" and that's that. 

If she's interested, she'll agree to meet, or ""I can't this week, but how about next?"" etc.   From there, I should be able to discern if a ""you want to do this again sometime?"" is appropriate or not.

27F, I’ve been on and off the dating apps for years. I’ve complained to my mother enough and she has always reassured me that I just haven’t  found the right one, been hearing this since I was 21. I feel like I could have been in a relationship or at least “dated” if I went for the guys that have pursued me. However, I got tired of the ones I didn’t like back approaching me and have decided to use bumble. I’ve met up with two guys and didn’t feel them either. It’s only been twice BUT like I said I tried the other apps for years. My life has always been the ones I want don’t want me back/aren’t serious and the ones that like me I don’t want back. My mom says that she really loved my dad and she’s been with her current bf for years but I just don’t get the appeal of either of them (seeing them as if I don’t know them or aren’t related to them). She says she didn’t settle but I just don’t get how you aren’t settling if you aren’t physically attracted to the person.

Anyway, one of his friends asked me to come to discuss some business stuff we're doing together.

I have been kinda depressed lately and wasn't feeling going too much, but I figured if my bf wanted me to come I'd try to and socialize.
So I asked him, I was like ""I don't know if I wanna go or not yet, but would you want me to come?""
He said ""I don't care your choice""
And I was just like ""yes or no""
And he said ""I mean if you're just gonna be sad the whole time no""

And idk I just felt really bad. I didn't need him to say yes, but I wish instead of just never talking to me about my depression and getting annoyed with he, maybe he could check on me.
He listens if I bring it up, I even posted about how depressed I've felt on my small private snap story (with like 5 ppl or so, close friends) and how I tell people and nobody cares or does anything or even checks on me. 

I don't expect the world, or him to revolve around me.
And yes it is a me problem that I deal with this. I rarely talk about the extent of how depressed I am. So when I do it's when it's getting really bad.

I’m a 27 year old male who has never been a ladies man, as they say. I’ve been in a couple of long term relationships in the past but this is the first I’ve been single in a while. I’m reasonably attractive(I think), fit, confident enough in conversations with women, and I’m fine with being myself and not being overly flirty or borderline obnoxious like I often see shameless other men act when approaching women in public. Anyway, I moved into my apartment complex last summer and began going to the on-site gym, when shortly after that I started seeing this female resident go regularly as well, around the same time I do. Sure enough, I began seeing her in our parking garage and realized she lives on the same floor and I’ve kind of had instances where I’ll be going to my car as she is leaving her’s and vice versa.

Long story short, it’s been months and I see her a few times a week. I’ve been interested in her from the moment I laid eyes on her, but I’ve never really had a good opportunity to approach her without seeming too forward or possibly making her uncomfortable, and I’m NOT going to strike up a conversation in the parking garage because that’s weird. In the gym, she almost always has headphones on, so it isn’t easy there either. Attempts at making eye contact don’t go super well because she seems to be the type that avoids looking directly at anybody at gym, and seeing as females tend to get hit on when at the gym a lot, i can totally understand why. 

Anyways, my sister, who is in her early 20s told me that as an alternative to interrupting her workout, it may not be a terrible idea to simply write a small note saying something like “hi, I don’t normally do this but I didn’t want to interrupt your work out. If you’re interested: “ and then write my name (first and last so she can creep on FB to see who I am if she wants; it’s 2022 and I know people do that) and then include my number. The on site gym is very small, so it’s easy to know which belongings are hers when she sets them down, as there is a bench or two that folks usually put their keys or jackets on when working out, so I would just leave it with her things before I leave. 

My question is: is this creepy? I have never done anything like this but personally I would find it cute if a woman did this to me, but I’m also very down to earth and open minded so I don’t find things like that to be that weird if done subtly and not over the top. 

Ladies, any opinions? Should I just wait for the right time to approach her in person? I should mention that she has appeared in my “people you may know” on FB I’m guessing because she has friends that have mutual friends with me(and because FB is creepy as hell like that) and I’ve seen her profile as listing her as single.

If you make repeated 👀 contact with someone in a public setting there's a 85% chance you are catching their eye.... LITERALLY!!! 10% chance their disassociating, and 5% they need help with something... 
^^still good odds. 🤓

70% of my personal encounters of being approached by a M25+ in public has been creepy.18% were Gen X &amp; Boomers striking casual conversation (both M&amp;F)... 7% were from female femists (women who respect other women). 5% remain of people who were too intoxicated to introduce themselves. Hopefully I'm not alone in these kinds of encounters!?!

Anyways if your still reading...

ASK/TALK TO THEM  🗣
Their opinion on something physically related to the interaction ""meet-cute""... The menu, artist, an item/ activity. OR compliment their style, pet, book, merch they're wearing etc. 

We all SENSE bad engery/vibes&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; trauma. (The majority of us have it functioning in today's society.) WHYYY is it so hard to act on the good vibes?! They DO exist, right? 😅 

My next relationship will to consist of communication, genuine connection, physical and internal attraction. This is why I identify as pansexual*... my preference is mainly still cisgender males.
^daddy issues am I right? 

The pandemic made me realize humans are the virus. We are past the point of, you know...CASUAL SEX. When someone asks to hookup, immediately I think *Let me spread my seed &amp; grow your egg"". 😂😂

Women are over hookup culture!! I say woman, as my childhood as a *girl* was short lived &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; que more trauma lol. I no longer identify as a *girl* looking for a *boy* (maturity i think?)

I crave communication, connection, emotions,  intamacy with another soul!! Who 👀 and appreciates me, both internally and externally. Yet very few take the chance to even approach me (conversing with a stranger).

If you made it this far Self CONFIDENCE IS ATTRACTIVE, ""alpha"" dominance &amp; femine insecurity is not. 🤮

Frank refuses to give me a chance and I don’t understand why.
I have so much in common with him but he seems to only be interested in women that are models. I get him in ways that Mia can’t but Frank is so vapid frankly that he can’t see that.

I (F) hooked up with a guy from Tinder who was literally the most handsome guy I’ve met. He’s everything I ever wanted from a guy - taller than me, very muscular, handsome, confident.

We slept on the 2nd date when I went to his place to watch a movie, and it was quite clear from his part that he only wanted sex, although he was indirect about it. The 1st date we went somewhere out.

When I made the move for the foreplay (I sat on his lap, grinded on him, we made out), I _did get wet_ , but I didn’t feel _horny_ or aroused? Sounds dumb.

It didn’t get better even when he started giving me head. I did get aroused a little but I swear if I’m alone with my toys, I literally have a feeling that I _need_ something in me. It’s really strong. I didn’t have **any** of that with him.

**No judgment for the following please, but it’s an important point to make IMO** :I’m surprised this happened because a few years ago I used to grind on guys in clubs and I always got wet and aroused in the moment.

1) Is it really possible that for some dumb reason, although he’s hot af, the sexual energy/chemistry between us is lacking? Why? I used to hookup with a guy who’s “less attractive” per se, but even the way he touched my neck or back gave me shivers and I got turned on (before any foreplay).

2) Maybe this can also affect why I didn’t get that aroused, but idk: All he did during the foreplay was basically just kiss me back when I was sitting on his lap, kiss my neck here and there, and that’s basically it. He didn’t grind himself back to me when I did it, he didn’t really tease me by touching me down there through clothes. I teased him a lot and basically waited for him to do the same but it didn’t happen. Could this also influence the experience, that it felt like the foreplay was for me only and he kinda rushed it?

At this point I’m just thinking is it my fault I didn’t get as turned on as I wanted to.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1152282,public,nsfw,"Is it possible that I find him physically very attractive and hot AF, but the sex isn’t good because some sexual energy/chemistry is lacking?",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s3mvbt/is_it_possible_that_i_find_him_physically_very/,no_ads,0,,dating

I started to like him. One night, he introduced me to some people our age, including a guy named Jim. I was heavily drinking that night, and Jim was flirting with me while I was falling asleep, putting his hand around my waist and things like that. He even bought me a water. 

I had to get taken back to my room that night. All I know is that Jim started talking about wanting to hook up with me. John got mad at Jim and said he couldn't because he liked me. 

Everyone told me what he said after. I asked John myself, but he actually had a girlfriend the entire time. 

Later that day, John had left already, but everyone else was still there. We were all sitting at a table, and I was quiet because I was embarrassed because everyone knew that I asked John. Jim asked me why I was so quiet, and then what I liked to do. 

I tried requesting John on Instagram thinking we could be social media friends at first. He left the request pending, and then rejected it. I got really upset and blocked him. I'm pretty sure he told everyone I blocked him, because Jim messaged me the next day asking if I was alright. 

Jim and I are still social media friends, and John broke up with his girlfriend two months after we met. We're still not in contact, but he watches all of my social media.

I realized that I messed up and I told her it’s because I think she is very attractive. The mood is definitely ruined and we ended up just made our a little more and I drove her home. She can tell I’m pretty frustrated bc I told her my experience and ruined the mood. She kept telling me that “It’s not weird”.

The next day she drunk texted me while she is out with her roommate. She said she is very anxious when she is around guys just for her looks. I really like her personality as well so I told her that I’m attracted to both her look and her personality. 

However, after that night I can tell the flame just started to go away. She is less enthusiastic about conversations and I’m also pulling away because I started to doubt if she still likes me. I tried to ask her out again but she is always “busy with work and roommate”. 

After about a week since our second date, she send me some messages to tell me she “doesn’t have the time to see someone seriously but she really likes me”. I think I handled the situation pretty well by saying that I don’t want to be friends if she doesn’t want to date me. We ended up being very straightforward about our needs and ended things.

Back then I was more shy, now my confidence is great and I feel like having sex now, whilst out of practice, I’d be a lot more confident. My only issue is that i’m pretty sure my last two relationships failed due to the sex not being satisfactory (but again I was a lot more shy then).

Now this girl I’m seeing said she hasn’t had a date for the last 4 years before she met me (bad online dating experiences) and she says she experimented at university before that so she seems less experienced than me.

Im 28m. If a women shows intention on another date and has a good reason why she cant figure out the next date at the moment and says they will followup then I'll give them minimum a week and then maybe bring it up again. To me its a bit of a test. Will they treat my time and my feelings with respect or will they string me along? Are they going to continue responding to my text but act flaky on setting up dates? If so after a week I dont see an issue with bringing it up. I understand people will say dont do that, but if they have good intentions and like you, I'd think they would understand why you are asking and explain.   


If it turns out they never wanted to see me again, then I can easily move on. To me its just not a nice thing to do to people. I know its hard to say no, but stringing people along in my opinion creates more anger. At least for me. I can respect a no, but when someone strings me along I feel like ive been done wrong.   


There are definitely times where its difficult to know whether or not another date is a good idea, but if the person seems interested and your really not sure, maybe its just better to not flake on them for a week. Maybe just schedule the next date with them and follow through on it. Then after that you should have more clarity.  


So to me if the reason is because your not sure then you may as well get that next date and make a decision then.   


What are your thoughts on this? I know we are only human and stringing people along isnt always deliberate, but other times it is and the slow burn is soo much worse then just a no over text. I've seen people say that they are afraid of the reaction, but in my mind the reaction would be way worse if they got strong along right? it is for me.

I think he’s very handsome. He’s got beautiful brown eyes, an infectious smile, nice skin tone, nice hair and a nice jawline too. But my parents think he’s ugly, and my mom even said he looks like Steve from Blues Clues (trust me there’s no resemblance I don’t know where she got that from). They won’t stop bugging me about this, and it bothers me because they shouldn’t judge him for his looks.
