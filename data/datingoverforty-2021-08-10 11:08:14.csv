0,p1t3vy,1628614018,The whole ‚ÄúI look younger‚Äù thing‚Ä¶,"So seems like this is everywhere - posts in this sub, men I talk to online, people putting their ages as younger ‚Äúby accident‚Äù (üòÇ) but whyyyyy?

Man : wow, you look so much younger.
Me: this is what 47 looks like now.

Man: you can‚Äôt be 47.
Me: sure am and proud of it. 

Why can‚Äôt it be you look good, rather than you look good‚Ä¶ for your age.

Whenever I read I‚Äôm xx but look xx, I cringe. It‚Äôs like we are apologizing for aging instead of owning it. It‚Äôs like saying I‚Äôm 47 but don‚Äôt worry, I don‚Äôt look old like other 47 year olds. You don‚Äôt hear a 28 year old say I‚Äôm 28 but look 22. 

Is there an unwritten law that we should not want to look like we are in our 40‚Äôs? That that‚Äôs something negative?

Let‚Äôs be honest, we are aging and who the hell cares. Do I look like I did at 25? No. Am I 25? No! Do I have a lot more to offer than me at 25? Hell yes. 

I‚Äôve heard from many men how they feel they look considerably younger (and am sure it‚Äôs the same for women) and it was only true of one. And is anyone going to say to you, yeah you actually don‚Äôt look younger. Not a chance. Also, I have teenagers - not looking for a man that looks like an additional child of mine lol 

You are in your 40‚Äôs. And you look good. Not good for your age. Not because you think you look 30. Cause you are in your 40‚Äôs with life experience and that‚Äôs sexy as hell.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/p1t3vy/the_whole_i_look_younger_thing/
1,p1vbck,1628620456,It‚Äôs my first cake day‚Ä¶,"‚Ä¶ which is somewhat significant. I‚Äôve long considered creating an alt account in Reddit for being a bit more risqu√©. I thought I would like to have anonymous conversations with people on the NSFW subreddits and maybe post some content of my own. But my wife really did not like even my porn consumption, much less the possibility of communicating with strangers online or posting my own stuff.

And then we split a little over a year ago.

It‚Äôs really interesting to think about my growth since then. Posting some NSFW pics to the internet was, uh, not what I was expecting. And I have definitely not found much success in striking up virtual romance on Reddit. I‚Äôve found way more interest in talking with folks on various dating subreddits. This one in particular. 

And now I just spend way less time on here than I used to. Not trying to fill some void.

After being single all the way through the pandemic, I went back on Bumble and met a guy, same age as me. The attraction was immediate and intense. It seemed to be both ways. We got along and I felt immediately comfortable with him. He told me quite early on that he had been in a sexless marriage for years. 2 kids, teens, ex has moved on with a long term partner about 5 years ago. He ended it but they are now on good terms. 

He showered me with lovely messages, pics, good morning messages and bought me gifts. I can honestly say that I'd not felt that attracted to anyone in years. Ashamed to say, even my ex husband. Not in the same way. He was very open and I was the same with him. I thought I had an amazing friend who was also a lover. He deleted the app. Then I did too. 

But then, after we had sex, he began to freak out. Said we had moved too fast and that he felt like he was using me. Said he didn't have a lot of time away from his kids and to me, it all sounded like excuses. I felt sick inside. I don't sleep with guys unless I feel a deep connection. I'd been celibate for two years before him. Only been with two other guys since my marriage ended in 2017. I don't sleep around. I was devastated but he suggested doing non bedroom stuff to ease the pressure. 

OK, tell me what you think. I replied saying - I get it, you're not interested. I felt like the 'busy' line sounded like an excuse and he was brushing me off. Never got a reply. It's been a month. Next day, I reactivate my profile and he is back on there with fresh pics. 

Was I too harsh? Should I have accepted the offer of non bedroom stuff or was I right in my gut? 

I still don't feel over this situation. I don't share my bed with men easily and I'm still raw from this.

38,p30cw2,1628776644,Problem During First Sexual Encounter with New Partner," 

Hi  everyone.  I'm on a throwaway  here.   I (40M) and seeing a new partner  (39F) a year after ending a  marriage where my desire went without  reciprocation.  I'm in therapy and  I realize that my marriage  negatively affected my self esteem.  I also  started to go to the doctor  since I am 40 now and found out I have high  blood pressure.  I've been  taking one Losinopro a day for a week or two.

I   remember thinking, when I started taking my meds, that I wanted to  make  sure my dick still worked.  In the back of my head, almost   subconsciously, I was worried about these meds and how they would affect   my erection.  Like maybe I saw a commercial where ED was mentioned as a   high blood pressure meds side-effect.   So I tested it last week and   everything seemed fine.  Then I tested it again Tuesday after some   flirty texts with my partner.  Two solo flights and, we are good.  But   its still been in the back of my mind - like ""on these flights, is the   cabin pressure what it used to be?""  I didn't use porn, just imagination   so I probably wasn't as turned on as I normally would be.    My doctor   didn't mention ED issues, nor did the prescription sheet.  I googled  the  meds and it seems to be very rare to have this issue.  It only came  up  if I specifically googled the issue.

Also,   I am not a big porn guy.  I watch it occasionally, but I can use my   imagination just fine.  So I don't think I'm sexually affected by it and   the shit I watch is tame as fuck.

I   met an amazing woman who is kind and affectionate and affirms her   feelings towards me and it means the world to me.  I like her a lot -   and this isn't one of those put her on a pedestal things - but I like   her so much that I am still nervous around her.  I think she's hot.  We   were flirting on the phone and she mentioned my penis size.  Its   literally average.  As men do, it made me worry that I would disappoint.    She also said (being flirtatious) that we should just have sex  already  and if its good, we will know that we have good sexual  chemistry.  I  have always been eager and able to please my partners but  this added  pressure.  Again, because I really like her.

The   relationship escalated last night, sexually.  There was some cuddling   and one thing led to another.  I had an erection just from her kisses!   I  remember from being on this sub that guys sometimes in this age  group  have ED.  This has never been the case for me.  Its been strong  even  during alone time.  I was super nervous, like almost trembling,  seeing  her body, touching her, and everything was working correctly.   But when  the time came for PIV...  I'll just say it.  I couldn't  maintain.  I was  ALL up in my head.  I was hyper focused on my  performance/size/being  quiet/being hard enough.   We worked around it  and both had a great  time.  That part was awesome!   But this still  ranks among the worst  things that has ever happened to me.  I feel so  bad for disappointing  her.  I assured her that it wasn't her and she  really turns me on.  She  assured me that its fine and she knows that I  was nervous.  Also, my  kids were sleeping upstairs so we were a bit  restrained.

So  what do you think?   Was I just really nervous?  Was it self-esteem  related?  Was I  nervous to disappoint? Did I have some medicinal  side-effect built up  in my head?  Was it the meds?  Was it the pressure.    All of the above?   Am I going to have to start taking Viagra?

Women:    How big a deal is this?  She has been very supportive and   communicative and she lined up another date and told me that we are   exclusive and are boyfriend/girlfriend.  That felt nice but I am   embarrassed AF.

Doctors:  Can I take these two meds together?

TLDR:    I have a new partner.  She is hot!  I couldn't maintain an erection   for the first time in my life.  I had one during cuddles, kissing, oral   sex for both of us, but just as I was ready to put it in, it deflated   like a week old party balloon.

39,p30vj4,1628778240,Site recommendations? Haven't had much luck this late in the game.,"  Good morning, 

I was wondering if you could recommend a site or app here in 2021, been over a decade since I‚Äôve been on OLD. It‚Äôs important to me that I‚Äôm able to edit my profile and respond to messages on the PC, I dislike texting on phones.  

I signed up to Bumble which is new to me. I also signed up for OKCupid and POF several months ago but haven‚Äôt had much luck. Both those apps were a thing 10 years ago and worked great for me at the time. Here and now, not so much pretty sparse in selection. 

Did receive a few responses over the last few months but they were out of scope of what I was looking for.  I did take a glance at Tinder but it doesn‚Äôt have enough information on the profiles to know if I‚Äôd be interested and to be honest some of the things I‚Äôve seen on there cannot be unseen so I haven‚Äôt continued exploring that one.

I suppose I should mention I live pretty remote, in a rural area so there are no major cities, so meet up events and various flavors of that isn‚Äôt a thing out there.  But, we have corn. Lots of it. Does that sound corny to you? 

Any recommendations you have I'd appreciate,  today I realized that my situation isn't going to change unless I pick a new direction,  any one you recommend surely would have more value then the ones I've picked so far. 

Thanks!",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/p30vj4/site_recommendations_havent_had_much_luck_this/

He said yes, I agreed for number to be given away, and received a message the next morning. 

We went on 2 dates. Lovely gentleman, fantastic guy, great chat about shared interests and hobbies and perhaps some chemistry. Unfortunately we were seeking different things in life and thus it was not viable to continue. Wished each other good luck.

He did it in a text and wouldn‚Äôt really tell me why other than we both had things to work on and couldn‚Äôt be together while we did that. He asked to be friends, I said no because my feelings were too strong, and that seemed to be that. In order for us to, as he put it, have better boundaries he blocked me on social media. I didn‚Äôt block him because I don‚Äôt use it much and also didn‚Äôt see the point. 

About a month later he asked to get together and we had a month of texting, finally talking about why he dumped me and some hot/cold behavior on his part. He also made a point to tell me I was unblocked. It seemed like when we‚Äôd see each other he was pretty flirty which I finally called out. 

He said no, that he only has ‚Äúfriendship feelings‚Äù for me. I asked for space again, being clear that a) it‚Äôd be a lopsided friendship because I wouldn‚Äôt want to hear about his love life and b) I‚Äôd like to find someone who is attracted to me and I‚Äôll be too distracted to do that if he‚Äôs in my life in a real way. 

I said there‚Äôs a space between being active friends and banishment and that‚Äôs where we need to be. He said ok, I wished him well and figured we‚Äôd probably not talk for a minimum of six months. I fell really hard and it‚Äôs been tough to move on.

Nine days after that, I got a notification that he‚Äôs now following me on Instagram. He‚Äôs also liking my posts and watching my stories. 

This, to me, does not feel like the space I asked for and makes me wonder what it is he wants. Personally I would prefer to avoid someone who has unrequited feelings me because I wouldn‚Äôt want to stir up a mess.

But friends who are more social media savvy than me say it‚Äôs in the space between active friends and banishment - that it‚Äôs just something people do and isn‚Äôt ‚Äúreal life.‚Äù Is that true?

I‚Äôve just realised that I date a very specific type. It‚Äôs always really safe guys, where I have more control over the relationship. It‚Äôs always based around sex, and I‚Äôm always the one to end it.

I‚Äôm just curious how many other people have seen that pattern themselves.

I do wonder if it is just me, an old friend commented recently how as a teenager I was never as attached to boyfriends as she was, she was always one to fall deeply in love.

My ex husband was convicted of pedophilia after our break up, I had three kids with him and he was my best friend even after the break up. So it was a huge betrayal. I did love him so much.

The only guys I have had that spark for, have always been the impossible ones. The ones who live in other towns or are moving soon.

To me, staying single forever is not at all a negative. I communicate well and often to guys I do date that it‚Äôs casual, just sex, and they always agree. Then they become  attached anyway, so I end it before they get hurt more. Plus something about them always starts to bug me!

57,p3pphf,1628875197,UPDATE: Problem During First Sexual Encounter,"First of all, thank you to this community!  We had some great conversations about an uncomfortable topic across all walks of life.  You people are awesome.  I didn't have a dad when I grew up, so it was awesome to hear from some more experienced men (you know who you are and thank you). Other guys have had the same issue and its not the end of the world.   

Women, you really helped me with the idea that this stuff happens, especially early in a relationship.  You also had great input about not making a big deal of it.  So basically, I just told myself that it was 100% psychological.  I made myself believe it and I let it go.  As Walter Sobchak said, ""If you will it Dude, it is no dream"".   

So without further ado:

**I was long, I was strong and I was down to get the friction on!**

Deets: 

She is aggressive.  She invited herself over last night.  It felt good that she did that.  I didn't have the kids.  The plan was to watch a movie, and maybe cuddle and fall asleep since we both were up late the previous night.  We never got around to the movie, but we did find out that we have very similar taste in film.  So that was a nice bonus.  Eventually, after scrolling through hundreds of film choices and chatting, we were getting sleepy and decided to go to bed and cuddle until we passed out.  This was 100% my intention.  No expectations.  

Everything was cool, relaxed and it felt great to get close to her.  I was super happy just to be the big spoon and I was just getting sleepy when she turned around and kissed me.  She kissed me hard and long.  FIREWORKS!  I was firing on all five-and-a-half cylinders.  A little foreplay, yadda yadda and I was just. SO. READY.  It was fantastic.  She was happy and I was over the moon. 

Thank you so much everyone for giving me support.  I would have kicked my own ass into submission if you people hadn't given me such great advice.  

I love you guys.

I'll see you on my main where I pretend to be much cooler.

81,p49da1,1628952545,Overcoming differences in communication style and understanding.,"I've certainly noticed over the years that people, and stereo typically men and women communicate and understand in different ways. 

How have you found common ground and understanding in your relationships, particularly in conflict resolution?

With my last relationship, while I thought I was communicating very clearly, I noticed my partner would not pick on [language qualifiers](https://writingcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/qualifiers/) at all. And also interpreted what I said in very different ways than I intended in how I worded something. (Though I should probably clarify here that we probably all interpret things in different ways.) I found myself resorting to using ""what I heard you say is..."",  phrases. After a few rounds of going back forth with that I found that our conflicts were often based on misunderstanding what each other was saying. 

Though, it is interesting to note, that while I did expect us to learn and grow from these interactions, and thusly understand each other better and have less of these conflicts. It didn't seem to work out this way. I guess we all have some form of underlying issues or insecurities that get in the way at times of moving past things like this. Myself included.

Anyway, which personality traits turn you on the most? And which have the opposite effect? Also, has your view on this changed as you've gotten older?

He was two years older, had never been married and didn‚Äôt have kids. He was creative and career driven and was so much fun to be around. We dated for three months and started opening up to each other. We were not only lovers, we were friends. During this time he disclosed to me that he had a heart condition and he was diabetic(juvenile). As a former medical and health care worker this didn‚Äôt phase me. I enjoyed his company. It affected him though. It seemed the closer we got, the more we talked, the weirder he got. Until he finally broke it off with me. I was devastated to say the least. He would occasionally reach out through the next year. Asking how I was doing. We got together at one point and then he pulled back again. The last I heard from him was around Thanksgiving last year, wishing me a happy holiday. He passed away in December. I found out today. He didn‚Äôt use social media and we weren‚Äôt together long enough to introduce family and friends. I googled his name because I realized I hadn‚Äôt heard from him in a while and found his obituary.  I‚Äôm sad, I feel for his family, but realize that him pulling back and ending it with me was the best thing to avoid future pain. I also realize now he was sicker than he let on and maybe knew his time was coming to a close.

89,p4e4wx,1628968301,Long Distance - How does it affect the relationship?,"So first an update for those who may care, Surfer Boy and I are back together and going to try to make it work. This time with better boundaries around topics of discussion and ranting, and trusting that the other person will say when the need to ‚Äútap out‚Äù of a convo. Honestly, so far it‚Äôs been even better than before.
Something that has come up in my head about us though, we‚Äôre technically long distance. Now it is only a 90 minute drive but that‚Äôs still significant to the shape the relationship begins to take I think. 

So what I‚Äôm wondering is:

How has the long distance affected relationships you‚Äôve had? Or if you haven‚Äôt had one, would you? A 90 mins drive away is significant enough that it disrupts normal life. I have to get someone to feed my cat. I can work remotely but I am still ‚Äúgoing out of town‚Äù when I go see him. 

Some back story: My ex fianc√© and I did long distance the first two years we were together. He also happened to be a 90 minute drive away. We were both about 25, both in school, and we‚Äôd switch off weekends to go see the other. I‚Äôm convinced, however, that it allowed us to completely miss/ignore some key compatibility issues. Namely his level of introversion and my level of extroversion. I stopped having friends bc I was always with him or out of town with him. And you can‚Äôt very well do the living together ‚Äútest‚Äù by essentially staying at each others‚Äô houses often - but still getting to live your life. You‚Äôre basically constantly on vacation every time you see them. I feel as though I haven‚Äôt really had any boyfriend who I was this into since him (besides surfer boy), who also lived relatively close to me. (The why of that is a whole other post entirely lol‚Ä¶)

So, can long distance give you a false sense of compatibility? Even at this age with this amount of wisdom and experience?

93,p4gmoc,1628976870,Dodged a Bullet,"Met a guy on OLD. After just a few (lengthy) messages back and forth we decided there was enough interest to talk on the phone. We talked for almost 2 hours yesterday afternoon. I hung up to grab some groceries to make dinner (I'm visiting family). He said I could call him later if I wanted to. 

He texted me while I was shopping with a few links to places he'd like for us to go on our first date and tip tell me that it had been one of the best conversations he'd had on a long time. I replied that I enjoyed our conversation, one of the places looked fun, and that I'd enjoy it with him. A few hours later he texted ""Are you OK?"" I replied that I was good and spending time with my family.

Fast forward to today. I was helping the family this morning, and then went to the gym. When I left the gym I called him to say hi and chat for a few minutes.

He was really cold and abrupt. I commented along the lines of, ""why do you sound so serious?""

He responded that I needed to be quiet and listen. I was taken aback by the comment. So I just said, ""OK"". He made some other similar remark, and I said ""OK, bye"" and hung up. 

Then he texted me just saying ""idiot?"" I wasn't sure if he was asking a question or insulting me, so I just sent back a ""?"". To which he replied  ""the definition of an idiot is someone who thinks they're so smart that they don't listen to anyone. You need to listen.""

I said, ""I'm not sure if you're trying to insult me or not.""
He said he was, and ""I listened for 30 minutes straight to see if you'd stop and let me talk. You need to listen."" He followed it up with ""f*** off"".

I was stunned. But, I couldn't let it rest. I said I apologize if I upset you, but that was unnecessary and that he could have hung up at anytime. He basically kept repeating his earlier comments. So, I pointed out that after hanging up he had researched places to go (he just moved to the area) and shared them with me. I also mentioned that he had texted me that evening too. So he'd had time to think about our interaction for several hours and was still interested in talking with me.

He continued with the same comments. So, I took the time to type out all of the things I could remember that he'd talked about during the 2 hour conversation. It was pretty lengthy. I sent it over to him. His response was ""See, all of that. That's the longest text I've ever received.""

I replied, ""it's a recitation of the things you talked about. It disproves your exclamations and insults. You talked a lot, and I was listening.""

His response, I kid you not: ""OK, we need to kiss hard and see if we connect.""

Me: ""not after you've told me to f*** off."" 
Him: ""OK, just meet with me."" 
Me:  ""you insulted me and told me to f*** off. That's not exactly date material."" 
Him: ""Sorry"" 
Me: ""learn not to be an ass""  (a dig at his ""learn to listen"" comments). 
Him: ""Love You"" 

WTAF! ""Love You?!"" In 24 hours you've gone from ""best conversation in a really long time"" to ""f*** off"" to ""love you"" and we have never met.

I have NEVER been with anyone who makes me laugh.

I‚Äôd like to not be pathetic this go around. 

Humor. I‚Äôve decided he needs to make me laugh. But a ‚Äúfunny‚Äù personality requirement is as vague as ‚Äúmust be hung‚Äù. So many opportunities for interpretation there. So in an effort to classify what I mean by ‚Äúfunny‚Äù, I came up with Monty Python vs Mr Bean personality ‚Äútest‚Äù, if you will. 

I have never found anyone who enjoys both equally. You‚Äôre either a dry, British wit aspiring (unless you ARE British, in which case, well done you!), sarcastic filled, realism vs optimism like fellow‚Ä¶.or you think Mr Bean is snort inducing. 
I‚Äôm all for physical humor - I cannot ever get enough Carol Burnett/Harvey Korman/Tim Conway (fucking trifecta of humor). But Mr Bean doesn‚Äôt even orbit the same planet in the same solar system of those founders of TV skits. 

So how to find MR. AMAZING? Do I throw out MP vs MB and see what happens? Do I do that FIRST THING? Because nothing would upset me more than matching with someone and hitting it off just to find they think MP is overrated. 
Ok, perhaps finding they‚Äôre a reformed ex con that served for pedophile crimes would be *worse*, or WORSE THAN THAT - a science denier - but stop judging my hyperbolic sentences. It‚Äôs rude. 

Do I just scrap Bumble (because honestly, it seems everyone on there is either a copy/paste whore or has zero self awareness and sense of humor (before you come after me - I‚ÄôM also on Bumble, so shut. it. ) - and instead put a call out here, in the depths of despair (aka Reddit)?
