We have a third date planned for Sunday and there have been great vibes all week. She has sent me a couple good morning texts and we text a good amount of every day while also giving each other space during the workday or at night.

Near the end of the first date, we made out in my bedroom and after doing so on my bed, she made it clear to me she does not have sex on the first date. I said cool, totally respect that and I’m happy to wait. I still feel this way now.

Second date we made more physical contact but not in a sexual way and we made out again before I left to go home.

We haven’t discussed sex at all so far but are always complimenting each other and when we kiss there’s clearly an attraction since we pull each other closer, yadda yadda.

I’ve got two friends who think differently on all of this: one thinks that I need to ask her about sex ASAP and get the topic discussed. The other friend thinks that I should just keep doing what I’m doing since the vibe seems really positive even without sex being part of the equation.

For further context with this girl, she’s said a lot of things to me about taking time to open up, a desire to build on our relationship and get to know each other. I do know she said her last ex was a bad guy, manipulative and is why they split so I’m guessing some of this comes from her being hurt previously by someone she thought she trusted.

Immediately after meeting, we hung out almost every night for the next month and a half. We would talk/text all day every day too. This was one of the best months of my life, we were constantly having sex and we were never bored with each other. She mentioned she wanted to date me multiple times, and then suddenly, when we got close to actually entering a ""relationship,"" boom she freaks out. **She has untreated bipolar disorder** and shortly after that talk, she had a mental breakdown (as she calls it) and locked herself in her room, cut everyone off for a few days. She came back to me apologizing profusely, explaining that she's been extremely depressed and is not over her ex at all and just can't be in a relationship right now. She always would say ""I really like you though, we can still hang out!"" but I don't understand what that means.

It's been a month since then. We stopped talking as much and have only hung out a few times but haven't hooked up. I honestly cannot stop ruminating over the good times - it's KILLING me. I miss everything so much. I definitely developed mad feelings for this girl... I haven't had feelings for someone in over a year and a half (since my last relationship) so this really meant a lot to me. I met her friends, she met mine, we got really close, really fast. I've had sex with tons of girls since being single but none of them compare to what I had with this girl.

The other day, she texts me ""I'm doing my face and it makes me think of you."" She also replied to my snap story which she hasn't done in weeks. She's been texting me first every day now but doesn't seem like she really wants to see me. What do I do? We both agreed the sex we had was incredible and she says we can be ""friends."" Does this mean FWB? I want to be FWB with her but I don't know how to approach that. She was so obsessed with me for a long time and we were constantly having sex, I just don't understand how she could so abruptly not want to see me anymore....

( I might use 'guy' and 'person'  synonymously )

Being a nice guy comes with expectations that others will do nice things back to you. Nice guys are susceptible to getting burned emotionally very easily if others do not meet their expectations.

Being the good guy comes with no expectations of others. Literally none. And even if you have expectations internally but the outer side of you pretends to be a good guy then you are not one and you will get massively burned. Good guys never get burned emotionally.

So here lies the problem. Good guys suppress their real internal emotions very hard which makes them come off as unreal or robotic sometimes. Even through good guys have huge amounts of mental strength to stay charismatic and positive, it doesn't come off as relatable much these days. Depression is slowly becoming a big factor in intimate attraction as more and more people are getting depressed due to current world events which is something I feel is responsible for that. Ultimately good guys should show just a bit of emotions but not so much that it takes them over no matter what other people might do to break their emotional armor. There is a perfect equilibrium and good guys should try to achieve it if they want to find their other half.  
Another problem is that there are more people that would take advantage of good people then would not which makes it harder to stay as a good person or good guy. Also often times, we do not show enough appreciation to the good guys or good people in our lives that are there for us. We should always remember that they might not be around forever. So y'all should get to it if you have that one person. 

You also should not be a good guy if you think like if you give to the universe, the universe will give back to you. You should be good from the heart, to help other and be there for them because you want to. The thought of someone out there appreciating your kind gesture should be reward enough for you.

Another thing that bothers me is the false notion that other people will be magnatically attracted to the good guy. This is totally false and does not work. Sure you can uplift people emotionally by being ungodly positve but there will be no attraction at all so you should keep your expectations non existent if you are a good guy when it comes to dating. I have tried this and this did not work for me. I would love to see someone prove me wrong.

Being a good guy works in the long run though. It takes time for word to spread to that special someone you are fated to be with. You become a legend in their eyes while also uplifting yourself.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1161675,public,self,Why being the good guy is not very effective for dating in the short run,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/t19luy/why_being_the_good_guy_is_not_very_effective_for/,,,,,,,

However, last night was the first time we slept together (no sex yet) and he was saying a lot of very flattering things, and talking about us in the future tense.

I came away with the sense that he might fall too hard too fast in general when it comes to dating, which makes me wary. I feel like he just chose me out of a crowd and attached himself to me.

A week ago, I ended up seeing him for the first time in a few months and essentially just told him everything I wrote in that post. I also apologized for anything I may have said or done that hurt him or made him feel inadequate, and I told him I wish I had spoken up sooner because at the end of the day I just really wanted my friend back.

Surprisingly he was super receptive to me explaining my feelings, and after I was done he profusely apologized for everything. He said he knows he was taking out his insecurities on me and had been a terrible friend, and he apologized for vocalizing his feelings for me at the wrong time in his life. He told me that despite everything, he loves (awww) and cares about me and wants to be a part of my life. We both agreed we can't change the past (as much as we wish we could) but that we would make up for lost time together in the future.

As the title says, dating has always been very difficult for me. I am (21m) and have never had a “true” relationship. I’ve had pseudo relationships where we basically are a couple but when it comes down to the “label” we weren’t in a relationship.

I’m told I am an extremely handsome guy. I receive compliments on my appearance on a daily basis and I used to model for fashion shows that were held locally. but looks are not everything. I have a well paying job and I’m on a great career path that will set me up for the future. I am very athletic, not the big burly type but more of a tennis player/basketball player physique. I’m told I’m really funny and sweet guy. I have a multitude of various hobbies I enjoy. And I’ve surrounded myself with some of the best friends I could ever ask for. 

I do receive attention from a lot of girls but I’m not physically attracted to most of them.  Most of the girls that I am physically attracted to are 

A) not looking for relationship
B) already in a relationship 
C) I’m not their type
D) other

And even then, the girls I find myself “wanting” are also being chased by multiple other guys that in their own right have very good qualities.

I’ll admit I have some confidence/ self-esteem issues but I feel like a lot of it stems from being unsuccessful yet being told “you’re one hell of a catch you deserve the absolute best”. Hard to believe what people say is true when I remain unsuccessful.


I’m still working on myself as that’s a life long journey, but it’s a little depressing that I am as unsuccessful as I am in dating.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1161690,public,self,Dating is very hard for me,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/t1b06w/dating_is_very_hard_for_me/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,

People are making it sound like this is the only thing that matters and career, personality, and interests don't matter at all.

To be clear, I am absolutely trying to lose weight and don't want to make excuses for this, but is this really the only thing that women are looking for? I am currently in grad school for engineering and will have a successful career and also have a wide range of hobbies with a good personality, but I am starting to wonder if any of these things even matter at all.

To be brutally honest, is being 205 lbs at 5'8'' absolutely KILLING my chances to date someone even fairly attractive right now? I am continuously working on myself to improve and that definitely includes losing weight, but I am wondering if it is even worth bothering to try and date at my current weight based on all of the things that I have been hearing. Should I look into dating only after I have lost weight if it seems like there will be a 100% failure rate at my current weight?

Example: Matched with a woman who ended up being beyond my 25 mile radius and at a distance of 1.5 hours away. I eventually found out she also worked as a nurse, often times nights and weekends,. While we communicated well and had a great conversation leading up to that point, I had initially aired reservations about distance, did not want to set any expectations with talking, and when I found out about her work lifestyle, I really couldn't see us being able to make any time to date on the regular because I am looking for someone who is more so available during the times I'm also not working. I could tell she felt disappointed, but a large part of me felt like she was idealizing the situation before it even began rather than understanding the large hurdles involved.

This is one of those circumstances with dating apps that is just as frustrating as matches flaking or ghosting, because it's like you're connecting with someone who technically would be a promising match, but be it distance/lifestyle, it isn't going to work, and you almost feel like you're not making progress either way.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1161697,public,self,Matches who doesn't understand why circumstances will prevent things from working out,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/t1by82/matches_who_doesnt_understand_why_circumstances/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,

I wondered if anyone had any thoughts, because I was left very confused, not that answers really matter now...

We met online and right away she was super friendly, which meant a lot to me.  I usually, at some point, secure a date and stop talking, but she expressed a pretty strong interest in continuing the conversation, several times a day, for what all in all was about a month, though we only went on two dates.  After date one, I wasn't totally sure she was interested, but she texted me immediately after the date and said she wanted to go out again.  I sort of figured she was maybe shy and was more comfortable with texting, and that was totally fine with me (although personally I would probably text more like every couple of days).

Anyhow, I also tried to let the conversation die out naturally several times, but she continued to initiate contact, even the morning of our second date, checking to see how my day was.  And of course, a matter of hours later, she would be letting me know that she didn't have a romantic interest.

I guess it's been a while for me, and I felt so happy that she was interested and I liked her a lot so far and wanted to take things slow and get to know each other more.  I worry that I scared her away because I was a little nervous on the second date, particularly since something felt a little off--a disconnect perhaps between our messages and actual in person connection.  I don't know, I often hear people say that a man shouldn't show interest until a woman has, which is fair enough I suppose, but I felt that she had shown interest by messaging me so much, sharing somewhat personal things about herself, and asking me so many questions.  But afterwards, I feel like a fool, and that I should have read the situation better, and I can't help but wonder if things would still be moving along if I had played my cards a bit closer to the chest.  Then again, I wonder if it's worth riding things out with someone on the fence anyhow?

I just can't understand why the heck the wanted to talk to me so much?

I don’t know if you’d call it internalized misogyny or an idea implanted in my brain by society, but I feel weird dating men 2-3 years younger than me. 

I’m 27f I didn’t try to enter the dating world until I was 26 mostly because I was insecure about my appearance and terrified of sex, but that’s a story for another post. 

The first guy I actually started “dating” (it was only for 2 months) he was 24, he couldn’t commit to a relationship. We never did anything other than oral and I felt a little weird about that because he was younger. 

The second guy was 3 years older than me and we dated for 5 months, he also wouldn’t commit either but he was the first person I had sex with. I didn’t give our age difference a second thought and never felt weird when we had sex. 

Now, I’m not necessarily looking for a husband or even something super serious but within the past week I’ve been talking to a 24 year old, he actually graduated high school 2 years after me.  We have a lot in common and he seems nice but anytime the conversation turns even slightly sexual I kind of feel like a perv because he’s younger. I think maybe I feel this way because we went to the same high school and he most likely hung out with my friends’ little brothers who we always perceived as being so much younger than us even though most of them were only 2 grades below us. Also, in my close circle of friends everyone’s partner is older. 

If he asks me out on a date I’ll probably go, but I want to get out of this mindset that he’s too young for me. And funnily enough he’s probably more experienced than I am, so I don’t know why I can’t shake this feeling. I didn’t feel this weird about the first younger guy I talked to but I think it’s because we went to different schools and his age was 24 on tinder when I was 26. This guy is currently 24, but I’m assuming he’ll be 25 soon unless he moved up a grade.

A little about me I am an engineer for work, I consider myself attractive (but going past looks), I have a lot of hobbies like baking and triathlons, and I am a VERY outgoing person who loves to talk. I met some cool people on apps and in person when I first moved and they kind of sustained me until around August of 2021. I got past the talking stage very quickly and was having fun dating around. Well after that I realized I wasn't really interested in most of them so I cut ties and just decided to focus on myself for the rest of 2021. January rolled around and I started thinking about dating again because it is normally very fun for me. So I got back on the apps and started swiping and meeting people. I met this guy and saw him 3 times within a week and things were going actually really well. He had made plans with me on a random Saturday and then boom heard nothing from him.. I got ghosted! It was super strange and kind of hurt my confidence a little bit because it has been a long time since I was ghosted and there was no indication that it was going to happen that way. I then had a guy come over, but he is moving here in a couple of weeks and we have been communicating a lot so theres one ""prospect"" that I can see getting past the talking stage. So anyways then I went on another first date with a guy I met from bumble and the first date I believe went pretty well and then I just never heard from him... so I got ghosted once again. I have been talking to other people on apps and haven't met up with them anytime soon. I feel like kind of sad and rejected when I have put myself out there and nothing has come from it.

I didn’t lie when I told her that I found her extremely attractive but I don’t really know her much but I’d love to get to know her more and see how it goes.

One week later a male classmate texts me her and my crush’s friend group have been shit talking me and the “confession” was a dare between her and another girl for $5. I texted the two her and my crush with a screenshot of the conversation. She says he got it wrong and another friend dared her to seriously ask out her crush (me) for $5. She also said she no longer liked me which I thought was a lie cause it was so fast. My crush claimed she “hated her toxic friends” and didn’t apologize or give me insight. The crush died there but I was confused about my former admirer. I really liked how she looked and seems to have a great personality. My problem is, I don’t know what to say to her. I only really know how to act polite around girls and sometimes make them laugh. I feel like every day I  look more and more like an ass who used a bad excuse as a rejection which I didn’t completely intend. I don’t know really anything we have a lot in common apart from both of us being good at school. What do I say to be friendly and make it look like I want to be good friends or more with her?

We arnt exclusive and had that whole conversation cause we were kinda forced too but I coworker. She recently got out of a two year relationship and said she kind of hated guys now and didn’t want to hurt me so we agreed to keep it the way it’s been. We don’t really get to go out much because I had to go get surgery a couple months ago and she’s very busy with school. We do see each other at work though once a week which is when we’d go eat together and I’d drop her off after spending a couple hours together. To be honest I kind of chickend out a couple with her because I’m not very outgoing and wasn’t ready so our relationship sort of died down but we still talk every day. Right now though I feel very ready for her and I told her that I was which she seemed to really like. Out texts then started to get more flirty but after a week of not seeing each other it sort of died down. Mainly due to us not going out or seeing each other so theirs really nothing to talk about. Currently to be honest I really want her and even if that dosent mean dating yet I want to show her how much I care about her and all that. She also made it clear that she wanted me to start doing things (physical touch) without overthinking them too much. I do love being physical but at the same time I worry that she might get uncomfortable even though she said multiple times that she wouldn’t be. I see her tomorrow and plan to be more outgoing and finally make a move if the day goes right.

I treated her kids like my own, she barely acknowledged mine.  Completely unacceptable.

We had on again off again contact, but I was going to help her with her rat problem on a Saturday.

About 2 months ago now on a Friday night, a friend called and tells me this woman is running away from her boyfriend who is threatening her.  I let her stay over because my friend had company and no place to put her.  

This woman comes over, says thank you and a few things, but I show her my daughter's room where she is staying, and pretty much disappears for the night.

I found out from my friend by text that she's super religious and very shy, so I leave her alone. 

Ex comes over banging, shouting and calling.  I didnt hear any of it until she left I see her calls and texts.  She put 2 and 2 together and came up with 22.

I tried calling, but she freaked out on me and told me to F off.

I expected to clear things up the next day with the ex as I thought we might get back together. 

Because I let her stay, my guest offered to buy me breakfast.  I agree, we have a nice breakfast  and my ex shows up.  We go out in the parking lot and she screams at both of us, I end up getting a restraining order against the ex.

The girl was completely fucking traumatized by my ex.
She left, and I thought I'd never hear from her again.

Since I have written my ex off completely at this point, I start thinking about this girl who stopped me on the street back when my ex and I were dating.

I didn't have her number, but she told me her name.  I look her up and message her.  She says she's surprised and happy I called.  I'm trying to play it cool.  She's 32 and I'm....much older.  She looks like a young blonde Kim Kardashian with normal proportions, add a splash of french-canadian and native American.   We go out, one thing leads to another, and we start making out.  We hooked up for a few weeks, but I wanted something serious and she didn't, so she ended it.  Not a good month.

A couple of weeks ago, I get a call from the woman who stayed over completely out of the blue.  She is a completely different person on the phone.  She's happy, talkative, interesting. Hmmm, ok.  

She asks me out to dinner and I accept.  We have a great time and make plans to get together again.  

The past 2 weeks have been so fun.  It feels great meeting new people again.  My ex was a good mother to her kids, but was otherwise a giant failure in just about every area of her life.  I loved her, but it was so hard being with her.

The ""new"" woman and I are seeing each other now, but ,she is very religious.  As in, no premarital sex.  I say, you are a 37 year old woman, and she replies that she's prayed on it many times and that she will never have premarital sex.  pow, right in the nose.

I'm a very sexual person, so was my ex.  Sex was one of the huge pillars of our connection and relationship. 

Celibacy is new territory for me.  And waiting until marriage?  Damn.   

TL/DR; If my ex hadn't flipped out on me, I would still be unsuccessfully trying to fix her.  Instead, she caused a new woman and I to connect when we would probably not have, but now I'm dating a woman who is celibate.

I'm thinking I need to get out and meet more people.

33 yo female talking to a 41 yo male I met two months ago.

We live in different countries but plan to see again next month when I visit his country of residence. 

We seem to have a good connection (phsyical and mental ) and have a lot of common interests. 

However, I find his texting/communication habits a bit odd and want to know whether I'm over reacting or being reasonable.

1. Majority of our communication is via whats app! And even at that, our chats are spaced out by hours. His average response time to messages is 3-4 hours, sometimes it extends to 12 hours or more! Now I'm very busy myself so it's not like I'm checking my phone every minute, but it is pretty difficult to have a consistent, meaningful discussion if responses are so slow and received 4 hours later and then another 4 hours later etc. 

It's really killing the natural flow of our interactions. We hardly ever have a nice, stimulating back and forth conversation because responses are protracted by hours every single time. Because of his texting pattern, I  find myself mirroring his conduct and responding to his messages hours later than I usually would. It is so silly lol. 

To be honest, I'm getting very bored. He had told me before that he wasn't a ""texting"" person though, but still.  

I should also add that he will initiate conversation first if he doesn't hear from me. So I'm not ""chasing"" him.

2. We have phone conversations every week usually at my suggestion.  Our conversations on the phone  are an  hour long or more and very enjoyable. However, it would be nice if HE took the initiative to call first. 

Question- I don't want to come across as needy or clingy so I'm wondering if it is a good OR bad idea to raise this subject with him ie our pattern of communcation? Or do I just carry on with the flow?

Or is it time to cut my losses and move on? Maybe he simply isn't that into me? 

BTW he is American if that makes any difference or provides some context but I don't think it a cultural thing.

Thanks for reading if you made it this far!

My job usually has a lot of transfers aged 20-30 over the year in a workplace that is largely dominated by people in their 40s/50s. I’m 35M and over the years I’ve noticed a pattern with these newly transferred (usually single) women. What I’m about to explain has happened consistently (maybe 12-13 women in total). I would appreciate it if someone could explain if I’m doing something wrong, such as misreading social cues.

**Here is the pattern:**

1. New recruit joins my job and we work in separate rooms. I’m actually very introverted so I don’t go out much to socialize. Moreover, I don’t really have work related reason to talk to her.
2. Occasionally, we’ll pass each other in the hallway. Nearly every time, she’ll flash a big smile at me and excitedly say “good morning!”. I smile politely and say good morning back (I’m usually in a rush to go somewhere, as is she). This happens 4-5 times over the course of a month.
3. After this stage, the women now start to ignore me when we meet in the hallway. From here, they’ll storm past me as I say good morning. Sometimes, they won’t even hold the door for me when I’m 1 meter away from reaching it. It’s a very jarring shift for me.
4. Eventually girl has to leave due to her contract ending.

**Repeat**

I hope I’m not generalizing, but this has happened almost exactly the same for years now. I was wondering if this is just a massive coincidence, or if I was missing some obvious social cues.

I wanted kids and she did not. We were both still very much in love but realized that our future goals were incompatible. It was a mutual decision; we cried in each other's arms in the parking lot at Chili's that day. We have since stayed friends.

In that time, my views have changed. Mostly looking at the world during the pandemic, responses to it, and my age. (I am almost 40.) I would still be okay with having kids but decided it isn't a goal I would seek out. However, by the time I realized that, the ex was with someone else. I managed to move on.

I have gone on a few dates since but nothing serious developed. And I don't do hookups - I'm okay with FWB but I need some kind of connection. So basically I'm on a two and a half year dry spell.

A few months ago, the ex starts messaging me more heavily, and it turns out she is single again. We have been talking more, flirting a bit, steadily ramping things up. But she doesn't want to get back together, isn't ready for that, and tells me she will let me know if she is but doesn't expect me to wait around.

Well in that talking I realize I have fallen for her all over again. So I have to move on. Again. Feels horrible. And I don't want to screw up anyone else with my baggage so instead of looking for a new girlfriend I start looking for a FWB.

I finally find one. She's not really my type and it wouldn't go anywhere but she's in the same place I am - wanting some intimacy but not ready for a relationship. We go out a few times. We have talked about getting to the benefits part and starting to plan for it...

And then my ex girlfriend (who doesn't know about the FWB) starts feeling frisky. And we sext. And she wants to meet. So we make plans. And because I am making plans to meet up with my ex, I decided not to go through with sleeping with the FWB. With no benefits she ends contact entirely.

And now my ex starts feeling overwhelmed. She has second thoughts. Decides not to go through with things. Maybe she met another guy, maybe something else is going on. I dunno. I'm disappointed but it isn't like she owes me something.

Except now I have no ex girlfriend (who I am still not over, again), no FWB, and I'm still on a 2.5 year dry spell.

FML.

Not that it matters but was a 5 year marriage and I left her 2 years ago, lost 40kg, got my career to take off and moved across the country for a new start. 

So 2 years on I've been joining meetup groups to go on walks, nights out at the clubs, play sports and more. Now I want to say right now I am still over weight, when I started losing weight I was 170kg and now I'm a little under 130kg. So yes still fat and it is still going down. While I'm not ashamed of myself and have full confidence while out, I won't sugar coat it, I'm still fat. I think it is still affecting my chances at every stop to get girls to give me a chance. Friends, family and even complete strangers all say I'm a lovely bloke and any girl be luck to have me, it's getting a nice lady to look beyond my bigness and give me a chance I'm finding hard. 

Reason I bring this up as I was out with the meetup group last night, I knew some people there from past meetups. I had a blast socializing and even dancing (yes we just got some of our freedoms back here), but not for lack of trying no luck with the ladies. I helped one guy get the girl by having a deep and meaningful with him and giving him some good advice, the girl even tracked me down for a cuddle for the advice I gave him. Another girl I was talking to was in a group with others talking and laughing. I knew she wasn't going for m so thought I'd setup my friend I met at these meetups a few times and it worked.

There is one girl that I have big crush on, may even say I fell in love. We were dating for at least 10 months. However I had a period when I was pretty harsh on her(for no reason, don't know why was I like that). That hit her hard and after a month she fell for another dude, one of my best friends (he is still one of my best friends). Not long after they got in relationship. He told me that after few weeks. I was really upset about it but I didn't want to fight over it 'cuz I thought there is no way she would want me back, and didn't want to destroy our (his and mine) friendship (we have same friend group and I didn't want to make inconvenient situation).

Some months passed thill than and somehow I almost got over it BUT in last 2 weeks she is hitting on me (they are still in ""relationship""), (I didn't have anyone in ever since). We even made plans for the next weekend, even though I had pretty bad encounter today. I was with him at the barbershop and than we went home together(by bus). We got out on the same bus station (he went in one direction, I went in the other) when I called her about some birthday party that was scheduled on that day, 3 hours after. She told me that we can go get some drinks before that 'cuz I was near her home and so I don't have to go home just to immediately go back there to go to party(I live far). I didn't have anything against that. I walked to her house when I noticed that my phone is low on battery(I had to call my brother to drive me home after the party). I texted her saying that my phone will soon turn off. She replied immediately saying I can come over to recharge my phone.

Her parent greeted me, I set my phone on charger and we sit in her room chatting. At one point we went to the kitchen to get some drinks when doorbell ringed. She went to check it out, it was him, he came by. I don't know if she invited him so we would start a fight(she is not the type that make those type of situations on purpose) or he juts came by(both of us should be home till party). I didn't know how to act so both of us (me and him) acted weirdly. I went out about half an hour before party by excuse other friend is waiting for me near her home and said that we will meet them at the party.

It was just like that(don't know what they talked when I left). He is more of a party boy than me and he spent whole night dancing. Most of night, her and me were sitting at the table and I noticed that she was leaning towards me whole time. After party we all said goodbye but her and me scheduled some more hangouts.

Telling me “he didn’t want to be too forward but he’d love to see me again”. 

He has texted me a bunch everyday since, checking in on me after work, sending me funny videos and telling me goodnight every night. He asked me out again right away with a specific time and place and we were supposed to meet up again yesterday. 

He then texted me a several hours before we were supposed to meet saying he had to fly back home (instead of this weekend- it’s his brother’s birthday) to avoid the winter weather/storm in the Midwest. He said in his text he’s very serious about meeting with me again and he felt terrible. He told me he’d love to make it up to me with flowers and dinner.

I told him no worries and asked him when he’d be back so we can reschedule.

We went back to his place and I spent the night with him. We fooled around but we didn’t have sex. That night we were both a little drunk and I remember asking him straight up “are you one of those guys that isn’t looking for a relationship and that just wants to waste my time?” He replied something along the lines of “I’m not actively looking for one but I am open to one” he told me he is the relationship type and he got out of a short one that lasted 5 months 2 months ago. 

So later in the week we went on a really nice cute date. He invited me to spend the night afterwards but I ended up going home after hanging out a little at his place. We again fooled around but no sex. I told him that I need exclusive before doing that. At first he said he was fine with that and can be exclusive but I told him that I didn’t wanna pressure him to make that decision right now and he agreed to take it slow. 

Everyday we have been texting eachother all day. Then the following weekend we meet out at the bars when we found out we’re both out. We fool around again no sex. In the morning we spend all day and into the evening together hanging out at his home just chilling. Following that We continue texting everyday and then I get invited on another date with him. 

We end up having sex for the first time. (The 4th time seeing him) Before we started to I stop him and tell him that I need to make sure we aren’t hooking up with other people and we need to both agree we won’t. He tells me he hasn’t hooked up with anyone else since he first met me but I tell him I need for us to both agree we only are hooking up with eachother and he kinda hesitated but he agreed. The following morning he had to WFH but told me it was no pressure and I could stay however long. I ended up leaving two hours in. This was today and i’m feeling all anxious because I really hope that this isn’t just a hook up type of thing for him. 

I saw him today obviously but we haven’t texted today yet which isn’t unusual because the only days he would really go without talking to me were days when I saw him that morning.

The chemistry was incredible and we both expressed being unusually comfortable with another. We talked on the app all day before she asked me to snap, after which we spent the entire day exchanging voice messages. That night I went over and we hung out. We talked for hours and eventually had sex, and told me before and after that she wasn’t interested in just a hookup. She joked about how we were such lesbians while cuddling in bed afterwards and before I left she gave me a really long hug and talked about wanting to see me again, and we exchanged goodnight messages when I got home. The next day she told me that she had a breakdown and thought she wasn’t over her ex’s treatment of her and that she still needed to heal. I told her I was happy to take a step back and that there’s no rush for anything and we continued to communicate.
