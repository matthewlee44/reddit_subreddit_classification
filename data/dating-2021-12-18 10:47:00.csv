0,rjbfcd,1639846297,Are my psrtners new friends racists?,"Happy, loving interracial international couple here with lots of experience in each other's culture and families. Been together 3.5 years, traveled the world together (11 countries) and we feel well understood by each other. We recently got a place in the US and are trying to socialize. Im very good at that but its not as easy for my partner and his rugby team is pretty much the only place he can create bonds (except work). However my [25f] partner [30m] has a new group of friends - whenever i join the group, as the only POC, i can feel an instant change in attitude, diversion of eyes etc etc. It also feels like they go out of their way to exclude me when im stamding right there. Its generally more awkward than it needs to be and this is surprising because new people join the group pretty much every week and i dont see them being treated as dismissively as i do. This is weird because im very much a social butterfly, and pride myself on being a good listener, funny, genuine and very personable. Currently living in the US, i obviously have been in many allwhite spaces and do not feel like i get this reaction every time. Additionally at least a quarter of the guys are Trumpers, which obviously doesn't mean they are definitely racists (in our home countries we are both politically conservative though we aren't in the US) but combined with other feelings, I'm not sure how to read that. One of these guys also frequently jokes about African American culture and has mixed up the name of the one black member on their rugby team. Ive once before made a big deal of a friend my partner had that had all wrong vibes and said some weird things and my partner understood, apologized to me, confronted him and we cut ties with them. I don't want to do that over and over again, especially since rugby is pretty much his only socialization. Am I overthinking this? Ive met this group of new friends 3 times and its the same deal everytime.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rjbfcd/are_my_psrtners_new_friends_racists/
1,rjbk1w,1639846695,How to impress a nerdy girl who is straight A student and/or is goal orientated if you're not so successful/rich yourself?,"I got inspired by a thread posted just recently on this forum, which I'm not gonna link, because he was a bit of an a\*\*hole.  And.... also my own desire for a nice girl and not a h\*e. 

I know I'm weird. It's not that I can't get the pretty and stupid ones. Don't wanna give up too much info about myself, but I'm not ugly, I can tell you that. But I prefer being with someone who does something with her life.

I just prefer smart ones, even if they're not so attractive(still fit, or at least not fat(sorry, it is what it is)). Ones who behave nice (basically how a girl/woman would behave), is doing good at school and/or has a career. Who prefers to read books instead of partying and do other nerd stuff instead. Yeah, those exist.

So I was wondering - guys who date those kind of girls and not some basic b!ches, what did u do to win them? I'm currently back to school at age of 25 and looks like I finally got my sh\*t together with school and work. What should I do to impress those kind of girls?

Lately I’ve been scared to ask girls out thinking they see me as unable to please them. I know I can do all of the above but I truly believe no women would look at me and think I’m sexy due to the chair. 

Am I wrong ladies? I want to hear your opinions on this. Give it to me raw don’t worry about hurting no feelings because if I was sensitive I wouldn’t have asked. 

Part of me is like hey wait for that right girl to come along then another part of me know that women don’t really approach guys too often unless she can’t resist you. 

So should I slap fear on its face and just get out here start talking to women? I sometimes overthink how some women gets mad when a guy they don’t find attractive approach them and try make a connection then  there’s those opportunities we miss by not saying nothing.

We got breakfast in a cafe, and his stance on me(developing our relationship) was the same.


After keep texting everyday for a week, he visited my city again and we went on the 2nd date(without hookup). 
While drinking coffee, he said
 ""Even if I know we are going to take things slow, I just want to focus on you. Don't worry, getting into relationship will be far from now but I just want to only focus on you. How do you think?""

After texting everyday for a week again,  tomorrow is our 3rd date and I'm going to his city this time.


And while thinking about him... I just realized I didn't get the exact meaning when he said he wanted to only focus on me and he wanted me to do so.
Does that mean he wants us to be exclusive from now on? Or was it just a sentence?

I thought she was just playing with my hand, until she outstretched it and applied her palm and fingers against mine:

""You have really small hands""

I looked over and noticed mine were slightly bigger than hers during this comparison of hers and made a point of it, but she noted she was small and petite so that was saying something about them.

She did some pretty awful other kinds of comparisons, so I put it down to her being insensitive and a weirdo.

i have a bestfriend (Let's call him ""Alex"") who's 7 years younger than me

I'm 31 (Female) and he's 24 years old

We have a group of friends and we're very close (Like a family) and i'm the oldest one (the 2nd oldest is 30) and Alex is the youngest of the group

I met Alex when we were kids, he was only 7 and i was 14 and he was a really shy kid, didn't really have any friends so my mum asked me to become friends with him, well we became really close friends eventually, i would always talk to him first since he doesn't really start talking until someone starts first, we play games, there's this lake nearby our house and no one really goes there and it has become our favorite place to hangout, especially when we see the sun set and that's when it's our que to go home

few years later and we met bunch of our friends and we became a group, more like a family, Alex and i are still close as before, sometimes one of our friends would joke about it which i didn't pay any mind to it

We both care about eachother, and know our habits and what we like and don't like, despite of me being older i was actually the one who's a cry baby, emotional (But no i'm not a childish person) and he was the one who acts strong one (even after i catched him crying when he watched titanic)And him being shy was slowly disappearing and starts being a playful friend (playfully disses us and especially me being an old grandma, which i don't mind, i have patience toward kids)

He seems to know me really well, i think more than anyone who's close to me, he's an observant type

He always makes me laugh with his jokes and when does funny things, he's also obsessed with kiwis (which i despise with my soul) but it makes him get in a good mood when he's down so i do buy it for him

6 years ago Alex told me he liked me, that time i did have an attraction to him but he was only 18 that time and thought maybe i'm just his ideal type of girl and it's just a small crush (well most teens has a crush right? i did too when i was in HS) 
so i shrugged it off and told him that he's just young and it's just a crush, he did deny that and told me he was sure about his feeling but i kept my word, he's a teen and and i'm adult and that is not right

We decided to drop that topic and continued to be friends like nothing happened, but he started to hug me and tried to flirt but failed

3 years later i started to have feelings for him and it was really bothering me, never told anyone because they might find me weird to like someone younger, i started to see him as an adult but i feel insecure, he still kept being affectionate with me, i get nervous whenever he's close and i always see his face in my mind and dream

Few weeks ago he confessed again to me and i told him about our age difference, he lashed out saying he's an adult now and age doesn't matter (He's not the type to get angry easily but i think he get fed up with me thinking about our age), He left after that and it's been awhile and he's avoiding me, doesn't answer my texts or calls and he mostly stays at his apartment, even our friends starts to notice, they told me he really did have feelings for me and it was obvious to them and they aren't gonna judge us if we became together

32,rje2p7,1639854084,For the women who feel that they may not be able to find a partner and the men who reject women just because of a lack of initial physical attraction.,"Looks are far, far from everything. If you think being attracted to is the most important thing while finding a partner, you'll be wrong. Sure, initial physical attraction is great, but for many a cases, it's not necessary. Plenty of men will overlook looks if we mesh really well and you have an amazing personality. 

I did! And I still am with the woman 😊

I did not find my wife remotely physically or sexually attractive at first. We were friends, found out she had a crush on me for over a year from a mutual friend, thought about letting her down easy since I felt absolutely nothing for her other than being a friend, but my boys group made me realize that she's a super sweet woman and I ought to give her a chance, and we'll have been together for 7 years somewhere in March 2022. 

Hell, in general, a fair few of male friends are with/married to women who they didn't find attractive at first, but now, due to emotions, we feel that they're the sexiest thing on earth. So boys, try and be mature about it, and then, you'll end up finding a gem.

I (M29) don't have much dating experience, so I could really use some advice. I matched with this girl on a dating app about a week ago. We quickly exchanged numbers and have had very long texting conversations ever since. She was in an 8 year relationship that ended pretty badly and she's been single less than a year now. Her ex moved on super fast. She's very interested in meeting up and hanging out asap. 

Everything seems great except I worry that I'm just a rebound. She brings up her ex a fair amount in conversations, which is understandable since she spent 8 years with this person. It just seems like a year isn't much time to get over such a long relationship, especially when she was blindsided by the breakup. Maybe I'm wrong.

Hi everyone,

For the longest time I have struggled with dating. Girls were never into me, I was never into them. Since Covid started, I had a “glow up” where I improved myself in multiple ways and now I am the best version of myself.

For the first time, I am going out on a date with someone. She’s very pretty and a very cool person. However, I am kind of conflicted. 

I know I am not committed to anybody right now but if this girl ends up liking me and wanting more, I can’t help to think that I want to meet multiple women first. At the same time though, I have never gotten an opportunity like this before (going out on a date).

So my problem here is, should I just try to date her and attempt a relationship (if we click) or should I pursue more women and see who fits best with me. I don’t know if I will get an opportunity like this again.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rje6nj/19m_please_help_should_i_date_more_than_one/

40,rjejer,1639855424,"Went on a coffee date with a cute girl, had an hour, 10 minute conversation. Not sure if she's interested.","Greetings,

First, some exposition: I'm 33 years old, have 0 dating experience, but work in medical sales, and thus, am capable of surviving in social situations. I'm also reasonably experience with women in bed and am not too intimidated by them at this point.

I recently cut video games cold turkey and have started working out and dieting. I also have started using dating apps and am trying to get a girlfriend.

Anyway, last Tuesday I went on a coffee date with a girl (33) who was waaaaay cuter than she looks on the app. She's also very successful, articulate, and just my type physically; she's ""perfect,"" imo. 

The date took place at a halfway point between where we both live. So about 30 miles in either direction. We both showed up precisely on time. I was dressed like shit in comparison to her: well fitting jeans, a hoodie (yeah, I know), but well groomed etc. She was dressed better and in a trendy way (sorry I don't know much about women's clothes). The first part of the date went well enough, introductions, a hug, then she started firing off some cookie cutter questions which I answered adequately. To be frank, I started to get a tad bored of the generic questioning and started to shift the convo a bit more towards funnier, yet intelligent topics. One thing I took away from the whole thing was that she seemed very intelligent and maybe, dare I say, nerdy. I also didn't get a connection feeling from my point of view, she's just attractive and articulate enough for me to want to see her again.

Now, the end of the date is where I'm quite sure I fucked up. She goes to the bathroom at like 1 hour, 10 minutes, which I assumed was he way of trying to mix it up. Also, a homeless person walked in and sat down right next to us. So she comes back, and I go, ""you want to go?"" She replies, ""yeah, let's go,"" like in this quick way. She remarks that the date lasted the perfect time for her to get through her drink and we walk out.

Lol okay, so mind you, this is my first date. While she's in the bathroom, I'm trying to figure out what to do next in this sequence of events. I text a friend, and we both conclude that I should try to change the venue. Personally, I'd like to take a walk, but what ends up happening is that we walk out to the side walk, she reaches for her mask, I get my mask and she starts saying something and then stops dead. I look at her and spend a brief second trying to digure out what she's doing. So I go, ""oh yeah, what was that?"" Motioning to her that she should say what she was about to say. She goes ""oh, nothing,"" and goes ""go ahead what were you going to say?"" At this point I'm like, ""oh yeah, it's cool if you don't want to because you have work in the morning... but did you want to do something else?"" I say this in kind of this nervous manner lol, but to be frank, at this point we are both having a really hard time competing our sentences. She goes, ""oh yeah, I have work in the morning"" like in this really quick way. She goes, ""wait, do you work tomorrow?"" And I go, ""uh I do, but at like noon, but it's cool."" 

Lol and then we both stand there like looking at each other. I'm patting her on the back/shoulder and I go, ""you're great, haha you're great."" Lol I say this 3 fuckin times and pat her 3 times. I go, ""sorry i dont have much dating experience(big mistake, maybe the dagger). She goes, ""oh really?"" She smiles, I smile, then I'm like ""alright cya later!"" We both leave.

Lmao so obviously not a good way to end it.

That was last Tuesday, my female coworkers suggest I ask her out again on Wednesday, my sister suggests Thursday, but I'm so eager to see her again, I go with Wednesday, which was probably a mistake. She says she is busy this weekend but would be down to do something next week.

That night and Thursday night I try to text her some more so that I can talk to her. She definitely takes a long time to respond back (but to be fair, this has always been what she's done). Haven't texted her today or yesterday, and am planning not to do so until Sunday to ask her on another date.

48,rjfawg,1639857683,One day...,"Was out climbing the other day in the local climb gym. Was really fun. Started lead climbing again. Feels amazing to use my body to its full potential again. And I'm thankful that I can still do it at 32. 

I'm just so thankful for being alive. Being able to experience what I've experienced.

About three years ago I made a calculation. I calculated that the city that I was currently living in of about 4 million people contained about 2000 women who were compatible with me for a longterm relationship. I was absolutely stoked!! I'm still single and living in a smaller city so I'm guessing it's down to about 1300ish. Still stoked! The other day I saw a guy on some random sub who made a similar calculation. He came up with a figure of 3000 in a city of about 2 million and he was absolutely bummed out by it. I thought to myself ""wtf dude?! That's awesome!"". 

Anyway the reason I bring up the calculation is that today I saw many beautiful and interesting looking women (I have a broad taste, something my friends have criticized me for in the past but I don't give a shit.) Seeing these women did give me a little pang of loneliness though. I so badly want to connect with someone and sometimes it feels impossible. That little calculation does give me some hope though. That maybe I'll meet one of them. I don't mind being single for a little longer till I meet her but god damn.

So my friend (26 M) sent me the link below and we actually both laughed about it and how oblivious the OP seems, honestly, I dont get a lot of options online, like I get matches but they eventually ghost haha and I thought there is no way girls would want to meet in person. I tried it yesterday...honestly it works pretty well imo. I know a lot of guys (myself included) thought OP was being condescending but yeah this is actually not a bad idea. So yeah, yesterday I approached 10 women and I got 4 rejections (2 claimed they were taken, 2 said they aren't interested), I got 4 numbers, 1 Snapchat and 1 Instagram, the girl who originally gave me her Instagram sent me her number after a few DMs back and forth. Ive had back and forth conversations with all the girls that gave me their numbers and the Instagram girl, I dont feel like I am carrying the conversation myself which is opposite to what I get on online dating. I actually had one phone call and she called me first! These are all women who imo are attractive and probably wouldnt respond to me online.

But yeah guys I think there is some merit to what she is saying honestly as condescending as she may be. If everything works out I have 2 dates in the next two days. It works I think at least try it out. Btw Im not like crazy handsome I can pm a selfie if you want, (5 foot 9, a little overweight) Im also not ugly lol and I have dimples so I think that may help. One more thing, 2 of the women that rejected me outright were Asian, Im black, so you may just not be peoples preference and thats ok. I got the best responses from black and white women. Anyways just thought to share this, maybe try it sometime ngl its nerve racking in the beginning. BTW I used the ice cream/ froyo suggestion the OP had and it worked very well.

Guy likes you. Is emotionally mature. Is talented themselves in many reguard. Has their life together, works hard. They like you. You and him both agree on almost every important issue.

But instead of focusing on the what ifs or the ""negative"" parts of yourself he would rather encourage you and adore you from the beginning. He is laid back and not ever judgemental. He accepts you for who you are now.

65,rjh4e5,1639863058,M/23 with crush on girl I tried texting with years ago,"Hey guys. 

Back in 2016 I had a crush on someone from my school. We eventually started texting back and forth until one day, she went away on a holiday with her family. After that I never got any text back from her. When I asked her best friend why she stopped texting me, she told me that she just kinda lost interest and that she didn't understand herself why she would not write me anymore.

After that I never really thought about her too much. Up until 2 years ago when I came across her insta. Since then I've been asking myself what she's been up to after all these years. I asked some of my friends, if someone had heard anything about her. Unfortunately, nobody could really tell me anything. 

Me and her never spoke to each other, but somehow, everything I was told about her always checked the right boxes for me. But since we never really spoke and only texted a little bit, I don't really know what to do now. I follow her on insta, but she doesn't follow me back.

I would really like to slide into her DMs on insta, to find out whether she'd like to talk to me after 5 years. Unfortunately, don't really know what to say to her. In addition to that, I really hate texting. I always hated it and I was never really good at texting with girls. But since bumping into isn't possible, texting her kinda seems to be the only solution.

Nothing happened in those days, we didn’t fought or anything. It took him days to answer to my messages. Even though he spended the whole time on his phone when we spend time together. This is already going on since 2 months. He won’t text me in weeks, if I don’t text him first.

4 months ago he moved away because of his work but we were able to see each other every second weekend. We haven’t seen each other since 2 months and every time I ask him if we can see each other again he answers “ I don’t know if I have time”. He never asks if we can see each other. Whenever he visits his parents ( which live in the same town as me) he always tells me reasons why he can’t see me. But in reality he is always out drinking with friends or having a party at his place. When I ask him about it, he always tells me that he doesn’t wanted to see me and wants to spend time with his friends. I have spent weeks crying.

TL:DR got back with my ex after 2 years of breaking up. Wondering if I made the right decision

My first girlfriend broken up with me around 2 years ago due to difficult circumstances and her difficult to deal with parents. We then agreed to stay friends since before getting together we've been close friends for around 3 years.

Fast forward after two years of the initial breakup I went on trying to move on trying with different partners that I didn't truly click with the same with as her. A couple of blind dates and couple of relationships that barely lasted a couple months.

 Frustration started growing inside of me until one day I invited her out for dinner just to catch-up as friends since that's what we've been from the beginning I didn't want to lose that bond specifically.

What seemed like a dinner invite turned into a sort of date. throughout this dinner the tone and topics shifted towards dating. After she learned about my failures she confesses that she hasn't been in any relationship after the one we had and felt like she messed up due to the difficult circumstances at that time.

After a heartwarming exchange between the both of us and opening up more and more we end up agreeing that we should get back together.

I'm having a hard time understanding whether I'm doing the right thing or if I've messed up big time.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rjhgqw/people_who_got_back_with_their_exs_why_did_you_do/
70,rjhhxr,1639864231,"Conundrum, need advice","I have a question and need some advice. This is my first time ever posting on Reddit so here goes. There’s a woman I’ve known for several years, we initially met online and she came to my city a few months later. We spent about a day and a half together, it was a little weird bc I was really busy so not able to make that much time for her. Ultimately she left with the impression that she really liked me, I found her attractive but something was missing as far as connecting with her went. She returned to her country (I live in the US, she doesn’t) and we talked sporadically. For some reason she grew to like me more and it was out of sight, out of mind for me. We both ended up in separate relationships at the time, but in 2019 she moved about a 2-3 hr flight from my city and we were both newly single so we started talking again. I was really depressed and unable to stay consistent so things stalled again, the pandemic happened and she ended up in a relationship with someone in her home country winter of 2021. She moved back home in summer of 2021 and I know I’m an asshole for this, but I started texting her a lot about missing her and she was in this relationship that was going nowhere. She saw it as an opportunity to confide in me about her current bf so I willingly listened but things got awkward when she suggested I get to know a friend of hers, who she insisted I’d really get along with. I pointed out it was awkward and she said not really since we never dated or slept together and that even though she was friends with this girl, they weren’t “best friends”. She really pushed it too, she kept sending pics, when I mentioned I liked something she commented that her friend also liked it. I made a somewhat suggestive comment about her chest size and she remarked that her friend’s are bigger and even sent a pic that showed her friend in an outfit that confirmed it. I found her friend attractive and finding out we have the same music taste and political ideas, I started to warm up to it. Same time the girl in question is on the verge of breaking up with her boyfriend and keeps referring to “us” as in her and i while simultaneously mentioning her friend. We even discussed baby names and marriage. Once her and her bf broke up I think there was an expectation that her and I would try things again, but as much as I liked her, I was kinda burnt out by the back and forth between us over the years (a lot of it my fault), confused by her former insistence that I talk to her friend, and at the same time intrigued by her friend. We had a convo where I admitted I found her friend’s Spotify and liked her playlists and she admonished me for being “super interested” in her friend. It’s just been weird. Now I’m at the point where I don’t think anything can ever progress with me and the girl in question and I’ve articulated this to her. But my conundrum is I want to reach out to her friend, I can’t ask her to introduce me (I’m not that much of an asshole) and even though I know her friend’s private social media accounts, I’d feel weird as hell requesting and messaging her. Was this all a trap at the end of the day? The idea of her introducing me to her friend? Am I wrong for wanting to pursue it? Should I just leave it alone?

He does it every time he can; we're talking about some past anecdotes and then he mentions her and something about that anecdote with her; we're talking about some opinions and then he mentions her opinion.

I can't forbid him to talk about it, and it wouldn't bother me if he just would have finished the topic in the first times, but he has been doing it always during these almost three months we're seeing each other. I didn't say anything about how it makes me feel this situation until yesterday, when I just couldn't take it anymore. We had a respectful and mature conversation. I told him if he has some unfinished business with her, he can continue with his life; I don't have any problems, there are no feelings between us anyways, and he assured me, like always, he never felt something for her, that just she got obsessed and wanted one more step. I believe him, the girl's tiktoks about him make sense with his version at the end (I needed to confirm it).

79,rji7d8,1639866356,The girl I was setting up my friend with hooked up with me instead.,"So yeah, the title basically. Here's the nitty-gritty. 

This friend of mine in uni has been crushing hard on one girl for quite some time. He was also super shy about it, like, could not approach her if his life depended on it. And his reply to my offers to be his wingman was that he will ""play the long game until an opening presents itself"". He knows all her social media and basically stalked her without making any moves. 

So I decided to help the guy, organized a huge party month in advance, casually came up and invited her and her friend. And since we had different people coming from other faculties it wasn't weird, so she accepted.  

The whole month leading up to the party I planned several get-togethers with my friend, her and her friend, just the four of us. So we hung around at my place a couple of times, met up in the city, cafes, you know, stuff that friends do. During those meetups I would start discussions about things my friend could contribute as well as she would be interested to listen and just took the back seat or even left the room for a smoke or something, so they could talk. At some point even got them to kiss as a joke-dare. Everything was pretty much offered on a plate, yet my friend's participation was lukewarm at best, even though he was happy to hang around. Well, I hoped maybe the party's atmosphere would set up the mood and give him more courage.

Fast forward to the night, I am hosting the party, interacting with other folks, making sure everything goes smoothly. My boy seems to be doing fine, they danced a couple of times, saw them talking at some point, all is good. I am, on the other hand, either tending to guests or hanging out in the smoking room. Then, out of nowhere, she runs up saying she's been looking for me whole night and that we didn't do shots or danced at all. I just brush it off saying all good, we'll have time, but she insists. We do shots, after which she says that she ""doesn't feel good"", so I take her to the bathroom, where out of nowhere she locks the door, turns off the lights and well, the rest is history. You can refuse a girl in this situation only for so long and, well, I fucked up.

I came clean to him, we had a big argument about it. Settled our differences to some degree and carried on. We occasionally meet up, but it's not the same anymore. Regarding the girl - we're in a kind of fwb situation. I tried to steer this into a relationship, but she's too undecisive, so I just left it at that and moved on. We hook up from time to time, but nothing more. 

I still feel like shit about this whole thing. My only gripe is that with all the opportunities, meetups, parties, hangouts - he never made a move. In the end he puts the blame on me, saying I ruined everything and that this was my plan all along. Naturally this will be the last time I'm helping anyone in a similar situation, but tell me, guys, from the outside perspective - was it me who ruined e v e r y t h i n g?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rji7d8/the_girl_i_was_setting_up_my_friend_with_hooked/

I wanted to meet up with him but apparently he’s always too busy to meet because of grad school. It’s been 2 months since we began talking, and we likely won’t meet, if ever, until he gets back home from Christmas next year.

During that time Jake’s told me that he’d like to continue to just talk to each other (and no one else) but I think I’m at the end of my rope for how long this can last in this state. Frankly I’m tired of asking him if he has time to meet up, because he never does.

He’s told me before that if I have someone who has more time than him that I’m more interested in he won’t hold it against me but I do have small feelings for him, despite not having met. However, because of the length of time where we haven’t met I’m getting the sinking feeling I’m being love-bombed for fun rather than actually pursued.

90,rjiuu9,1639868393,Girlfriend talking to ex on Snapchat,"I've been seeing a girl for 4 week, I know fast to call a girlfriend, I didn't push for commitment but mentioned I was okay to give it a go, she said to me she didn't want to wait so here we are. (Im over 3-4/7 days a week).

I really do like this girl, she's says I brought back her smile and she can never wait to see me again.  I've met her friends, family and even her kids (recently), 

Tonight though, her kids were out all day with their bio dad (6yr ago broke up)
He dropped the kids off at 8.30 which is fine, then come 9.30pm we are cuddling up on the couch looking at her phone and a Snapchat pops up, it was her ex (kids dad)....queue another 10min and another Snapchat pops up, at this point I wasn't sure what to say, it happened directly in front of my eyes....I didn't know how to bring it up so I chose to ignore it and address it tomorrow when I'm over again.

My question is, I could myself be paranoid.....is this normal? Snapchat is photos unless I'm incorrect, I don't use these social platforms.....why would she and her ex of 6yr be snap chatting eachother.....

Any have any ideas how I can bring this up without coming across wrong? 

Thanks.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rjiuu9/girlfriend_talking_to_ex_on_snapchat/
91,rjixr6,1639868607,Would it be a terrible idea to reconnect with someone who clearly said he didn't want to get invested?,"I briefly dated someone this fall. We maybe went out 4 or 5 times. In the beginning he acted like he was genuinely excited about me and invested in this. On just our second date we spent hours talking about life and what we believed in and were interested in. He planned a picnic and would text me to ask about my day and actually wanted to sleep over at my place before I was ready.

The last time we saw each other we went further sexually than before and I asked him afterwards what he was looking for, which led to an odd conversation where he asked me to go first. I said I wasn't looking to move in with someone but an emotional connection is really important to me. He said he's moving in 6 months and how do I feel about that, and I said it's not an issue because I'm not necessarily looking for a super long-term relationship in that sense at the moment anyway. His response was ""okay, so casual then"" which was somewhat confusing but I assumed it was clear I wasn't just looking for casual sex. 

After that he was different. When we texted it was only flirtatious/sexting ish or him answering questions that I specifically asked him. He stopped asking anything about my day or showing any interest in me as a person and a week later made no plans to see me again. I thought maybe I was being too sensitive and should ask him out instead, so I did, but it turned out he had plans to go to 4 parties that weekend and when he did agree to meet up, planned on just having me help set up for one of the parties (that, by the way, he never invited me to). I told him let's do another time if he's too busy. He said he would let me know. At that point I was leaning towards breaking it off but at least wanted a conversation to make sure I wasn't wrong about him. I offered to bring him a coffee and we could go and just walk and talk for a few minutes. He said he didn't have time. The next day he suggested meeting up that week and I told him I just want to talk for a few minutes. He agreed to call me in the morning and never did.

I finally texted that he's obviously looking for something a lot more casual than me and we should stop seeing each other, but I was open to talking if I was wrong. He said I was probably right and he didn't want to overly invest in something at the moment. I told him to make it clear from the beginning next time because it's shitty to treat people differently once you have sex. He apologized and said he just changed his mind when I asked him what he was looking for and he realized he would be moving soon. I sent a long text basically saying you can still prioritize and treat someone as valuable in a short relationship and if he couldn't or wouldn't, he probably just wasn't interested. He never responded which I took as confirmation he wasn't interested. 

I texted him again a week ago for something totally work-related (long story) and he ended up saying sorry he didn't respond, he didn't know what to say and regretted not meeting up to talk because it's hard discussing feelings over text. 

It almost sounded like he wanted to talk more but I just told him if it didn't work out that is what it is, and we haven't talked since then. 

The fact is I miss him tremendously and think we had a connection that you can't fake. It was easier to think he was just using me for sex, but as tacky as this sounds I don't think he could have faked this level of feeling connected. I have kissed plenty of attractive people I had chemistry with, but have never felt this strong of a connection kissing someone, or had this experience of holding eye contact and both of us being content. He said that I had a calming presence, and when he looked at me sometimes he almost seemed like he was a little bit in awe. 

I have been telling myself that he clearly wasn't interested enough and if he wanted to he would have called me (it's been a month and he has not called or made any effort to reconnect). But part of me feels like what if this was just miscommunication? Is it possible I just responded too harshly (I did send a pretty harsh few texts) and he misses me too but thinks I wouldn't give it another chance? 

Anyway, I don't know if I'm being a pushover and have to accept he isn't interested and move on, or if it's possible this was just poor communication and maybe I pushed him away too fast or put too much pressure on it. My concern was just not feeling respected or like he valued me anymore but maybe it was too early to have that expectation.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rjixr6/would_it_be_a_terrible_idea_to_reconnect_with/

94,rjj2cn,1639869016,Leaving space after a good first date,"Hey all, 

TL;DR at the bottom. 

A rather smitten M/27/US here. Just wanted to ask for a little bit of advice. I recently met a girl (let's call her Jane) who moved to my city, moving into my female-friend (Ann)'s house about a month ago. She's got a great personality and is a lot of fun to be around, and is very naturally pretty too. As a result, several guys in my friend group have shown an interest in her, with one guy in particular communicating this with Ann.

He was being pushy, and Ann basically made a point that Jane has only just moved here, let's let her settle in and try to get to know her before they start trying for relationships. I really liked her also, but I kept things cool and made sure I was welcoming and didn't try anything like that with her. We spent quite a few evenings together with the group, and after a month I felt some real chemistry between us, and decided to ask her if she'd join me for a countryside walk. 

She said yes, but wasn't available at the date I specified, I was a bit disappointed. However, the next day she texted me asking if I'd go out with her as she wanted to celebrate completing a course, and no one else was around. I said yes of course and met her, we had such a great night having some beers together and getting to know each other. We have tons in common and conversation flowed like wine. 

After a few beers she said she wanted to go home, but I could stop by and have a cup of tea and watch some TV. I had my arm around her and she ended up laying down with her head in my lap, it felt romantic, wholesome and natural. However, I get a lot of anxiety about these things, and I didn't want to push her by initiating a kiss on what was basically a first (unofficial) date. When I left I gave her a hug goodbye, and that was that. It felt a little awkward leaving honestly, wondering whether I maybe should have kissed her, but we were tired, a bit tipsy, and it didn't feel like the right time. 

I texted her the next day wishing her safe travels on her journey home (going home for Christmas), expressing how much I enjoyed getting to know her more, and told her I was looking forward to taking her on that country walk when she got back from Christmas. She took a few hours to reply, but eventually responded saying that she had fun too and she had got back safe. It wasn't as enthusiastic as I expected considering the chemistry we had, and whilst it was a positive message, it did make me wonder whether I had come across too strong. 

It's only been 24 hours and frustratingly, it really is dominating my thoughts. I would love to text her and ask her how things are going etc. but I think I should give her time to enjoy family time, and let her text me on her own accord. Worst case scenario she doesn't text me, and I contact her on Christmas day with festive wished. 

Do you think I am handling this the right way? I think I've been scared off by the comments of Ann at the beginning, wanting to take things slow and let her settle in to this new city and friendship group. however, another part of me sees a lot of chemistry, and I worry whether she was upset that I didn't initiate a kiss, I haven't texted her again, or that I am being too precautions. 

Any thoughts would be appreciated. I honestly haven't felt this way about a girl in years, I've only known her a short while but we have so much in common, it really is a pleasure to hang out with her and I am pretty sure she feels the same. My plan is to just leave it for a few days and see if she wants to talk, I think it's important she has time to process her thoughts and I know that I can be a little over enthusiastic with the texts etc.

 **TL;DR I met a girl who only moved to my city recently, and we had a great date. However, things have felt quiet since the date, I didn't kiss her goodnight and I wonder maybe if I should have. I'm playing things slowly to give her time, but I'm not sure if I should be more explicit such as stating we should have a ""date"" or telling her that I really like her.**",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rjj2cn/leaving_space_after_a_good_first_date/

96,rjj7rh,1639869478,I don't know how to feel,"Hi, 

I (22F) kind of need to vent but could also use some advice. I went on a few dates with a friend's friend and they absolutely were amazing! He (24M) had just gotten out of a LTR and I had told him I wanted to wait to hook-up. After that, we had talked a bit, snap chatted, and talked in person but he had never planned or accepted another date. He was always really friendly in person and I felt like I was led on for months. I recently found out he's in a relationship and I don't exactly know how to feel. I would start to get over him at points when I would think about how he led me on but after talking to him/seeing him in person, those feelings would kind of go away. I know he doesn't owe it to me, but it would've been nice to have some closure. Does anyone have any advice?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rjj7rh/i_dont_know_how_to_feel/
97,rjj9wn,1639869659,I went on my first date ever and failed,"I'm 24 and went on my first date ever. I was so bad with girls that I'm still shocked it happened. Especially because it was with a really beautiful girl. Ultimately it failed and she told me to stop talking to her because she doesn't like me.

The thing is, I thought it went great. Both of us couldn't stop laughing and by the time I took her back home she was already planning the next date. I really thought I would see her again but in the span of 2 days she went cold and eventually cut all ties with me.

It's so disappointing because it was the first time I ever went on a date so I hoped it would go further but also because it still fell apart after what seemed to me like a perfect night.

I guess the mistake was that I didn't kiss her, I was too chicken to go for it. Still, I wish it had gone further than it did.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rjj9wn/i_went_on_my_first_date_ever_and_failed/
