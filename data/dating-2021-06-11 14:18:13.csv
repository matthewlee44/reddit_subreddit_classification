0,nxo1hw,1623439518,Does anyone else find that traditional stereotypes about sex are basically backwards?,"A traditional stereotype about gender and sex is that men are motivated by casual sex and less interested in committed relationships, while women are more motivated by committed relationships and less interested in casual sex.

While I think I understand where this idea comes from (see below), in my experience it seems to be roughly an inversion of the truth. 

In my experience most men find casual sex and dating a generally frustrating and pointless endeavor, and really want the stability and ongoing affection of a relationship. They definitely enjoy sex, but aren't too worried about the details; as long as they like being around their partner and find her attractive, it's good. Although they have standards, it's not unusual for them to find women with whom they would be willing to enter a relationship.

Meanwhile (again, in my experience) most women seem to be extremely into the attention, validation, and sexual adventures they find through casual sex and dating. Quality of sex is very important to them, and they're very critical about it, with extensive likes and dislikes and strong opinions about what makes for good and bad sex. Although theoretically they are not opposed to a relationship, it seems to be very hard for them to commit to anything and let go of always looking for what's next. I've literally had two different women say basically this same exact sentence to me: ""I think if I date lots and lots of men I'll eventually find someone, like if I dated 1,000 men there'd probably be one of them I wanted a relationship with."" I can't imagine hearing anything like that from a man. 

**Where I think the traditional idea comes from**

I think the underlying distinction that the traditional stereotype was trying to capture was this: men have a much lower bar than women for casual sex, especially when little effort is required to get it. I'm a man. If a halfway attractive woman knocked on my door right now and said, ""Would you like to have sex?"", I'd probably do it. I can confidently say that I think very few women would do the same in that position. The bar is just higher in general for a woman to be willing to have sex. But that doesn't mean that women aren't extremely interested in casual sex, as IMO the modern dating scene shows.

**Conclusion**

I'm curious what others think on this topic? Do you think this is nonsense, or agree with me, or have any other thoughts?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nxo1hw/does_anyone_else_find_that_traditional/

2,nxofzz,1623440673,"Ghosting me after 5 weeks of contact, a nice date and hours of talking on the phone?","I texted with a guy I met on tinder for a few weeks and we met last week. The date went well, he texted me immediately after, saying he had a great time and wants to meet up again soon. He texted me the same thing the next day as well. 

On the weekend I asked him, whether he wants to meet up spontaneously. I saw him online several times, not answering. I don’t know how to explain it, but I lost control of my thoughts and emotions. I am very mistrusting and have to work on that. I sent him a long text, telling him that I can’t deal with his late responses or that I feel fooled. 

He is ignoring me ever since last Saturday. I tried to reach out several times via WhatsApp and called one time. He isn’t responding whatsoever. I tried to apologize and everything, but nothing works. 

He still has my number saved him, since I still see his photo and he has it on „only for contacts“. Of course he still could have deleted the chat. He didn’t block me or sth like that and still follows me on Instagram. It’s really weird. 

I know i made a big mistake by telling a date that soon that I feel fooled, but I didn’t expect that he would ghost me after 5 weeks of texting every day, talking on the phone for 9 hours and a nice meet up.

Does it mean he wasn’t even that interested or I „just“ blew it up with my text?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nxofzz/ghosting_me_after_5_weeks_of_contact_a_nice_date/

I got talking to someone the other day (we live in other countries), and we'd arranged to watch Netflix this evening. I messaged them a few hours before, no response. Then 20 minutes after the scheduled time, no response.

Is this normal ? Also, he always asks me to finger his bum from underneath when he’s about to cum and it drives him to the high heavens (his eyes would literally roll all the way back and will moan like a demon).

11,nxp49n,1623442494,Why do we think of dating in such black and white terms,"I’m not ready to get married or have kids, but I’m into casual sex for convenience sake to fulfill my physical desires. The problem is, people seem to associate the word relationship with more responsibility, loss of independence and no fun. On the flip side, people seem to associate the word casual with sporadic mechanical sex, with little to no awareness and consideration for the other person’s existence or feelings outside of the encounter. 

My issue with casual arrangements as opposed to serious relationships and vice versa are that, they are on two extremely different sides of the spectrum! I can’t build rapport with someone who keeps me at arms length, therefore I’ve never felt compelled to upkeep such a “intimate” yet sterile and transactional arrangement. But then again if someone becomes a consistent source of affection and companionship, my feelings towards them will start to become more complex. 
I cant date or sleep with someone who I wouldn’t otherwise be “into” just cause I want to remain unattached; I wouldn’t be interested and imo, that’s cruel. 

I don’t understand why some people are dead set on compartmentalizing their intentions as casual versus serious, right off the jump. At some point down the line, the distinction must be made, but as someone who truly *goes with the flow* I can’t compartmentalize my interactions with people like that!!!!!!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nxp49n/why_do_we_think_of_dating_in_such_black_and_white/

We make small talk and  she sees my home return address on the package (I live outside a major city, kinda in the sticks) and mentions that she lives in the same small town!   She then told me that she lives close to the grocery store.  I said, ""ok yeah, I'm just over a mile from the store, so you're real close!"" 

She then said, word for word, ""Yeah, I live on (insert street here), it's a dead end and I'm the very last house on the right.""

We matched a month ago and texted daily for a week. We have a lot in common and get each other's humor. He initiated more texts than I did. We had a video call for an hour and set up an in person date for the week after. For two days after the call he kept initiating (mostly) and we continued talking. On the third day after the video call, he told me that he just got out of a relationship and needs time to figure things out. I empathized with him and told him that I am glad that he is taking time off dating because reflection and personal growth is important for making the next relationship better. I invited him to reach out when he feels ready.  He thanked me for understanding his situation and said that he will contact me when he's ready. 

Today I looked on the app and saw that he added new photos and changed his description to ""looking for a long term relationship"". 

I am looking for advice on what it could mean and how to proceed - here is what I am thinking so far:

(1) He told me a white lie and he isn't really interested in dating me. In which case whether I contact him or not wouldn't matter. It's done.

(2) He may be interested, but not enough to contact me.  He is still playing the field. 

(3) He is talking to others and perhaps there was someone who he connected more than he connected with me.

Anyway, there is this one girl in my college class who I am interested in asking on a date and I don’t know the best way to approach it. We met about 5 months ago when our program started and about a month ago she text me saying we should hang out sometime. Well since then we’ve hung out a few different times and it’s been a lot of fun but I can’t tell if she is interested in me or only sees me as a friend. I went into it with no expectations but after hanging out with her I realized that I like her and want to ask her out on a date

My first problem is, is that if she does decline my offer I would still like to remain friends and hang out. Do I run the risk of losing the friendship by asking her on a date?

Also, I’m a very shy person but I know I should ask her on a date in person instead of via text. I’m just trying to think of the best time to ask her. I want to wait a couple of weeks due to these next weeks being really hectic for me, but I was contemplating on if I should ask her after class or wait until the next time we hang out. How do I make it not awkward for us if she doesn’t want to? Should I mention that if she doesn’t want to it’s no big deal and that I’m totally okay with remaining friends?

Finally, for the date idea I was thinking either do movie and ice cream afterwards or bowling with ice creams afterwards. Would either of these be fine? I know movies aren’t recommended, but we have hung out before so its not like I’m taking a complete stranger to the movies. Also it would be a movie that she wants to go see. Want to keep it on the shorter side.

After a while I asked her out, she agreed and a day before the date she got sick and said her head hurts realy bad, she didnt come to work aswell so I didnt force it as an excuse. We kept with the messages and after a few weeks I gave it a another shot, I asked her out at work and she agreed to go out again, but the same thing happened, this time she went asleep late and didnt wake up. I told myself that my self respect got to its limit and I stopped talking to her via messages. She didnt send any aswell.
The whole story above took about 2 months which got me realy exhausted about starting a relationship. After that it was kinda weird at work for some time, but recently (A few weeks have passed) went back to just talking at work and it still feels like there is something ""in the air"", plus Im kinda still ""crushing"" on her, and when we are around each other at work its like a bubble, we talk like there is no one around.

32,nxraxo,1623448498,The Journey to Self-Love,"Throughout my childhood, I (19M) have often dealt with rejection, loneliness, and emotionally unavailable people. These negative experiences have hindered my self-esteem and sense of self-worth, causing me to build walls around myself in hope of shielding myself from untrustworthy people. My family often unintentionally disregarded my emotions as well, leading me to believe that I should bottle up my emotions and focus solely on my academic and athletic goals. 

There is nothing inherently wrong with building walls around oneself, but doing so inhibits one from developing intimate connections with people. People who close themselves off are essentially walking paradoxes; they want intimacy but fear rejection. The irony of it all is that the walls inevitably crash down on them, leaving them feeling empty and lonely. Although rejection may terrify people, the potential happiness from opening oneself up outweighs the pain. In the case of rejection, one will eventually develop resilience to fend off the pain; one cannot control how other people feel, but suffering is a choice.

Although I still struggle with trust issues, I’m beginning to understand myself more each day. I hope to eventually develop the emotional stability to confidently tear down my walls and become the best version of myself. I’ve also learned to prioritize my mental health and not hesitate to disregard anyone who undermines my self-worth. As a result, I’ve been slowly developing a sense of self-love. I’ve also learned to recognize my strengths and shortcomings. I finally know my worth and won’t settle for less than I deserve.

I'm an introvert, so I wasn't putting a whole lot of time into it, but I eventually dated a girl when I was 26, and it was a mess. She was physically and mentally abusive, and wouldn't leave me alone, almost to the point of stalking me. It didn't honestly end until I broke contact and moved. Since that time, I haven't been eager to date, and a lot has changed in my life. I got injured, ended up on disability, and had to quit my job at an auto repair shop. I've gained some weight, mostly due to not working, and I'm living with a family member since I can't afford my own place. I like to think I'm a decent, caring guy, but I don't feel like I have much to offer since my injury. It kinda feels hopeless, and it's absolutely frustrating. Not really sure what my options are.

37,nxrz94,1623450437,"Conflicted about whether to pursue farther with this girl. We'd both agreed we wanted a no-strings-attached deal, but now I think I'll catch feelings","I'm not sure I'm really looking for *advice* per say, but I want to verbalise my internal conflict.

This monday I went out with a girl (let's call her Erika) I met on a dating app. We'd both agreed we were just looking for something casual, and so we just focused on having a fun night having dinner, went for a walk around the lake, and then we went over to my apartment.

We spent the night together, and never really managed to fall asleep due to the heat, so we mostly spent the night cuddling and making out on and off.

Next morning, we left, me to go to uni, her to go back to her place. We'd vaguely talked about seeing each other again while we hung out at the lake, but we never brought it up again. She'd said she was open to anything so long as no strings were attached. Though the idea did float around my head, I said nothing because I was seeing somebody else that next evening.

The date came up, turns out I really wasn't interested in this new girl after all, so we called it off short, and texted Erika again, telling her I'd really enjoyed my time with her and would like to see her again. She agreed, and she's supposed to get back to me about her availability next week.

As far as what we've discussed, this isn't supposed to go beyond anything casual. But reflecting upon myself, I'm worried I'll catch feelings, possibly sooner than later. My rational side tells me I should cut this off here and there before it gets ugly. 

But another part of me really wants to simply see Erika again. And knowing this was the first time she was doing casual stuff through dating apps, I can't help but think she might be open to keep going and simply see where we end up. I've absent mindedly looked at her profile earlier and noticed she was in town this evening, and I'm considering hitting her up. That can't be a good sign...

I should probably discuss it with her if and when we see each other again, but I'd rather do that knowing where I myself am standing on the issue.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nxrz94/conflicted_about_whether_to_pursue_farther_with/

got a serious problem over here. I met a girl about one year ago, she was a friend of mine, and we instantly connected. She had a boyfriend at that time, we met some weeks after and (tbh i got no idea why i did that) i tried to make a move on here. She told me that she wished that we met before she met her boyfriend. Nothing happened on that evening but then the diseaster continued. We hanged out with friends a lot of evenings, she told me many times that she wants me, but then i didnt wanted her back (the boyfriend thing was in my head). After some time spending with her and my friends, it happened, we spent the night together. After that we had for a few months an affair, she told me that she wanted just me, we were planning our future and that she will break up with her boyfriend. We spent weeks together and everything was ""fine"". She still was together with her boyfriend until she broke up with him sth like 6 months after we started with each other. At that point everything was great, the main problem was, it took him another 3 months to moove out of their appartement. I was patient with her and told her that everything is fine and im kinda happy that there will be nothing in our way now. But like 4 weeks afterwards she kinda realized that the separation is really happening. Since 3 weeks she is telling me, that she cannot allow closeness to her cause she is kinda hurt about the separation from her Ex. Right now  I'm doing everything for her (Maybe too much) to make her feel better, but tbh i have no clue what to do now. Shall I still wait for her to be ready after 1 year of dating??? Shall I do all the things which Im doing and accepting the up and downs that she has? She is saying, that she doesnt't really know what she wants. The hardest part is: She was the one girl after like 10 girls I met the past 3 years, where I could imagine a future together with. But right now I have no idea what is wrong or right. The good times are great but in the bad times I just wanna cry. She says she needs time and she asked me out if it wouldnt be better for me if I date other girls, which broke my heart.

47,nxt8by,1623454328,Steps in Online Dating,"As someone who has been online dating for some time, it seems to me that there are levels, or steps, to it:

1) Getting the other person to “like you back,” or to “swipe right” back on you.

2) After you send one or a few messages to the other person, to then get a first response back from the other person.

3) For the responses to then go back and forth, at least to some extent.

4) Getting the other person to take communication from the first app, where you are first communicating, to another app or source, such as moving to texting, or Instagram messaging, or Facebook messaging, etc.

5) Building up the communication from there to where you make a phone call and/or video call to each other.

6) Meeting in-person for the first date.

If they want to see you again, they will reply and set up a second date. If they aren't interested in seeing you again, they will either ghost you (which I really wish people would stop doing) or politely tell you that they don't feel a romantic connection. Either way, you will know whether or not they want to see you by their response or lack of response.

There have been multiple times in the past where I have thought, what if we are both waiting for the other person to text first so we don't come across as ""needy"" or ""desperate."" We need to stop being so worried about who seems more interested!

I have hobbies outside of college, but they are mostly hobbies I can do at home and by myself. Plus, they’re probably very guy-centric anyway.

One of the reasons that women say they don't want short men is because we will contribute into having short kids. As a short guy I dont even care about the height of my kids and I could care less if they are short. But why should that even matter? You can't even see the future lives of your kids and being short shouldn't be seen as bad, theres just so much stigma and discrimination against short people, but there are loads of short people that are very successful and happy. Being tall doesn't make one's life better or averagish height and I think its really silly and dumb to think that if a kid ends up short his life will be a living hell, thats toxic AF. A lot of these people that practice this are short people themselves, moreso shorter women. You can't really guarantee anything and just because you breed with a person that isn't short that doesn't mean you pop out kids that aren't short, the chance is still 50/50 if one person is short and one person isn't short. It really shouldn't matter and I think that this makes kids feel insecure because if their parents dont like them being short that can lead to a crap load of mental health problems.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nxtod8/as_a_short_guy_it_pisses_me_off_when_women_say/

Since I’m from the Philippines, it’s been difficult to find one for some reasons including being not in the west. And Exmuslims in the west prefer to date someone from there for convenience. I don’t want to move to an Islamic country being Exmuslim. 

Another reasons are most are teenagers aside from the fact we aren’t that many. Also, I always find exmuslim men tend to carry the toxic masculinity they learned from Islamic Culture. 

I understand that I only have two options, give up with the idea to be with someone or take a risk and go against my family and probably get disowned.

And it only triggers me more when I don’t feel the person is sympathetic enough. I understand anyone hates drama but people know too It’s not creating drama.

I’ve asked about this stuff from some white people and experienced it myself that it seems it’s a culture people in a relationship can’t handle scenes like this. People expect to have added happiness alone. Like someone from ask men said why would someone wants to be in a relationship just to have negativities or problems that weren’t there before being in a relationship. Does that mean, you can only expect your partner at fun and happy times and you can’t really expect emotional support from him cuz you’re being toxic?.

59,nxutt5,1623459487,Was I too harsh on my ex-boyfriend?,"TL;DR: My (27F) ex-boyfriend (26M) exhibited many qualities I look for in a partner but as time went on many I couldn't overlook a lot of things he did and we broke up after six months. I have outlined these red flags below and how I vocalized my concerns. Since our breakup, I keep wondering if I was too harsh on him. Considering I have been in toxic relationships in the past, I find it difficult to trust my gut sometimes, so other people's inputs are helpful for me so I know I'm not crazy.

Background: My ex-boyfriend and I met last summer through mutual friends. We got along so well and hit it off immediately. He was everything I was looking for: smart, affectionate, handsome, sweet, funny, committed etc. For someone who had only been in bad relationships, he was a breath of fresh air. The first couple of months were great, he was very thoughtful and generous when planning dates, although I insisted we go 50/50 on everything (he comes from a very wealthy family, and I didn't want him thinking I was taking advantage of him). After the two month mark, I felt myself having doubts about him because of certain things he would do, but I didn't know if I was being unnecessarily critical of him (internally) and so I gave him the benefit of the doubt. He also suffers from ADHD and depression, so I wanted to be patient with him and help. Eventually we ended things because all the problems I had with him piled up. Now, as I move forward with my life, I want to make sure that my criticisms were valid and that I wasn't being overly critical of him (as to not make the same mistakes in a future). Below are a few of the red flags I noticed that bothered me and led to our breakup:

1. He has a trust fund and didn't have a job. He would literally sit around and watch TV all day. I work about 80 hours a week and make \~100K so this lifestyle bothered me, I really value ambition and drive. He was super sweet and would bring me coffee and lunch when I was working, but I really wanted him to be productive on his own. I would always encourage him and tell him that being productive would make him feel better about himself. I'd try to get him to work out with me, go on hikes, volunteer. I just wanted him to be somewhat productive in ANYTHING. His parents (who are wonderful people btw) would vocalize their disdain of him not having a job, being independent or living on his own. I also tried helping him by making him a cover letter and resume and sending him job applications of jobs I thought would interest him. He never applied anywhere.
2. Because of his lack of job, after about two months of dating he didn't have any money to do anything. His parents monitored his use of the family credit card and only let him spend money on groceries in an effort to encourage him to be more independent. Every time he did spend money on us doing something, he told me his parents got mad at him for spending money he didn't have (which is completely understandable and fair) and that I would need to pay for future stuff. I told him it was frustrating to me that he didn't have any money (to even pay for half of our stuff) because I want to be able to enjoy life with him (go to restaurants, go on trips, etc.) and his lack of money was limiting what I could do with my life. Again, a lack of money wouldn't have bothered me if he was struggling to make ends meet or was actively looking for a job. I don't mind picking up the slack for a friend/BF struggling financially, but not a trust fund baby who is just lazy and refuses to get a job. It started to really piss me off when he'd demand I pay for parking when we drove places or meals for us because his parents only gave him 20$ and he couldn't afford to pay. Also, the fact I knew gifts from him were picked out and paid for by his mom kind of bothered me because it felt like I was mooching off his family, and as an independent woman I didn't want his parents thinking that's what I wanted - if that makes sense? I honestly couldn't even look his parents in the eye sometimes because I was embarrassed they would think I'm a gold digger.
3. He would always tell me we couldn't do things because of what I said in point #2, but he would spare no expense on his friends to impress them. The fact I would see him spending money on dinners with his friends but not on me really hurt my feelings, because he'd always fuss about the money he spent on me.
4. One of his friend's wife made a lie about how his family stole money to get their wealth and quoted fake articles (which I googled later and don't exist). I stood up for his family but he refused to say anything because he didn't want to ""rock the boat."" I couldn't believe he would let someone disrespect his family like that. I HATED this friend's wife, because she would always passively aggressively put him down and I would stick up for him. He got mad at me because I didn't want to hang out with them anymore after that. I told him he could hang out with them, but I didn't want to be around fake people. His idea of sticking up for himself after this was telling his friend to tell his wife to stop saying that stuff because it got him in trouble with me.... basically he just threw me under the bus and made me the bad guy like some overbearing girlfriend when all I wanted was him to stick up for himself. I was so mad.
5. He would overtake his Adderall (because he ""couldn't feel the effects of one"") and not sleep for days on end. He did this a couple times on trips we took together, and he'd end up sleeping through the entire day and leave me by myself. He told me he previously had a cocaine addiction (but was sober for a year), so this behavior worried me. I never saw him using cocaine, but his lack of discipline in every other aspect of his life made me question his ""sobriety.""
6. He would lie about the dumbest things. Just little things here and there. Sometimes he would say he bought a gift for me and it was coming a few days later. When I'd ask if it came yet he would say ""oh I never ordered it."" He did this multiple times. It always felt like he had an excuse for everything and I didn't know how much was truth, and I genuinely started questioning everything he said. For example, when I vocalized wanting to not want to spend every weekend on the couch watching tv he told me ""I've already lived my life"" as an excuse as to why we were sitting watching tv
7. THE LAST STRAW: He told me his parents gave him some money to spend on our valentines day. The weeks leading up to valentines day, he told me he got an Airbnb and it was a surprise where we were going. A few days before valentines day, I asked where we were going and he said he never booked anywhere and that he wanted to use the 500$ to go on a trip with his friends the next month, so we would just stay local and have a picnic on the beach. This hurt me, but I said ""oh okay that's fine."" On valentines day, he didn't get me a gift even though I had bought him an expensive gift as well as a sentimental gift that he knew about ahead of time. I tried to keep a brave face after all this hurt, but dinner was cheap takeout on the couch of his parents house in sweatpants (not even on the beach as promised). I felt so deeply hurt I just started crying my eyes out over the dumplings he bought. He apologized profusely but I went home immediately after dinner. The worst part was the day before valentines, he had invited that friend and wife who insults him over and had spent a boatload of money on preparing a dinner for all of us, and he hadn't even put in an ounce of effort in our valentines day together. The day after valentines he told me he wasn't sure about our future together, so I told him there wasn't a future for us after everything I had put up with from him and we broke up.

Overall, I think I am better off without him. I do miss him sometimes (we've been broken up for about 4 months), but I don't feel heartbroken by the end of this relationship. I felt he wasn't mature and didn't understand what real partnership is, even though he did display many attributes I want in a partner. Sometimes I guess I feel like maybe I wasn't patient enough and should have been more patient considering his depression and ADHD and I feel a bit guilty for vocalizing my unhappiness in the situations outlined above because maybe it didn't help his mental health. Considering I have been in toxic relationships in the past, I find it difficult to trust my gut sometimes, so other people's inputs are helpful for me so I know I'm not crazy.

61,nxv53g,1623460550,Work from home flirt,"Here is my story: I started working in this company the moment the pandemics started and there was this guy who is a manager in a different department. 
He was friendly (and I saw him checking me out a few times - I don’t want this to sound arrogant and I only say this as a context  but I’m quite attractive by society’s standards and guys usually comment positively on my look or they want to date me - but I’m also awkward in settings like this and I had no idea how to act friendly so I became strictly professional probably way too quickly) and we didn’t get to know each other at all and then permanent work from home happened. I asked him if he wants to mentor me as I’m still quite new and he was happy about it. 

The thing is now I’m going to talk regularly to him but only via zoom calls (as in one two times per month) I’m sure he’s not married and young but I have no idea if he’s committed. He never shared personal information with me. I’m interested in getting to know him but I have no idea how to go about this. What should I ask him in these mentorship calls? I want to be very subtle about it and I’m also genuinely interested in the company. How would you insert some subtle flirting in these calls? 

The problem is that every time I talk to him and he asks me what I’m doing I reply “working on project X”. At the beginning he was more casual but then he became more formal and started replying like me or no small talk at all. Is it too late for me to give him a hint I’m interested?

I was on a 2nd or 3rd date with this Iranian girl I met on OKCupid - it  was at her place and her brother was in the next room doing his thing.  We're making out on the couch you know, having some pretty innocent fun.  But apparently there is this thing they do in Iran (don't quote me, I'm  just selling it like I bought it) where you take a sip of wine and then  like baby-bird it into your partner's mouth, like a nasty wine-spit  waterfall. It's supposed to be erotic I guess but I was really grossed  out by it.

No red flags so far -  nothing wrong with her attempt, but I'm just not into it. I just tell  her I don't like that and can we just fool around normal like? She  didn't get the message, and did that shit again! I guess she just  figured I didn't know I like it yet and needed another shot at it. Now  I'm fully disgusted, and weirded out by the fact that her hairy brother  is just a thin wall away.

I'm out.  I make a polite excuse to leave. She's pretty drunk by now from what  little wine she managed to not regurgitate into my mouth - so she grabs  my arm and slurs, ""nooooooo, don't goooooooo."" and basically refuses to  let go and allow me to leave.

Then when the music started, she was dancing and hip bumped me not once, not twice, but THRICE. Did she want some of that body lumber? 😏👀",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nxym6p/was_this_female_interested_in_me/
96,nxyt6v,1623473276,How to date after being single for several years....,"So I honestly don't know where to start, online dating is not my thing. I tried it, get a decent amount of matches, but as a twenty something man who isn't interested in hookups it's rough (I'm sure it is for the women out there too). 

I'll match with women, dates will go very well, then usually something will flail out when she says she's looking for something short term or a fling which doesn't interest me (nothing wrong with it, just not my cup of tea). 

A little bit about my background, I go to the gym 4 times per week, I'm in grad school at a decent public university, work and socialize when I can. I have problems like everyone else, so I'm definitely not immune to it. 

Are there people nowadays who actually want something meaningful? Do I have to wait until I'm older in order for that to happen? 

To preface this I am Asian, not into the hookup scene, I do get interest from women at the gym or at university but it's mostly just for short term... Maybe there's a vibe I'm giving off that I'm unaware of??

I'm not sure if there's necessarily a place you go to to find ""long term?"" or if it's just the age demographic I'm in. 

I want to figure out if the not wanting long term is just depending on the people I'm attracting (If the problem is me) or if it's just that bad out there. 

How do you get back into dating (long term) after having been single (work, grad school, life) gets in the way? Honestly no idea where to even begin and online dating is a shit show",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nxyt6v/how_to_date_after_being_single_for_several_years/
97,nxyude,1623473394,"I keep attracting the wrong type (dominant men), it's annoying. What can I do to change this?","Not sure if it's mostly due to my short stature (5'4 ft), my personality, or both, but I keep attracting dominant men and it's just getting annoying.

I had 3 relationships and 5 other flings (all younger than me) through my lifetime, but I always ended up frustrated by their dominating manner. 

It annoys me that my men were trying to take charge in our relationship and dictate my life. As if they were challenging my freedom and independence, I detest this. I know what I want. I already have all plans and projections of my own future. Respect my decision. Even on small things like date night, I want them to understand that **I** decide where and what to do. When I ask for a date, just get ready and I will pick you up on time. Don't plan ahead. *I lead*. Just join me. 

It irritates me even more that some men thought I wanted an alpha man to challenge me. Why would I want that in a relationship? I want a submissive and receptive man I can protect, mommy around, keep him safe, help and guide him on the right track. 

I don't know how I can attract the right type of people and achieve this dynamic. I consider myself quiet decent, even charming. An independent young woman with a STEM degree from a top university, I even work two jobs while still maintaining a 3.5 GPA. I even have a great physique, not as buff as professional weightlifters, but buff. Still, whenever I find a potential submisive partner and try to make the first move, most aren't interested. Some even ghosted me.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nxyude/i_keep_attracting_the_wrong_type_dominant_men_its/
