0,ozg8jp,1628286080,All I do it put myself down for being single. How do I stop this self-destructive behavior.,"My 30 birthday is coming up in a couple weeks and to date I’ve never have a girlfriend or relationship. Despite this however, I’m basically the best version of myself that I’ve ever been me mentally, financially and physically. I have a nice car, bills are paid, live in my own place and enjoy a fun number of activities and hobbies like hiking, yoga, the gym, modeling/photography etc. 

My problem is I have these constant ups and downs that I rotate through. One week I feel amazing as if nothing can stop me, I’m upbeat, energetic and feel great about my life; then the next week I’ll feel like lonely shit and remind myself that I have no one to talk to. 

I do my absolute best to not let my self worth be based on a relationship status but it’s very hard not to think about. Everywhere you go are happy couples holding hands, smiling, kissing, going out on dates, sex, parties, someone to talk to etc. Just the other day in fact I went hiking by myself and there were nothing but couples having fun and enjoying the beautiful views together; you can’t help but feel left out! 

How do you single people do it? How do you not let the loneliness set in when it’s impossible avoid everything around you?

Was he flirting with her?","I invited a guy friend to a sports game. During the sport, he kept looking at my figure, showing me he's checking me out. We had good conversation getting to know each other. We ate dinner with our friends after playing a sport. He and I sat across. At the beginning of the dinner he started mentioning how he's single. He kept talking to me one on one, sharing his life, asking about mine. By the end of the night, he talked to my sister who was sitting next to me and started making more eye contact with her as he talked. He's known me and my sister for awhile and even told me how he forgot her name at one point. But he asked her that night if she was okay while she was shivering cold. He didn't ask me that. When we talked outside, he fistbumped my sister and said ""We would get along well"" after she said she eats practically anything. He was looking at me as he said that. My friends and I all stood in a circle and he kept cracking jokes and started making eye contact with just me, not my sister. But he was standing next to her. I'm wondering if I gave out obvious signals that I was into him, and if he's visibly not feeling it or if he's just not into me as I thought. I've complimented him, called him masculine, initiated conversation with him, but haven't physically flirted with him, which is what I can tell he likes. (He's brushed his hand against me before.)

13,ozhqp7,1628291129,Are we even allowed to tell people when they hurt us? Or do we have to bravely lick our wounds and self soothe?,"I have been dating this man since December, we are both 36.  In the past eight months, I have seen him TEN times.  We live 3 miles away from each other, but he is busier than the President.

He is a very busy doctor, who is managing sick patients during a pandemic. I have a very good job at one of the best companies. He is socially awkward and is from a conservative family in Europe - I am more outgoing and was part of the NYC social elite scene, pre-pandemic. Whenever he upsets me, like ghosting me for a week, because he did not like a joke - I just write it off as him being a social idiot and that he hasn't seen his family and friends for two years, because the pandemic.  

About a week ago, he came over for the first time - we were in the area around sunset, so we were going to grab wine, and bring it to my roof lounge. I have invited him over three times before, but he told me he did not want to put pressure on me - okay! Well, during our drinks and chat - we never made it to the roof - he complains that I never make the first move, and he also wants to feel desired. I tell him he's inconsistent.  It's great that I saw him three times over the past two weeks, but over the past eight weeks, I only saw him three times.  I do not know how to read him, so I don't know what's allowed.

We kiss, it gets heavy, I ask him if he wants to go to my room.  He goes down on me.  When I ask if it was okay for me to go down on him, he says he doesn't want me to, because he doesn't want to have sex with me... Okay.  I said okay, we're naked... why don't you want to have sex with me.  He said he doesn't have protection, I say, I do.  Then he says he doesn't use condoms. I say, we need to talk about this.

He starts frantically getting dressed. I ask him to calm down and sit next to me and talk.  I asked him why, he says because they're numbing and all the women he's been with have been on birth control - I say I am on birth control.  But, I can't not use condoms with someone I don't see consistently, and can't make time for me for six week stretches. Then he says he's only been with women he's been in long term relationships with, and he wants to wait.  I say okay - we can do that. What would need to change in our relationship, for him to start seeing me consistently, and as someone he can seriously date. He says he doesn't know, he hasn't thought about it. 

I ask him if he ever pictures himself dating me he says no - he hasn't thought about it. I ask if he wants to stop seeing me - he says ""of course I want to keep seeing you.""

I tell him I want to go back into the living room, and have a snack, I don't want him leaving on these terms.  He starts frantically putting on his shoes and knocks things over.  I tell him I am going to walk him to the elevator - he says no, because I am in my pajamas - I was wearing shorts and a tank top.  I tell him to text me when he gets home - he says why would I want him to do that? I told him, that's fine you don't have to text me. He asked why I was upset -  I told him this situation is upsetting and I already asked him to not leave when we're in such a confusing state.

He text me when he got home a stupid joke. The next day, I tell him I did not sleep well and needed to speak to him this week, after we had some time to think. He says he's very busy with work, and was sending me stupid memes all week. Sending me very relevant, humorous, YouTube videos for my book club, etc. On Sunday, one week later, he sent me a trailer for a new series of a favorite movie. 

I told him I was disappointed that he could not carve out 30 minutes for me this week, knowing how upset I was. He says ""I am sorry 'allupinyourface' though I did say the end of my week would be really packed up with work - and it wouldn't have been 30 mins in reality, our conversations always run - but happy to talk with you tomorrow? I could call after work.""

I was irate - like you weren't on call this weekend... And you're ""happy to"" walk a neighbor's dog, ""happy to"" show a friend around the city, not ""happy to"" talk to someone you are dating about how you undressed her, then decided to tell her how you don't know if you could ever date her seriously. I decide not to answer and send a really nasty text. 11pm on Monday, he says, ""I guess that's no..""

Yeah - asshole. Anyway, Tuesday evening, after much calming down and not wanting to be a ghoster, I tell him ""It's okay - I don't need anyone doing me any favors, by talking to me when I am upset.""

Am I even allowed to tell him how irate and hurt I am? How I worked to consider his feelings, and he put in zero effort to consider mine? How I am a person with feelings who he pursued, and talked me into staying after I tried to cut him off twice for going six week stretches without seeing him?

I originally thought that I had no hope until an incredibly beautiful girl (I was stunned!) matched with me and told me I was very handsome, it didn't work out because our life phases were different despite being the same age.  I wish we could still talk because we synced and got along very well, but after disclosing that information she stopped talking to me.  We talked for 5 days back and forth constantly, flirting and having a great time.  I've also been matching with more women that I consider attractive, though they never seem to message me back.  However, this got me thinking that perhaps I can really make myself stand out, However, I want some objective and harsh feedback here.   


Link: [https://imgur.com/a/04XasMP](https://imgur.com/a/04XasMP)  


Here is an Imgur link to how I look now, and my current profile pictures. Some of my pictures are a little old due to the pandemic and I didn't take many photos until now. I'm waiting until I get the photos from my recent vacation back before I post them.   


Additionally, the pandemic was a shit year for me.  I started having GI issues and I lost a ton of weight, to the point where I looked ghoulish.  I then put weight back on, but it wasn't the lean weight I wanted/started with, it was mostly fat and now I'm a little above where I want to be and it doesn't look as good due to not being muscle.  My match still saw my most up-to-date nice photo and still liked how I looked.   


I've also posted a picture of my bio to see if anything can be improved there.  In short, what I want is  


Rate my overall attractiveness: 1-10  
Rate my innate/natural attractiveness: 1-10  
Rate my ""Vibes"" Attractiveness: 1-10  
Rate my possible maximum attractiveness: 1-10  
Rate my Profile: 1-10  


Then give me feedback on how I can improve each of these things and help me maximize what I've got.  I'll tell you what getting a compliment from a beautiful girl really made me second guess my self-perception and really made me think about how I could be the best version of myself, but I need help because I never thought about these things until now.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ozhtcp/28m_needing_dating_profile_help_includes_pics/

22,ozidpv,1628293388,Is he serious about me?,"Hi All,

Hoping for your help here, analyzing if someone has serious intentious with me. I had some bad experiences in the past and doubt my intuition because of this, I don't want to misinterpret the signs.

I am dating a guy that I have met on Tinder about a month ago. He asked me right away if I wanted to go on a date and I agreed to meet or a coffee. I suggested a place and we met there. Date was going very well, he stayed longer than he wanted and asked me at the end if I want to meet him again.

As it was crazy hot where we live, I asked him if he wants to go for a swim on the second date. We met on the beach and he had put some thought into it, brought a blanket, some food and my favorite wine (we had talked about it before). On this date, he kissed me and we made out on the beach. He tried to touch my breast and I moved his hand away, whereupon he said 'I don't count don the time until we have sex'. After the date he asked me, if we can meet after work or go for a lunch. I agreed and since then we met for lunch a few times.

After this, he came over to my place where we played boardgames and had sex. It was pretty good and we took plenty of time to cuddle afterwards. After this visit, he came over again and we repeated the whole thing, which made me worry that this might result into some kind of sex thing. When I asked him, what he would like to do before the second hangout at my place, he said 'I really would like to f\*\*k you again, but we could also only play boardgames, or we just do both?'.

Here are some additional pointes to keep into consideration:

\+ He remembers small details about me, like my favorite color

\+ He makes some vague suggestions about the future like 'If this works out, we should travel to ... together"" and ''I can show you this movie I made some time""

\+ He displays signs of affections with me publicly, like kissing me and holding hands

\- He never texts between dates

\- He is still on tinder

\- He hasn't introduced me to anyone in his family yet (It might be too early, I guess)

Any thoughts on where this is going?

We work in different buildings and different departments and overall are unlikely to see one another unless we really put forth effort. I found myself extremely attracted to him and we ended up getting along great. He knew I was married at the time but I didn't really share with him (or anyone at work) that I was going through a divorce. 

Since first meeting we both have found excuses to see one another at work and chit-chat. He always seems super excited and happy to see me and I think there is mutual interest/attraction. He often asks about my weekend plans and has shared a lot about himself. My divorce hasn't really come up in conversation. It's a mix of embarrassment and not wanting to overshare, I guess? 

Now that the divorce done and over and it's clear we both like each other, I would really like to hang out with him outside of work! We don't see each other a whole lot, but we have been texting.

34,ozjaa5,1628296817,Just want some feedback,"So went on about 5 dates with a cute guy who approached me at work. Second date he kissed me. All the dates after that always included some light make out sessions. He's a really sweet guy and a gentleman. Was always asking to spend more time with me (which was a bit hard due to my schedule) and we texted every single day. He started asking me to hang out at his place after work (which is late at night). I turned him down the first two times because I was concerned that be might be expecting sex which I wasn't ready for at this stage. However I eventually texted him one night and said if the offer still stands I'd love to come over. I went and we had a really good night watching shows, cuddling, making out. At one point I asked what he's looking for and he said he'd just like to see where it goes. And then asked the same question. (I'm not good with words at all) but I said something along the lines of not being in a rush, I'd love to see where it goes too and we can take our time, but didn't want to be too casual. (what I was trying to say was that I didn't want to have casual sex but I don't think I got that across properly). He said ok and the rest of the night still went well. In fact the cuddling was even better. He walked me out, kissed me goodbye and gave me multiple warnings about the road before I left lol. However the next two days he barely said two words and I had to initiate most of the convo. He finally sent me a message saying he's not sure what he wants at this time and he knows I'm looking for something serious, and doesn't want to play games with me. However if it's what I want he'd love to be friends still. I messaged back saying I love his honesty but that's not quite what I meant. He said he's confused and I then sent him a message asking him to meet up to talk and so far he hasn't answered. Was that him taking the nice way out? Or just my bad communication? Cuz if he is still interested in carrying on what we had going I'd love that. However if he's not feeling anything and wants to cut his losses I'm ok with that.

36,ozk55f,1628300311,(24M) Why is it socially acceptable for women to openly criticise men in dating but not vice versa?,"Not trying to start a flame war or anything but I'm genuinely curious about this.

Whether online or hearing (hetero) women I know talk about men in real life, I quite often hear women make critical remarks of men in light of their interactions with them.

Things like ""Men are pigs"", ""Men are trash"", ""Can't spell disappointment without men"", ""Men only want one thing"". Seeing threads about how ""the bar is literally that low for men"".

These are often just accepted as fact, the women that say so are usually met with sympathy, and there seems to be no social consequence for being so open about saying so.

Whereas I find that if I make a post to complain about my interactions or experiences with women in any way, I find that I receive little sympathy and am often blamed for it; e.g. ""well what are you doing wrong to make women act that way?"" Even though I've had many similar experiences that women complain about men dating wise; including aspects regarding physical safety.

If I were to make any references to ""the bar for women"", even to say something like that ""it's so hard to find a decent woman who talks to me like a normal person and communicates openly and honestly"", I'm either blamed for this like above or referred to as arrogant, douche, a Nice Guy TM, etc.

If I complain about women using me for sex and/or ghosting me after sex, the reaction is usually ""well you mustn't have been good in bed"" etc. It's definitely a different reaction to what women receive when they're upset a man doesn't call them the day after etc.

While I can complain to my friends privately, if I were to post the kinds of passive aggressive remarks on social media like I've seen women do (I personally never have) it would be of great social consequence to me with women (especially as I live in a town where everyone seems to know everyone).

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm curious why this is? Is it because of a sympathy gap between men and women? Because women  are more at risk in terms of their physical safety in dating? Other factors that I'm overlooking?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ozk55f/24m_why_is_it_socially_acceptable_for_women_to/

I rarely spoke to her in high school, because I was depressed and had recently been diagnosed with asd, and I was struggling with my sexuality, I still am today. In 2015 we went to a scary movie and I, moronicly, thought that there was a connection after she started hiding in my arms, during the scary portions, and I had my right arm on her left shoulder, with my arm brushing on her chest. I invited her to my high school reunion in 2019, and she aggred to come along, but I felt really inadequate after, I saw her having a conversation very easily with another friend. we met up at a nearby park last March, and when I briefly told her my feelings, she looked down and away, then sort of changed the conversation. Her birthday was a couple of days ago, wasn't invited, but got a generic heart response when I told her happy birthday. I haven't seen her in over a year, and I know I'm in denial wrt thinking that if I hang out with her and open myself up to her, that she'll see me as someone interesting and not a boring ""friend.""",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ozknfa/im_in_denial/

As a shy person myself, I have noticed him sneak some glances when I can only see him in my peripheral. (this is definitely a tactic I use on my crushes as a shy person so that's why I suspect him lol)

Anyway, we are definitely acquainted with one another. I met him in a class we had together where we only talked once which is when my crush started and when the glances from him started. I decided to friend him on facebook and I noticed he was in a club I was interested in joining so I decided to shoot him a message to ask if the club was still going to be meeting with covid guidelines (this was August 2020) and he said yes. This past school year we had a handful of meetings and we didn't talk since it was a lot of chatting with the leaders and stuff.

So now we get to this August. No, we haven't had many conversations but he seems like a sweet guy and by the stuff he posts on facebook it seems like we have a lot in common, plus I think he might like me back. We go back to school at the end of this month and I want to message him and ask him on a date. I'm not sure the status of the club this year so I don't want to wait until we have more time together since I don't know if we will.

For context, I'm 23 and male. For context, I don't think I'm a bad looking guy and I'm pretty confident that I'm really good at most things that people look for in a partner.

However, how are people not afraid about one upping peoples' past partners' experiences? Like, when people are exposed to an extremely fun and memorable time with their past partner, do they compare it to future partners? I'm worried that I'm only good for looks or a good time but not for conversation or fun experiences. I've never been the type of guy to be like ""let's go out on a crazy adventure at night and have laughs, like a young adult romance movie"".

To keep it short, I'm fairly religious and I want to meet someone with the same values as me, to practice our Faith together, get married, and raise a family together. I live in the South, so you'd think there'd be plenty of potential matches that check those boxes. Problem is, I live in a fairly medium-sized town with several big colleges, and I have significant trouble finding matches that are within a drivable distance, as many of the potential matches I try to look up all live in or near the major cities in the Southeast that are several hours away (Charleston, Atlanta, Charlotte). But it's not like I live in the middle of nowhere, I live near fairly large cities, even if they aren't somewhere like Atlanta. It frustrates me so much that there's just so little activity near me in comparison. And no, moving is not an option. 

It just gets so frustrating looking at a profile and thinking that she is a good fit, only to see they live like three hours away. And the ones that do live closer I've already tried to message, only for that to go nowhere. I just wonder what else I could do to try to meet people nearer to me because it's obvious that the list of dating apps and sites just aren't doing it for me.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ozneo9/i_feel_like_im_running_around_in_circles_because/
72,ozneyh,1628313946,Sort of asked out a girl at work and now I hate to run into her?,"So I stopped working on my college campus awhile ago and I had asked my female friend jokingly if she could ask out a girl for me. I didn’t expect her but to my surprise she asked for her Instagram and she told me that the girl said I was funny and cool, and that she would add my friend and I could add her from there.

They never exchanged information and the cringey part was that I THINK, I’m not sure if it’s actually her,  but I think I found her IG and sent in a follower request, but didn’t get a follow back. So I’m guessing she doesn’t like me which is fine, we were cordial and I would try to make her laugh when I did work there, but it was embarrassing to see her again. Usually I’m pretty good about shooting my shot, but I hate running into girls I’ve gone out on dates in the past, or girls I’ve asked out before (even if they said yes or no). 

We just said hi to each other and that was pretty much it, I’m probably not going to try to talk to her again and I don’t regret asking her out, but it’s just a reminder of being rejected. 

And my friends and I have a pretty good saying, we never clown on any of us when we go to ask out girls, and the saying is “shooters gotta shoot.” It’s basically saying if you gotta take chances in order to have a chance of success, but in this situation I feel like it backfired.

My friend is still saying that she’s shy and that she wouldn’t be surprised if I was direct then something could happen, (which she is pretty shy) but I said that I’d leave it at that unless she went out of her way to do something.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ozneyh/sort_of_asked_out_a_girl_at_work_and_now_i_hate/

Is this what society is now? Just loungey places with DJs and when you look down at the menu you see the word ""Bites"" and they have all these silly foods with truffle sauce and garlic aioli. Overall, everything feels very *generic.* 

 Your friend tells you that it's super cool and better than going to some random bar where people play darts and pool,  but then again, it all feels very generic to you. It's all the same. 

And when the plate is finally brought to the table, everybody has to take their phone to take a picture in order to put it on social media. 

You talk to a man who has a nice watch and he talks to you about his new sales commission and how he has a client in Shanghai. You also talk to one girl and when she gives you her Instagram, its just a bunch of photos of her modeling in front of the camera in various restaurants and touristy spots in different cities. 

One guy says he met Snoop Dogg back in 2017 and wants to ""get lit"" in the upcoming music festival and another woman tells you the story about how she got her tattoo which has a special meaning and then proceeds to tell you how it also has to do with her astrological sign.

78,oznmcp,1628314941,First date went great and felt genuine connection but was I (F29)too needy acting?,"

I went out on a first date two weeks ago with a guy I felt I really hit it off with. I felt he was very attracted to me and I became attracted with him(M29). He was holding my hand and it felt nice to have a genuine connection. He didn’t pressure me but we had sex and I ended up spending the night. This may be an over share but I didn’t really get wet not bc I wasn’t attracted to him but I think bc I haven’t had sex in a long time and was nervous. It was kinda awk bc I’m sure he picked up on it and we weren’t really able to do it. I don’t know if he even came. I ended up telling him that I only hookup that with guys I’m serious about and that we should wait until we’re exclusive to do that again. He agreed and said he was the same. I might have come off as needy but I started saying to him stuff like “I don’t want this to be a one time thing” “when will we see each other again?” he told me something along the lines of “I don’t want you to think I’m ignoring you I am going to be busy for the next few weeks bc I’m going out of town and right when I get back I have to move out and find a new place to live but I’m thinking I should be contacting you once I’m all set up in my new place which should maybe be next weekend” the rest of the night he cuddled and he kissed me all night and it was very sweet. He didn’t try and hook up with me in the morning or anything but still kissed me and cuddled all night. So over the next two weeks I have been the one to reach out twice and the first time it was just to thank him for the evening. He texted me back both times and continued the convo but then he let the convo die and I was the most recent reply. He told me in our most recent convo that he was super busy and still hasn’t found his place to move. I do genuinely believe him. I really don’t think he is much of a Texter or on his phone a lot. For example he literally has no social media except for a Instagram and he hasn’t posted on it in 10 years. Before our date he only texted me a week before to make the plan and then we went a week with no texting at all until the day of our date  he texted me to confirm. He has watched every single one of my social media stories too. I told him I was attracted to him that evening before we hooked up and he was surprised for some reason? But I’m pretty sure I’ve made it obvious that I like him bc I iniated texts to him two seperate times and they were pretty flirty. I really do think he is a genuine guy but I am a little upset as to why he hasn’t made any plans yet as it’s been two weeks. Then again I know that he did tell me it’d be after he is moved in. I don’t want to double text though 

TLDR; date two weeks ago he told me he would contact me when he is done moving but it’s taking forever and I can’t tell if I should reach out again",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oznmcp/first_date_went_great_and_felt_genuine_connection/

We live one hour and a half away from each other. With our busy schedule, we only hung out 4 times, but we talk on the phone occasionally. And we text each other every other day. From the start, he was the one who plans out our dates. I dont make any plans, he just tells me what time and where to meet up. 

Two weeks ago, i asked him what was he looking for. Something casual or serious. He told me, he was looking for something serious. And he told me that he was glad that i asked him cause he was thinking about it. But he told me that he doesn't want to rush to anything or pressure me. Also, he likes spending time with me. I agreed with him. I told him the same thing. He ended the conversation with, The feeling is mutual. The thing is it's been already 3 months. And i feel like we haven't had any progress with physical contact. The last time we hung out, he gave me a quick hug. But it was awkward. He hasn't given me a kiss or anything. We haven't talked about anything that includes physical touch. Also, we haven't talked about being exclusive. 

He moved into a new apartment and he told me i was invited to his housewarming party when it happens. And he is driving out to my town this weekend. I am going to show him around. He seemed he had no problem driving to my town. He seemed excited..

So im confused, does he like me as a platonic friend? Is he just being nice? This is throwing me off. Should i be worried? Im not sure if he likes physical touch or he is taking it slow.
