My take:  if this is a tactic motivated by any of the above, or something else (besides actually being busy, which happens), it doesn’t work on me.  It has the opposite effect!  It telegraphs lack of interest.  There are others responding more quickly, and I’m totally ok with eagerness from others.

I'm in decent shape (run 5 to 6 miles a day), college educated (if that means anything), have a decent job, money saved up, and I have people say I'm handsome, etc. etc.

If you're wondering why the long gap between the two relationships, I graduated college, recession hit in 2008 and couldn't find a decent job for years like a lot of other people and struggled with money and used that as an excuse not to go out and date anyone. And then once I did find a decent paying job, I just worked, saved money, and I guess I got used to being by myself and doing my own thing.

So I (42) meet this guy (41) IRL we become close friends with daily contact and he begins lovebombing me full on after about 3 months. I play it down as it makes me feel uneasy. Then he would tone it down and we start getting real close and fond of each other. There is so much love and care and great connection mentally as well. 

Sex is good, we really like each other physically, our habits and rhythms are similar, everyone has space but still share common activities, friends, and we essentially both look for the same thing; to love and to be loved, we want someone to be there, not just fuck buddies or a fling. He involves me in interior design for his new home. I stay at his parents house. I take care of him when sick. He does a lot of lovely things for me as I do for him. We give small gifts all the time. He says no matter what, we are there for each other. Even involves me in his future plans, and suffice to say, I am so sold on this. 

We never went officially labelled as such though, label did not seem to matter. But when I tell him after about 6 months that this is it, I am happy and want to be with him, he starts to pull away ever so slightly. Few weeks of question marks, push-pull games follow, then he says he fell out of love and about a month ago he goes for some random chick because he wants to have family.. (did not work out) 

Obviously, I am, aside from the insane amount of pain over the loss and grief, completely dumbfounded as to why on earth would someone throw away something they apparently wanted and relished in, just as they got it. 

Sadly I cant avoid seeing him so I also witness how little of that beautiful love remained in him. As I was just some furniture in the office. Naturally, I tried to get an answer - in a civilised, patient manner, and got all sorts of bullshit answers that don’t add up. 

I am also hearing similar stories from others. Can someone lighten me up please? Why would people do something like this? Just look around, he heard all these awful stories about dating, too. In a world like this, I’d take care of gems in my life for sure!

Advice? What to expect? Other than just “wait and see” because my anxiety doesn’t work like that (hence why I’m posting here, I guess). Also I guess I don’t know the “rules” of dating these essays. 

The next 2 paragraphs are backstory and I know this is long so feel free to skip if you want to get to my point/question. 

Little backstory: got divorced about 2 1/2 years ago. We were together for 13 years. No kids. Decided to up and move somewhere out of state I always wanted to live. Got a great job. Then Covid hit. I knew I didn’t want to jump into the dating pool right away, but a single friend of mine who we had always flirted offer to be a rebound for a month or so which really helped. 

So as lockdown etc is still going on in summer/fall 2020, I decide to try OLD. Met a guy, we got along well from the start, we decided since both of us had been working from home and had no other interactions we would meet up. Hit it off great. Dated for like 3 months. We broke up because he was emotionally unavailable but we are still friends and really enjoy hanging out. Tried a couple more dates in 2020 and they were all nothing I was interested in. Stayed away from even trying all of 2021. Month or so ago decided to try again. Matched with one guy and we hit it off so great talking for like 2 weeks but when we met in person the spark was not there for me. No matter. 

So I guess I’m not usually the one to reach out, “like” whatever (match.com). Last weekend I see this guy, I think he’s hot and I notice his profile is totally the stuff I’m into and not just all pics of skiing and hiking and mad gym shots and “if u wanna know just ask” and all that shit. Divorced with no kids. Love kids just never wanted any of my own and lots of people dating at our age do have kids. So I decide to send him a message. I see he’s read it and checked out my profile and online so I figure ok, he’s not interested, no worries. Next day he messages me back and we spent all day chatting and he asks if I want to meet up for a drink the next day (yesterday). So, we did! It went great it was a little over 2 hours and the moment I walked in he gave me a big hug and there was no silent or awkward moments the whole time. He said he had to go because he had to get up at like 5 for work. We walked out and we got to his car first (I was around the corner) and he said he’d like to do it again if i would (which I said yes), gave me a hug and a kiss which turned into like 4 (pecks, whatever, you know), we leave. He texts me later and says he had fun and was really busy all week but if I had time next week let’s make plans. I said ok. 

All of this seems really positive to me! So you might be wondering what the hell I am going on about. Well, I like him and I feel so awkward. Do I wait for him to call or text me? Should I not worry if he goes silent for a week because he is so busy? Would it seem weird if later this week I just texted him to say hi? I don’t know what to fucking do I’m mid-40s and I feel like when I was dating in my 20s it was still more of a wait for him to call you and if he doesn’t in 2 days or whatever he’s not interested. 

Please fellow daters just help me not crash this before I can see where it will go. I’m not trying to get serious fast or anything like that, but this is the first dude I actually was like, wow, yeah, I want to see more of him and just enjoy his company and see what happens. Also I now don’t really want to talk to multiple dudes/answer messages but should I assume he is talking to multiple women?

Started dating May 2020 – Really great connection in all ways, we actually “love” each other – Feb ’21 I was dealing with some neediness issues, we took a 3-week break. I overcame my issues and she’s even said, she hasn’t seen them since. Everything was great again, and we were spending even more time together. Jun ’21 came back from a vacation and she started to get distant. Jul ’21 we broke up. She felt she couldn’t give me what I wanted from a relationship because she has kids still and mine are grown. (Really was never an issue, but she did seem to have an avoidant attachment style). A week later we decide that we can still be friends and hang out – that leads to friends that can hang out and also have sex. (Dating?). 

We start hanging out often and I even spend the night the nights we do have sex. We kiss hello and goodbye. We figure out that maybe we do have a chance, and while unspoken we are basically dating again. We do make a promise to one another that “if there is no chance at a future for us” we’ll let the other know – so they can start dating or whatever. 

Day after Thanksgiving ’21 – She tells me there is no chance for us in the future because she’s not ready to be in a relationship – has too much on her plate – just doesn’t feel that way for me. But we continue the relationship almost exactly the same except – we no longer kiss hello and goodbye, and sleeping over stopped. 

Two weekends ago we end up spending the entire weekend together. I slept over both nights and we had a great weekend. That week we hang out again. 

**Issue/Question:** While she knew I was going to try dating – went on 3 early Dec – none since, not by my choice, OLD sucks for guys. She initially put herself OLD but stopped and she told me she was taking a yr off from dating because she wanted to work on herself. So the other night I saw her on an app. I called her and asked about it, and she claimed it was from before she decided and she couldn’t delete it – I told her I was going to wait to say something, but when she’s ready to date, I’d like an opportunity. She said if we get back together, it would have to happen naturally and she’s not going to push it. I know she’s probably going on dates – but obviously not found someone cause we’re still having sex and hanging out. – **My question is, am I kidding myself that she might consider getting back together with me again?**",True,False,False,datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,66320,public,self,Am I kidding myself?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/sd5wn2/am_i_kidding_myself/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BUT I recently learned in a round about way that he has been visiting an Only Fans site for a woman who markets herself as a sexy teacher.  

I see Only Fans interaction as different than passively watching porn—because it is interactive.  So while this may not be actually physically cheating, it feels more like that and I feel very conflicted.  

I can’t tell him to stop — he is a grown man.  But I’m wondering if I should tell him that it bothers me?  I’m still wrapping my head around this … it’s not necessarily a deal killer but …

Also when I found out about this, he lied to me at first, which tells me he knows it is different than passively watching porn.  

(No I did not snoop on his phone or computer.  We share an Instagram account for a side gig and when I was on that account I saw in the notices that it said “your contact [only fans name] is on Instagram.”  I then saw that he followed her with our joint account (mistake) and liked her two (very recent) IG pics with his own account.

Here lies the problem. We text once a day.Typically good morning, good night, and to confirm a date. We've kissed and made out, no sex. It's been 3 months with many dates. I'm not having sex until I'm ready, and he's not pushing. We basically meet, have lots of fun together, and kiss goodbye. No phone calls between dates. I typically feel like we're strangers again each time we meet.

He was very, very enthusiastic during the initial dates, but he's cooled way off. I've tried to initiate more affection, hand holding, etc but I sense he's holding back.

Is it because of the lack of sex??

Didn't have the consideration to text me and let me know she was gonna be delayed, felt disrespectful. Like there was no consideration for my feelings and I'm just left hanging there. The day before we had an awesome conversation about our burgeoning relationship too. When she got back I said my peace, that it was messed up to do that and to leave me hanging like that. She asked for my forgiveness and said she'd never want to make me feel that way again. Has been super apologetic today as well. But the damage has been done.

I often take breaks from dating when it feels exhausting. Right now I am on a break. 

Reading that comment made me wonder if people would think that I am non-committal because I haven't been in a stable relationship for some time. I have never thought of myself like that but maybe it is something to think about? I always say that I am looking for a long-term stable relationship.  

I guess I have two questions:

The social anxiety is still there but at this point in life it's secondary to even want to try dating again. I'm operating under a 100% rejection rate for the past 25 years since I was 15. I don't understand mutual attraction as I've never experienced it and I'd love to do nothing more than just skip the courting phase altogether, but I know that isn't an option.

I only asked out about 20 women last year and they all nicely told me to go fuck myself. I have literally hundreds of rejections in my life without a single success at getting anyone to even spend 10 minutes with me to get coffee. It  shaped my mindset to be someone who really doesn't wanna try anymore if I'm being honest (rejection isn't fun).

I am 48 she is 50. 

We are in an LDR. We see each for at least a week every month. We have talked a lot about having a long term future together.

We are both divorced. She has adult children and mine are minors. 

Our finances are very different. She makes WAY more than I do, plus all my money goes to child support. We have talked extensively about financials and she is fine carrying the financial weight of the relationship. 

This brings me to my question. We have been talking about giving me some control over a small portion of the financials so that I can plan dates and activities or make purchases of things for us without me always having to ask her.

With dating I seem to be extremely passive, meaning, I really need to have the guy chasing hard in order for me to feel like I want to be in it. Hear me out, it's not an ego thing but a self-aware insecurity. I guess as a woman you always feel like you hear these messages that 'if he wants you, he'll go after you', so for me it's the only way I suppose that I know he really likes me. At least in the beginning. That said, I have started to wonder if this tactic has hindered me. I posted something a while ago - my first reddit post actually - where I had an incident where I left a date because I felt rejected. Most people thought I overreacted. Fast forward to this past weekend I met up with a really great guy and we hit it off. Had a couple drinks, talked a ton, and ended the night with a steamy make out session. He texted me that night to say he had a great time and to make sure I got home ok. That he thought I was very pretty and sexy. Then he texted me the next day to see how my day was going and also to reminisce about the make-out. Granted, a lot of signs pointed to him just wanting to get physical, but I kind of flirted back and left it alone with him texting last.

The next day I unmatched him from Hinge because I really want to date someone who can ask me out after a first date, not just a lazy flirt. Maybe this is okay but then I wondered if it was another overreaction from me. That he initiated the texting and just because he didn't ask me out right away again I unmatched eventhough it had only been a day. Anyways, I was having a good day today and had a couple of great opportunities present themselves (non-dating) so I guess I found myself in a flow - you know the kind where you feel like you can rule the world for a minute? - and decided to text him and let him know while my weekend was busy i'd love to see him again and left it in his court.

I’m 42 M, and live in northern Alberta…And I swear I live in a city where the people are so damn disingenuous it’s infuriating. I haven’t been on any dating sites in a couple of months, as I feel like it’s the same serial daters that have been on there constantly for years. Granted, I live in a working city that’s about 8:1 men to women. I feel like we live in a “throw away” society. Nobody wants to give anybody a chance anymore. The females around here have the pick of the crop as there’s so many, and are always looking for that “grass is greener on the other side”, constantly. I’ve even had a girl in the middle of a dinner date with me reply to messages on the dating site we met on. 

And honestly I feel like my biggest hurdle is the fact I have a soon to be 5 yr old daughter. I was with her mother for a year, and pregnancy was unplanned, but we rolled with it. She went abusive berserk a couple months after birth, and we split. I have her 50/50 and is obviously my #1 priority. I’ve been told numerous times I’ve got no business trying to date at my age with a young child. 

I’m no underwear model, but I do take care of myself. I’m tall, and yes have a bit of a dad bod, but I’m active and eat healthy(most of the time). I just can’t get anywhere with women. 

The last part is going to sound weird I know, but please be kind. My sex drive/testosterone is unusually high. Like teenager high. I’ve read that’s not supposed to happen, but here I am. I’ve been told by a couple of women now, that’s a turnoff. As in the more I want it, the less my partner does. I’m not a walking hard-on that’s dry-humping everything either. Just enjoy a passionate relationship. 

I’ve had way more bad experiences trying to date than good ones. Apparently being a single father with a young daughter is a huge deal breaker in these parts. And honestly covid has unfortunately turned me into a bit of an introvert. My self esteem has taken a beating over the last couple of years to say the least, so I’ve just resigned myself to being single for the foreseeable future. Just I just wait till my daughter’s older and try again? I’m not unhappy per say, just lonely I guess. Do I have a defeatist attitude?…..maybe. Just all the rejection for things out of my control has me down a but lately.

Be careful when a date out of the blue starts deciding what you need. This is not the same as them hearing what you need and working with that. 

--------------

First was a man who converted a date-for-relationship into a ONS. I was completely enthralled by this one. On the second date we talk for two hours then go to his place for drinks. After an hour of more conversation he looks at me and says something about how I might need sex as part of my growth right now.

From my point of view, we're still on a date, he's still interested, and he'd like sex with the understanding that it would hold no promises. So we do.

Later that week I get it in retrospect. He never was interested in me long term. He used the talk to dazzle me, and the declaration of my needs as a way to make sex look like him being concerned about me.

---------------

After the first experience, I felt like maybe I did want to be open to casual dating and sex, but with better communication and with better connection, hopefully making for a better experience.

So I change my OLD profile from relationship to ""I don't know.""

----------------

Second was a man who restates my ""I don't know"" to ""casual with connection."" I say it's a fair restatement even though I am still open to a relationship. 

This date is much, much better than the other experience. He's pretty wonderful and, for me, the casual with connection feels like casual with profound connection.

But then in less than 24 hours he's saying I'm great but he needs a relationship and since I'm ""casual with connection"" it can't work.

I want to believe this second guy was less manipulative than the first. But I also think he wanted to clearly define my position before sex so that he could have an excuse after it. I do have a feeling that if I had said I want a relationship, that after sex he would have said he wasn't ready for a relationship.

------------

I'm walking away from these experiences with plenty of information about people and myself. I'm learning.

People can be dazzling and very convincing temporarily. I'm sure I'm stating the obvious when I conclude that anyone can misrepresent themselves over a short time period. Also, talk is cheap.

At my age and stage in life, I'm recognizing that I must have a connection before sex and therefore I need to protect myself more, because it f*ing hurts to build a connection only to have it broken. 

I think I prefer to go much slower, and--like many of you already advise--give myself much more time to get to know someone before I make myself vulnerable to them.

OLD is a rollercoaster because it feels so urgent and that urgency can lead to shallow decisions and experiences. 

It isn't necessarily so, I have met men who are much more old-school and seem intent on getting to know each other well before getting physical. This makes me appreciate them more, especially after my other experiences.

And, these slower men also--so far--take what I say about my needs at face value, and they work with that.",True,False,False,datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,66439,public,self,Beware Dates Who Decide What You Need,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/sep7wy/beware_dates_who_decide_what_you_need/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Firstly, I would value any advice as I’m feeling quite sick at the moment…. 

Some background - 
Marriage of 22 years broke down - caught now ex- husband in an affair. 
It’s been two years. 
Met a wonderful guy (also divorced after a long marriage - he was faithful till the end) a year ago. 
We talked every day for a full six months, went for walks, coffees. 
Things went further, it felt like we both fought this as I genuinely belief neither of us were out to rush into anything and it’s weird as hell. 
We have a wonderful relationship, we can talk for hours or just sit in each other’s company and quietness with no uncomfortableness. 
We have amazing sex, like honestly - never felt more alive…

While we are still ‘unsure’ as to this new ‘thing’ we don’t refer to each other as our partner. Even though some of our friends are (and my kids). 

Today we had a little ‘inside’ joke on messages and I said to him all I ask is honesty, if you get bored or want to move on with someone else please be honest and let me know. 
He was shocked at my response and while I then asked for him to let me know his honest thoughts about how I feel… He didn’t respond. 

Am I too sensitive considering  my background and cheating ex husband?

We talk about stuff together in our future. Talking to his family (he always talk about me with them). He said things like he wish he met me earlier in his life and I’ve made him a better person, etc.  

Please help me. I don’t want to ruin this with my insecurities…

We will see each other later and I will talk to him then but will be good to get an outside view. 

Might be relevant to note we are both in our mid forties.

Hi everybody!

A  couples of days ago the woman i dated broke the relationship after 3  months and a half. She is 41 and i'm 48, close to 49 soon.

I  must admit that I caused the breakup because she has been more  uncomfortable than usual for days with her, so I went back to topics  that I knew were sticky for her and that we had talked about the day  before after returning from a weekend at a resort, we had a great time  good.

There were 2 issues in my relationship:

1. We  work at school as teachers. I was new. So we started dating but she  wanted that nobody knows at work that we were dating. Until the end of  our relationshio. She is very traditional, and i'm an urban male. I  don't care what the people thinks about me and my relationships, but for  her it is, and in my country is ver normal that teachers date as  coworkers (when it happens) normally, not as something awkward.
2. She  is very childiss in the intimacy, and very shy for sex and even for  talking about her emotions, mostly if she needs to say something nice or  about love. She isn't rude, but her communications skills in this area  are poor, from my point of view.

Those  things becoming a bigger problem. We had 2-3 first months like a dream,  very passionate, kind, doing things, etc. etc. Classic couple that  communicates very well, talk a lot, etc.

But  it seems like my sense of the relationship was wrong. Week after week,  we live in a small town (we are not from here, we live both in another  city close, surprisely),  sometimes, i felt embarrased. Casue waking  around the town, she want to be invisible, that nobody notice she was  with me.

It's like she wanted to  live in a small capsule with me. I know it sounds weird. I let her,  after some discussions, let this, but i'm a normal guy and i dont like  to hide. Never did it. It was very umcomfortable.

But  i adapted, things goes nice, and so on. But, at the same time, i felt  like she was very good with me. She was happy, she was kind, and so on.  But a little bit,  a few days ago she started to act different.  More  like a Diva. I thought i was giving too much, much than her.

Last  night, after a day with some discussiones about the 1 and 2 point, hide  our relationship and she do things, but never says something ( i told  her i didnt want ""i love you"", but something like i like to be with you,  or i like your eyes) cause i need it to ear that too.

She  said while fighting talking that she felts very pressure, that she  needs more time, and i remember her that the idea of going to live  together in a few months was hers, not mine, but i was agreed. We live  each other in our houses.

So...  Things went wrong and wrong. I said that i can't with that hiding shit,  and she said that she does not want to have a relationship with a  coworker... and i told her how the fuck is that, if we are fucking  DATING 3 months? I dont' want a relationship with a coworker too, isn't  easy, but life is life, what do you mean.

She  also said she felt awkward last weekend when we were in the resort, and  i must be honest saying that i felt that too. We didnt had sex, we were  exhausted for the last 2 weeks, but we were doing nice sports and  sleeping together as usual an being very affectionate with each other.  Next day she send me a message and she told me she had a nice weekend  with me and so on.

So, yes, maybe i  pressure her, but i felt that sex isn't going nice (not only for the  last weekend, i felt like no emotions with her, but i felt too that i  want to stay with her, i thought it was a small crisis), but the fight  getting hot.

I saw a woman i never  seen again. She was saying things to hurt me. She said she is not going  to change and dont want to date me anymore, and in that moment i  thought that was i want too. I was tired of all of that shit, globaly. She told me before that previous guys (she had very few relationships and her last big was when she had 25 years old, other were from 1 year to months, and no more) she shuddenly feels on the top of the rollercoaster and then a few time later, she goes to the bottom and needs to leave the relationship, she told me she feels that and dont know why, but that was happened with me recently these last days. Well, i'm not Brad Pitt, and i'm not the most attractive handsome guy of the world, but i am, haha, so i don't know what happened to this woman with me because i never detected any sign that something goes wrong (cause she hide it, maybe, but... that's not my problem then, it's hers). 

I  answered her rudly too, and she said old issues about us or that she  thought that she NEVER told me before. like she were saving all those  things that worried or disappointed her instead of telling me and  talking about them. Like mature people i think do.

Things ends me leaving her at her house and breaking, i was really angry too and she was like an ice with me.

First time i saw her in that mood. It was shocking.

What i thought (i know i left a lot of info, but i want to do it shortly):

1. She  likes me, but she wants a casual relationship hide with me to keep  doing his private life, sports, etc. etc., but not to invest too much.  BUT IN 2 MONTHS or a bit more THE IDEA OF GOING TO LIVE TOGEHER WAS  HERS, NOT MINE. She started dating with me, she asked for me, she was  looking for dating me, at the beginning i wasn't interested. But she  wants a discreetly relationships cause we had a good position in our  school and she is an ambiitous woman, that i like, and maybe she wants  to hide it. She told me her family was very traditional. But hey, you  can't say in my car that you want to put your glasses on cause some kids  or friend coworkers can see us together. Those things, not everyday,  but every week or 2, was fucking my mind.
2. She  was never in love with me, just with a guy who treats her like a queen  and she was enjoying that and no more. And when she started feeling  less, she was thinking about broke the relationship.
3. She is a very inmature woman emotionally (i think this can be true and also 2 or 3).

So,  yes, i'm not perfect, i invested more than her, and i didnt play mental  seduction games with her that most man know, cause i wanted to have a  natural relationship and see where that goes.

The  las fight was very rude, as ai told, she was trying to hurt me, and i  answered rude too, but never trying to hurt her, but that happened, it  was no control in that moment. I told her that if we are going to be  friends later or at least say goodbye hello at work, but she said: of  course not.

Man, i have a great  personality, i have a lot of character, but i'm not an idiot guy  insulting and those things, i don't need it, i'm more ironic and  sarcastic.

Well, it hurts, cause i  have feelings, but some part of me wanted to break and know im feeling  hurted, not much, but i invested an for another part of me, the brain,  says: she is not for yours, baby, she is not the kind of woman for you.

So,  what do you think. I made mistakes, i push too much maybe, but if she  said she was not going a milimeter (textual words) what she thinks about  not dating a coworker (and were 3 months and a half, it's an hilarious  argument), so there's no debate and negotiation, there's nothing i could  do cause i'm not going to stay with a woman under her rules while she  lives the perfect life privately that she wants.

A guy who she went on a date with before meeting her husband is one of my friends and he just told me he wished he gave her a chance because not only is she still beautiful (she was beautiful at 300 pounds) but she has since became so successful in her career that it allowed her husband to go back to school full time to get his masters and PhD (something my friend has been wanting to do but can’t afford to quit work). 

I told him it sounds like he is looking at what she could do for him instead of what he could offer and he said he could have worked out with her like she put in her dating profile, but he wanted the finished product, not the work in progress.

I have stories like this where I was told I would be perfect if I wasn’t overweight by guys who didn’t want to invest in me. Some of them didn’t even have the ability to match me in what I was bringing to the relationship, but I was willing to support their journey to better finances, a more meaningful career, etc and all I wanted was someone to workout with me and who is creative with healthy meals. I’m in a healthy and happy relationship now but I’m curious how many of you have passed up people that you wish you gave a chance and/or invested in? Anyone willing to date someone who is actively working on themselves and support them on that journey or do you all prefer people who have everything together? 

Side note: I understand to some people that despite how beautiful or handsome a person is, if they are overweight or underweight it automatically makes them unattractive so the can’t be with someone like that. Example, one my friends loves Natalie Portman but was instantly turned off when she lost weight for Black Swan. So for people where weight is a deal breaker, another example to use may be bad finances since people can come out of debt with work just like people can change their weight with work).",True,False,False,datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,66499,public,self,Who is willing to invest in a potential partner as they work on improving themselves while dating?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/sfl5xd/who_is_willing_to_invest_in_a_potential_partner/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I was a DJ for 15 years and through my own gigs or with my fellow crew memebers, there was always an event or way to be out and socialise.  Now everyone should be avoiding those situations for awhile and I am home just working on myself or small projects but I miss some social interaction.  Some jokes to share or good conversation or just a movie, TV show or book to watch, read or talk about.  I looked into Hinge and started to sign up but I am not sure what to put.  I don't have many good pictures.   Most pictures are group at night or a dimly room and we are all hamming it up distastefully so I will not put any like that.  I have to have someone take pictures of me.  So they will be staged with me probably standing unnaturally in front of somthing.

I think many of my personal stories to share sound fantastical and fake, my background sounds made up as well but online is the only way I see to meet anyone these days.  We can't travel as freely and I am holding off on booking trips because this modified distancing isn't what I want to travel around the world to see.  

Lastly I got a blue collar job now.  It is different than my first career programming computers and it is not a high paying six figure job.  It is pretty poor paying but I enjoy it.  Younger me would probably say that I have settled and don't work so hard anymore.  I own property and have planned for retirement and have investments, now just trying to enjoy living and exploring the world.

That being the case, I am now planning to try to impress strangers.  It doesn't seem possible.
