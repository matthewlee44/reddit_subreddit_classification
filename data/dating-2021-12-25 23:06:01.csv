1,roq0rk,1640495762,Should I say that I like him ?,"So there is this new guy (23) who is working in a shop near the one that I’m (22F) working in and I’ve been looking at him for a long time and he noticed that so he started to talk to me little by little and we were having small conversations.

And one day he came up to me and asked me for my name and my snapchat so I added him and he told me that he was mesmerized by my eyes. 

The thing is he’s kinda a bad boy and a player , he’s so outgoing with other girls and not just like that , sometimes he jokes with my other co-workers when he passes by and ignores me (even tho I’m the only one who is friends with him) and sometimes he gives me all his attention and flirts a lot like A LOT , he even gave me his personal favorite pin from his chest and put it in my sleeve and he told me “don’t be shy when you need anything just tell me” he even fought with drunk guys who harassed me late at night and he stayed until I closed the shop and made sure that I went safely to my car. 

I don’t know what to do with him he’s hot and cold and I’m confused I don’t want to break my heart again and I’m scared.

Another note I’m kinda cold with him and I don’t respond to his flirting like other girls so he sometimes tries harder for my attention and he said “don’t be harsh on me just be easy and open up to me” and when I text him he takes hours to reply. 

I know he’s not completely a bad boy he helps me a lot and always make sure I’m fine , I’ll give him that. 

Any advices ? Should I give him a chance and tell him that I like him or I’m just gonna waste my time with him ?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/roq0rk/should_i_say_that_i_like_him/

I am not quite sure where to post this. 

I am a young adult in college (19 almost 20). Had a few dates they were horrible. Dudes only cared about sex, were super manipulative and mean. 

Long story short I grew up in a bad household and community, and have a bad background with sexual relations due to that. 

One of my best friends let's call her D came to college wanting to find sex, found a long-term partner the first week, has now been around him for two years. D is openly bisexual and jokes about us being a poly couple quite often, she is just a few months older than myself. 

I am fine with the jokes, however, I really like her. I trust her, enjoy spending time with her and we have post-college plans as well. 

How do I approach this? I don't want to ruin the friendship but I am lost.

I know this is too long for casual but I feel really attached to him at this point. He is seeing another girl, which at the start was fine. But. He goes away on weekends with her, knows her friends, goes out places with her etc. He would never do that with me. He only comes to my house or I go to his place. We hang out and talk, have a beer and then we have sex, he’ll stay for a bit after and then leave.

He said he I mean a lot to him and he thinks about me everyday and he didn’t want it to end this way and he wanted to see me. Fast forward and he put off seeing me for two weeks. He has had some mental health issues and had just been diagnosed with adult ADHD and he was really upset about it. When I did see him it just went back to how it was and I wonder if he put off seeing me so I would have second thoughts about ending it. I’m so confused about what he wants from me. What I want to know is whether sex is enough to keep a guy hanging on even when I told him the situation is making me feel worthless and like I don’t matter.

13,roqxzs,1640499239,There will never be one single solution to all of your problems,"It might be human nature, but we always seem to look for one single answer as a solution to our problems:

If you’re overweight, you’ll feel happy with yourself once you get in better shape.

If you kick your porn habit or stop masturbating you’ll feel confident.

If you read a book, or take a certain course, you’ll be able to talk to women.

The bottom line is, even if you solve what you believe is your biggest deficiency or problem, you will eventually find something else. 

You will never be ‘there’, where you are one hundred percent at ease with who you are. That’s not a bad thing. It’s human nature.  It keeps us moving forward and developing as people. 

Confidence comes from consistent action in various areas of your life, not just addressing the area where you feel the most incomplete. It’s hard work on various .

For instance, if you kick your porn habit, but stay at home while eating junk and not maintaining your personal hygiene, you will still likely feel a sense of unease and insecurity, although your biggest source of personal dissonance is being managed.

You shouldn’t be dissuaded from working on yourself, and improve on the areas where if you feel to need work.

15,ror1cv,1640499616,[Vent] I don't think I have the energy to start dating,"This is mostly just a rant. 

&amp;#x200B;

My family is absolutely fucking insane. They are *extreme* Evangelical fundamentalists that insisted on ""homeschooling"" me as a child. I put that in quotation marks because there really wasn't much school involved, it was several hours of praying/reading the Bible as well as a little bit of math. Due to the fact that my parents are part of a very small, very extreme (growing up my dad taught us that 9/11 was God judging America for homosexuality) , and very insular religious sect I was never really socialized as a kid. I certainly was not allowed to date or even spend time around the opposite sex. 

When I ""graduated"" high school I was basically a little kid that was a legal adult. I didn't have a basic knowledge of the world and was essentially unschooled. The only people I really ever interacted with growing up were my parents, so I struggled a LOT with very basic social situations. 

Most of my twenties was spent trying to remedy these deficiencies. I spent a lot of time at the library trying to read and learn about the world. It is genuinely possible that I have watched more lectures on YT than anyone else alive. I spent a lot of time learning how to interact with people. Even very simple interactions such as dealing with a cashier at the grocery store was hard for me when I started.  It was hard. As fuck. It was mentally and emotionally draining. I had so so sooooooooo many embarrassing and awkward conversations...

I do feel like I'm at the point to which I am pretty good at dealing with people in a vast majority of situations. I have a very good job and I don't feel like I have issues communicating with people on a day to day basis. The one thing I haven't done is dating....as in I have never been on a date and am at 100% lifetime rejection rate. 

I feel like learning to date is going to be very hard for me. TBH I have never had any type of sexual interaction with another person. The worst part for me is that...Bros/Broettes I'm just fucking tired. I'm too fucking old for this shit (32m) and I don't know that I have the mental/emotional stamina left to spend...potentially years trial and erroring my way through the basics of human sexuality. Like fuck, eventually you wake up and the fire is gone and it just sounds easier to accept your fate and throw in the towel.

17,ror7nu,1640500304,A little confused about the slow pace and when I’m seeing him next,"I’ve (29F) been dating this guy (31M) for over a month, we usually get together for a date 2x a week, except this week we only saw each other once. Mutual friends/my clients helped encourage him to message me and we’ve been chatting and getting to know each other since mid November. Things have been determined on his slow pace since he’s a shy guy, and seems that maybe he was hurt in the past. He was married in 2017, which I heard through my clients indirectly but he has yet to even bring up his past or that he was married, which I find a bit odd how reserved he is. I don’t think he’s trying to hide it, I think he’s embarrassed. They were married less than a year, his friends told him not to marry her but he tried to make it work. He doesn’t come off as a ladies man at all and is kinda quiet. He likes football and is a simple kind of guy, but asks me a lot of questions. We haven’t had sex or gotten sexual at all yet, but that’s fine. The slow pace is refreshing after I had my heart broken by my ex this year. He’s been respectful of me and taking his time to get to know me. We really enjoy our time together, after every date and the next day he says how much fun he’s had and that he really enjoys spending time with me. We laugh a lot and get along well, I can see this definitely developing into a relationship. We have even had two group dates with his friends and it was a ton of fun. We took some pictures together last Saturday (he took them) and he seemed to break out of his shell more the last couple times we’ve hung out. 

But I’m getting a little worried and confused: 1. I’m not exactly sure what he wants and 2. when I’ll see him next. We have kept things casual on dates and only have talked about surface level topics. I have gotten in my head a bit anxious about what is comfortable to bring up because I don’t know what he wants and he’s reserved. I don’t think he would continue to pursue me the way he has but it’s been extremely casual at the same time. I want to ask him about his dating history next time I see him, but he was vague when I mentioned today that I’d like to see him soon. All he said able was he would like to see me too and changed topics … I don’t know if I’ll be seeing him at any point the rest of this year. His dad is coming to visit and staying with him, but he plans to see more family and possibly go out of town to see them on New Years Eve in another city (2-3 hours away), not he’s not sure what plans are yet. I asked him to let me know. Otherwise I will need to make other plans. On Monday he mentioned him and I should take a trip together soon to a nearby city in January, but then said he might be able to get a hotel discount in February and said he’ll let me know. So I guess we’ll see. 

He last came over to my apartment on Tuesday, I made tacos and have him a little Christmas gift (49ers football mug tumbler). He thanked me several times for it and appreciated my cooking. But he didn’t get me anything and only stayed 3 hours cause he said he “was tired” and had work in the morning. I noticed he’s been using less emojis and kinda saying less (funny or flirt things) since Thursday but still will reply to my texts within 10-30 minutes, while sometimes I don’t answer for up to one hour or more.

I myself am in a really good place now, and was happy even before meeting her. Sport/Work/Hobby/Friends, I'm in a really healthy routine, and I can project myself in the future and am building something out of my life. 

So pretty naturally I stepped up to help her on cleaning, tidying, cooking and other chores. Plus, even if I don't have kids on my own, I have a really good feeling with them in general and her kids love me,  I spend time with them and give them a lot of attention and am really playful. It's really a second nature to me. 

But I don't like to hide my feelings and I'm done playing games. I want to keep my healthy lifestyle/vibe I have going on, so I'm honest in my relationships. 

So I told her I started to catch feelings. 

And since then, something broke.

Sometimes I'm able to walk away from the situation without saying anything, despite it always being painful, but other times I end up getting in my feelings and asking ""why don't you feel a spark"" and ""what can I do better in the future"" basically going crazy and asking my date for advice on how to be more attractive. Which obviously isn't my dates responsibility.

It's now become a pattern for me where ""successful"" dates don't make me feel much better, but everytime I get a rejection it piles on to the pain of the last one. This is honestly a terrible trait for me to have considering how consistently I online date but its not something I've been able to fix. Part of me has considered giving dating up altogether, but then I give up the possibility of the next date actually being the ""one"". It's really the pain of my false hope being torn down time and time again that makes dating terrible for me. I just want to know how other people cope with the constant rejection? Or if I'm the only one that's actually been rejected this many times to start feeling this way lol",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ros3z2/i_cant_take_rejection/
29,ros7wb,1640504518,Coming off as clingy when organising a date?,"I've been hitting it off with a girl recently over voice texts for the past week. I floated the idea of catching up for drinks after Christmas and she said she'd let me know her schedule for the week today. I work a 9:00 - 5:00 and she works in the evenings so it's pretty tight for both of us.

Yesterday she texted me saying how she was all alone, her parents are out and she's looking for something to do - when I offered that we could hang out since we both don't celebrate Christmas she declined. I then realised that I had the entire week off so I'd be free to hang out during the day sometime during the week and the conversation continued from there without much second thought given to what I said (it was just something I tagged on at the end of a text).

I'm going to let things simmer and wait for her to bring it up but I'm worried that I came off as clingy when I told her my availability was freed up during the daytime for this particular week. She'd been calling me cute/hot/flirting a lot so I think she's interested so I'll just be patient...I'm overthinking this way too much and need some peace of mind.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ros7wb/coming_off_as_clingy_when_organising_a_date/
30,rosjh0,1640505924,She (22F) asked if i (22M) am intimidated by her because i am not dominant.,"So ive been seeing this girl..

she admitted her feelings for me first. 
one night we got in a fight and the next day we talked and she said she wants to take things slower and start off as friends.  

we had been sexting etc which she always initiated but would say it would give her cold feet but shes so attracted to me. 
when we first met she said i dont speak much and when i do everyone listens with such intent and that im funny etc

im also used to always making the first moves and decisions so with her this is different. shes very outspoken about men, consent etc and different so i wouldnt dare making a move without asking. 

anyways so she says about starting as friends but is still attracted to me and i respect it. so i start treating her as a friend and immediately she was flirting and texting me the same night. 

i was completely confused and didnt really play into it. 
we went on our first “date” and had SO much fun.  
i didnt initiate any physical contact nor flirt though as i want to respect her wishes. 

she professed her interest in me and asked if i had the same in which i do after. 

but still i am afraid of flirting and overstepping boundaries/not rush anything. 

the way she is i also feel like im walking on eggshells sometimes which from what i see if partially my fault in thinking so. 

lately ive been in a lull and losing interest in her simply just by the confusion and suppressing my emotions so i dont get attached and hurt. 

she will flirt with me here and there too. which gets me confused. 

the other day she started flirting kinda with me and asked me to go to stores with her so we did for like 2 hours, we went and had a fun time. but again no physical contact. 

last night she flirted hard so today i said fck it and sent a flirty text. things were getting intense. she even was “begging” for my attention.  she then asked if i was intimidated by her. and doesnt want me to feel uncomfortable. 

it took me 2 times asking her and giving examples to why she felt i was. 

she proceeded to tell me that she has been making all the moves. 
as well as the way i respond to her 
the way i conduct myself
 “you dont seem dominant” 

i told her i have been respecting her wishes and trying not to put her in any uncomfortable situations. as well as taking things slow. 
im afraid of flirting and holding back because of that. 

that im used to making all the moves and decisions and if i have permission i will then. 
she then told me how much she wants me and that we agree on telling each other what we are comfortable with and would rather press the gas pedal and reestablish boundaries than nothing at all. 

we started flirting and role playing hard. 

we are seeing each other monday as of right now and im going to kiss her and maybe even a little more. just this all has me kind of confused and the way she said that im not dominant along with it seeming like im weak when in the end im just trying to respect her wishes felt very disrespectful to me. 

i did thank her for telling me though and that im so happy she did. 

what can i do to go back to being myself and not seeming so submissive? and what was i doing wrong?

tldr; 
girl confusing me with what she wants then says im not dominant. maybe i was taking it too slow.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rosjh0/she_22f_asked_if_i_22m_am_intimidated_by_her/

I've been seeing a girl for the past month. We've been on 4 dates so far. I enjoy hanging out with her.

Anyway, she tested for covid on 12/22. Received positive result on 12/24.

On the 24th I mentioned the idea of going out with her for New Years but in the end told her I think we should probably wait to go out after new years since I have immuno-compromised roommates.

After thinking about it more, if she tests negative before the 31st we can still go out. She's going to need to test anyway before going back to work.

Would it sound bad/desperate to mention setting up tentative plans for the 31st and cancel if she tests positive again?

Part of me has a gut feeling that she's already set up plans and I should just live with my decision to wait....I've really wanted a new years date for at least 5 years now and I thought this would have been perfect. Maybe I *am* desperate?

I dont like referring to people as options, but in lieu of a better word, having ""options"" makes you less hurt when people say no and more confident when approaching new people.
Essentially, the more you date, the more you will date. Its a momentum thing that works both ways. The less you date, the less you will date.

Im not saying sleep around, im saying that going out on dates with people improve your ability to go out with people. 

Now some of you will say, but i like this one person. Great. Date them at the peak of your dating, not the beginning.

37,rosqwc,1640506856,When to DTR - we’re inseparable,"I’m 21f. He (23m) was a mutual friend, we were linked online over a year ago. We started DMing July 2021. That spilled into talking every day to voice messages to phone calls to FaceTiming all night twice a week almost for weeks. Context was I lived in a different state so we couldn’t meet. I returned to my old city November 2021 which is where he lives. And we’ve been inseparable for just over a month now. 

We spend on average 4-5 days a week with each other, definitely stays over all weekend and even the days we don’t see each other we’re on the phone or FaceTime. We go to all our events together. We hang out with each other’s friends. We hold hands and remain affectionate. Our circles think we’re a couple or that we should become official soon. We buy each other things, we talk about doing those embarrassing tasks together too like shaving each other’s body hair, we communicate using “we”, we switch up our dates and activities to keep it fresh etc. 

In terms of exclusivity - I’ve left it open for him to choose what he wants to do but he has never disrespected me and claims he will always be honest if he does get involved with another. And I trust that he’s not given he sees me most of his free time. He has close female friends but he makes an extra effort to prove to me that his interactions are platonic, something I’ve given the benefit of doubt. As for me I’m not interested in anyone else and when I have asked how comfortable he is with the thought of me having sex with another guy he has expressed he wouldn’t like it at all. 

He knows I like him, he’s too shy to verbalise but it can be concluded he kinda likes me too? We get along extremely well. We’ve accepted the “seeing each other” label for the time being.

We want to take it slow for various reasons But I don’t want this to become a situationship either or for him to think it’s okay to get girlfriend privelages without me being his girlfriend. So I want to put a loose personal timeline around when to have the talk by.

We are pretty fresh in our relationship but there is one thing to it. She’s an ex fiancé of my university classmate, they have been together for around 4 years. I know it’s stupid but sometimes I start getting insecurities and some jealousy about this whole situation. He’s a very handsome guy, and he still has pictures of her on Facebook about how they travelled the world or kissing each other and etc. I get self-conscious she’s been through such a love story with someone else, would she feel same in love for me?. However, with my logical mind I understand it doesn’t matter. She’s now with me, I’m happy and I know our feelings are being genuine.

Ok so I just got heart broken recently and downloaded a dating app for male validation. (I know it’s very unhealthy)

Matched with this guy who also got his heart broken and we vibed went on some FaceTime calls and established a really meaningful friendship that I hope will last. 

When we first met irl I established pretty clearly that this isn’t a date and i had my guard up pretty high especially since I knew his past of being a fuck boy and we both aren’t ready for a relationship. 

We were having so much fun just chilling and vibing and just appreciating one another’s company, BUT THENNNN when my shoe laces untied he bent down and tied them for me, we also shared an umbrella and you could visibly see he was getting wet cause he prioritized covering me, he also bought me flowers and lastly we plan on spending New Years together if he doesn’t have any plans. 

I’m just scared cause I feel like I can catch feelings for this guy but idk if I’m getting played especially since he knows how to treat girls and after his heartbreak and mine idk if I should catch feelings and idk if I can control them (whether I can stop myself from catching feelings) I just feel really comfortable with him and I don’t wanna loose a friend but I wouldn’t mind dating him.

I (30 M) recently broke up with someone after 3-4 months of extremely intense dating. The breakup was abrupt and unexpected for her but something I’ve been feeling the need to since a bit of time. 

While I completely expected anger, it was the choice of words that was surprising for me, I was told that in retrospect she was too good for me, that I don’t deserve someone like her, that I was a loser in life and that she absolutely does not wish any well for me.

While I completely get the first two being said, it was the latter part that caught me a bit off guard. I’m not looking for justification that I was right in breaking up, I know perfectly well that the abruptness may well title me as a dick, but the things that were said has got me thinking if I dodged a bullet.

We decided to spend night together, and i said to her that i will make breakfast for her in the morning(it takes some time to find good ingredients and cook it).    


Here comes the problem: i have this stupid habit where instead of answering question, if i find it extremely weird or dont understand where it comes from, i ask ""why?"" first instead of answering,and answer after, and i know its a bad habit . So after one of these answers (i answered same way before that morning) she gets angry and starts saying she wants to go home asap . I realise that i angered her and try to hug her and ask if she still wants breakfast. She says no , tells me to stop touching her, which i do, and starts preparing to leave. I get hurt a bit because of all preparations for breakfast wasted, give it a minute, and try to communicate again. This time , she says ""Fuck off"" , and basically doesnt speak to me until she leaves at all. She knows i am anxious person so i obviously start thinking about whats happened and whats going on while she keeps preparing . It lasts for roughly 5-10 mins, then she says she called a taxi, doesnt say good bye, says i cant accompany her, and leaves.   


Roughly after 5 mins after i get myself together i text her to tell me when she is home, and instead she says that i dont care aobut her, because i didnt prepare breakfast anyway, didnt call taxi for her ( i probably should have done it, but i was anxious and neverous and was thinking aobut what happened) , and all that because of excuses.   


How much did i fuck up? Was i overthinking and should have cooked breakfast anyway, even though it was very demoralising and hurt to hear no ? I also dont feel its fair that she texts me everything after, instead of talking to me irl, when i tried to start conversation. So i want to know if its fair for me to feel hurt after all that, or am i too egocentric, and should have thought more about her and called taxi for her(i know its important for her, but i just couldnt think straight).",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rovbfv/my_gf_got_upset_for_listening_to_her_and_then_not/
70,rovqmi,1640520473,I want to fight for him - should I leave it?,"This guy and I dated for two months. About 6 weeks in he told me his boss had mentioned a promotion they may offer him in a different city, but he said nothing was set in stone. I told him to let me know as soon as he knows whether he’ll go or not, but it’s a great opportunity and he should take it - even though I’d miss him. I should mention he is an extremely hard worker, frequently finishes work past midnight, and is probably moving into the height of his career. 

Fast forward two more weeks, I ask again about the job, and he says he thinks he’ll take it. I panic, and get pretty upset, and tell him I should leave - and also throw out the idea of moving to this city with him. He was pretty upset too, crying as well, and said he would love if I moved with him. But I think I freaked him out. 

Shortly after, things got weird. I could sense it. Text replies got longer and he was putting off hanging out. We finally chatted, he said that he can’t give me what I’m looking for at the moment + with the move to the new city it’s probably best we end things, but reiterated that our time together was amazing and it’s nothing to do with me, that I’m one of the most amazing people he’s ever met, blah blah blah. 

In a strange turn of fate I was offered an amazing job in the same city as him, and will likely be moving there months before him. 

Do I reach out before we both move just to try and fight for him? Or leave it to fate, and hope that he might message me when he eventually realises we’re living in the same new city?

This is one of the most disgustingly toxic ideas ever perpetuated in our culture. 

First of all, labelling half the human race as ""hos"" - seriously?

Plus, taking someone's side by default just because of their gender, without taking literally any other aspect of the situation into account?

Because men are always as honest as the sky is blue and never have ulterior motives for anything ever?...

It really is a shame. No matter how good I am to a guy, his guy friends will always be #1 to him and will always automatically come first.

I would never try to get between a guy and his friends for my own selfish reasons. I told a male friend once frankly that a certain friend of his was a poisonous piece of trash - his response was ""don't insult my friends"". What the hell? So what was I? Chopped liver? Yeah, I guess so.

Personally, if I dislike someone, there's always a reason for it. If I tell a guy that someone in his circle is a poisonous piece of trash, I'm not saying that as a ""ho"". I'm saying that as someone who genuinely cares about him and doesn't want him to end up being hurt by that person.

74,rowkkp,1640523901,Only insecure in relationships. Sabotaging relationships and my(18M) own happiness,"My first relationship which was pretty toxic. It was in high school where it was built around her making me feel like I wasn't good enough so I wouldn't get a say in anything, and then she would control and manipulate the relationship. I broke up with her and that was around 3 years ago now, and it is still the best decision I've ever made.

Since then, I feel like I've done a lot of the stuff people always say, working on myself, building my confidence etc etc as I've never really had great self-esteem.

And honestly for a good 2 years or so, I felt really good about myself and who I was. I didn't overanalyse the things I did anymore worrying about what other people thought of me, I just felt really confident in who I was as a person. I really improved my skills in my hobbies and passions and achieved things I am really really proud of. That's probably the happiest I've ever been.

But recently (for just over 7 months) I got into a relationship with a girl (20F) for the first time in a while and it seems my old habits have come back. I worry about how she sees me, I worry about how I compare with other people in her life, I worry about whether I'm making her happy or not etc etc. It really doesn't feel good. I don't want to ask for reassurance because that gets annoying really quick. And it's not like she imposes expectations on me or pressures me to be a certain way, it's just me and how I feel. I know I shouldn't feel like that and that it's a pretty unattractive way of thinking but for some reason I can't help it. It's as if, all of a sudden, once again, I actually really care about what someone else thinks of me and that I've given them that power over me or something. I don't want it to feel like this and I know it shouldn't. If it goes on like this I'm worried it could sabotage this relationship.

I don't want my girlfriend to think I'm a weak person. Because I'm not, I just seem to get like this when I get into intimate relationships because I care too much about what they think of me.
Can anyone give me some advice on how I can start to overcome this? It would be really really appreciated.

I honestly think he was just jealous cuz me and my friends were bad girls that smoked hookah and ate mexican food and went to poetry slams and such and all his friends did were drink in the house.) I find that men become immature and often times even cheat to get back at her for wanting space. ""You dont want to deal with me but my ex does."" Ugh i dont understand how men can be so ignorant but there is no argument for it. The only solution is ending the relationship. But men should really have a better concept of boundaries.

This guy completely love bombed me from the beginning to the point where I became obsessed with him and now that it’s over it’s like can’t stop thinking about him what feels like 24/7. Things ended a couple months ago when I brought up the “what are we” conversation and he said he wasn’t ready for a relationship (even though we were basically in one). 

How do I stop obsessing over this guy and hoping he comes back? It’s so fucking toxic the way I think about him all the time and imagine a future with the person I thought he was.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/royvx0/advice_on_how_to_get_over_a_situationship/
94,roywjm,1640532022,We broke up because I️ was hysterical,"First I’ll say that I don’t think I’m in the right for the way that I acted but sometimes I get so fed up with the same things happening over and over again.
For weeks I had been telling my long distance boyfriend that I was going to be lonely and sad during the holidays. I live with my aunt, far away from family and I had been expressing to him how upset I will be to not have the holidays with him, how badly I wanted it, etc. He reassured me multiple times, he’d make sure I had a good holiday. He often is very busy with family during this time, as he is in the military and they all want to see him. On Christmas he and I got on the phone early in the morning for 30 minutes. I was on my way to the movies and then to the pool and was keeping myself occupied but around 8 I found myself free. It was okay, at some point in the night I figured that we’d have a call. Around 10 he was hanging outside in a park with some long time friends in New York. It was cold and he stood out there with them for over two hours. Also, around that time I told him I’m getting ready for bed. As always though, I don’t go to bed without him, its rare that we go to sleep without our goodbyes and today was Christmas. At 12 I asked him if he would have time to call me and he said most likely not. I got very very upset. He was out in the cold for two hours with his friends and couldn’t reserve thirty minutes for me even after the multiple times we had talks about my feelings. He instantly got upset with me for my reaction because I was not holding back but as always after a certain point he ignores me, stonewalls me, and does not want todo anything or save the relationship. He tells me ignoring me for days because hes upset is normal, I’m acting hysterical, hes busy I should understand, its not a big deal, etc. At this point I make it clear I’m crying and he doesn’t care. He won’t step outside to talk to me. He ends up breaking up with me. He says Im hysterical and he is finally done. He cannot take my emotions and I had overblown the whole thing. 
Im left feeling empty, sad, and like he has no duty to me. He doesn’t ever take care of my emotions, he’s constantly leaving me lonely and only talks to me out of convenience, he never MAKES time for me the way he does for others. Im missing so many details and I was hysterical truly. I was really hurt and inconsolable. I begged for him to go outside and talk to me and he refused. He didn’t want to argue, he didn’t want to make things better. I’m extremely hurt and at a loss but maybe this was for the best. He’s very emotionally absent I’ve talked to him many times over it and no significant change has happened.
I was no saint I just want advice, comments, anything to kind of keep me occupied. He blocked me son all forms because I did not stop texting him when he told me to stop.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/roywjm/we_broke_up_because_i_was_hysterical/

96,roz3l5,1640532665,Fun Virtual First Date Idea,"Let me preface by saying that I already understand the inherent challenges of a long distance relationship especially with someone from another country. 
With that said, I meet this girl online and we have been talking pretty consistently for a few months now. While I haven't forwarded asked her about anything too forward I have gotten a the feeling she would very open to trying a long distance relationship if not a bit hesitantly (and I believe rightfully so). 

Of course I would love to go see her (or vise versa) but to me the entire idea of traveling to another country before even dating someone in any way seems absurd and a bit irresponsible.

Does anyone have any good ideas for a first date idea that could be done completely virtually? I'm looking for something that would give us time to just talk but maybe also ease some of the inherent tension/anxiety that comes with first dates.
Any and all advice is welcome! Thanks!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/roz3l5/fun_virtual_first_date_idea/

98,roz6px,1640532942,Met someone last night,"I was out and near blackout drunk, I met a couple of girls and a guy. They invited me to hangout and it seemed like the guy was with one of them, so I was mostly talking/dancing to/with the other one, but I was kind of in and out of it and every time I came to, I'd find the guy cutting me off from the group.

Or every time the girl with him left, he'd be dancing with the girl I was dancing with. We were just dancing, but they started *really* dancing.

Anyway the girl I was talking to gave me her number and an invite to hangout with them today.

Feeling awkward, I don't go out much and I can't tell what the dynamics are right now.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/roz6px/met_someone_last_night/
99,roz8ui,1640533145,Is she's just manipulating me? Because I feel like I'm getting played heavily.,"Me (20) M in a long distance relationship with a  (24) F.  For the past few months now,  she's been talking to less and less. It coming to point where I'm getting ignored  by her when I message her on snapchat but she still view everything I post while I'm being ignored for 10+ hours or sometimes  1 or 2 days. So I decided to go ghosts and not hit her up at all and see would she's take the time to message me first,  when it's usually me messaging her first all the time. Giving her validation.  It been exactly 6 days since I heard from her. Didn't even tell me merry Christmas and that's honestly hurts my feelings because I try to treat her the best as possible.  I noticed her snapscore constantly goes up at well by 15-10 points,  so im just getting a feeling she's sending  pics.  She's do claim she's interested/ she's loves me but it don't feel like it when I get ignored and don't hear from her.  NOTE ( I Tried talking with her about the issue but nothing changed. )",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/roz8ui/is_shes_just_manipulating_me_because_i_feel_like/
