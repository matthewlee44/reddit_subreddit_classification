have moved back to town? I've heard mixed ideas about this (my friend called a guy a creep, but he wouldn't stop trying to date her for like 2 months after she said no). I also don't want to come off as if I have been stalking them for 2+ years because I definitely have not been.

While we were together, her family would make rude/back handed comments to me, on more than on occasion comparing me to her sisters boyfriend, he was clearly their favorite.. these comments would hurt my feelings. When I would address it with my ex gf, she would somehow make it into my fault or tell me that I do not like her family. Her mom caused a lot of problems in our relationship. A few examples, when my ex gf moved in with me, her mom first tried getting me to take their family cat into my home, my mom is very allergic and told them this often (I want my mom to be comfortable visiting my home). After I said no, my girlfriend was very upset with me. A month later, her mom was requesting that we take in their family dog that is 14 years old. To this I said no, my girlfriend again was upset. I then told my girlfriend if she really wants to take in the dog that is her choice. She said no she does not want it, just wanted the option (so why get mad and cause a huge fight?). My grandmother, who was like a second mom to me past away, the weekend of her funeral her mom and boyfriend had a trip planned and requested we watch their two dogs (14 &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; 15) years old. I had three relatives staying with me, I declined to watch the dogs under these circumstances, again, I was the bad guy. 

What caused the breakup: her grandma out of state had her 80th bday party. For months my gf and I believed I was invited, finally able to meet her entire family and see where she spent summers growing up, we were both very excited. A month prior to the trip, her grandma says no boyfriends. This greatly hurt me, my grandma had just passed and again, I felt belittled by her family. I was upset and we argued a bit but I let it go. The weekend of the trip, I wanted distance from my ex. She did not allow this, texting/calling all the time. We ended up getting an argument one of the nights (about me not being allowed on the trip), I regrettably said hurtful things and hung up the phone. She did not speak to me for days. She came back home, read a pre typed breakup message on her phone (majority of which was around me not liking her family/getting along with her family), which was clearly written with her mom and sister. She would not allow me to say my peace. 10 minutes later her family showed up to my home with a uhaul and let themselves into my home. When leaving her mom would not let her say bye to me. We have not had communication since that day, mid June. I wish that my ex could have seen my side and have had my back, or Atleast supported me. However, her and her family are perfect and do no wrong, so when I would say anything I was terrible, I could not have feelings. After a while, I stopped addressing the rude comments that were made to me with my girlfriend because it would only cause a fight. I kept them to myself and tried spending little time with her family the last few months of our relationship. This also got me in trouble.. I could not win.. ever. I renovated my kitchen for her (and me, but mainly her, she loved to cook), she would often complain it was taking to long, house was construction zone, not able to go out and have fun because I was working on the kitchen, would not come with me to pick things out for the kitchen. I could not win. I am curious of others perspective of the situation… thank you for your time and support. 

TL;DR - 29m seeking advice on ex gf 24f behavior &amp;amp;amp; family behavior, was I the one in the wrong? Should I have been more easy going and let things go? If in a similar situation, what would you have done? Any advice or perspective is appreciated.

 Anyways, I think I'm moderately attractive. I'm thin but in decent shape and really tall. I'm at least smart enough to get through 100 credits of college and have a 3.5 gpa. I'm pretty introverted and kind of socially anxious so meeting people in group settings is difficult but if it means I don't have to be so lonely I'll do it 😅 

I've tried going to bars but I don't really see how you're supposed to start a conversation. Everyone there seems to be there with family or friends already. 

I've tried going to events I really enjoy but they tend to not have many females, and the ones that are there don't look like they want to be bothered by some random guy who's by himself.

I really enjoy a lot of The Roommates and Todd Valentine. 

Why is there no tangible advice like this for women? The only advice always seems to be 

* ""don't be fat"" 
* ""be kind"" 
* ""stop going for men with options"" 

where as a lot of men's self-improvement advice actually talks about places to high to meet quality women, how to attract the women you want, how to convey your value, how to ""keep her hooked"" etc. 

Why isn't there any tangible advice like this for women? 

I'm tired of reading that the only things that matter for men is looks and kindness when that's obviously not true. Even taking myself out of the equation, I know tons of beautiful, kind women who struggle with dating or attracting anything more than casual flings.

I feel some of the men's advice could apply to women, but most of it doesn't because of the differences between men and women's socialization. The cozmo articles about ""how to keep a man!"" are generally full of empty platitudes.

So my girlfriend and I broke up about 8 months ago and were apart for 4 months before we got back together. COVID, winter, and depression were the main causes of our breakup. During this breakup, she ran into an old high school friend and pursued him because she finds him very attractive. She said nothing became of it because after getting to know him, he's not her type. They recently became SnapChat friends now and they talk daily. He's in a relationship as of recently, but I still have expressed that this makes me uncomfortable. He reacts to her photos with starstruck emojis and shit indicating that he likes the photos. She told me that she would hang out with him 1 on 1 if he asked to do something.

So  comparing myself to these people suck. Like how many continents have  you been too?! I've flown maybe twice to see family haha. You own a  home??? My apartment is nice haha, Im far from having the kind of money  for a down payment...

Then maybe I should date younger like 24 then? Well as soon as I start talking to them I often immediately feel a disconnect.

I've just started going to college and I met this 19yo girl, wich seems pretty interested in me. 
But I don't know if she's really into me... She's already in a relationship but idk anything bout it.

Maybe I'm running my fantasy too much, but I think she is sending me lot of ""subliminal message"".

1. First time we met she immediately took me in sympathy, and seemed interested in me, asking me some questions

2. Second time she seemed even more interested, she kept touching me, and *𝘦𝘩𝘮 𝘦𝘩𝘮* she also came really close to me and she touched me with her breast in a way too comfortable way. But overall she still seemed like a friend. This happened in the afternoon and at the end of this she asked me if I wanted to go out with her in the evening. 

3. So later that evening I went out with her and some of her friends, nothing special happened. A typical Friday night in company of some friends.

4. This time I've met her in the underground while we was directed to college. She was with one of her female close friend, she greeted me with a ""warm hug"" (idk if it's the correct way of saying it) and then we talked a bit. 
She asked me if I had a cigarette, and I told her I didn't bring them with me, still, she touched me trying to find them in my pocket. Then she and her friend talked about her relationship, i didn't really understand what she said at the beginning of the phrase, but it ended with: -I see him (her boyfriend) as much as him! (me). 
And her friend replied with : -When will you break up with him? (In a jokingly way I think, not really sure).

5. Ok so later that day we're doing the same lesson, and she sent me a photo of her and later tagged me in an Instagram story, still it seemed to me as a jokingly way.

I have to admit she seemed a really outgoing person and I've seen it pretty well that Friday evening. Btw I'm more of an introvert myself, maybe even a bit socially awkward, but I always try my best.

6. Now today she met me again at college, I was with other girls and we was in a study hall. She greeted me came really close to me and again she touched me (even with her breast again) we talked a little, she asked me if I wanted to go to lesson with her even if I don't follow that same course. 

Then she asked me to go with her at one of the lesson we attend together tomorrow, sadly I couldn't book the lesson (For anti COVID regulations) and I'll have to follow it online.
She encouraged me to go anyway with her in presence and now I'm really thinking about it.

At the end when she had to left us she surprised me with a kiss on my cheek, that seemed (at least to me) something more than a friendly greeting. Maybe I'm wrong? 


In the end i don't really know what to think, I'm almost certain that she likes me, but I may be wrong I'm not really good at understand woman and their signal. 
Maybe she's interested I mean her body language seems pretty clear, but she's in a relationship and I don't really know what to do. Should I say that I like her and risk to ruin a friendship?

Read whole thing to understand:

So I met this girl who is very kind and loving in person. We met on Bumble and it said on her profile that she was looking for a long term relationship like me. We matched and talked over face time. On my profile I said I was a christian and I’m looking for a Christian woman or someone who is open minded. So when we started talking on FaceTime, she was telling me that she wasn’t a slut or a hoe and doesn’t want me to think that way about her. We talked on FaceTime Friday by the way. Anyways, she was telling me she wasn’t a Christian and she hopes I’m not going to turn her down because of that. At this point she sounds legit and sounded like she really cared. It was almost like an interview for her or something and I could tell she really liked me. And she kept apologizing for her behavior to me. 

So we went out for coffee on Sunday and she was very beautiful in person. She’s a freshman in college and she’s 18 and I’m a sophomore in college and I’m 20. We had a lot in common and we had a lot of fun and there was no funny business or things we shouldn’t be getting into. After having coffee she asked for my instagram and she gave me her phone so I could add myself. I didn’t follow her back until I got home after the date. She was very touchy, but also super shy around me at the same time. Usually I like to make the first move of grabbing the girls hand when walking, but she actually made the first move, which I didn’t mind. 

Through out the day we laughed and had a great time together and after the date I asked if she was free Wednesday to go on a date with me to the movies. She said yes and she was very down. She answers texts right away and shes acting like she knows what she wants. She told me that if it was okay if she told her mom and her family about me, which I didn’t mind of course. 

Anyways when I got home, I texted her letting her know I had a great time and told her that I look forward to Wednesday and she told me that she can’t wait either. So I went to my instagram and went to follow her back. And when I saw her profile, I was stunned. There were all these pictures of her in her bra and underwear looking scandalous. She is very attractive, but some of her stuff on instagram made no sense, she was telling me to not think of her that way, but then I go to her profile and see all these sexy photos and guys commenting saying these dirty slangs. Even her highlights were her in the same outfits and she had these songs saying very and I mean very inappropriate words. Saying things like eat me. 

&amp;#x200B;

My question is - What the heck is going on!? She was telling me she was a virgin girl and I was her official date that she ever had. I won’t hold it against her if she had sex before and if she’s trying to do better and not be a hoe. But why the heck would she share her instagram with me after telling me these things about her? What is going on? I’m supposed to be going on date with this person Wednesday and I don’t know what her true intentions are. She was telling me she wants to become a Christian and that her mom and her family want to meet me and she’s already acting like were dating and she‘s arranging future dates. But what do I do? I believe in second chances, but I don’t know what’s happening. Ideas?

I didn’t/don’t think of myself as particularly attractive, average maybe. Some good qualities some bad ones. But a recent experience made me consider what makes you attractive.

I live in a middle European country and look let’s say genetically ambiguous, if you see me, you could think I am a Turk, maybe an Italian, maybe a Spaniard or even a Brazilian. 
So I went to a self-described Latino Bar/Club with a few of my friends. This was my first time since about 3 years and I assumed only really hot guys get approached for talking and dancing but what I saw confused me. 

Firstly, I was the first of my group to arrive, I am not a hugely extroverted guy, I can bullshit and use some charisma for social interactions but I won’t just approach a different group and start talking and dancing. So I sat down on a couch doing my best fake confidence act, taking up space, sitting straight, wearing my black leather jacket and half-turtleneck drinking my beer. Then out of the blue, a small Mexican girl walks across the room, I haven’t noticed her thus far, I assume she walks past me and I give her a big smile as I was told to do. I am then baffled at her actually sitting down and talking to me in english. We talk for a moment, she excuses herself to the bathroom and leaves. (I dont see her again) 

My friends arrive, we drink, we dance and I see everywhere (imo) average looking guys dancing and then making out with attractive girls to my confusion. Me being the loser guy or just bad club dancer that I am can’t get any girls to dance with me and none come to me. Then later I sit down where I sat before and again to my surprise, this time an older (than me) italian girl/woman smiles at me, lifts her glass, I do the same thinking nothing of it until my friends nudge me to go talk to her. I do and immediately remember why I don’t do that, it’s loud and I can’t hear a thing. We drink our glasses and she leaves. 

Later (around 3 am) we are in line to get our jackets and leave but because the line takes forever I start to dance again and a brasilian girl gets away from from what drunk me assumed was her boyfriend (probably wasnt) and comes very close to me and dances with, me again completely confused just do small talk with her while she has her face as close to mine as her size allows until we get our jackets. 

None of my pals, even the girl was approached. I have to figure out if that was a lucky streak, normal, I am secretly hot or latinas are into me. 


I have no experience from clubbing so someone wiser please tell me what to take away from this?

While we were together, her family would make rude/back handed comments to me, on more than on occasion comparing me to her sisters boyfriend, he was clearly their favorite.. these comments would hurt my feelings. When I would address it with my ex gf, she would somehow make it into my fault or tell me that I do not like her family. Her mom caused a lot of problems in our relationship. A few examples, when my ex gf moved in with me, her mom first tried getting me to take their family cat into my home, my mom is very allergic and told them this often (I want my mom to be comfortable visiting my home). After I said no, my girlfriend was very upset with me. A month later, her mom was requesting that we take in their family dog that is 14 years old. To this I said no, my girlfriend again was upset. I then told my girlfriend if she really wants to take in the dog that is her choice. She said no she does not want it, just wanted the option (so why get mad and cause a huge fight?). My grandmother, who was like a second mom to me past away, the weekend of her funeral her mom and boyfriend had a trip planned and requested we watch their two dogs (14 &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; 15) years old. I had three relatives staying with me, I declined to watch the dogs under these circumstances, again, I was the bad guy. 

What caused the breakup: her grandma out of state had her 80th bday party. For months my gf and I believed I was invited, finally able to meet her entire family and see where she spent summers growing up, we were both very excited. A month prior to the trip, her grandma says no boyfriends. This greatly hurt me, my grandma had just passed and again, I felt belittled by her family. I was upset and we argued a bit but I let it go. The weekend of the trip, I wanted distance from my ex. She did not allow this, texting/calling all the time. We ended up getting an argument one of the nights (about me not being allowed on the trip), I regrettably said hurtful things and hung up the phone. She did not speak to me for days. She came back home, read a pre typed breakup message on her phone (majority of which was around me not liking her family/getting along with her family), which was clearly written with her mom and sister. She would not allow me to say my peace. 10 minutes later her family showed up to my home with a uhaul and let themselves into my home. When leaving her mom would not let her say bye to me. We have not had communication since that day, mid June. I wish that my ex could have seen my side and have had my back, or Atleast supported me. However, her and her family are perfect and do no wrong, so when I would say anything I was terrible, I could not have feelings. After a while, I stopped addressing the rude comments that were made to me with my girlfriend because it would only cause a fight. I kept them to myself and tried spending little time with her family the last few months of our relationship. This also got me in trouble.. I could not win.. ever. I renovated my kitchen for her (and me, but mainly her, she loved to cook), she would often complain it was taking to long, house was construction zone, not able to go out and have fun because I was working on the kitchen, would not come with me to pick things out for the kitchen. I could not win. I am curious of others perspective of the situation… thank you for your time and support.

I rearranged my entire evening to make the date, but when I got out of the gym, there it was: a text saying they had booked another client for an appointment on their side hustle job as a barber, and because they couldn't pass up getting a new client/the money, he cancelled. I was very understanding, but disappointed since I planned my evening around the plans.

If you get the ""I had a good time, but I didn't feel a spark / romantic chemistry"" it just means they don't want to have sex with you.

2) Don't lie about anything with dating.  It'll crash it.  Even small lies can ruin trust quickly.  She/he can't have a relationship with someone they don't trust.

3) Just because the date went awesome doesn't mean there will be a second one.  I recently went out with this woman and our conversation was smooth as silk.  Authentic snorting laughs were had, and we made out at the end.  She talked about how much she wants to go out again, and then boom ghosted when I texted the next day.  That one still messes with my head.

4) Most first dates, almost all, don't turn into a second dates.  I get the impression people get excited going on a first date, but when they realize it's just another human sitting across from them, they go back to swiping looking for their instagram dream match that doesn't exist in real life.

5) Men crave youth and beauty and women crave social status.  There I said it.

6) Dating a doctor / lawyer / high end professional kind of sucks.  You just never see them since they're married to their job usually.  Sure they have a swanky apartment and nice car, but who cares when you guys only hang out once a week while they're doing laundry.  I have a few friends in those fields, and they all agree that their job usually killed at least one of their prior relationships.

7) Coffee dates don't work well.  There's nothing romantic, sexual, sensual about sitting outside a Starbucks knock off 1 pm on a Wednesday.  I have never had coffee dates turn into anything ever.  It's just dry chit chat with caffeine making people even more nervous.

8) No one is more busy than someone not interested.

9) Honest closure hardly ever happens with dating.  Either it's a ghost, or a cliche break up message.  No one wants to hurt another persons feelings, so they usually say some generic ""Our personalities just don't click well"" type of thing.  One woman told me I wasn't catholic enough since she was so used to using religion as a way to reject guys.  I'm very catholic lol.

10) If you just want to get laid, have your first date at a bar well into the evening.  A few drinks in may be enough to get it flowing.

Are there people who actually like to work full time and provide for others?  Maybe this is more common for wealthy people?

1. Plus a child that comes with a babybdaddy.

Meanwhile the other parent  works full time, and pays child support. (In this case, baby daddy has another baby mama he deals with). 

They live off of the government and their parents and expect to be a stay at home mother because humans weren't meant to work so much.  


2. The partner can't hold a job so you just tell them to quit working since to can't rely on their income.

Frankly, I don’t have any desire to seek out a serious relationship right now. I’m young and quite inexperienced both romantically and sexually, so I wanted to explore casual dating a bit. I once matched with an older guy who explicitly stated that he wanted to find a FWB, which I didn’t see as a big issue. In fact, it could’ve been a perfect arrangement for both of us because I wasn’t looking for the love of my life either.  We met several times for coffee/dinner and then ended up having sex at his place. To be honest, I wasn’t fully ready for it, but he kept insisting, and in the end I just decided to go with the flow. Sex itself was kind of awkward and underwhelming, but being so close to him physically made my attraction a lot stronger, and I started to fantasize about how much better it will get after we become more comfortable with each other. The kicker is, he texted me the same evening saying that he suddenly realized that sex outside of relationships isn’t truly satisfying for him and that we should break things off. I was so taken aback that I didn’t question his reasoning at all and just accepted that that was the end of it. On a second thought, I found him doing a 180 really weird, considering how eager he seemed prior to getting intimate. Now I’m left wondering what forced him to change his mind so abruptly, whether I wasn’t attractive enough for him to stick around, if my shyness caused him too much headache, what I could have done or say differently, etc. Besides, I constantly catch myself wishing he gave me a second chance and ‘saw the light’ so to speak... I even stalked his social media and now have a strong reoccurring urge to reach out and suggest that we have some fun one more time. However, I understand that it will most certainly lead nowhere and only make my humiliation worse. 

Basically, this experience left me mentally unwell and highly insecure about my behavior and appearance. It’s been one week since we parted our ways and I’m still not over it😔

A month goes by and I bring my first date home, where I've been living with my mom during the pandemic. We had fun, got drunk, made out, she asks me to put on some pink floyd and we start having sex. But then I fail 3 attempts, even tho she was really nice about it, we laughed, talked, made out and tried again for a while until it goes bad.

The next few dates with different girls were awesome, it never happened again, even when having sex in my car out there.

But then, last saturday I finally brought someone home. It was a second date with a very nice and hot girl that I'm kinda falling for. We had some drinks, mushrooms, got a little stonned, made out, and guess what, she asks me to put on pink floyd. We start having sex and BANG, failed again.

Now I don't know if beeing in my place triggered me, or listening to the same songs, creating the same environment, or because it's the first girl I kinda got attached to emotionally since my breakup. 

I don't know what to do, how to stop thinking about it while trying, you know? After the first time I was like ""dont fail, dont fail"" the whole time.

I(M23) have been talking with this girl (F22) for about 2 months now and we have met once irl. We basically like each other and have gone through the whole why we like each other and if we are good for each other and have started seeing if we can be good partners in long run.

The issue I'm facing is that I feel I'm being too friendly towards her and at times it feels dry and I find it hard to navigate the conversations. I guess I'm afraid of me getting boring and uninteresting in the conversations.

I'm not sure if there's any way or not but I really want to be more romantic or flirtatious towards her so that we have that attraction between us.

Almost trying to dodge the ""you're great guy but I'm not attracted to you"" bullet.

And it's not just about her, I'm seeing this as a general skill that I think I lack so I really want to work on this aspect of my personality.

I (29F) have been dating a guy (31M) for about 4 months. We are dating exclusively and have been since we essentially met but have yet to put a title on it. We’ve met each other’s best friends, we’ve gone on a decently long vacation together, and we see each other on a regular basis. 

I’ve recently restarted therapy to address some things I’ve noticed about myself while being with him that I’d like to improve on (communication, responses, reactions, etc). 

My guy also has some dating trauma. Really only 1 major relationship (7-8yrs) and it ended 2yrs ago and fairly poorly (she, in so many words, essentially ghosted him). Based on what I know of him as a person, he moves very slowly - not just in dating but in all aspects of life lol. 

Vulnerability for him is difficult but he says the more I share the more it actually helps him in sharing and processing his own stuff. And seeing me go to therapy and actively working on myself is getting him thinking maybe he should do therapy too. All of this I think is amazing. 

While we have been exclusively dating for 4 months, just without a title, and I’m ok with this for the immediate foreseeable future, it feels like everyone around me is almost boxing me into a timeline. Say things such as, ‘oh you should be in a labeled relationship after 3 months.’

Given our individual relationship trauma, I’m much more sympathetic to his willingness to take it slow. 

I wanted to see who else has dated someone with relationship trauma and dating slowly. How’d it turn out? How’d it go in general? Any advice? :)

I(25) met my boyfriend (25) abit more than a month ago. It's my first relationship and I fell for him hard, because we had really great conversations, and we're getting along perfectly.   
He's an absolute sweetheart, treats me very well, is very honest when I ask him something, but he is extremely quiet. I feel like I'm doing alot of the talking, bringing up topics, asking him questions. I just don't really know how to place this. I know he mentioned he can be socially awkward, but he doesn't make an effort to ask me any questions. At the same time he's not uninterested. He's a very attentive listener, but if I don't initiate the conversation, there's none. We still do have great vibes, when we talk and we share the same humour.

A few days ago I've seen him expressing himself in a very vulgar language online, one that I don't like. My family has seen some of it and it led to a fight (... I might've tried to defend him) and led to them not wanting to meet him. I know I defended him, but it doesn't mean that it didn't irritate me.  
I've talked to him about my concerns. He explained some of his behaviour with his friends groups and upbringing. He told me he doesn't talk to me this way, because he already guessed I wouldn't like it. He's changing his language according to the people he's talking to and he didn't see an issue, although he said he can see my point of view. All of this really didn't help me to feel better.  
I'm just deeply confused and I'm trying to understand. Does it mean he's not his natural self around me? My family isn't helpful, they just want me to break up with him.

Has anyone ever been in a similar situation?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1044530,public,self,I don't know how to feel about this,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q1bjzs/i_dont_know_how_to_feel_about_this/,all_ads,6,,,

(I am in my mid 30s, this guy is in his early 40s.) He is the first guy in a long time that I saw as having really promising potential. 

He made verbalized before we met the first night that he is a gentleman and not in this simply for sex. I stated I understand that men and women have needs but that I don’t want to rush into anything. He seemed respectful of this. At the beginning of the date he said he never has women over to his place, the last time was 3 months ago. 

He initiated a second date, there was a mutual attraction. We were both more handsy this time, we did end up having sex. I never have sex on the second date, but this seemed to just naturally happen this time. At one point he made a comment “we’re just having fun right now. No pressure.” I asked him when he last had sex, he said 2 months ago. 

After the first meet I gave him my number to use instead of the dating app. He hadn’t put it in his phone yet. So we were laying there and I said “you know what you should do?” He asked what? I said “put my number in your phone.” Then moments later he said “I plan to delete my profile soon.” So I said “oh really?” And his response was “that site is gross.” To which I agreed, and said I can’t be bothered with it anymore either. 

He told me we should set something up for this week (he wants to watch a specific movie with me.) He said it would have to be after the weekend (the one that just passed) because he has his kids. I didn’t text him all weekend because i was working but also because I really wanted to be respectful of their time together. 

He only seems to message me every two days, except last weekend we messaged for the whole weekend regularly, he didn’t have his kids then. I know he owns a business and has his two kids, who will obviously be a priority to him. They sound like really good kids.

I know on some level my anxiety over this is irrational.. but he hasn’t messaged me yet today. And I just logged in to the app and his profile has been deleted.

About 2½ months ago I started talking with a girl and early i noticed that we were similar in a lot of things. Me (22M) she (20F)
I never had a gf before so I was really shy and similar things, once we were talking about our relationships and she cut it early simply saying to me that she ended a 3 years relationship beacause her bf became toxic, but she decided to stay in contact with him because they had a really similar difficult past and after all they stayed together for 3 years.
After that speech she told me that she wasnt looking for a bf so i decided to respect this fact and keep knowing her in the while
After some weeks she gave me her number and we started talking more seriously, day after day i noticed some interest in me but I couldnt get out of my mind the fact that she wasnt looking for a bf.
We met and at the second time she hugged me, and I started to catch some feelings for her.
A week after that she and her ex got a discussion and after that discussion we never talked like before again, she started to reply to my messages like hours after, that thing lasted for about 2 weeks and at some point i asked her why all that happened, she told me that she had to think about what happened and what to do with this situation and she told me that her ex started to be part of her life again and they are trying one more time beacause ""he is proving myself that he is changed""
I wrote to her bestfriend to try to understand the situation and she told me that the girl i was catching feelings for, was interested in me, but cause of my lack of signals she never understand what my thoughts were.

Hey everyone,

I've been dating my current girlfriend for about a year. I don't think the specifics matter too much, but she was previously out of another long-term relationship before we started dating. She has a pretty big past of sexual history in college but she is completely loyal and I have no reason to believe she'd ever cheat on me or anything like that.

Anyway, I've started to get insecure about everything. And I know, 100 million times over, that none of this is her fault, and that is it my OWN problem, and I am looking for ways to overcome it or reframe my mind. When she's out at the bar with her friends, I instantly get worried about what's happening. I often worry about the sex not being good enough for her, my dick not being big enough, etc. Again, she gives no indication that these things are falling short, it's just me. Sometimes I get insecure when I think about her sexual history, and think about how she's probably been with much more attractive men. Sometimes I think about how she's done things that she tried with other guys that she doesn't want to do anymore (anal, etc).

The other day we were out shopping and she was telling me about her best friend can be really mean to her, and said a few years ago they didn't speak for months. I asked what the fight was about, and she told me that she was seeing a guy in college and that her best friend tried stealing him from her. and that made me depressed, even though it was before I even fucking knew her! Like my brain is seriously so fucked up, this really shoudn't make me feel any type of way, should it?

Basically, I'm really fucked up in the head and it's all my own doing. Is it a confidence issue? Why am I so insecure about literally everything? I love her a lot and want to be with her but I can never get out of my own head, I'm always caught up on stupid bullshit like this. I think it's most definitely a problem within myself.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1044666,public,self,How to get over jealousy/insecurity in a relationship,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q1cfk2/how_to_get_over_jealousyinsecurity_in_a/,all_ads,6,,,

That’s why I’m here.

It usually takes a lot for me to work up the courage to open up about any issue with my boyfriend because there’s always the good chance he’ll immediately jump to breaking up. I’m growing tired of it, especially since the majority of these are not, in my opinion,  dealbreakers or breakup-worthy offenses. 

For instance, one time he tried to surprise hug me while I was under the covers; he didn’t know where my face was or the fact I was wearing glasses, so he ended up smashing into my face and breaking a part of the glasses. I was pissed, but the next day, I just asked if he could take me to get them fixed so all was good, or so I thought. My boyfriend later revealed he thought I was going to break up with him for that. It didn’t even cross my mind; all I wanted from him was an apology (which I did get) and to just make sure to not jump on me while I was under the covers next from then on.

Something less severe, but one he also suggested breaking up over, was the time I expressed that I was frustrated that he wasn’t ready to leave to the zoo when I arrived at his house. We made plans that I would drive to his house and he would drive us to the zoo. After my hour-long drive, I was surprised that I had to wait for him to shower and get ready; what was he even doing in that hour? And he woke up earlier than me as well. He wanted to break up for this because I told him I was annoyed.

I have asked him why he frequently suggests breaking up over anything I express displeasure at. He said he can’t stand to see me hurt from his actions and doesn’t want to hurt me anymore. He also feels like I deserve better/ a better person, and thinks he’s not good enough for me.

I feel like he’s just constantly giving up on the relationship and throwing in the towel before even trying to do better or differently. There are also bad, creeping thoughts that I have, like wondering if he’s so quick to suggest breaking up because he wants me gone, if there’s “someone else,” and wondering if I’ll be blindsided one day with an actual breakup.

We haven’t broken up yet because I’ve always managed to reason with him or calm him down. But like I said, I’m growing tired of it, and have pretty much grown to expect “we should break up” from his lips. I just want him to understand that I start conversations about problems in the relationship because I believe in trying to be a better person.

I own up to my mistakes and try to change so I don’t repeat those mistakes, but I guess doing this is hard for him? Or he just doesn’t want to do it? I feel like I need to have a conversation with him about this, but I don’t know what else I can say.

I think we well and had a great time with each other. But I haven’t heard from him since I went home yesterday afternoon and when I was leaving, he didn’t kiss me goodbye. 

I didn’t go for it either, I was sorta nervous to be honest so we ended up giving each other a quick hug as our goodbye and then I said “it was a pleasure meeting him” and left. We didn’t discuss hanging out again and I feel the goodbye we had wasn’t really like a “I want to see you again” type of goodbye 👋from him since he wasn’t nervous or shy to hit on me or kiss me the first time…

But I could  just be overthinking bc maybe he was nervous too after spending some time with me and being sober, he wasn’t when we initially met so maybe he just had some liquid courage the night before when coming up to me.

So, I'm 23 F, and the first time I've seen this guy was back on college, on 2019 perhaps. But he never caught my attention, as I thought he was gay, cuz there were some rumors that he was, and I believed them. We never even talked back then, as we weren't even from the same classroom, we only studied the same subject, architecture. But some days ago, I found out that he dated a girl some months ago, so I think he might be bi, or even straight, I dunno, but suddenly I feel so interested on him now. Some of my friends know him better, so I asked them about this guy, what did they know about him and so, one of my friends said that my crush told him he wanted to try dating boys, cuz he was curious, and that he dated a girl some months ago, but the relationship was kinda... boring. Meaning, he is indeed gay or bi, but I'm not sure if he even likes girls anymore. He might be just curious about boys, or maybe he don't even like girls at all, maybe he had that compulsory heterosexuality thing, I dunno, it's possible. But then, here comes my dilemma: 

I felt interested on him, but I am so effin shy, and I have moderate social anxiety. Meaning, I got anxious, and couldn't sleep or eat well for like 3 days before I acted up and did something to call his attention for the first time. I did something a little stupid tho, I admit. I went to his instagram and liked one of his old pictures (we already followed each other ever since college, can't even remember when did I start to follow him), and so I sat back and waited for him to like back one of my pictures, or DM me, or... anything, whatever, I just wanted a signal back, and it never happened. He never answered anything back to me. I know, this was a kinda stupid action coming from me, but it was the less destructive way I found to call his attention, cuz if he didn't like me, he would just ignore me, and life goes on. It would hurt way more for me if I started a conversation and he ignored me, or if we just made small talk and never went forward, I would feel ashamed for the rest of my life about it. 

But the thing is, I've been running from hurting myself for way too much time. My entire life. And I wanted to try a little harder on this one, cuz it's so hard for me to feel attracted to anyone... It happens like, 2 times a year, if I'm lucky. When I do, I tend to think about the person all the time, cuz I never know when it will be the last time I'll feel attraction, heck, this might be the last one and I may never know. I graduated from college already, which means I'm not gonna see him face to face again so soon. But I wanted to talk to him online, like on instagram, I wanted to try something with him, but I'm SO bad at conversations. My convos usually last until the ""how are you? good, u? yeah, me too."", I'm terrible at this. I'm an introvert, which might add to that. And plus, I'm so afraid of be thinking a little too high. He is an extrovert, and he is handsome, strong, intelligent, while I'm below average, I'm thin, a little intelligent but not nearly as he is, and he has a lot of friends, while I'm a little bit of a loner. I keep thinking, even if he does like girls, why would he even like me? That keeps bothering me a lot. Plus, there is a chance he kinda knows how much of a quiet girl/loner/weirdo I am, cuz we went to a college trip together once, and spent a few days on the same city, maybe he doesn't even remember me there, but maybe he does. Maybe he remembers me as ""that weird girl from that college trip"". I dunno, I'm so confused. 

Oh, also, one other thing, the first thing I actually said directly to him, was like, last week (this was AFTER I liked his old photo and he ignored it), he posted something funny on his instagram, and I replied with a similar pic from the same artist, and he laughed and said ""I liked that"" or something like this. Then I said one more thing, hoping he would keep talking to me, but he just sent some laughing emojis and it all ended there. I don't know what to do, or if I even should keep trying. I feel like a teenager. Plus, there is no way I can get to him and ask ""are you gay? do I even have a chance?"" lol even his friends don't know if he is or he isn't for real, so I'm kinda troubled at this too. My friends who know him says he is very kind, that he is funny, that he is a good guy. I wanted to approach him so much.

I (27M) had a first date scheduled for Friday night with someone I met online. Then Friday rolled around and I was not feeling great mentally for a bunch of reasons completely unrelated to her (bad week at work, personal life stress, etc.) I thought about cancelling  but I hate living with regrets so I just rolled with it. We were meeting for drinks and I figured I could be home and in bed in an hour. 

Of course, just my luck, it ended up being the best first date I've ever had. We talked for hours, we were constantly laughing and touching each other, we kept seamlessly going into topics that are way too deep for a first date then back into light banter. We both, unprompted, couldn't stop mentioning how great it was going. While I have no idea how things are gonna turn out, I really can't imagine how a first date could go better. 

There was a lot of touching and sexual innuendo, and while it's not like she was throwing herself at me, I definitely think we could have had sex if I had been committed to escalating. But to be honest, I still didn't want to have sex that night (with anyone!) If I had to, she certainly would have been my first choice, but I still was just not in a good headspace for that. I had been feeling depressed and unsexy all week, and  I told my roommates that I definitely wouldn't be bringing anyone home, and a million other reasons made me feel like I just wasn't in ""the zone."" I knew I wouldn't be able to give it my all, and I didn't want our first sexual experience together to be unpleasant. Obviously I didn't say any of that, but we ended up just kissing goodnight and agreeing we'd see each other as we left the bar. 

Now I'm just wondering if I really blew something. Women, would you feel rejected/lose attraction if you had a great first date and the guy didn't even try for sex at the end (despite there being a clearly sexual vibe)?

Since I turned 18 years old I have dated close to 40 women. None of them felt mutually afterwards and promptly went back to their ex or put me in the Friendzone.

It seems I also attract the more ""damaged"" type of women. Nothing wrong with that, but I myself don't always know how to handle baggage. Even though I have gone through some serious stuff in my lifetime already.

About a year ago I followed advice from my friends and went to dates with the mindset ""I want the date to be fun and have no expectations"". My dates started to get better and better, but it almost seems like the rejection I get afterwards keeps getting more painful.

I just can't seem to have that romantic click with a woman and it breaks me apart at times, because I have felt empty and lonely for years on this aspect.

Right now I don't know what to do. My Best friend (woman) says it is better for me to focus on my career and school. She also stated I should stop using dating apps like tinder and such because online dating doesn't work for me in her opinion.
