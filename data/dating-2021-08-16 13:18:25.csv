10,p5nv6a,1629144116,It's pretty messed up to justify traumatizing people under the guise of sexual liberation,"There was a rather sad post on /r/dating_advice today. The gist as I remember it was this guy had a date with a girl from tinder, they vibe, they have their second date at some sort of house party with tinder date's roommates and some of OP's mates, OP apparently bought the drinks, not sure if for everyone or just for tinder girl. They vibe again but halfway through one of OP's friends starts dancing with her. His other friends tell him that wasn't okay and so he doesn't initiate anything anymore and decides to leave early. Tinder date swoops in and tells everyone she will accompany him to his car, later they all hear them having sex in the next room. OP has been humiliated in front of everyone and understandably breaks down crying in his car, end of story.

Now the issue I want to raise is not about the post but the comments, where there's a lot of arguing about who the asshole is. The notion of ""both suck"" gets met with ""just because he brought her drinks, doesn't mean he is entitled to having sex with her"". Most only fault OP's friend. That is a very messed up take.

Since when is female sexual liberation (which I'm a fan of) a wild card to being a giant narcissist that knowingly traumatizes other people?

First of all, if both knew they were hurting OP's feelings yet decided to still go forth and engage in this then they are both equally assholes.

Second, the girl is actually the much bigger asshole here, since she was the one who initiated the way it played out and could have pursued that friend in any number of other ways that didn't include humiliating OP like that. For instance she could have just given him her number and tell him to call her tomorrow. But no, her immediate sexual gratification was more important to her than OP's mental health. Incredible.

Yes, you don't owe anyone sex just because they brought you drinks. But since when are men so worthless that a woman's immediate sexual desire is more important than not potentially permanently traumatizing a man?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p5nv6a/its_pretty_messed_up_to_justify_traumatizing/

We are both 25 now, he plays football professionally and has never had any social media channels, never been to school parties, etc. so I was happy to have the opportunity to contact him there. It took one day for him to accept my request, after that I sent him a message a few hours later saying ""Hey old seatmate üòã How‚Äòs it going?"", because we sat next to each other in class for two years. He was not online for a WEEK, then he replied very nicely ""Hey Lara! Everything is fine with me thank you üëç I hope with you too? Oh yes the good old school days üòÖüòÇ"".
Two hours later he was online again, which seemed unusual to me considering he wasn‚Äôt online the whole week before. Maybe this was just a coincidence, but it already made me wonder if he was avoiding my message before, or he was thinking about what to reply the whole time.
I hadn‚Äôt replied at this point yet, but while he was still online I did and asked him if he sometimes missed school. He didn‚Äôt answer and has not been online since then, it has been four days again already.

22,p5os0p,1629146862,he called me an asshole for wanting to spend time with him. am i?,"so a little backstory. sorry for any typos. my bf and i have been dating for almost 3 months now. i know not a long time. the relationship started when we met on tinder and planned to just hook up at a hotel and then we ended up spending the next day together and just clicked really well. i ended up getting kicked out of my house with my parents and moved in with him and his family about 2 weeks later (i know it was a risky choice but i didn‚Äôt have anywhere to go) he‚Äôs in a band and i take him to practice at least twice a week. he doesn‚Äôt have a car. up until recently we‚Äôve been on the job hunt and i‚Äôll get more into what happened bc it relates to work. 

so last week his band mate/best friend got him a job at his work. it‚Äôs awesome for him. i‚Äôve been working at a chain restaurant for about 3 weeks now. i really enjoy. it‚Äôs probably the first job of my life i‚Äôve actually enjoyed. 

so now to the actual story. friday he found out he could start his new job monday. he ordered a pizza from my place and asked i take it home with me from work. i didn‚Äôt mind of course so i did. turns out one of my coworkers put the wrong pizzas in the wrong boxes and got our orders mixed up. before i left for the night i had to remake the pizza she had given us and got a lecture about making sure to carefully read over tickets. i was annoyed already about this. i get home and he flips out that it‚Äôs the wrong pizza. he starts talking about how he just won‚Äôt eat even though he hasn‚Äôt eaten all day. i offer to drive back and get him the right pizza even though i just worked an 8 hour shift and i have a condition that causes extreme pain in my back, legs and feet when i stand for long periods of time and i was dead beat tired bc it was a friday and really busy. the whole car ride back to my work he‚Äôs yelling about how everyone i work with is an idiot and the r slur and just overall saying really mean things about my new coworkers, who i really like. he talks about how my manager must be this miserable sad sack for working there for 9 years, i didn‚Äôt see anything wrong with it though. he obviously enjoyed the work. but finally when he gets the right pizza he calms down and apologizes. 
then all weekend all he could talk about is how much more he‚Äôll be making than me and how he‚Äôs so happy to have a ‚Äúreal job‚Äù. it‚Äôs been making me feel really miserable about my work bc i feel like it‚Äôs not good enough for him anymore, even though he himself worked there for a brief period. so i was already feeling a little insecure and hopeless about my work, which is a big deal to me bc i have really bad depression and its really important to me that i don‚Äôt dread work like i have in the past. 
so comes monday and he wants to get a jump start on his training so he gets up at 5 so he can get there by 6, which means i also have to get up that early to take him. the day goes by fine and he texts me all day talking about how he‚Äôs found his place and he‚Äôs happy about his new work where so many of his friends work. don‚Äôt get me wrong i‚Äôm more than thrilled for him, it is very exciting to be at a place where you feel like you fit in. 
i worked at 2 pm and got off at 8. so around 6 i was taking a break and called him and he said he‚Äôd stay awake until i got home so we can spend a little time together. i get home and he‚Äôs asleep. i was a little annoyed about this but let him sleep. around 9 he wakes on his own and i ask if the dog needs taken out at all and he said he does but that he‚Äôll do it. so i ask if he could stay up for a little bit when he gets back so i can tell him about my day, i had an amazing day at work and was really excited to share it with him. he says in a really aggressive tone ‚Äúyeah it‚Äôs not like i need to get up at 5 am or anything.‚Äù so i just say i‚Äôll take the dog out and he can just go back to bed. don‚Äôt worry about it. he then says ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt have to be such an asshole about it‚Äù 
i ofc was upset bc i didn‚Äôt think i was being an asshole, all i wanted was to spend an hour with him since i hadn‚Äôt seen him all day. i take the dog out and call my mom bc i was upset and wanted someone else‚Äôs opinion if i was being an asshole for just wanting to spend time with him. she said that he‚Äôs still adjusting to the new sleep schedule and i should just let it go. but it‚Äôs hard to let it go when someone so close to you calls you a mean name. when i got back down i went and sat in the closet bc i didn‚Äôt want to lay in bed next to someone who just called me an asshole. he starts blowing up my phone about how i need to come out and how are we gonna fix anything if i just hide. he has a valid point, i just have a really hard time with discussions. my whole life a discussion was sit down and shut up. so i walk out of the closet and all hell breaks loose. 

we start arguing about things from months and weeks ago. every time we fight he brings up how i live in his house rent free and i always ask him if he wants me to leave bc it makes me feel unwanted and unwelcome. i‚Äôve told him this before, and what‚Äôs ironic is that he doesn‚Äôt pay rent either. he brought You how he puts gas in my car and gets gas money for me. i told him the only time i leave the house is so i can go to work and to take him wherever he needs to go. he then said that he‚Äôs not putting money and gas into a car that doesn‚Äôt take him anywhere. keep in mind that neither of us have had steady income for stuff like gas bc we both recently started working and haven‚Äôt gotten out checks yet. 
i then brought up how i take care of his dog during the day while he‚Äôs at work and his response was that he regrets letting me care for charlie. this really hurt bc he has a human son that the mother of says i‚Äôm not allowed to meet ever. this hurt bc i understand not meeting him after only a few months but ever? i was excited to meet his son at some point. eventually the fighting stopped and i started crying. he didn‚Äôt know but that day on my way home from work i actually felt hopeful and excited about my future with my work and that was a huge deal to me. it felt like he had stripped it away from me. his response to me crying was to turn to me and say ‚Äúit‚Äôs not the end of the world you know‚Äù which completely invalided the fact that i was upset and he didn‚Äôt even know why i was upset to begin with. 

we ended up just going to bed without talking. the next day was tuesday and i was off work so i picked him up from his work and we had to run a few errands. i guess i wasn‚Äôt acting like my normal self bc he asked if i was mad at him. he has a tendency to just pretend nothing ever happened when we fight like that but that was the first time we fought in that manner. i told him i didn‚Äôt even know what to say to him and that i was really hurt by some of the things he said. he agreed that he was being a dick last night and came clean that he had been drinking before i got home. 
he has a problem with alcohol and wasn‚Äôt supposed to be drinking, his baby mama even told him that if he can quit drinking and smoking weed she‚Äôll let him be more in his child‚Äôs life. so it was big deal bc at that point he had been sober for nearly three weeks. 

we talked a little more about it and agreed to just admit that we were both in the wrong. i still don‚Äôt think i was in the wrong but i wanted to move on. 

then on wendesday he had band practice and i was off again so i hung out with his friends. i‚Äôve never really felt like i fit in with them, we have very different upbringings and don‚Äôt have any common interests. but since i moved in with him in a new city i didn‚Äôt have any friends of my own nearby. this is the part where i think i‚Äôm in the wrong. one of his friends girlfriends was there who i had never met before. she seemed really nice and genuinely trying to get to know me. she was asking about my home life and my family and we ended up talking about his drinking and smoking. i told her he‚Äôs been trying to quit for the sake of his son. she ended up leaving early and i was chitchatting with his other friend who i be seen many times at this point. she was asking about our relationship and if i see it going anywhere. i admitted to her that i was having doubts about our relationship bc of our fight and told her about some of the things he said. she gave me some really good advice and i felt better after getting some outside input. 

we left and the next day while he was at work he called me. he asked if i had said anything to his friends about him. i admitted that i did and told him i was feeling isolated and wanted someone to just listen to me. he told me he gets that but i shouldn‚Äôt have talked to his friends about it. apparently the girl i had never met before was really close with his baby mama and was only talking to me to get inside information on him to report back to baby mama. and then the friend i have met before went and told the whole friend group everything i said and now there‚Äôs a lot of drama between everyone. i feel bad for bringing everyone else into our fight but i was just trying to get advice from someone and i didn‚Äôt know who else to turn to. so our whole fight has restarted bc i told his friend and she told everyone else and everything‚Äôs a mess.

I‚Äôm trying to figure out where his head is regarding the intention of this date. Especially since we don‚Äôt live near each other. Should I straight up ask ‚ÄúAre you looking for a hookup with this date?‚Äù Through a text? Or wait and ask in casual conversation on the date?

I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll be fine with or without sex, but I‚Äôd like to know how to go into this date/what mindset to be in. Honestly, if the chemistry is there, it‚Äôs hard for me to say no to sex in the moment, so i want to prepare myself and not just dive into the situation and ‚Äúsee where it goes‚Äù 
I don‚Äôt want to make it weird and every time I‚Äôve tried asking before just happened to be the ‚Äúwrong way to ask.‚Äù And I came off controlling or like I‚Äôm ‚Äúdoing too much‚Äù/‚Äúruining the moment‚Äù

TL;DR - how do you ask if someone has the intention of sex when approaching a first date. Before you meet up? During the date? How would you phrase it?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p5oz3y/im_going_on_a_date_with_someone_coming_from_out/

I (29F) have been dating a great guy (31M) for around 3 months now. We‚Äôve been seeing each other a couple of times a week, lots of sleepovers, constant texting - everything has been great. 

There was a little blip a couple of weeks back where he thought I was about to ask him to go ‚Äúofficial‚Äù (I wasn‚Äôt - though I‚Äôd like to) and he panicked and told me he wasn‚Äôt quite ready for that. His last couple of relationships have ended badly and so he‚Äôs being super careful not to get hurt again I guess. As disappointing as that conversation was for me, I decided that it was probably worth me being patient for a little while longer and seeing what happened. 

Couple of days ago after a few drinks, he referred to me as his girlfriend. I was a little surprised but didn‚Äôt react to it in case he‚Äôd said it accidentally (hi there social anxiety). Later on, he did the same thing again - we were laughing about a conversation we‚Äôd had with another couple earlier in the day when he said ‚ÄúI bet they looked at you and thought ‚Äòher boyfriend is a right jerk‚Äô‚Äù. Again, I didn‚Äôt react to the use of the word ‚Äúboyfriend‚Äù - though maybe I should have done.

What makes things awkward now though is that the next day when he was sober, he referred to me as his ‚Äúfriend‚Äù when speaking about me to a cab driver. V confusing!

34,p5po6g,1629149526,Shallow connection with my date after 2.5 month,"First off all; I'm from the Netherlands, so I'm sorry if my grammar isn't on point so now and then!

So..  I'm dating this guy for 2.5 months now who is 5 years younger. I'm 33. 
I have had some pretty serious relationships; one from 7 years and some relationships around 1.5 years. I also lived together with a previous partner. I'm pretty serious when it comes to relationships. I like to get to know someone, invest in them, grow together and have a lovely time together for a - hopefully- long time.

He only had a one long-distance relationship and one relationship when he was 16. He never lived together and still lives at home with his parents.

I'm a sucker for deep connection's and honest conversations. For me a person is attractive when I feel this emotionally strong bond where your open, honest, ask questions, tell personal stories about Big or smal events that happened in your life and that lead up to who you are.

This guy is great when it comes to a lot of aspects but the connection just doesn't go any deeper since day 1. He is very interested in me, and showed me of to al his friends/sport friends whatever, talks about the future, wants to introduce me to his parents.

But i'm doubting more and more if it's just because of my physique or for me as a person.

The compliments are so shallow: your sweet, your pretty, your nice, your fit. And it feels so meaningless.  Never do I hear something about me as a person, my character or my traits that attract him.

When im dating I like to ask a lot of questions to get to know someone and learn more about them personally. Compliments that I gave are always personal, because telling someone is pretty.. doesn't mean a lot to me because it's something anyone can say.

The conversations are really shallow unless I ask him about things in his life. I told him once that I miss getting some questions back so he could get to know me. But I never got any. So now and then he asks; and you? After I ask a question, but even that's something he lacks of most of the time.

When we talk about feelings, I initiate it 9/10 times, sometimes he is even silent when I open up and says NOTHING. And then he later texts like: o, about what you said.. I just let you speak, but I have the same. 
I feel like; why is it so hard to say that in person? I'm not someone who is into texting, I rather have face to face talks.. it's wayyy more personal and special then a stupid text.

Whe are dating now for 2.5 months and I'm not sure about the whole thing.. Do I need to give it more time to develop a emotional bond, is it the lack of experience from his part with relationships, shall I bring it up again and hope that he understands what I need?

Do more people experience this huge difference in there relationships when it comes to the needs of having a emotional bond with your partner?

I never experienced anything like this so I'm not sure what to think about it.

43,p5qwcj,1629153426,You can do everything right and it can still not work out,"So the title is basically my story in a nutshell:

Three weeks ago on a Tuesday morning I match with a girl on Tinder. Almost immediately she messages me and soon after proposes we meet for a coffee before she goes to work in the next hour. I've got nothing going and we live less than a km away from each other (I'm in Poland) so I'm down for it. 

It goes well, we meet, chat for a bit, have some Starbucks, then she catches a tram to work. Later that evening, she invites me over to her place for some pizza, drinks, and meet some of her friends. After a fun night of hanging out and playing cards against humanity, we call it a night and head home at 1 AM. 

I was out of town for the rest of the week, but when I got home on Sunday, I let her know I'm back in town and would like to meet up, but then, she hits me with this:

""I must focus on workü•∫ but if I will be available or something I will let u know that I'm bored or smth"" 

So I'm here thinking to myself ""Where did I go wrong? I thought it was going well"". It stung a little to read that, but I knew to keep my head up and keep moving forward. To my surprise however, the following evening, she texts me saying we should go to the gym the next morning. So Tuesday morning, we go to the gym, then she comes back to my place for a coffee and she needed to use my laptop to take a test for her work or something. Turns out she was somewhat genuine about her work. 

However, she kinda goes into a low mood after she finds out she failed the test. I'm an optimist so I try to keep her spirits up, but instead she wanted to go back to her apartment to smoke weed to relieve the stress from it I guess. Nevertheless, she thanks me for a good workout session, coffee, and letting her use my laptop, and we'll see you soon.

Except that was 2 weeks ago and I haven't seen her since. I just even just texted her now saying I'm thinking of going out Friday or Saturday night. She says she already has plans for Friday (fair enough), but Saturday she's not sure. At this point for me, anything but a yes is a no. 

So here I am once again trying to figure out where did I go wrong, but honestly, I'm not sure what. I made my intentions clear, that I didn't want to be just friends, we matched on Tinder after all. 

Still, I don't get it. One week she wants to see me and hang out, the next she doesn't. It's basically hot and cold behavior. I'm supposed to travel to the US next week for 5 weeks and then I have to go to the UK for work, so I really need to get ready for that now. 

I will continue to evaluate myself over the course of the 3 interactions I've had with her to find any mistakes along the way. One thing I have learned though is that you can do everything right, even on the first 3 dates, and it can still not work out. 

The important thing is to not take it personally and keep your head up. It'll sting a bit (it does for me), but just keep improving yourself to be the best you",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p5qwcj/you_can_do_everything_right_and_it_can_still_not/

I just want to feel like I can have a future, get married, feel home.

I have too much baggage and dont feel like I am attractive.
I have a hard time going out to meet people.

Is there any chance for someone like me in my age to reach a dream of a home and family?

57,p5s9fc,1629157973,Tinder Moments from 2014-2015 were a great way to start a conversation.,"Tinder Moments were basically photos you could share with all your matches, with some text included. Most people used it to just show what they were doing or show off their bodies, but I found it a good way to advertise an activity. Then girls would actually message me first.

I had accumulated a couple hundred matches by then (I swiped right on everyone), so it was almost a guarantee at least one would engage with me. Think of it as a local ad to the people who already thought you were attractive enough to swipe right on. It was also just a good way to get a conversation going.

Is there anything like that now? I find the typical interactions on dating apps to be kind of exhausting - going through a lot of the same questions.

59,p5suwe,1629160026,Girl was interested in me and was flirting but then rejects me?,"So there's this girl that goes to my university and she was in one of my classes last semester. I would often find her staring or trying to hold eye contact. So this semester we had 2 courses together and we started sitting together. She's beautiful and gives off nice vibes every time we talked. We also exchanged snaps and she often sent me these cute selfies. Based of her chatting skills and talking in person I could still tell she was flirting at times

So I decided to ask her out in-person and ... she straight up rejected me. She didn't have a boyfriend or anything and suddenly said she's not interested. Was this my mistake for asking too soon? Did I misinterpret the hints I saw? So after that it got a bit awkward and we haven't been sitting together anymore and she stopped messaging me on snap.

I was worrying about how the date would go and which place to take her but didn't expect a straight up rejection. Lost a lot of confidence after this blow.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p5suwe/girl_was_interested_in_me_and_was_flirting_but/
60,p5sw2l,1629160145,A guy I like‚Ä¶ advice needed,"So there is a guy a like. A lot more than I should. We have great conversations online and live (live means 2-3 times because of the pandemic and before the fact that I was unavailable). So we have known each other for a while (3 years, out of which I wasn‚Äôt available for long) and I have just became available lately. We have texted and he has been very responsive, and I think he likes me. Still, he never initiates conversation. It is always me. As I said, he answers promptly and reacts in a meaningful way to everything and anything I say, he asks questions but he doesn‚Äôt ever initiate. 
So‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not 15‚Ä¶. It‚Äôs silly‚Ä¶ But hell, when I see him, I turn red for hours and I‚Äôm useless for days. He has asked me on a date at least 3 times - hasn‚Äôt happened yet, and I don‚Äôt know if it will. I just don‚Äôt. But there is this thing in me. A thing I can‚Äôt get rid of, since I know him. And it makes me so so mad. üò°

I don‚Äôt even know what to ask. He asked me out 3 times so far and none of the dates came through. Yes, I‚Äôm not offering that much, I show that I‚Äôm kinda laid back, whatever. Although, me texting him every single time is not that laid back now, is it. So I have a couple of hypotheses:
1. He is gay - that is impossible because he would definitely not be the way he is if he were. 
2. He has someone - would he though? Would he be available to talk for hours if he had a girlfriend? On a Friday night?? My bad too, I never asked him. 
3. He is playing around, because it is nice to flirt. 
4. He is a wuss‚Ä¶.? He thinks I‚Äôm still unavailable because I haven‚Äôt made it clear for real, only sort of given hints‚Ä¶ so maybe he is careful. 
5. He is just respectful and thinks the client is needy‚Ä¶? Yes, I‚Äôm the client. They don‚Äôt make money directly off us, and him being more professional wouldn‚Äôt change a thing.

61,p5swpg,1629160209,Am I delusional or is my ex lowkey stalking me?,"Long story short, this summer I started working at a liquor store that is relatively unknown and niche. It‚Äôs clear cut across town from my ex‚Äôs house and his workplace - I‚Äôve only worked there for three months- and a month ago he randomly came in but I hid in the back so he wouldn‚Äôt see me. I thought it was strange but chalked it up to a super weird coincide. A day or two later he somehow found my brand new insta account and was clearly creeping because he accidentally liked a photo of mine. Then less than a week later, he viewed my story on IG but wasn‚Äôt following me. The following week he came into my work place again, for context: all of our products are behind a counter, and during this incident my back was facing away from the door. There were two other people working yet he walked up to the counter where I was (facing the opposite direction stocking a cooler) and when I turned around to my surprise, he was less than a foot away and I had to serve him. There‚Äôs no way he didn‚Äôt see me because after the fact I walked around to the other side of the counter and I could clearly see where I would have been. THEN last week I happened to be sitting on my front step and I saw him bike by house even though it‚Äôs not his usual bike route and is super far from his house. Then he liked my most recent IG photo, unliked it days later only to like it again. Couple days later as I was driving to work I saw him drive by my place. Cut to today, he came in **AGAIN** but my coworker helped him while I pretended to be busy and look away. He made a point of talking to me, then accidentally dropped his shit on the way out (it broke) and he was super embarrassed. When I looked out the window I noticed he parked his car right next to mine despite the entire lot being empty. He obviously knows what I drive so there‚Äôs no way he didn‚Äôt know I was working.

She‚Äôs really cool and sweet. Though it has been a minute since we last had sex. It‚Äôs been a while that I thought she lost interest in me, but I didn‚Äôt trip out about it because it is what it is. I have a very high sex drive whereas she doesn‚Äôt. Last night, we finally had sex again. 

This time I was a little surprised she wanted to do it. I asked if she was still into me. She said ofc. Then I asked if she really wanted to do this. She nodded yes. Then she replied, ‚ÄúI know you have a high sex drive so I‚Äôm just trying to please you at least‚Äù. This drove my anxiety through the roof. I am a survivor of rape/SA so consent is very important to me. I need it clearly and I need it to be said to me ‚Äúyes‚Äù before proceeding. The thought of having sex with someone who‚Äôs not really in the mood, but they‚Äôre just doing it for me gives me so much anxiety. I cannot enjoy it if the other person isn‚Äôt enjoying it. I lose interest quick. 

Today, she said I worry too much. I worry too much about making her feel uncomfortable. That I have her consent always. She thinks I bring it up too much and should just accept her response when she agrees to do it. I can‚Äôt lie, I prolly do annoy her too much in the beginning with repeating ‚Äúare you sure? Yes? Be honest please. If you don‚Äôt want to do it, please tell me.‚Äù and etc. She said even if she isn‚Äôt in the mood, she likes seeing me happy bc I do truly enjoy the time with her.

66,p5tkik,1629162619,Bad luck or me?,"I don't open up to people almost ever (25M) so I figure I'll do a little bit here. 

I got into my first relationship a little over 6 years ago. She was genuinely my everything. I loved her and did everything I could to make her happy. We talked around our 1 year about marriage and such and we had both agreed we wanted to be in a relationship for at least 2 years before getting engaged. Well, we passed the 2 year mark and I didn't wanna appear too over excited, but I had definitely decided this was the woman I wanted to marry and spoil the rest of my life. So maybe a month or so past our 2 year I brought it up and she abruptly said she could never imagine marrying me and she broke up with me that day. It shattered me and tbh, to this day I'm still healing. 

Anyway, big mistake, but I got into another relationship about a month after 1st girl and I had broken up. This 2nd girl told me I was the person she was looking for and I believed her. She spoiled me as much as I spoiled her and we seemed so happy. Eventually she brought up sex and after some talks I agreed to give up my virginity since I really believed she and I were gonna be married and we'd be together for ever. Well, you can probably sense where this goes, we didn't end up working out. Mostly because she cheated, got pregnant, and married this new guy. 

But my big question is, am I just this disappointing? Am I just not worth marrying? Am I not a good possible husband/dad? Or am I just that unlucky?

I've been single now for nearly 2 years now and I just can't find it in myself to develop feelings for anyone anymore.

83,p5udel,1629165511,Long distance boyfriend of 3.5 years keeps ignoring me when I ask about seeing eachother again. (M 24 / M 28),"I've been seeing a guy 3 hours / 170 miles away for going on 3.5 years and seeing eachother in person typically twice a month since 11/2020. The first 6 times he drove to me, I started going his way in March. We're not publicly exclusive since his parents are homophobic but all his friends know about us.

He had an anxiety attack/breakdown with me when I was there the last weekend of July for my birthday. Long story short, I drove the entire way to him for the first time (normally he picks me up halfway). My car was unsafe to drive home and he still insisted I left Sunday night, threatening to call the police to remove me if I didn't. He later apologized multiple times over text and phone once I got home. We'd never had any kind of fight or minor issue whatsoever until then.

Early on the first week of August, one of his cats needed emergency medical attention and he ended up making a $1000 goal gofundme for the bills. I put up $225 and got other friends on my end to put up $250. He was very appreciative of it multiple times.

That weekend, I went to a surplus store in my city he loves to use a $20 coupon I'd had for months since it was expiring later in August. Yesterday I asked him when I could come his way again to give him everything I bought, he said to remind him tomorrow.

I did once he got off work today and he unexpectedly (to me) suggested the weekend of September 18th. I'm supposed to start working an in-person fulltime job after August ends (I've worked remotely since right before covid).

I told him that and asked if it was possible for me to come stay with him either this Sunday or next Sunday through midweek. He ignored that part of my message, only asking what kind of job I'll be starting, then ignored me a second time. We've not talked tonight since then.

I'm thinking the only reason he's doing this is because he's not ready to physically see eachother in person after his breakdown, and he's just too nice to tell me. I guess I'm not sure what to do. I don't want to keep bringing it up but it'd be nice to get some kind of answer.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p5udel/long_distance_boyfriend_of_35_years_keeps/

87,p5utwx,1629167158,How to start dating after college with no experience with girls?," This will be long, please bear with me.

I am now a 23 year old guy who has absolutely no experience with girls beyond friendship, like seriously, none. I got my first hug last month after hiking with a girl for a few weeks. I am a decent looking guy so I chalk this up to several causes. lack of exposure/options, late to the game, and extreme introversion.

First off, lack of exposure. I am in a male dominated field and am in male dominated hobbies. I work in natural resources which is 90% male. Hobbies include, everything outdoorsy, from hunting to climbing to back country skiing. All of these seem to have very few girls. Even my guy friends say I am too outdoorsy for them most of the time, leading me to do everything alone. My social life is a small group that is extremely tight, we only really hang out with each other, and not often anymore. It is hard to break into new groups or to find someone to add to mine. This has caused me to have lots of acquaintances who I know but dont really ""know"" (if you know what I mean), they also aren't really willing to accept invitations.

Ever since I graduated college, my exposure to people in general has dropped even further, especially since I live in a semi remote area. Small town of 2000 people, about 40 mins from the nearest city.

Late to the game. I am a christian and every christian girl my age is married it seems. It seems like I have missed the boat and potentially missed the train that takes you to the boat. On top of that I am waiting for marriage which reduces possible dates even more. I have reached the age where having absolutely no experience is becoming an amber flag. I also am not really a church person and have never fit in with church groups or church people.

Extreme introversion. I am NOT socially awkward or anti social. I in fact love social gatherings and meeting people. Its just that it sometimes takes me weeks to recharge my social batteries. I am generally perfectly happy alone or with a single every close friend. This further limits my lack of exposure.

People are usually surprised when they ask about my girlfriend and they find out that I am single. I am told that I would make a great husband or that ""I just figured a guy like you was taken"".

I have tried many things.

""Dont look for a relationship/be desperate, it will come when you least expect it."" - Thats how I ended up here. I lived my life though college and would say that I have lived a pretty good one. I dont want to sound like I have a large ego, but I really do have no regrets and have lived life to the fullest.

Online - nothing, no likes, matches or messages. I have had profiles reviewed and created by friends and reddit.

Therapy - I have been to a therapist in the past and all I got out of it was ""Some people are meant to be alone, we can work on ways for you to accept it"".

Friends - Friends/family etc have tried to set me up, but that has never led to a date, only lots of being stood up.

So my questions stands. What would you recommend to a guy who is recently graduated in a rural area and is hungry for a companion, to do to try to change my dating life for the better. Essentially something needs to change, but I don't know what.

88,p5uub2,1629167198,How common is it to get hit on at least once every time you go out?,"So I guess you can say I have confidence issues, I just go through periods where I‚Äôm feeling myself, but most of the time I just feel like I‚Äôm not good enough for things and just feel worthless. That‚Äôs a completely different conversation, but I was wondering like how common is it for guys to actually get hit on or asked when they go out. 

I ask this bc after I started going out I realized that it‚Äôs become normal (it‚Äôs maybe happened 4-5 times now) for a girl to come up to me and ask me out or call me cute or whatever. Usually it‚Äôs by girls I don‚Äôt find attractive and I just say I have a gf, but I always make sure to never be rude and tell them how much I appreciate it bc I 1) really do appreciate it and 2) respect that they‚Äôre going out of there way to talk to me.

I‚Äôve had times where girls I find attractive make it easy for me to hit on them, by being extra nice or whatever, but I want to go after shy girls and girls that I actually like. I was out the other night and I just felt off even though I was talking to people and having a good time, and like my confidence wasn‚Äôt there for whatever reason. 

I‚Äôm saying this bc I feel like an imposter at times, like they‚Äôre just flattering me and I get really anxious when a relationship starts to begin, and I just want to find my person you know. I‚Äôve only been in two almost relationships and they died out both at like the 3 month mark, and Id like to believe that I‚Äôm going to find someone and just click and everything will be all good, but it hasn‚Äôt happened.

I guess I think like since I‚Äôm not in a relationship or seeing anybody right now, it must be me. 

I guess how have you dealt with feelings of low self confidence, feeling like an imposter, etc.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p5uub2/how_common_is_it_to_get_hit_on_at_least_once/
89,p5uydm,1629167620,first date at my house? 24f who lives alone.,"I‚Äôm talking to a guy on a dating app about bad movies and he suggested we watch one at my place as our first date. When he first recommended we watch a movie together I entertained it, but after thinking about it for more than a split second, I get a little nervous at the thought of the first date being at my home since I live alone. I‚Äôd rather meet up in public first to see if there‚Äôs any chemistry. Do I trust my gut on this one? how do i backtrack on a movie night without totally bailing?

91,p5v217,1629167992,Advice for after a break up,"I just got out of about a year long relationship, it had its pros and cons which I feel like is normal but the breakup took about the whole summer (June-present). We broke up and got back together several times over that period and I feel like mentally I‚Äôve been moving on since July. But this past week we finally decided to end things and my brain instantly thought ‚ÄúI should download tinder‚Äù. Like what is that???? I don‚Äôt even know if I‚Äôd want to date right now. 

When is too soon to start using tinder? And why is it my (and probably so many others) first instinct to immediately download it right after something doesn‚Äôt work out?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p5v217/advice_for_after_a_break_up/
92,p5v3bz,1629168123,My new boyfriend lied when I asked about a name who is his ex girlfriend,"I‚Äôm 31 and he‚Äôs 28.

Is this considered a white lie? And Am I overreacting for being lied to. I have had people lie to me in the past as to why it‚Äôs eating me up. I really am confused to the point of where I am seeking advice here. 


I saw the name twice and disregarded then something came up later and  stimulated me to search the name, I don‚Äôt consider it too much of prying even though not like me to do so, it is 2021 and everyone‚Äôs on the internet. It in fact was his ex girlfriend. 

His first rebuttal to me was ‚Äú I don‚Äôt know who that is‚Äù

Second, ‚Äú‚Äòmaybe it‚Äôs my sisters friend‚Äù

Maybe? Ha

I think it‚Äôs really a farfetched response.

When if he just said an ex from a while ago would‚Äôve just ended the conversation and I wouldn‚Äôt have asked anymore nor cared but since lied I am really conflicted.


Please spare some insight if you have some

Then I overheard a girl (19F) talking to another clerk about her college and she went to the same college I went to. I asked the girl what her major was and she was taking some of the same courses that I already took and I offered her some of my study materials. I asked for her email which she gave me.

I continued to talk to the clerk about the return and the girl came back into the store and asked me for my number. As we were exchanging numbers I asked her where she was from and it turned out she and I were from the same town. (The shop was in a place 30min away from the town)It turned out that she and I went to the same elementary school, middle school and high school. We talked to each other for quite a while and said goodbye as the conversation naturally ended.
