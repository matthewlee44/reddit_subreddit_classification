0,rq1d4d,1640650186,Do Guys Enjoy Skincare Facials?,"I (20F) am really into skincare - I never had particularly bad skin but I find doing facials on myself every night incredibly therapeutic. When I was with my ex, I sometimes did my skincare routine on him and he seemed to really enjoy it too! It’s like a little massage for the face and the clear skin is just a bonus :)

I’ve recently started seeing this new guy and he stays over mine often. I really like spending time with him and have been wanting to ask him if he’d like a facial because I think he might enjoy it (he likes when I give him back massages). It’s also really fun for me to do, as the guy would usually lay down on the bed with me sitting on top of them and it’s kinda hot kissing them spontaneously when they’ve got their eyes closed for the facial. But that’s just going off my experience with my ex, I have no idea whether other guys would enjoy this :(

I really want to ask him whether he’d want to try it but I’m scared he’ll find it offensive (he might think I’m implying he’s got bad skin) or that he’ll think it’s weird/awkward because skin care and facials are often considered feminine. Also I have no idea how I’d even bring it up - it just feels so random to ask and I don’t want to seem like I’m “trying too hard”

I just want to get a general idea of how this would be perceived from a guy’s perspective? If a girl you were seeing offered to do a facial on you, would it be weird or cute?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rq1d4d/do_guys_enjoy_skincare_facials/

I have a full-time job and I am currently saving money to move out!!!! 

Meanwhile the guy I was talking to has been unemployed for past five years and said that he has no plans to ever change that.

3,rq1qpd,1640651266,"I’m (25F) starting to think that stating that I want a relationship could be pushing away good matches because it can be taken as an “ASAP, ring by spring” thing, when it’s not. I’d love some thoughts on this.","As of right now, the only app I’m active on is Hinge. One of my prompts is, “Let’s make sure we’re on the same page about…” and (among other, more light-hearted things) my answer includes “wanting a relationship.” 

When I get a match, or go on the first date, I’ll usually ask what they’re looking for if it’s not stated on their profile (I know Hinge’s terms include wanting a meaningful relationship, but that hasn’t helped anything, IMO). I’ve gotten a mix of “I don’t know,” “Casual dating,” “A relationship maybe, but I don’t want to rush into anything” etc. My most recent encounter was a guy who said he was “emotionally available,” we had a great first date, then the second date ended with him saying “we’re already doing couple-y things (meaning holding hands in public kinda things, which honestly he initiated most of) and I’m not ready, so please let me initiate that kind of stuff on my terms” so then I got insecure and anxious about everything because I realized I would be afraid to ask for a date or anything out of fear of scaring him off. That led to this post. 

I never expect anyone to rush into anything. Ever. I completely respect that it takes time to get to a point of saying no to everyone else to say yes to one person (assuming monogamy, which my relationships include, no shame otherwise, though!). 

That said, I, personally, do see value in just saying yes or no when it comes to the question of, “Are you ideally, if all goes well, looking for a relationship?” 

I view stating &amp; asking about intentions as choosing which set of lenses to look through as you date; when I was into casual dating, for example, the lenses I looked through were questions of do we have fun together, is he nice, do we get along, etc. As I’ve moved into wanting to date towards a relationship, the lenses have changed to deeper things like do I see myself trusting this person’s words and actions, what’s his dating history like (and is he willing to hear mine, judgment free?), how are his friendships, relationships with family, etc.

I also don’t have sex outside of a relationship, which is another reason I ask about what they’re looking for - I don’t want to waste their time if that’s not okay with them/they expect sex during the dating-multiple-people-phase. 

Maybe I’m shooting myself in the foot here, though. Maybe being too blunt is pushing potentially good matches away because they feel like it’s a RIGHT NOW kinda thing, when it’s not. It just gives direction to the whole thing, which I like. Maybe I could/should communicate that better. 

Am I overthinking this? Does it sound like I’m expecting too much too soon if I say I want a relationship? Any and all thoughts or experiences are appreciated. :)",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rq1qpd/im_25f_starting_to_think_that_stating_that_i_want/

Stayed in contact all the down the years and ended up in relationships with other people.

In March 2020 he ended up trying to sext me, we fell out. A few months later I saw he blocked me across social media so we didn't have any contact for a year.

In June 2021 he contacted me by re-adding me on snapchat (at this stage we were both single). I asked him straight out why he felt the need to block me on social media and he denied it all saying he just deleted his accounts and I didnt really care so I just let it go. This has come up a few times but he has repeatedly said that he doesn't have social media anymore etc...

We've been sexting eachother on and off for the past 6 months and that is all I want from him because I'm still processing my breakup with my ex (8 months ago) and don't want to date or even have a physical relationship with anyone.

7,rq26gz,1640652561,39 M - Finding out She has Kids,"Hi - so the “whether or not to put kids in your profile” is one of the biggest debates in OLD. 

I’m upfront on Hinge since I have kids and state it on the drop-down menu. I’ve been casually dating a woman (41F) for almost 3 months and found out she has a child last night. I find it a little unsettling she didn’t admit to having kids when it was clear that I do. 

Context: I do not introduce dates to my kids and think it’s better for everyone, most importantly the kids. If it’s a LTR then I’d consider it when we have a deep connection. She knows the above from conversations early on. We are both successful in our fields and also spiritual so have developed a bond in those realms. I respect her greatly and believe she’s helped me become a better version of myself in a short period of time. After dating 10+ women this year I can say she is a rare combo of confidence, class and beauty with traditional values. Hard to find in the Bay Area where poly/ENM is seemingly ubiquitous and ghosting is a way of life. We are both North Bay folks so lifestyle and location is a great fit too. 

What do both F and M think about telling someone you have kids ? How long would you wait ? How should I broach this when we talk again this week ?

We are planning NYE in the city (SF) so not making any quick decisions this week.

Hey 👋 
Recently I (f,24) have broken up with with my bf of 4 years. After that I had a so-called **e phase where I hooked up with people (in particular 6 in total, and prior to that I only slept with 2 people, two exes). 

2 of the guys who I slept with became something closer to me. We didn’t discuss relationships yet but it’s definitely going towards that direction, not just sex. From one prospective I like them both, but from another this phase made me realize I’m very capable of letting them go for a very minor type of dislike. And that my interest in them is weird, it’s not as intense as something I’ve felt to guys I liked before. Has sleeping with so many people changed me? Is it my breakup? Why am I so cold-hearted and can let people go easily (even the ones with whom we developed something, not a huge thing yet, but definitely some romance )?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rq2omx/im_not_as_affectionate_anymore_after_a_phase/
15,rq2p9g,1640654083,Advice on asking someone out?,"So there's this girl at a sporting club we're both members at and often go to similar sessions, and I've also caught up with her a few times to play ourselves. She is pretty keen on said activity so I don't know if she likes me at all or just the sport. She's a bit more of a beginner than me so it would be beneficial for her to practice with me. She hasn't mentioned a boyfriend so I assume she is single. She also hasn't made a point of saying or hinting at being single which you think she might if she was interested.

I want to ask her out but not sure the best way to do it. I did ask her for a drink after one session and she said yes, but then as we were saying our goodbyes after the drink it felt a bit abrupt, but she texted me later to say it was a good evening so it feels 50/50 which way it would go. That kind of drink after is a pretty regular thing with those types of clubs so don't know if I can read much into it. Text wise it's been pretty much just talking about the sport and because I'm not sure if that's the only reason I see her I don't want to hassle her asking her about other stuff in her life in case it's weird.

So I want to ask her out or at least sus out whether she is interested but I want it not to be awkward for her and easy for her if she wants to say no so I was thinking maybe doing it via text would be the best way so I don't put her on the spot? Most of my dating experience has been through online dating so then you already kind of know they are interested or at least know the context of your interactions but I rarely meet people I'm interested in irl so this is kind of new to me.

16,rq2q2j,1640654146,Is this girl into me or should I give up?,"Kind of a long post, so I apologize in advance. I (28M) started seeing this girl (26F) roughly 7 weeks ago. We went on a first date and it was great, chatted all night. We text frequently enough but not constantly throughout the day. Since that first date, we have basically hung out every weekend for one to two days straight. The sex is amazing and I have a great time just bullshitting and drinking with this girl. three weeks in I tell her ""I kinda like you,"" which I feel like is an appropriate emotion to have after seeing someone for three weeks, sleeping with them, and chatting every day. She doesn't really reciprocate, but tells me she has a hard time being vulnerable because she just got out of a 4 year relationship 8 months ago. We continue hanging out but I feel as though she pulled away a bit since revealing this to her; She doesn't text me as frequently and she doesn't seem as eager to make plans with me. A few weekends ago we're hanging out and I ask why its hard for her to be vulnerable with me. She reiterates what she stated previously and says she doesn't know if she wants to actually date someone right now, even though in the past she has told me she is looking for something long term. She does however admit that she likes me. Since then, she has basically bailed on me twice; one weekend she was going to come over after drinking with her friends, but said she was too hungover so she said we should hangout next Sunday after Christmas. Next Sunday comes and I text her in the morning asking what we are going to do that day. She takes hours to respond and tells me that she's hanging with her family again. I'm just torn between continuing to try with this girl, or giving up and telling her that we should stop seeing eachother because I feel like I'm not getting much reciprocation from her.

But when it comes to women and dating, I lack confidence so much.  I’m back on the market after a years long relationship and the prospect of dating is giving me hella anxiety.

 I’m very successful in life, I had a great job, now go to an Ivy League law school, have a great job lined up post school, am financially secure, mesh really well with all of my colleagues/classmates/mentors.  I can work a room and network really well.  I’ve given speeches in front of 1000 people. And in friend relationships women generally have told me I’m very funny.

But when it comes to dating or pursuing woman for relationships, all of that confidence is reversed.  Instead of focusing on my qualities, I think about my drawbacks.  I’m short - 5’5” - nothing I can do about that.  I’m also not fat, but definitely not a slim guy, I have a little extra, nor noticeably muscular.  

I’ve matched with like 10 girls on Hinge in a span of a few days.  A couple convos are going well but I’m deathly afraid to set up a date.  I’m so worried she won’t like my physically, especially if we make it to the bedroom.

26,rq3en1,1640656181,Gender Roles/Money/ Dating/ Millennial Issues,"In your relationships/dating life who generally picks up the check for dating expenses? 
Or who should? 

I study in an expensive city. I see someone who treats me well otherwise and acts very committed to me. He works but is in a junior position at work. 

He hardly ever pays for any dating expenses, and if he does, it’s usually something very minor and happens rarely. 

From day one every drink and meal has been split very evenly. 

Because he has a roommate and I mostly host, so that adds to my bill but i usually don’t mind because I prefer my place. 

But I’m wondering if this guy I’m seeing is not a good fit for me financially… that we may be financially incompatible? 

Don’t get me wrong. It’s not about living off a man. I’ve always paid for my own housing and living expenses with a man. Even a guy paying for dating expenses all the time isn’t great because I saw in my previous relationship that can create resentment even when the guy is earning significantly more. 

But I grew up in a culture where this is also more so the norm too and I’d always considered gifts to be a love language of mine because it’s also how I was raised as a child (a little materialistic I know, but I also can’t help my conditioning and nothing wrong with having a preference)… 

Anyway, it’d be nice to be dating someone who was a little bit more generous. Because I am used to that culture. 

I’m not sure what his mindset is but he doesn’t necessarily come from a culture where women expect to contribute half. I know in Europe it can be more that way.  

Also one thing that I think guys don’t realize is that women send a lot of money on things that are really for the date .  Sexy shoes, clothes, lingerie, perfume.  

He generally requests that I wear these things because it pleases him. I don’t think he realizes these expenses all add up quickly. 
And they are all my personal expenses 

He has some personal issues he’s trying to overcome sex wise so since they help him, I generally oblige.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rq3en1/gender_rolesmoney_dating_millennial_issues/

He has severe anxiety but I get that and so do all my friends and family. He might be ND but my father has Autism so I really enjoy the way his mind works.

But he also has chronic pain in his arms and hands due to his labor intensive job. The pain also makes it hard for him to sleep. So he is often physically drained and fatigued.

He started working the steps in al anon during his relationship with his ex wife and is very aware of his codependency. He has worked hard to learn how to love himself and set boundaries. He has never used any substances beside alcohol and has been sober a couple years. (I’m in recovery too btw)

He worked ten hours on Christmas Eve. He was totally exhausted at his family gathering but he pushed through and was physically present for it. But he was dissociated which he often is.

We stayed at his parents house and went over to my house the next morning around 11am. But he was still tired. 

He was too tired and in too much pain to participate in anything on Christmas. My family is concerned. My mother has nerve pain and nerve damage too. It seems like there are lots of options to help ease his pain. And I would like him to explore treatment options.

I told him Sunday night that I would like him to consider talking to his doctor about Gabapentin. He googled it and said he won’t take pain killers. But It’s not a pain killer nor a narcotic.

I asked him to seek treatment for his sleep and pain problems. They compound on one another and make it difficult to plan anything or enjoy time together on his days off. He has been trying to “live in the moment” but as a result I can’t have expectations on any future events especially if they are social events.

But, He says he is setting a boundary and won’t take medication. He will live in pain until his hands don’t function and I should respect and accept his choice. He feels like my request violates his bodily autonomy and that I am being manipulative. But he is unwilling to talk to a sleep specialist, chiropractor, or acupuncturist either. I don’t care what his treatment is, I just want him to try things and get better!

I want someone who is willing to be a lifelong partner. And if he is adamantly refusing to get help I’m not sure if we will be able to build a life together. 

I don’t know what I can do. Any ideas? How can I address this issue?

TL;DR My boyfriend is constantly fatigued and in pain. We didn’t get to celebrate Christmas because of it. But he refuses to explore any treatment for these issues.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rq3l8n/should_i_end_this_relationship_or_is_there_hope/

All my close friends married or in LTR right now, and I will meet this new year single like always. It been easier in the past, but last time I been on celebration with friends it was weird I was only lonely person there. And after some drinks discussion switched on me and my failures at finding someone, they told mostly positive things and main them was something like ""you are such sweat guy and putting so much efforts, how this happen that you can't find anyone"" yet this felt bad. I want so much to at least once meet new year cuddling with someone I love. 

I been rejected around 50 times only this year, if you only count time where it been at least 1 date. Hell know how many through life. Never ever had success in this. Last week I been blocked/ghosted 6 times and had 3 dates, one was just awful so I ended it myself, one was fine, last one was good we even have common hobbies which is extremely rare in my area. But  today both of them made it clear that they will be extremely happy to be friends with me, but don't see me as romantic interest. That just sad. I had so big list of potential friend so I don't care at all. Probably will try being friends with last one just because of hobby.

Today I had sleepless night because of all this. I know that I am definitely not in right mood for dating right now, so I need to get some pause. But I just lost any hope in having success in this aspect of life so I just don't care much about every conversation or date I have. I already expect it to be fail, since I never saw anything else in 20 years.

However she started saying that she might not be ready for a relationship due to her commitment issues and other interpersonal issues. She was acting weird for a few days and asked me about what's girlfriend material, and why do guys kiss on the first date (we haven't kissed on our dates cause I was sick) 

**Here was her problem:**
So after some digging and talking she told me that a few days ago she was at the city and she ran into an acquaintance. They talked and had dinner as friends but the guy was making moves. She never reciprocated.

She got dropped off by said acquaintance and he kissed her. She said she didn't want to kiss him or have feelings for him.


And she said she felt wrong for being kissed by him. I reassured her many times that it wasn't her fault and that I'm not angry or disappointed that it happened but rather than she kept it from me. Even then I reassured her it's all ok because WE ARENT OFFICIAL 

after some processing we called each other for the first time this week. She explained that she never knew him in person and only online and that was why she accepted dinner from him.

She also said that she doesn't deserved me and that she doesn't think she'll be ready for a relationship. But I still wanted to try cause I thought maybe it's another tough time in her life. And we reached a compromise of ill be un-exclusive again but still talk to her (as apparently she tells me things even her best friends dont)

I'm 35M and live in Melbourne Australia. I'm at that stage in life after a terrible divorce and taking time to pick myself up and sort myself out, I'm ready to jump back into the dating game. This time round I want a girl with some core hobbies and interests of mine. While I know I will never get someone exactly into everything I am, getting at least in the same ballpark is a must. 

I love things like a few computer games at night, watching cartoons, a game of D&amp;D and other similar things. While there is way more to me then the above mentioned hobbies. I'd like a woman who has one foot in such a world.

So far I've got a few dating apps I'm regular using. Attending a few D&amp;D games, and trying to find groups that have above kind of hobbies. But I don't really see meetup groups for these hobbies or if there is online dating for nerds/computer game fans I'd love to know what they are.

43,rq5fqg,1640661965,He seemed interested me for a week and out of nowhere he is basically ignoring me today?,"I met this guy last Sunday. We hit it off. We were talking about our future careers, mutual friends, he offered to get me water, he was rubbing my leg lol, and he even walked me home. We’ve talked every hour of the day via Snapchat for week straight. He’d also respond to me in like a minute, even if I left him on delivered for hours bc I was busy. He’d make me laugh, I’d make him laugh. It was great and I was SO excited that someone I was interested in was interested in me as well. 

Not to mention, he asked me to meet him at a bar twice in one week. The first time was at 2am so I told him I couldn’t. He told me that he was coming to get me (since he knew where i lived after walking me home). I told him no (in a funny way, not mean/stern) and then later he asked me to go over his house (it was 3am and that’s when I wondered if he was just trying to get me in bed with him). He also said he’d pick me up and take me home in time for Christmas Eve morning. He said he wanted me to sleep over so we could watch our fav show and sleep…idk if those were really his intentions though. I still told him no. 

Then on Christmas night, he went to a bar after spending time with family, and he asked me to go but I couldn’t. And then last night he was at his friend’s house (who I know a little), and his friend—let’s say “Jay” randomly snapchatted me, saying “I have to unadd you but it’s nothing you did”… and then right after said “I think I’m in love with you”. I’ve only hung out with Jay once with a whole bunch of other people at a party but always suspected he liked me…. But to top it off, when the guy I like (we’ll call him Matt) snapchatted me, I saw that he was at the friend Jay’s house. Which made me think that Matt was telling them that we’ve been “talking” and that he likes me… and even last night Matt was snapchatting me nonstop and asking me to hang out with them. 

But today, Matt has been super distant and has been leaving me on on delivered for super long periods of time which is so unlike him. I finally got him to talk to me kind of—he even showed me his Christmas gifts lol. But then I asked him if we could hang out before he leaves to go back to the military. It took so much courage for me to ask him because I’ve never asked a guy out before or have even been on a date, and all he said was “Are you going out on New Years”, I responded and have been left on delivered for 40 minutes when he’d answer me in one minute days ago.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rq5fqg/he_seemed_interested_me_for_a_week_and_out_of/

But it’s around the holiday’s, I don’t want to come of as too eager so I told her basically that I’d like to get to know her better but that I had plans this x-mas weekend and NYE but I didn’t want her to think I wasn’t interested.

Later that night she texted that she had a great time ending the message with an “xo” and something the next day the same. I have plans, but I really wanna hang out NYE with her. I think it would be fun. I kinda wanna just tell her that I wanna break my plans and hang out with her if she’d like. I just feel odd about it for some reason.

When she gets the notification will I get the notification that she got the notification?

If she check marks me back, will she be able to message me?

Will paying for anything increase my chances or are things going to work out just the way they are?

When a girl starts messaging me, what should I say?

Are there a lot of girls on Bumble who share the same interests that I do?

Will the algorithm show me girls that have the same interests that I do?

How does the algorithm work?

50,rq5zy8,1640663650,Try to make Win-Win situations,"24M feel as though, in my experience with dating in 2021, I am frequently not heard while I am trying to express something important to people near me.

I'm sorry for my generation and feel dejected by them at the same time. We're so hopelessly depraved. Our parents all got divorced. What we learned about dating through tv and the internet was probably not super great. Selective hearing is giving people daily affirmations for their unhealthy ideals. Nearly 1 in 3 millenials haven't had any sexual activity in a year, gen z is even worse. There's a reason for this.

Over the pandemic I've turned my diet around and quit drinking. I've lost 60 pounds with  &lt;20g carbs a day. I've naturally rested into my self confidence and security with my believing that am a valuable person for a prospective relationship. I've gone through 3 relationships in the past year, which I've learned is actually much more fortunate than a lot of men in my generation.

Each of these relationships I was approached by them, they each lasted about 3-4 months, and ended with me getting blocked on social media. 

This time last year I was going with an autistic girl who was getting her masters degree. She was super intelligent, but it was funny when she wouldn't pick up on sarcasm. We got along really well until one day I said something cross about her. Something really simple too, I just said she was bad at a certain video game, after literally weeks of me trying to be genuinely supportive. She was really bad too. It was like something switched in her brain and from then on whenever she started feeling uncomfortable she would just end up leaving and going home or hanging up the phone. A lot of the time it felt like protest behavior, not the paranoia she was selling me. So, after attempts at comforting her didn't work, I would tell her hey what you're doing is a lot like protest behavior and I don't appreciate that very much. 

And over the course of a few months, there was some back and forth of this and she blocked me and unblocked me on discord and instagram a number of times. I eventually put my foot down and told her, after me having to make amends at every crossroads in the past, it was her turn. She owes me an apology. And she still owes it. She was just physically incapable of acknowledging that she had done anything wrong at any point.

Other girl I'm dating she had just gotten out of a 2 year long relationship but I had already known her for a long time and we already had a sort of flirty relationship. She was very up front with me that she just wanted to be single, so we did our little friends with benefits dance. See I had ignored the red flags on the approach. I knew her mother, and I knew that she had been abused by her mother. She would tell stories all the time about it, but always in a good way as though they were idealizing their parent. Stories like her mother regularly forgot to pick her up at school and so she had to walk home. Or she just got left in another state altogether. Always to the effect that it made her ""stronger"". She was so adamant about this that she told me that if she ever had a child she would insist on raising them the same way, and she knows full well that her partners would have a problem with it.

After a while we started developing attachments for each other and she did not like that. It got to the point that I would drive to her house for her to sit in the room with me without even looking up from her phone at me. She would dismiss my advances. And then when I would go to leave for home, she would get up and grab my arm and kiss my neck ask me to stay. Then she goes on this work trip for a couple weeks, tells me about how she's sleeping with these guys in this other state. When she gets back from the long trip I go over to see her, but she just avoids me, calls me clingy, tells me not to come back for a couple days. I learned that what she was doing to me was something called dismissive avoidant attachment style. It's a cruel disposition to have. 

So I take this realization to her I show her look what you're doing look at what this is. I was excited, I thought a light was going off in her head, that's how I would react if I learned some insightful information about myself. But no, she completely shutdown, drove 4 states away overnight to be with her ex, and I didn't hear from her for weeks. When I finally got her attention, I was just like ""you don't have anything to say at all!?"" and no, she didn't , she continued to blame me and then proceeded to block me on messenger and on her phone. She left her childhood stuffed animal on my bed that I guess I'm either going to keep in my closet or throw away. Guess I could UPS it to her.

Anyways, third and last girl this year that I dated. Approached me telling me she thought I was hot and although she wasn't especially attractive, I was happy with the simplicity of a warm body after the nightmare I had just gotten over. I reciprocated appropriately. First day out she tells me, she gets all serious, tells me she hasn't dated anyone in 2 years and that it was a bad relationship. I tell her ""Oh sorry you didn't have anyone over the pandemic that must've been hard"". She laughed, telling me how much she enjoyed being single. I suspected she was inflating her recent sexual activity and the success she was getting on tinder.

She was clearly very insecure about her weight and her frizzy hair, and her messy car/room. Definitely a pack rat (and I'm a minimalist) but I didn't say anything to her, I was content with trying to make her feel more secure. She did something I still hate where she would pretend to not get your text until the next day or she would hold it over your head if you texted more then 3 times in a row. People really have to stop doing this. I'm considering refusing texting in the future. And I hate phone calls, but if that's what it takes. I even tried to relieve her of the stress by telling her that I won't judge her for how often or how quickly she responded to a text.

In her own weird delusional labyrinth she's created for herself, she became uncomfortable with anything less then complete submission or she wouldn't feel secure. Once it got to the point where she was just unnecessarily wasting my time, I again, confronted her for the first time about these issues and tried to offer her help, and again, blocked, disconnected, no response.

I can't continue to live with lie where we can't admit that there are a significant quantity of people out there that believe that they can do no wrong, and that excommunicating people on a whim is a justifiable and rational course of action.

Furthermore I believe these insecurity issues seem closely intertwined with single-fetishization and polyamory. Healthy relationships aren't indefinite, but they are secure. Don't try to sub/dom your partner in a relationship by creating win-lose scenarios where one person benefits at the other persons expense. Power and domination is a sexual fantasy. Aim to make win-win's in a relationship.

51,rq66f3,1640664151,Start dating or put down roots?,"42m six months out of a 4 year relationship. Just moved cities, which has helped in the healing process immensely. However, am largely starting from scratch in terms of friends (have a couple old ones in new city, but nothing close to the rich social circle I enjoyed with my ex). With recent Covid spike here, plus winter, my preferred ways of meeting new people are pretty much shot.

Here’s my dilemma. In my past, I had a tendency to make the woman in my life the center of everything. This time around, I’m vowing to live a more balanced life, sustaining friendships outside my relationship (rather than letting them fall by the wayside). This balanced way will be new to me and challenging, but I see it as essential, and vital for the health of the LTR I want. But I don’t have my “new” life in place yet, or even close. The thought of having to get there before I can be with someone makes me really discouraged. And I am losing my freaking mind not having intimacy in my life (the whole gamut, including sex but also all that other good stuff). I am 42 and find myself thinking about sex 11,000 times per day, probably more than I did at 16. Externally I think I’d be appealing as a partner, but my life isn’t as together as maybe it should be?

My close friends are split on this. One says: build friendships first, before you go off dating. She says that it would be weird if I start dating someone seriously without other relationships in this city in my life.

He was the one who showed interest first and is still sweet and caring towards me. But on christmas day we had a really great day together and i got super high and he had one of his best friends over (a girl if that matters) and i guess they were looking at some pictures on instagram and I hear him go “oh she’s hot” and his friend went “um hello” and gestured to me (trying to tell him he shouldn’t have said that) and he just went “oh true” and it got kinda awkward. i was on my phone so to them it didn’t seem like i heard. but i just felt terrible that he totally forgot I was in the room, im not mad that he finds other girls attractive but after having such a nice day with him that situation kind of hurt. it’s been 2 days since Christmas and he’s brought up 2 different ex’s of his and i’m not sure how to feel about it and this isn’t the first time he’s brought them up, he’ll tell me a bunch of different stories about different girls, he’s still friends with one of his exes because they work together but they still see each other as friends outside of work. He has a lot more experience that I do even though he’s younger (he’s been with 15 people including relationships, flings, fwb, etc. and I have only been with 2 people aside from him) is it normal for him to bring them up this often?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rq6d6l/why_does_my_boyfriend_keep_bringing_up_his_exs/

58,rq70e9,1640666655,Dating and anxiety,I got out of a four year relationship about a month ago. He didn’t love me the way he said he did. His words say one thing but his actions said another. Anyways. Obviously I’ve been out of the game for a while. I forgot how much my anxiety makes me hate dating. Especially the talking stage. I met this guy on tinder. He checks off every box I have of a perfect partner. We’ve had sex a few times over the past few weeks and went on a few dates. We always tell each other we have fun and plan to see each other again. Now here’s where my anxiety bs comes in. I’ve noticed he’s started taking longer to answer my snaps but his score does keep going up while im left on delivered. Drives me nuts. I know he’s busy with work and all so im trying to be patient and understanding. But my anxiety makes me go crazy and I can’t help but think he’s not interested in anymore. So I sent one last snap (only snapped 3 times in a 24 hour span) asking if he was still interested and if he wasn’t that it was okay I just need to know. Am I crazy for doing that? I feel like the most humane thing to do is let the person know you’re no longer interested. I’ve been ghosted enough times that I just don’t want to get attached if we are not on the same page. Idk. I’ve been through a lot because of my ex and my narcissistic absent father therefore I have attachment and abandonment issues so I’m trying not to scare him off because I see so much potential. But at the same I’ve had myself convinced for so long that I’m not deserving of love because my father never loved me so why would any other man love me. Idk what to honestly.

Last night I asked if he wanted to talk OTP again. He said was busy but said we could talk tomorrow. Totally fine, I knew it was the day after Christmas and I apologized if I had come off as inconsiderate by asking. He said it was totally fine, he would love to talk to me if he wasn’t busy. It gets pretty late so we send our good nights. 
Today he doesn’t say a thing to me until 4:30 p.m., and said he was out with family and took a nap afterwards. Also totally fine, but a little unusual compared to the past few days because he usually texts me earlier in the day/more frequently. Says he’s with family again. No problem. 
He didn’t respond to my last message until pretty late and said he’s tired, goodnight he’s going to bed, and didn’t mention a word about the phone call we were supposed to have?? but said we should meet soon. 

He keeps saying he likes talking to me, so maybe I’m just reading too much into it. I am overreacting by thinking he should’ve at least addressed the phone call? Is he just having a har time being direct so he’s letting me off easy? What do you guys think? Would you stop taking to this person?

Couple days passed after we're still snapping, never really talking in person because I'm so shy and anti social that I don't know what to say and he's always around friends when he is at the gym. The gym is the only time we get to see each other btw. I sent him a snap one day, but he did not reply back the whole day, so I just left it at that. Next day still no reply. I did not snap him again because I did not want to be seen as annoying or desperate. Then I became really depressed that I was too boring for him and my anxiety started to get bad. I was sad for a week straight, so to cope with trying to make myself feel better I clear all of our conversations on Snapchat so that his name would not be the first that I saw. When I see him at the gym, I don't even make eye contact with him because I feel like him and his friends are talking about me. which might just be my anxiety.

I logged back in and he has me removed as one of his friends, so I removed him too.

82,rq8wwl,1640672672,Had an awesome date with a tall girl,"So I had a really fun date tonight followed by some equally fun sex with a tall girl I met at a supermarket yesterday’. 

I needed some heavy cream because I planned on making Alfredo sauce. I was standing at the grocery store in front of the big fridge with all the different types of cream and the cooking cream was all the way at the top. 

I’m 5’5, so not tall enough to reach the cream by myself. Next to me there was a very attractive woman who was probably 5’8. And on my other side there was an employee who was stacking shelves. 

 I turned to her, said hello and asked her if she could please reach up there and grab me the cream and there was a “moment”. She looked at me intently with her big green eyes and I gave her a big smile that said “yep, we both know I could’ve asked the dude next to me stacking the shelves but I asked you because I want to talk to you”. 

Not that she saw my smile because we were both wearing masks, but it’s crazy how much eyes convey vibes and feelings and we just had this moment where we looked each other in the eyes and we somehow understood each other. 

She knew I was interested and now it was up to her to either give me an indication she was interested as well or that she just wanted to be left alone and go on her way. 

Long story short we ended up chatting for five or 10 minutes, we exchanged phone numbers and agreed to hang out the following day.

The point of the story isn’t to tell you about me getting laid but to say that I’m comfortable with my height and I like being me and how I look. 
I’m confident and very comfortable in my own skin, and that plus having good social skills has allowed me to enjoy a good dating/sex life but also great friendships with women, whether those friendships had “benefits“ or were completely platonic.

I like to lurk on this sub and on the purple pill sub, mostly because I find it interesting and entertaining to read some of the wacky stuff certain people write, and something I’m seeing a lot of is dudes blaming their lack of success with women on their height, as if being short condemns men to inceldom. 

So I wanted to say that it’s just not true, and that there’s  plenty of shorter guys like me out there who aren’t necessarily rich or with model-tier good looks that are successful with women. 

If you’re confident and you feel good about yourself, women who aren’t shallow or superficial generally won’t care unless you’re an actual midget Who said he was 6 foot tall on his tinder profile.

Of course my game is on point. I work out, I have a good posture, good social skills, I’m very good at reading body language and nonverbal cues, I make sure I look and smell good every time I walk out of my door and I’m very comfortable talking to people in general. 

But the main thing is, height isn’t some thing that gets in the way of me being successful with women.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rq8wwl/had_an_awesome_date_with_a_tall_girl/

89,rq9b9i,1640674032,Worried I’m Dating a Predator,"Hi everyone. I (18 M) have been getting to know a woman (19 soon to be 20.) Nothing serious yet, but we’ve gotten well acquainted since November. We’re semi long distance because she goes yo school two hours from me, but we decided something fun we could do “together” would be to watch a show in sync, an episode a day. She recommended an anime called “Devil Man Crybaby.” Literally within the first few seconds of the show, there are high school girls bending over and flashing their bare asses at the screen. It’s not established at all anywhere how old these characters are, but I’m assuming only 16 because that’s how old the protagonist is. I was mortified to see this. 

I asked her “how old are these characters?” out of concern, to which she responded “idk..16, 17?” Something I should have mentioned earlier is that she’s pansexual and comments on how how these characters are and talks about their anatomy and how much she likes it. When I tried to bring up that these characters are pretty young she just shrugged it off.

So my question is, am I vastly overthinking this? Or am I rightly concerned? I’m horrified that Netflix would green light a show like this in the first place, but I’m even more horrified at the idea that I may be getting involved with a bad person. This has been really weighing down on my and my anxiety and stress are definitely up. What should I do??",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rq9b9i/worried_im_dating_a_predator/

91,rq9fk0,1640674450,I'm just not much of a laugher.,"So I'm going to go ahead and call this an issue becuase it's been pointed out to me as such. I think things are funny but 95% of the time, something that should elicit a laugh does not make me laugh. 

It's become a bit of a problem in my dating life because there have been some instances were the person I'm on a date with is telling a joke or has a great sense of humor but I just won't laugh. Its not because they are not funny, its just I don't feel the urge to laugh.

If someone doesn't accept a second date, I usually ask for some feedback and more than once I've gotten something along the lines of ""You didn't laugh at anything I said so it didn't seem like it be a good match.""

Maybe this is a more deep-seated problem but it's been bugging me lately. I don't want to fake laugh either.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rq9fk0/im_just_not_much_of_a_laugher/
92,rq9ieb,1640674732,She kissed me…,I’ve been dating this girl for a few weeks and she mentioned to me on our last date (3rd date) that she wanted to kiss me but she wasn’t brave enough in the moment. Just today we had our 4th date and I planned  on  kissing her for sure on this date. The only thing was that she actually spoke out this time and said she wanted to kiss me. So thats when it happened. Now I feel like less of “a man” since I wasn’t the one who initiated it LMAO I know it sounds silly because the kiss was really good and not awkward at all. But I’m kicking myself for not taking the moment when I had it myself. I don’t really have a question I just needed to rant about it. I know the flood gates are open so I’ll feel more comfortable with being intimate with her.

93,rq9k5w,1640674878,Hello. I need advice.,"I (22F) was on my boyfriends phone and then he got a notification from an 18 year old girl on reddit (he’s 25) and it was a very long paragraph. I’ve went through the messages and they’ve been texting for over a year now and every single message is very long paragraphs, there’s been some sexual stuff mentioned (not towards each other, just talking experiences, porn, joking about sex and nsfw subs) and they seem to have deep conversations. He’s never told me about this girl. I saw a message where she even asked if what she was saying was too much for being underage and having a girlfriend and he said he was fine with it and she was not breaking any boundaries (i do have problem with it). And i saw him say he’s not comfortable discussing his mental issues with me. I also saw them discuss marriage and he said he doesn’t want to marry. Even though he told me he did? They seem to relate to each other well. Looking at some dates, they were texting each other on holidays while WE were together and I was trying to get his attention. Idk i’m so confused on what to do. I’ve posted this on other subs but I would like more opinions. I may be in denial.

TL;DR: My boyfriend regularly talks to an 18 year old and has been for over a year. Some of the convos they have make me uncomfortable and he’s never told me about her. Not sure what to do.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rq9k5w/hello_i_need_advice/
94,rq9m1g,1640675040,Am I just too boring to date?,"I’m a 20 year old guy I assume I’m average but one thing I feel is holding me back is I guess I’m considered “boring”. I’m not much into alcohol and smoking and my interest are playing basketball, watching movies, playing video games and cars. 

Unfortunately These interest don’t lead to meeting women at least in my case. I’ve tried dating apps and have gotten a few match’s but only 2 messages. I don’t feel like I can convey my personality with messages on a dating app and most girls I’ve meet in real life are mostly into parties and stuff like that. Do I just have to wait until my 30s for someone to settle for me because I’m a “safe” bet?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rq9m1g/am_i_just_too_boring_to_date/
95,rq9r5m,1640675548,No messages after a great day and then some…,"I (late 30s F) was set up with a guy (mid 30s M) by some mutual friends. We were both vetted by our friends so we felt comfortable meeting up halfway during a trip he made to my state after a few weeks and just 1 phone call. Though we spent only 20 hours together, we had a lot of fun and both agreed we wanted to continue talking/dating before parting ways. We did share a hotel room and unexpectedly (but also naturally) we were making out and he did get a bit handsy.

I never get intimate (kissing+) when I first meet someone but we had a good connection and I felt ok since he was a known person to people I am close to, but I did stop him being handsy and limit it to kissing.

We texted the next day after parting ways but since, he hasn’t messaged in 3 days. He did tell me his friend was meeting up with him while in town but I’m annoyed there’s not even a hello/contact. Considering I don’t get to the level of intimacy I did with him this quickly, I feel like an idiot and kind’ve like he was just having fun (whereas I take this stuff more seriously). To add to this, I paid for the hotel room online and we agreed to split it so idk how to ask him for his half when he hasn’t messaged at all.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rq9r5m/no_messages_after_a_great_day_and_then_some/
