3,ph3sem,1630670533,Do you think a lot of women just aren’t physically attracted to most of their partners?,"I’m just curious. I always hear that women focus more on emotional attraction than physical attraction and it’s made me curious.

Do most women genuinely find their partners physically attracted?

Most men have never received a complement. Most women typical desire sex less than men do. Most women don’t hook up with guys unless they are exceptionally physically attractive.

To me it’s seeming like women just don’t find their partners sexually attractive and they just fulfill the sexual part of relationships to keep the guy happy.

I only really started thinking of this because of what I see online how much seem to hate sleeping with their partners, also I had a friend who’s saving herself for marriage and has a boyfriend tell me that one of the guys in one of my classes is so hot she’d actually fuck him. So she hasn’t slept with her boyfriend but would with this super attractive guy.

One I didn't realize wasn't past her freewheeling days, but wanted to be. Super cool chick, and hot. I didn't care.

Anyway she got drunk one random Wednesday so I drove her home and (I don't think she knew she was saying this aloud) right when she seemed to be getting turned on and almost hitting on me she put her hands around her face and started murmuring, ""be a good noodle, be a /good noodle, BE A GOOD NOODLE, come on baby we're a good noodle"". The way she said that stuck with me, incredibly clearly. ""We're a good noodle"", especially.

It's the only time she's not hugged me goodbye. She ran straight inside. I later learned she had stopped her streak of one night stands two days earlier, and her drinking (heavily, anyway) the next day.

She just graduated technical school (first in her family to get beyond 7th grade) and showed me her contract to move (FINALLY, away from her horribly stuck family) to her dream city and start a real job.

Nothing against hooking up. It's done me real good, and many people. I just wish I could convey the sincerity of her drunken ""be a good noodle"" mantra. We all need more of that.

After I discovered reddit, I eventually came across many subreddits such as r/AsianMasculinity and r/aznidentity (dafuq are those subreddits). Even on normal subreddits, it is commonly stated that Asian guys are at the bottom at the racial hierarchy in dating and online dating studies I've seen as a kid. 

As for my personal experience, I've never encountered any of this in real life. In my age group, Asian guys aren't seen as unattractive to my knowledge. I never had any trouble getting a girl regardless of race but I'm pretty handsome so that might change things. Other Asian guys my age constantly date other girls of other races like white and Hispanic even if they look like nerds. The only Asian girls I've ever seen dating white guys are the older generation (like millennial/gen X) and they're all transplants.

But for about a week now it's been like the guy forgets I exist. Doesn't open or reply to anything until the middle of the night and even then it's usually a quick response and then he's gone again for another full day. No chance at all to talk about what we've been up to. Planning a second date has been bloody difficult too. I don't spam him either, I'll send like one or two in the morning and then not bother again until he eventually opens them.

The other night I upped and asked him if he genuinely still wanted to talk and meet up again, because this on and off shit is getting to me. He said yes, that he still wants to talk and get to know me more etc. He explains some distractions he's had lately and that he's terrible at replying when he's distracted. So I say it's ok and thanks for letting me know and we put that convo away.

However, he's still pulling this same behaviour, days after I said it frustrates me. 

(Shoot me if you really want to, I know I'm not a creep though) I was just curious and saw that Snapmaps shows when someone's online. And I've seen that he's online on and off all day, and my message goes unopened for the entire thing. So this just makes me doubt everything he's said about being busy.

I really like this guy, he's super cute, he was super kind and attentive when we met up the first time. I really do want to have this second date with him and get to know him.

16,ph5ms9,1630677300,Really down about this and trying to figure it out,"
Met a girl at my retail job about a year ago. Started talking to her and she started joining me on my breaks at work just about everyday we worked together. She immediately caught my interest as in my experience girls who are not interested do not go out of their way to talk to me or take breaks with me

Over the next 6 months i started to get to know her better in time we spent talking on our breaks. These talks would usually end up going 5-15 minutes over our scheduled break time once we got to know each other better. 

She started asking me more personal questions about my life, interests, and school. Alot more personal questions than ive ever had with any other co workers. She would ask about my family and follow up on the things I told her. 

She told me a lot about herself as well and always seemed excited to sit down and talk with me. She always wanted to know what I was up to on the weekends and told me she wanted to go to some museum once the pandemic was over. 

She even mensioned to me that she was single on valentines day and asked if i gad any plans. Then proceeded to randomly tell me that a few coworkers hit on her but she wasn’t interested. I changed the topic as i was un comfortable. 

 After about 6 months i finally got up the nerve to ask for her number. She gave it to me with no hesitation.  Texted her the next day and we texted back and forth about 6 times until i got distracted and didn’t get back to her until the next day. Texted her the next day and had to go to bed early and left the convo. 

The next day I texted her but got no response… thought i was ghosted but then texted her a day or two after and she texted back  I then asked her if she wanted to go out on a date to which she said she didn’t think she could because she had a brother with health issues and may me vulnerable to the pandemic. I thought this was her way of rejecting me. 

I told her i understood and I wouldn’t talk to her anymore. I understand how awkward it can be to be asked out and I didn’t want her to be un comfterbal. She said I didn’t need to do that as she really enjoyed our relationship. She told me to treat her the same and said a few other things that confirmed she understood I asked her out. 

Didn’t talk to her or hear from her until I saw her at work next. I tried to avoid her but that was impossible once she sat down with my on my break. We talked for an hour and the topic of that never came up. I didn’t know where I stood or how she felt about the whole thing. I decided i just needed to get over her

I texted her a few days later and asked her if it was ok if she could not talk to me at work because I needed to get over my feelings for her. I also told her I thought she was a cool person and was my friend, but I just needed some time but id like to remain friends. 

She told me that she was into someone else and I tried to convince her to shoot her shot because i thought we were just friends at this point. She agreed to being friends and I thought everything was fine until the next time i saw her she seemed very upset. 

It was not my intention to hurt her in any way, i just didn’t want her to feel uncomfterbal or anything like that. I texted her that afternoon and said it was ok if she wanted to talk to me at work again but i got no response

She seems to be aware and knows when people are hitting on her. She seemed used to it so idk why she wouldn’t just tell me she wasn’t interested. 

I went up and tried to apologize to her the next time i saw her but she wouldn’t even face me and said she just wanted to be vague. 

Today I was sitting in the break room alone minding my own business then she sat down across the room. My friend called me and after 30 seconds of talking to her on the phone, she gets up and hurries out of the break room. Just kinda weird.

TL;DR: met a girl and thought we clicked. Asked her out and she told me she couldnt at the time because of a vulnerable family member(before vaccines) and I assumed she was lying.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ph5ms9/really_down_about_this_and_trying_to_figure_it_out/

In June I met a cute brazilian girl(F29). We had a crazy chemistry, our talks were enthralling, sex was good an our outlook was super compatible! We had a lot of things in common, we were even born the same day! Everything was good BUT...she had to leave the country (Ireland) because to go to Croatia because of visa issues. She was very transparent about that as she gave me this information after our first date. 

At first, I thought it would only be a fling, something super casual. But date after date, our relationship became tender, more affectionate (hands holdings in public and kisses, long cuddles in the morning...etc). As you can imagine, I really started to develop feelings for her.

She was supposed to leave Ireland during my vacation but she decided to push back her departure so we could met one last time. During this last evening together, she told that we were a great match and that she want me to come and see her in Croatia. At first I thought she was joking, but just before I left, she told me that one more time. So...now I am supposed to meet her in Croatia next month 

So far so good, we are sending each other long texts and jokes! BUT...I don't know what we are. Are we in a relationship ? Are we exclusive ?  I don't know how to bring these topics. I want to ask her all these questions BUT a part of me is afraid of breaking this great friendship / relationship.

I've never met someone who was remotely close to my age who was single or unmarried. *Never.* It's my understanding that after 25 everyone is already married with kids. Finding someone who is both single and between the ages of 27 and 31 is going to be like finding a needle in a haystack. I'm picky about age because I was taught that even if you are legal adults that it is predatory if there is more than a 2 year age gap in either direction.

There's someone who has been heavily flirting with me and while I *do* find them very attractive and like them far more than I should ... this person is 23. It's morally wrong for a 29 year old man to be attracted to a 23 year old man. I really like him but I've told him he's too young for me. He is undeterred by my age surprisingly and as much as I'd love to reciprocate his advances....that is not morally okay. We seem similar in terms of maturity but a 29 year old even dating a 25 year old is sorta iffy. 

I look really young for my age so I mainly attract people in their early 20s (because that's about how old I look) and those people are single. But I turn them all down because, once again, age difference considered, dating someone younger than 25 would be morally wrong.

32,ph8a3x,1630685490,Did this girl lose physical attraction to me?,"Met a girl on a night a week ago. Although I had been drinking a little bit she didn't drink in front of me and did not appear drunk.

I approached her and her friend at a club and we ended up dancing, making out and having a good conversation, we were laughing asking questions etc. 

While we were dancing and making out, some random guy told us ""you look like such a cute couple"". For some reason she didn't like his presence so she told me ""let's move away from this guy he's annoying"" After this she asked if we should all go to another bar. I suggested this bar down the street and we all walked there. 

Side note: on the walk to the other bar I asked her a question about her ex that obviously turned her off (we had been casually talking about our exes at the first bar) as she actually didn't answer the question lol. After asking this question, in hindsight her interest seemed to drop very very slightly. She said one or two things that made me think she was pulling back so as we got to the 2nd bar I decided to take it easy. 

By the time we got to the second bar, I made a slight touch on her hip to see how she would react and she started grinding on me instantly and we started making out and holding hands again. I assumed she was still into me. 

I ended up walking her home which in hindsight she seemed impartial to and she gave me a good night kiss.

Anyway I texted her this week and she gave me a weak response and hasn't responded to my last text in a couple days about a date we talked about going on. 

Anyway I usually just take my L and keep it moving, especially with girls you meet on a night out BUT I was so attracted to this girl and we spent such a long time together that I feel like I can eventually recover if I try again.

36,ph8bqc,1630685630,Is it okay to initiate a breakup over text?,"My situation is somewhat weird because this is not officially a relationship but more like a somewhat committed (more than I have liked for a long time) friends with benefits thing. We have texted every day since meeting for 6 months and hang out very substantially. I absolutely don't want this person to think I see them as disposable. I am (and have been) unhappy with the relationship, and I know I should end it. It seems strange altogether to be ""breaking up"" when I would just call this person a friend, but it mirrors an official relationship in every meaningful way.

Anyway, I would ultimately like to break up by text personally because it's my preferred medium for communication, allows me to truly explain my thoughts without the constraints of speech, doesn't cause any kind of humiliation for either party, allows us both to deal with it on our own, doesn't make the other party think at first we are just hanging out when we break up, and makes it easy to have a clear dialogue.

But, I know most other people don't like text for discussion, see it as low-effort (definitely not for me), and could see it as me having fear of expressing this (of course I don't want to upset anyone? Should I feel bad for that?), so I don't want it to be like that.

I cannot meet in-person with this person for at least a few days, but I think I need to break up as soon as possible. I've already waited so long, and I don't want to lead this friend on.

So, is it a good option to initiate with a text such as ""I think we should break up. Do you want to talk about this either in-person or over the phone?"" and then meet up and have that conversation knowing what's going on. It sucks for them to meet like that, but I think it has more dignity than a surprise breakup when you are just hanging out and allows for them to decide how they want to approach this.

Sorry for the long post. I'd really appreciate advice.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ph8bqc/is_it_okay_to_initiate_a_breakup_over_text/

When she wants to talk to you she’ll make eye contact, she’ll be open, she’ll react as if she’s talking to someone and wants to continue the conversation.

If she’s closed off, turned away, is looking away from you, she probably doesn’t want to talk to you and is creeped out.

&gt; If you have to schedule the date or meet up more than twice, she’s not really interested.

If she wants to go on a date with you, she will. If she’s busy constantly and makes no effort to find a date she can see you, she doesn’t want you. Stop touching back with her to see when she wants to see you. I give her, 2 calendar dates. If she’s busy both and she doesn’t say when she’s free, I’m out.

&gt; If she doesn’t at least offer to pay she’s using you for a free meal.

It’s expected for you as a guy to pay, but to make herself look good a woman that wants you to like her will fake offer to pay for her half. 

If she doesn’t, she doesn’t care what you think of her because she doesn’t like you. Move on.

&gt; If you haven’t been physical by the fourth date, she’s not attracted to you sexually.

If by the fourth date you haven’t even made it to 2nd base she isn’t into you sexually. She might think you’re a good guy and is waiting for the sexual chemistry, but you’re not giving her sexual urges. It’s okay, this isn’t a deal breaker if you’re finej with waiting, but just be aware.

&gt; Lastly, mind her texting/calling habits. 

A game I like to play is that if I notice I’m starting all the conversations, I’ll stop. No messages, no calls, no anything. If after 48 hours I don’t receive a text or call from her, I drop her.

She broke up with me for a few things that had been happening consistently the last 2-3 months. I was disrespectful in some ways and said some rude things after a fight to a friend. Nothing too criminal and I apologized for those things, we all make mistakes. We ended things on pretty decent terms. Hugged it out and we went our separate ways. We've been broken up for just about 3 weeks now and for the first week I would text her and try to get her back every other day. She never freaked out on me but insisted on no contact. Pretty pathetic and I realized how stupid I looked. We agreed to no contact and have been doing well with that for 2 weeks.

In these 2 weeks I've spent time to process what went wrong, what needed to change, and how I can change myself individually. I have made lots of progress and have spent pretty much everyday wanting to be a better person not just for her, but for myself. I went on a date and realized that you know not being with her won't kill me, there are other people out there. After that, I was really able to focus on what I can do to make myself a better person for whoever is next. I can't say I've made perfect changes in 2 weeks, but I feel like her kicking me out the door was the wake up call I needed to be that person for her. At the end of the day, I still want her back unselfishly. I genuinely love this girl whole-heartedly. 

So next Friday we HAVE to meet up because my security deposit from my last apartment is being sent to her house (parents were in the middle of moving, friends also moving around). I also asked if I could have a few minutes of her time to talk to her and she said okay. I have spent a lot of time reconsidering this idea because 1: I'm not sure I should have been the person to reach out, maybe it should've been her. She broke up with me and initiated no contact. 2: I really want to be sure I'm willing to change my ways for good and that I am 100% ready before possibly hurting her again. I believe I'm ready, but I can't screw this up again.

Stop touching back with her to see when she wants to see you. I give her, 2 calendar dates. If she’s busy both and she doesn’t say when she’s free, I’m out.

&gt; If she doesn’t at least offer to pay she’s using you for a free meal.

It’s expected for you as a guy to pay, but to make herself look good a woman that wants you to like her will fake offer to pay for her half. 

If she doesn’t, she doesn’t care what you think of her because she doesn’t like you. Move on.

&gt; If you haven’t been physical by the fourth date, she’s not attracted to you sexually.

If by the fourth date you haven’t even made it to 2nd base she isn’t into you sexually. She might think you’re a good guy and is waiting for the sexual chemistry, but you’re not giving her sexual urges. It’s okay, this isn’t a deal breaker if you’re finej with waiting, but just be aware.

&gt; Lastly, mind her texting/calling habits. 

A game I like to play is that if I notice I’m starting all the conversations, I’ll stop. No messages, no calls, no anything. If after 48 hours I don’t receive a text or call from her, I drop her. She’s obviously not as interested in me if I am the one initiating the conversations.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/phaefj/guys_here_are_a_few_things_you_can_do_to_tell_if/

We been dating for about 8 months and at first it was great we would text for hours  and I'd spend the night once a week and it was great. but lately we haven't really been texting and when he does the replys are pretty much the next day. and even now we haven't been together in person for two months and Im just feeling sort of neglected.
 I've been asking him at least two times a week when can I see you, or do you want to hang out and he says he can't because he is working and doesn't have off.
I really want to make this relationship work but I feel like if he isn't going to let us spend any time together then what's the point and that makes me sad.

80,phbymv,1630696976,How to overcome fear of social rejection,"I (M24) posted on Reddit a few weeks ago, where I asked why I self reject before approaching or doing anything with women, a friendly Redditor recommended I do some deep introspection / counselling. Thankfully I did both and have *almost* pinpointed what my fear exactly is: social rejection.

I know this is a common fear but for backstory I immigrated to the UK when I was 6 (from India) to a really racist part of the country. So social rejection was an actual tangible threat to my quality of living. And as any Indian knows, the famous saying “log kya kahenge” (What Will people think) is deeply engrained in our culture. This did have some positives as learning to be flexible, adaptive, and naturally funny / charismatic, but the fear of social rejection was still there. Fast forward to two years ago when I moved to the US for grad school, that fear came full force. It’s a lot better than it was now that I have friends, but approaching women is still a hurdle.

Has anyone been in this situation, or has thoughts on how to overcome it? I’ve been working on my health and grooming so I like to think I’m attractive. I can talk to girls no issue as friends, or flirt when we have mutual friends. But approaching a stranger is still an issue, due to this fear. 

TLDR; after deep introspection, realised that I have a fear of social rejection which stems from immigrating as a child. Any advice on how to overcome this?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/phbymv/how_to_overcome_fear_of_social_rejection/

82,phca38,1630697992,Help desperately needed to improve my (32M) dating life.,"There is a very long back story, but it is needed to know the necessary context in order for me to get advice that I could potentially use, so please bear with me and read on. 

Throughout my entire adult life (32M), I've always thought I could overcome anything with my own ingenuity and creativity, and I thought the same regarding the dating arena. Now, I think it's time for me to drop my ego and finally ask for help as my last resort. So bear me out and hopefully some of you might have some helpful advice.

I've always been a man of a few words when meeting someone new, and I have always been a shy person. I do always put myself in situations that force me to talk to people to get me used to the idea of socializing, and generally I find people that naturally click with me. My hint for that is that with these people, instead of being quiet, I just find it at ease to have a conversation with them. With the majority of people though, I rarely find it easy to add to a conversation and rather stay quiet.

When it comes to meeting potential people to date, I always find it impossible to ask them out or even hint at it mainly because when they talk to me, after 14 years of living my adult life, now I naturally assume that they are just being friendly and nice, and for the life of me, I can't bring myself to even flirt with them to start that deeper rapport that I am looking for.

I do have some history, but not that much to begin with. My first gf was a LDR from across the country and I even visited her maybe a few months after I was done with high school (2007). I will call her Jazming. Unfortunately, Jazmin  broke up with me before my trip, so I guess my trip was just to try to salvage the relationship. She had already made up her mind though, so my trip turned out to be just that, a trip to visit a new state lol. It took me a year to get over her, so I guess I had become pretty attached to her. I guess I tend to fall hard for people.

Fast forward a few years, and my next experience was a girl whom I met through another friend. I will call this girl Brooke. I genuinely do not remember how I did it, but I somehow let her know I wanted her and she became receptive about it, and eventually we hung out together at a gathering that our common friend was hosting, and we fooled around on a pool table that was there after the party was over and everyone was gone. A few days later at another party, Brooke had invited her baby daddy over (they weren't together anymore at that point in time nor when I first met her), and I spotted that they were fooling around at that gathering. When I realized what was happening, I backed off and for my own sanity decided to stop most communication with Brooke (I guess I was beginning to get attached to her).

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Before I continue, I must say that after what I wrote so far, I am realizing I tend to get attached pretty easily. If I am still that way, I want to improve this trait of mine and get better. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;

After this second experience, I had problems approaching women for fear of rejection. Not necessarily to talk to them especially if we naturally click, but simply when it comes to start the courting and flirting process. Nevertheless, in 2018 when I was finishing my undergrad studies, I somehow reconnected with Brooke once again. Luckily, I was living on my own with a roommate, so I guess I felt confident about it, and in a few weeks, I ended up at her house, we had sex, and then I brought her over to my place a couple of months later, where we had sex again. Now mind you, there was never a relationship. It was simply a friends with benefits type of deal. This time though, after we did what we did, I didn't really feel attached to her as I did before, but I had grown quite fond of her. Eventually within the year, Brooke secluded herself due to some health issues that she has been dealing with, and our communication between us slowly ceased to exist. I do let her be and don't communicate with her, but maybe once or twice a year I send her a text to ask how she is doing and to remind her that I am there for her if she ever needs anything and usually she responds, but the communication withers away within the week.

So throughout my entire adult life, my experience feels relatively little from my POV. I want to do whatever it is that attracted Brooke to me so that I can attract other potential dates to my life, but for the life of me I just don't remember how I did that. I want to end my dating drought. Being single is great because I have learned to be happy and productive without having someone by my side, but here and there, it does get to me being single for most of my adult life.

A couple of months ago, one interaction with a really cute ashier at a grocery store while I was working on some Instacart deliveries made me realize I need to learn to catch on cues from possible dating potentials. The cashier was ringing up my items, and one of the items was a bottle of cold coffee. She began to ask me if I like coffee, I said yes, but that the item wasn't mine. She then proceeded to tell me she likes her coffee very sweet. I replied saying I liked mine a bit bitter. I didn't think of anything of that interaction except that she was being nice and friendly with me and that was it. 30 minutes later while I was already driving to deliver the order to my customer, I realized I had a chance to ask the cashier out to a coffee date 😐 I tried going back to that grocery store again a few times some days later by choosing Instacart orders that needed to be fulfilled at that store, but I never spotted that cashier again...a missed opportunity...😞

Edit: I no longer have my own place. I needed to move back with my family at the end of 2018 and have been living with them since then until further notice. In the meantime, my parents are very conservative and frown upon me bringing girls over to sleep with me. It feels like that sets me back a few steps in the dating world considering my age, and so I don't got that going for me for the time being.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/phca38/help_desperately_needed_to_improve_my_32m_dating/

We talked a little bit, but didnt really know each other that well. I always thought she was attractive but never really made moves on her as we moved in different circles (she was a popular girl, I was more of a nerd that hung out w my own crowd)

Now we go to the same Uni by chance, and we are both currently juniors (after 18 months of online school due to pandemic). We were actually in the same dorm freshman year, but again, hung out in different circles (popular vs loner, same dynamics)

Current context:

I've always had a crush on her, and I made it up in my mind that I was going to ask her out in some way shape or form when I saw her again. Unfortunately that never really happened as I never got the chance to (saw her once while passing the stairs in a super crowded place where everybody is trying to get to their classes).

So i decided to DM her out of nowhere on instagram (messaged on Thursday afternoon), and sent her a generic text going ""hey we should catch up sometime and grab some coffee!""

She took around a full 24 hours to reply back, but did accept my invitation and asked if I was free on X day at X time and to let her know if i was

NOW THE QUESTION:

Does she just see me as being friendly/wanting to be friends/just wanting to catch up?

I felt like the way I phrased it could have been taken that way, but like I Dmed her out of nowhere so I thought that it might have subtle undertones of potential romantic interest as well.

I'm really questioning it as I really like this girl, but dont want to make a fool of myself by confessing my feelings or doing something stupid when she just thinks its some friendly get together.

On one hand, I think its pretty obvious that she knows im into her, and her actually setting up a time is like an indication she does want to meet

On the other hand, she took like 24+ hours to respond, and if she was actually interested in me romantically wouldnt it be sooner?

So I’ve been lowering my standards to the point that I understand that pretty much any girl I met naturally would be out of my league. I could really benefit from something like Tinder but it’s all girls that are in my league.

It’s probably my best chance of finding love.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/phdvrb/are_there_any_dating_appssitesevents_made/

97,phe57m,1630704053,What can make a bald dude attractive to women?,"As a rapidly balding teen myself ( M18 )…

( yeah, it sucks so bad )

… i was asking myself: what can a bald guy do/have to be more attractive to girls. It’s not about confidence… cause we all know looks matter. And tons of girls made me realize this lately, unluckily.

So, I guess i won’t ask girls, but women.

I don’t believe in god. Grew up devote catholic. Psychology graduate.

So I need advise.

I’m 30 years old, and finally find a decent guy. Someone that has qualities I admire and want to be around.

We’ve hung out a couple times and had wonderful conversation, sex and I felt a connection. 

He mentioned he only wanted a FWB because it’s “complicated,” and the complication is his relationship with god and the Bible.

He stated after having sex he would want to discontinue the sexual side of it because his “temptation” is not the way god intended him to be. 

It’s very frustrating growing up catholic and albeit I have to separate myself from
My experience and I don’t get it. He wants to have a normal life with a girl but then I propositioned him the question wouldn’t that be a sin too living a lie too? 

I’m more frustrated the fact that the perceivable agony he is going through between meeting someone he enjoys too and having to assume he’s going to hell for it.

He basically told me he doesn’t want to see me anymore because he knows he will be tempted and it’s nothing with me. I get it but I’m devastated because I truly liked him and I know I’d be good for him although god ultimately will win.

Yesterday 9/2 we spent the majority of the day consoling him that he’s not going to help. I tried to state to him the numerous ways the because he can’t change his brain size or chemistry I don’t think an all loving god would send him to hell say over someone who murder  people. He mentioned he would abusing gods system by dating me or having a husband with me. 

I got him to understand the lilkihood of his dichotomies of who goes to hell for what insighting problematic ideations in Leviticus.

I genuinely like him ad he likes me … or is trying to.

I shared with him other responses from asking other subreddits and he said people need to understand his perspective too…
