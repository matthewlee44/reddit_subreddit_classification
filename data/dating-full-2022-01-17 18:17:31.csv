I mean i probably had chances , when i was in high school i had lot of female friends and schoolmates but I feel like nobody really liked me back in the days
the problem is that my lifestyle wasnt really healthy (playing a lot of videogames and didn't go out that much)
2 years ago i started to workout and now im feeling a lot better with my body and appearance ,i improved a lot but im still being unlucky i suppose
my job doesnt help me knowing some girls and my interests are mainly videogames,gym and cars so its very rare that i meet new person through them...
ive been obsessed with the fact that i would just try with online apps but so far ive only went out with 4 or 5 girls in like 4 years of apps , somehow i still dont get likes (must be for bad pictures) so im getting even more depressed..
last year i felt good for the first time because a girl I went out with ended kissing me and she was so much in love with me, I SADLY WASNT 😅🥺
TLDR : i feel old,bored and i feel like flipping coins everyday with apps, even a friend with benefit would save me , im still virgin so im looking into sex a lot

Before this run at the swipes and putting myself out there I was an active alcoholic. So not only have I been single for 8 years I also haven't had much dating experience past the age of 24. I've now been sober for 2 years and after working on myself mentally and physically I figured I was ready for a serious attempt at finding a partner. I've had the usual matches, shallow convos, ghostings, and robots. I've also had a few very nice adult dates where conversations flowed and there was a mutual respect.

Enter Sam(not her real name). We matched on bumble two weeks before Christmas. She pointed out a band I liked and we hit it off well from there. I find out that day while we are chatting that she is in another state for the holidays to visit family. No, biggy, I can wait to meet a person. Over the next two weeks after matching our conversation grows deeper. Sharing music we like, sharing hopes and dreams and I shared my intentions with dating after I saw she changed her profile from ""something casual"" to ""don't know yet."" I felt a connection with Sam and it seemed reciprocated. 

Then her car broke down and she needed it repaired. She took it to a family member and while fixing the vehicle discovered that they were exposed to Covid by a cousin. So, she decides the best course of action is to fly back to the state we live in and quarantine until a neg test. As a side note, I will say I thought this was irresponsible but I understand not wanting to pay for a hotel for more than a week on a students budget and staying with family wasn't an option.

When she is back in town I offer to make her a care package or grab groceries as I have offered to any other friend who has been through Covid/quarantine. When I drop it off we wave to each other through the window and my heart sinks. She looks nothing like her photos. I felt misled. I take time that evening to decide that I am going to continue with this because our seemingly strong connection through words typed and talked could outweigh physical appearances. I will say I'm a handsome guy with a goofy flair who gets compliments. Her profile was angled face photos and one old(I know now) full body picture. I should have paid more attention to that, I know. I guess I will also have to get over my dislike of video chatting so I can avoid similar situations in the future. 

After she tested negative we went on a date that was really fun. Good conversation, good food. we went back to her place to use the hot tub and she had intentions of me staying the night. While I really like this girl I also couldn't get over my lack of attraction to her. We stay up until 2am talking until I find reason to leave and I could tell this was not what she wanted. Since then our conversation has been blunt and shallow. Now I know I'm not without fault in this situation. I pursued this with vigor and skipped a few common steps to dating. We both did. 

So now the question of advice. Do I just send a text saying I don't think we should see each other? Or do I need to explain myself in depth while trying to find a way to say you misled me without hurting feelings?

TLDR: Chatted with a girl for a month before seeing her in person. She's not what her profile looks like. I try getting over lack of physical attraction only to realize I can't.

In 2011 I (M 30) studied together with a girl that I had a huge crush on. We haven't talked to each other in like 9 years. I added her to Instagram a few months ago and yesterday I talked to her.

&amp;#x200B;

This is how it went:

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Hi Susan (F 28) (not the real name)! What were you doing? Do you feel studying psychology changed you as a person?

(left me on read)

(1 hour later)

Me: I wanted to tell you that, when we studied together long ago, I really liked you. I don't think I ever liked a woman that much. I remember we used to text a lot a you told me a lot about your job at (company). I wanted you to know that.

&amp;#x200B;

She: Hi! I was packing because tomorrow I'm going on a trip for 2 weeks with some friends. I saw what you wrote but I was planning to reply later when I'm not busy.

Me: lol, I rushed. That was my last shot.

She: I'm very surprised about what you said! We haven't talked for so long. I hope you're fine. I sincerely don't remember that we talked a lot, but I do remember you were a good friend and a good person. Sincerely so much time has passed and I don't remember much about that time of my life. I finished my course of studies (proceeds to tell me about her present).

But I can't talk much now because tomorrow I'm going on vacation with some friends. I have a flight to take early tomorrow. I hope you're fine and your things are fine!

&amp;#x200B;

Me: I remember a lot about you, although time can make you forget things. I remember that you told me about (some personal stuff). I was very sensitive at that time and had a huge crush on you. I really liked you.

I would like to have a coffee with you some day. It would mean a lot to mean, because you are the woman that I liked the most in my life. At that time I imagined that I would confess my feelings to you when I turned 80 as something pending, but I decided I didn't want to wait so long.

(Today she left what I just wrote above on read. She then uploads a story on Instagram where she's in the airport with her friends about to board the plane)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

How do you think it went? What do you think I should do next?

I didn't really expect her to reply so I said what I said without thinking. Honesty is appreciated.

After a while she started insisting that she will come and drop me to which my response remained unchanged. 

I reached home and she visibly looked upset when I left so I got home and called and asked her what's the problem. She said that she felt that I'm making her decision for her and that she doesn't like it. In all honesty, I never for a second thought of making her decision for her. I explained her that I didn't do anything of that sort intentionally and that she's making a big deal out of nothing. She still carried on and even said something on the lines of that we'll have serious problems if this ever happens again. It sounded like a threat to be honest and that pissed me off. I didn't say much but she continued being stuck up on that one thing. I didn't want to contribute anymore to this so I didn't reply to her much and left her to her own. I talked to her in the night and we had plans to meet and hang out at her place the next day and as soon as I was about to go to bed she asked for the day to herself. I respected that but I had something there that I didn't pick up when I was sick so I asked her if I could pick it up from there. She started saying things like this always happens when I ask for a day to myself. I told her she shouldn't have cancelled at the last minute and that I'd leave as soon I pick them up but if she doesn't want it, I won't. She went on a rant about me not giving her space and being selfish and what not. She even went and said that I ruined her day and I even apologised if I said anything that could've pricked her in any sort of fashion. She didn't respond the entire day and at the end of the day I told her that I don't like when she does this silent treatment stuff and on that she blasted me again with all her space and me being selfish and all that stuff. 

We hang out like 2 times a week at most and on one day we both work so don't get enough time to talk properly. We mainly communicate on texts.

How would you feel if your SO had a close friend of the opposite gender who they were friends with for about ten years. The friend was interested and they even slept together about a year or two PRIOR to meeting you but the relationship didn't progress beyond friendship because your wasn't interested in them like that. However, that friend still had feelings for your SO but your SO met you and wanted to be with you. 

For me, it depends on the circumstances:

If the girl who liked him did nothing to interfere in my relationship and my hypothetical bf didn't give me any reason to believe that he liked her or preferred her company over mine, I would be fine with it and let continue being friend. After all, if my bf never took the friendship to the next level when he had a chance to then that should be strong indicator that I have nothing to worry about. Friendship is so important and I hate to come between that. In fact, I would probably reach out to the girl to try and comfort her since I know how badly it can hurt to see someone you love fall in love with someone else. I probably even try to help her find someone else of she would let me.

But at the same time, if the girl was actively coming on to my bf and going out of her way to sabotage what I have with him, then I would hope my bf would end the friendship. Because if he just put up with her crap and made no effort to assert boundaries or cut her off then I would question if I have a future with him. And I would have a few things to say to the girl too.

I'm just not a super jealous person and I believe that if a person truly loves then they'll make you feel secure in their love that you wouldn't have worry about them leaving you for an old hookup that didn't go anywhere to begin with. 

My friends looked at me like I had six heads and said that I only feel this due to my romantic inexperience (i.e. five first dates and 1 six months relationships) and that I'll feel differently when I get more relationship experience.

This was the third time we broke up and it was about the same reason. The only difference this time is that he is very adamant that we aren’t getting back together, and this is also the longest we’ve been broken up for. His reason for breaking up is that he wants to focus on himself, as he feels like he won’t be able to really do everything that he wants because of the relationship. I understand since this is both our first relationship and we lost ourselves as individuals. Even though we’ve talked about how we need to give each other more space so we can focus on our own things, it never works since one of us always ends up missing the other. We’re both juniors in high school, we have a lot of priorities such as leadership positions, college classes, extra curriculums, joining programs, preparing for standardized test, and simply high school. When we broke up i begged him to change his mind, but after a while on the phone i realized that it is the right decision. Taking this time apart would help both of us be able to focus on what we need to do and work on ourselves as individuals that way we could be the best version of ourselves. We see each other everyday since we go to the same school and we’re also officers in our school council. We still talk in person, but stopped talking on the phone. I would still text him goodnight and i love you even though he wouldn’t say it back. But i stopped four days ago since i thought it would be best to no longer contact him digitally even though it hurts not being able to talk to him as much as we used to.

Last night he called me on facetime, this was the third day after i stopped texting him. I was surprised that he called since to me it seems like he’s fine and he’s going on with life without me. The call started off good, he said he wanted to check up on how i’m doing. We talked about what we did this weekend, anime, and a program that we are both interested in. Then he says that he wanted to go eat at a Korean barbecue place that we always went to. I asked him if he wanted to go and that we could go but as friends. At first it sounded like we were going to go, but he quickly said he can’t because he would be going against his word. I told him how it wouldn’t since we’re just going out as friends and nothing would happen. We kept going back and forth about this. I kept saying we could go as friends and nothing would happen, but he said no something would happen and it’s hard to just act like friends. At this point i told him that it’s okay if he doesn’t want to go, i don’t want to beg him to hang out with me. I told him that even though i want to hang out with him and call him, i have to force myself not to even if it’s just as friends because i don’t want to bother him and i want to give him the space he wanted. He told me that this conversation is making him miss me more and that he wants to end the call because it’s making his head hurt. I told him okay and that i’m sorry that this conversation happened when he only just wanted to check up on me. I told him that i’m always here for him and that he can alway talk to me, whether it because he needs to talk to someone, he wants a friend, or he needs company, and he said he that knows. Before we ended the call I said “you don’t have to say it back, goodnight, i love you” and he said just said goodnight.

I feel like i did something wrong and that i annoyed him for talking about that whole thing. It’s like he just wants me to move on with my life and that it’s so easy. He knows that i’m willing to wait for him and i have hope that we’d get back together even if it takes a long time.

And I think it's a combination of my personality, and just the fact that I don't really feel romantically attracted towards anyone. Not to say I don't find women attractive, but every conversation I've been in I've almost never have been able to figure out the difference between me having a simple conversation or me flirting. It's something I've always had trouble with, and at this point... I just don't know if I should even continue trying or just accept the fact I might wind up being alone for the rest of my life.

I hate to say it, but I've kind of gotten used to being alone after all these years. Comfortable with it even. For awhile, I've had friends who's company I've treasured more than any personal intimate relationship I've had with a woman, and I've had this theory that maybe I don't necessarily need to have a romantic partner so much as I need a companion who knows me well enough to perhaps not see me as partner material but not a complete hopeless loner neither.

I can't say that I completely like or am comfortable with that theory, but I can't say it's not inaccurate to what I've been dealing with so far in my life. And that maybe it may be the closest and only thing I have to having a partner in the near future. 

The thing is... I still kind of want to try having a romantic partner. I'm 28 soon to be 29 in a few weeks, and so far haven't had a girlfriend since I was 15. Either because most women in school were skanks, or because no one ever clicked with me. I'm not going to say I'm handsome. I'm decent enough, but I can't say I radiate masculine attraction or any standard of attraction really. I'm decent enough. 6 at least. 7 at best. But I think my confidence has decreased over the years since I started becoming social. I've had a passion for material things mostly, and don't have much interesting hobbies that people would gravitate towards and find reason to stick around with me. I don't think anyone I've tried talking to has ever really seen me as much of a potential partner so much as a friend and sometimes... That's just not enough for me. And I don't know if I should be mad, or just accept it and just never talk to them again. I've had friends whom I've been romantically interested in the past, and still hang out with them despite those ships sailing. But the thought always linger that maybe they might change their mind and give it a shot. It's a delusion, I know. What's done is done, and I can't change anything. And if I try, it will destroy the relationship I've tried to keep afloat. I don't know. I feel I'm ranting now.

I guess my point is... I'm lonely. And I guess it's fine but at the same time, I wish I wasn't sometimes. Maybe time will tell whether things change but not likely given my luck and location.

Quick question though. Have people had any change at all with finding dates in other states? I live in the east coast US, and another reason I think may have had no luck is just location.

And tbh I’d say a lot of it is cuz of my own doing. I have pretty bad anxiety in general. For example, while most people are excited before going to a fun event (like a house party or festival), I spend the days leading up to it in a state of constant panic, and having thoughts like, “What if there’s a mass shooting? What if I get in a car accident and die? What if I suddenly drop dead and my family isn’t around and I die alone at that event? What if I get trafficked?” Etc. Like those “concerns” literally take up my headspace for *hours* at a time, and I end up feeling perpetually sad/irritable/anxious/upset. 

And this type of mindset makes dating really hard for me in general, cuz there’s the added component of meeting with a *stranger* for the purpose of exploring one of the most vulnerable aspects of human existence (aka romance). 😰😰😰 So you can imagine the types of thoughts that go thru my head in the days leading up to dates. This has caused me to ghost guys during my earlier 20s after perfectly fine dates (which I feel awful about cuz they legit did nothing wrong…it literally always came down to me being too anxious). Or to drop/stop responding to dating app conversations with perfectly fine men…especially when they seem interested in setting up a date with me. 

When it comes to dating, I think outside of the catastrophic concerns my mind conjures up before leaving my house in general, I also end up with the added thoughts of, “What if he thinks I’m ugly? What if we marry then he leaves me? What if I spend the next few years with him then I end up 30 and single??” So I just end up feeling more comfortable not…pursuing romance at all.

I've been seeing this guy for about a month and we decide to have out first overnight last night. BTW I had made it clear prior I am not ready to go the way yet, but that is not really what this is about. 

Well we're going to bed, and things get hot and heavy. I tell him again, just to be clear, I don't want to go all the way, but we can do other stuff and he says hes aware, no problem, but he just wants to make me feel good. I'm all like, ""sounds good to me."" He goes down on me for like 30 seconds and then we go back to second base. He's fingering me and rubbing me and I'm really enjoying it (and I'm making that known) I'm also touching him as well. This goes on a for a few minutes. And then he just stops and turns over. I just look at him, confused, and he's like, ""do you feel good now?"" and I'm like, ""um, well, I would feel better if you went longer... I thought you wanted to make me cum."" And he says ""no, that takes too long. I'm worn out."" And we just go to sleep. No cuddling because he can't fall asleep while cuddling (disappointing for me, but I understand that some people are like that).  The whole experience was just very disappointing, honestly. 

That action/comment of his kind of rubbed me the wrong way (no pun intended), because my first thought is that he's the kind of guy that doesn't care about his partner's pleasure. Like a just wet her up enough to slide it in kind of types. And I don't really even have problems getting to orgasm with a partner doing it.  I think I'm pretty typical. Once they know how I like it, it usually doesn't take but a few minutes. But I've had boyfriends that would finger me for as long as it took. It would have been one thing if he had said ""this is taking too long,"" but instead, he said ""that takes too long,"" which I interpret as, ""I never make women cum because it takes too long."" Which makes me feel really turned off. But part of me is wondering if he thinks this way because he's had trouble with past partners and he feels like there is no point, or something. I also get that things can be awkward when you get intimate with someone new.

with an old tinder match at 2am who goes to her for
relationship advice for a girl he's interested in. I
confronted her and told her that I didn't exactly like what
she did and that it was really sus. I told her that she can
have guy friends and that it's fine but to see another guy
at 2am like that is just weird..
.. Bottom line I made myself
quite clear. Either way she talks about it with her friends
and calls me an hour later and goes on about how a
relationship should be about trust and how she trusts me
but was upset that I didn't trust her that I thought she
cheated on me that night. She told me that her friend
knows about our relationship and that the moment she
got in his car that she told him ""I have a boyfriend"" She
later on said there should be boundaries:
1. we should be able to hang out with whoever/whenever

2. we should tell one another things... but not everything

She never fails to make me laugh, can be an incredibly thoughtful person, and I've had some of my happiest moments with her. At our best, I feel like she's my absolute best friend and that we get each other better than anyone else. Other times, it's not like that at all. While we are extremely similar in our interests, energy, and humor, there are recurring ""issues"" that pop-up that I have a hard time knowing how to approach.

One of the more recent issues would be what she deems ""being considerate"". I can admittedly be an airhead, which I am trying to work on. Even so, I feel that I always pay attention to her needs and give her the love and respect that she deserves. There are a select few things that she has discussed in the past though that she highlights as ""inconsiderate"" acts by me. On one occasion early on in the relationship, I borrowed a cup from her place to drink coffee, and left it in the sink. She was upset for most of the day because she wanted me to ask if I could borrow the cup prior to taking it, and to make sure it was fully clean afterwards. I understood that and have made sure to respect her property since. After this happened, she stated that she thinks I'm less considerate than her and that it isn't something I can change about myself. On another occasion months back, I had apparently left pee on her seat after using the toilet, so I have always wiped the seat afterwards to make an effort to clean up after myself. One other point of contention was that I had left the lights on in her room (admittedly I am bad at this since I grew up without this being an issue). I try to always be conscious of this now. The other day though, she needed a favor from me that required me to go to her flat while she was out. I was in a bit of a rush and mistakenly left the lights on. Fast forward to the next day and I've hardly heard from her all day. She then comes to my place and is crying because I left the lights on. She says this is an example that I am not a considerate person, or at least not as equally considerate as she is. She seems highly fixated on this being a glaring compatibility issue. I did apologize, but to be honest, I'm quite flabbergasted that it only takes me making a human mistake like leaving the lights on (for the first time in months), for her to get upset and start crying that we aren't compatible in this respect. It just isn't something that I understand and I feel like it was a bit of a red flag for me.

Another issue is that I often feel like I am walking on eggshells with her. Often, I feel like my actions are under a microscope, and that she is constantly looking for things about me or my living space that are wrong or deserving of criticism. She gives the impression that she thinks that she always knows what's best, and that she has to ""teach"" me how to improve myself and my space. It started off as her jokingly ""bullying"" me, which I thought was part of her humor. But sometimes the way she looks at me makes me feel like she resents me. She'll give a look that says that she is fully annoyed and embarrassed by me. I've brought up how her tendency to make me feel stupid hurts me, and she said that this was ""typical her"" and that my feelings are valid, however she never really gave the impression that she was willing to work on this though. She later told me though that she doesn't want u

One other challenging thing is that she really does not have any friends or hobbies to fill her time. While she says that she is independent and good on her own, she wants me to be around her all the time. She can feel very clingy in this way. This usually isn't an issue because I think we get on really well 90% of the time. That being said, If I miss a call from her, she'll call back 5 times in a row and be bothered that I wasn't there to answer the first time. Once she was busy at work late at night and she ended up calling me at midnight. She knew I was busy with friends and had been drinking that night, but still told me the next day that she was disappointed that I hadn't answered and came to sleep next to her that night. Another night, I had been hanging out with friends till 1AM and she asked that I come by to sleep next to her afterwards. My car was running on fumes and the nearest gas station wasn't operating when I arrived. I told her that I couldn't get the gas needed to head over. The next day, she said that she would have ordered an Uber if she was me and that it bothered her that I didn't go to her by any means necessary. This was after spending my entire day with her up until 7PM. 

In short, I feel pressured with the impossible task to change myself into the ""perfect"" person according to her. If I do everything right but make a seemingly novel mistake on the rare occasion, I'm suddenly on her shit list. This hold/cold attitude by her is starting to be difficult to manage. I feel pressured to sacrifice my time outside of her and I feel pressured to never make a mistake as simple as forgetting to turn off the lights for fear of her crying and saying that I am an inconsiderate person. I want her to mature and understand that these sorts of reactions aren't normal and that she should be able to make friendly reminders without classifying me as an inconsiderate person, especially after I had *just* done a favor for her in the process. I just want to feel appreciated for who I am like I try to do for her.

She mentioned being on her period last weekend so when we met I gave her a small care package with chocolate since she had mentioned weeks ago that chocolate helped. She was touched.

Anyway, we both agreed that we would keep things casual (I will be moving to a different country in 6 months). We talked about sex and she said that she's been in an abusive relationship and it will take her time to be fully open with physical touch so I assured her that that was not a deal breaker and that I enjoy spending time with her way even though I am attracted to her (I told her that). Whenever we talk she says she enjoys being around me but keeps asking if I'm ""very kind or a psychopath"" or if I'm just ""too nice or a serial killer"" which you know is fine as a joke.

I recently had sex for the first time at the age of 41.

God, isn’t that a crazy sentence? I mean, I’m literally a Hollywood punchline! I certainly never expected my love life to turn out as it has. As a teen and young adult, I dreamed of meeting Mr. Right and having a family and all that jazz, same as most women. But my life just unfolded differently.

No, I’m not a religious zealot or a mental case. I have a master’s degree and a good job and a pretty normal life. I’m no supermodel but I’m at least average-attractive. And my friends would describe me as sweet, caring and good-natured. But I’m also very introverted; it’s never been easy for me to socialize and meet people, and I have few really close friends. On top of that, I’m gifted-level smart, a little quirky as a result of having ADD, and I have a deep passion for all things nature. I’m just a bit unconventional – and it has not been easy to find someone who could truly understand and appreciate all of that! I’ve dated a few guys over the years, but the relationships have always been casual and short-lived. There have been times when I was profoundly lonely, doubting my own worth, and wondered if I ever would find love.

It took me 20+ years of my adult life, a nature-related FB group, and a chance real-world meeting with a fellow member to finally do so. Amazingly, my lover felt a connection with me -- with my intelligence and passion and kindness in my interactions with others in the group -- before we ever met! He even tried to get my attention, in some small ways, but I was oblivious (something we joke about now). But after that chance meeting, we began conversing on Messenger, and I felt the same strong spark of connection almost immediately. The relationship blossomed rapidly from there.

He is the first person I truly WANTED to have sex with, the first person I had felt that level of attraction, connection, trust and comfort with. As we grew closer, and it was clear we both wanted intimacy, I felt he deserved the truth and I told him. After a moment of surprised silence, he smiled and looked at me with a sort of wonder, and told me he considered my trust and honesty to be a gift – a far greater one than my physical virginity. We made love for the first time a few days later, on New Year’s Eve. I never felt awkward or uncomfortable even for an instant; it was one of the best nights of my life.

I wanted to write this for a couple of reasons. One, I wanted to remind people that it’s okay to be single longer than normal, okay to wait until you’re truly sure. No one’s relationship path is the same; there is no right formula or set timeline. When the right person comes along, and when you are truly ready, you’ll know. Don’t let anyone or anything pressure you; that can only lead to regrets.

Two, this is for the folks like me – the folks who are different in some way, who haven’t had much luck with relationships, who are struggling with loneliness and doubts and insecurities. Don’t give up! Live your life, find outlets for your passions (you just might meet someone that way), and trust that the right person will come along sooner or later.

Then it turned out he had plans for all his summer break and was travelling like non-stop so he didn't have time to meet me. He still texted me a lot, almost every day, but never asked me on a date. I called him out on it, saying I can't do this if he doesn't have time to meet me and texting isn't good enough for me.

So I said okay then text me when you're in town and available, and in my head I let it go, knowing he won't text me.

And he didn't. For 4 months. Then one day in October, he texted me at 3.30 in the morning ""So when will we meet?"" with that eye rolling emoji. I saw it because I was out with my friends but by the time I woke up he had deleted the message. I didn't say anything because I assumed it was embarrassing enough for him as he was probably drunk.

Then fast forward to New Years Eve he started texting me again, reacting to my insta stories and wishing me a happy new year and asking about my ski trip. I was very confused. My responses were kind but kinda short and I didn't really ask about him. Then he texted me at 3.30 again.

I matched with someone on tinder and conversation is going pretty good; however, I’m 25 (F) and he’s 35. I know it’s not odd for people to date out of their age range but I guess I’m nervous of the idea. When I was in high school he was a very prominent figure in our community.. volunteering very involved, so I guess it’s weird being on the other side now being older. I just graduated almost two years ago now and I feel like we’re in different places in our lives. 

Of course it’s still very early on but I’m wondering if it’s even worth either one of our time. I got out of a 3/4 year relationship a year ago and just now decided to step back into the dating scene. With him I was ready for marriage and even kids possibly before the age of 30. However, now kids are no longer on my mind. 

I’m thinking about going to graduate school fall 2023. I’m not sure if it will be within the state or outside of the state but that would be something else. I’m not sure if I’m being cautious because of my heartbreak or if it’s things I should genuinely be concerned about. He’s more established and I’m still figuring out who I am and want to be.

We chatted for about 2 weeks online on the app before we finally setup that first date where he drove 40 minutes to meet me. (TBH I didn't want to go but felt I should meet him in person first before I decide). Turns out he was incredibly fun and goofy to be around. I enjoyed his energy and loved our first date. He told me loved our date and was really sad when I had to leave. He mentioned he felt really comfortable around me which is unusual for him for first dates. He was very intrigued by our conversations and wanted to keep seeing me. He's not talking to anyone else and I am his first date in a long time. Things are going pretty well and we had a second date a week later that led to us sleeping together and staying over his apartment. We had sex for 5 rounds throughout the night, then had some pillow talk late into the night, discussed what we both liked during our sex sessions and expressed we both enjoyed the sex and each other's presence. Honestly, I am falling for this guy but some things he does make me confused.

1. When we are eating at a restaurant together, he would stare at me intensely with a smile on his face, but not say anything. Whenever I asked ""what's wrong?"" He would laugh it off and say ""Nothing"". He does this randomly too but never tells me what is going through his mind.
2. He would laugh randomly when we were watching a show or when I am doing something else and he is across the room. When I ask ""what's so funny?"" He would tell me directly or he would say something like ""You are so funny. You should have your own comedy show."" That makes me confused because I didn't say anything and/or I would be doing something like refilling my cup with water.
3. He would joke about things like me moving in with him so we can spend more time together or things like starting a family/putting a baby in me. He also joked about how we can discuss what kind of furniture or decorations we can add to his apartment so it feels like mine too.

Is this something guys do often? I've never had a guy act this way around me. Are we moving too fast? Should I be concerned that he may or may not be love bombing me or treating me like a replacement?

She dated this guy for 4 years and they broke up. She was drunk when she brought him up and said she would gladly go back to him, which was the first red flag. This was before we had ever met in person. I was willing to say okay, let’s move past that because we all have baggage and she hasn’t seriously dated anyone since they broke up about 6 months ago. 

We were supposed to hang out today but she said she wasn’t feeling up to it emotionally so we rescheduled for tomorrow. She says shes doing something tonight so probably wont be texting me much. She brings it up a few times so I eventually ask (if felt like she was trying to get me to ask) so she says shes going to hang out with him.

Okay, so a little over a week ago I moved to a completely new place, where I knew absolutely nobody and decided to hop on an app that lets you anonymously chat with people within 5 miles of where you are at any given time. Some girl wanted a workout buddy, so I commented and told her that I’m up for it and to text me and sent her my number.

After that we got talking pretty quickly once she realized I was new here and offered to show me around the area that night and picked me up and absolutely hit it off with eachother, I couldn’t tell at first but later once she had dropped me off saying thanks &amp; how nice and fun her and her friend were.

After that night, she came over every night for a week basically. She even brought her cat over and it stayed here at my place with us for a few days, and finally on the 6th day of us spending our free time together we did the deed. We both have fairly low body counts (mine was 2 and so was hers) and agreed that we don’t enjoy hookups and only really want to get intimate with somebody if it’s because we feel a special way about them, anyways, right after we were done she sat up and asked me what we were and at the time I didn’t know what to say, she seems perfect and I wanted to just call her my girlfriend but I didn’t want to come on to strong and so I just said that we were friends that are talking and in that stage, but made sure to say that there’s no doubt in my mind that soon we will be eachothers significant other. 

We both started work at our new jobs right after that, and since then I have only seen her twice and haven’t been getting texts back from her often. She is sweet and it makes me unable to read her. I don’t know where her head is at compared to where mine is at. She’s the first person I’ve met here and it’s just been hard to want to meet somebody else after going all the way with them. 

I don’t want to ask what she thinks because I don’t want to be annoying, but on the other hand I want to ask what she thinks about our situation thing that we’ve got going on to make sure I’m not having hope that I shouldn’t actually have. Should I just ask her what we are, if we are anything?

I recently reached out to her to catch up and we did. It was nice to hear from her but she did tell me that she still isn't over me so this conversation was over the phone and not face to face. When I broke up with her, I wanted to be single and since then I have been with a handful of women but no one compares.

There's a strong part of me that wants to get back together. But even so, I'm not fully convinced.

So a bit of background, I initially matched with her in mid December and we really hit it off. I tried to arrange a date but she couldn't at the time because she was going back home (north of England) for the holidays. I didn't think it was going to lead anywhere, but I was off work over the holidays so thought I'd talk for the sake of it, and we exchanged instas where we had good back and forth of interesting messages, but again I still had no expectations of it going anywhere. I tend to like to keep my options small, not that I usually have an abundance anyway, because I like to take the time to get to know someone, so I'm usually only talking to one person at a time. 

Flash forward to the start of the new year, she told me she was back in my city and was free the following Sunday. So I arranged the date, which was dinner, and it went really well. We had a great conversation, lots of laughs, bit of flirting here and there. We both agreed the time went so quick because of how fun it was. She then texted me later that day to say she was interested in a second date. 

I arranged the date for the following Saturday (literally the one just gone), this time it was crazy golf, followed by drinks. Again, we both agreed the date went great and was a lot of fun. The conversation didn't die, there was flirting and we kissed which felt totally natural. 

The following day the texts were still going strong and we even had an idea of what we wanted to do next time we met - pasta class. But today, after a delay in her responses, she texted me saying that she had time to think since our date and felt we got on well, but as friends and that if we met up again she couldn't promise me more than that. I texted back saying I understood it had to feel right, and that just friends wasn't for me, wishing her all the best and all that. 

I fully respect her decision, it has to feel right for both parties. Naturally, I feel gutted because it felt like we had chemistry, and she was the first girl out of those that I've taken out since my break up 6 months ago, which was quite rough, that I actually felt like I got on with and had fun with. I was also a bit restricted in seeing people in general after the break up as my father was severely ill with COvid, on a ventilator for 11 weeks, and came home vulnerable in May 2021, needing some time to build his immunity and strength again. So I've only really been back ""out there"" since November, and her personality was really refreshing. 

I was lucky that I was meeting up with my best friend today straight after work, so I had a good chance to vent and get that feeling of rejection mostly off my chest. However, it still feels kind of shitty. I know it's not a big deal, but I guess no one likes being rejected, and I know it's gonna play on my mind as the week progresses despite me being generally ok with it because I got to vent.
