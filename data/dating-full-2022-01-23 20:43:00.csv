He showed interest in me first, and asked for my contact. We started talking and flirting and as time went by, I started falling for him. I knew it was too early for me to develop feelings for him (I'm AP btw), but I couldn't help but feel the way I felt. We met quite often, and talked quite often. But I would have to admit we were still on the ""getting to know each other"" phase. After two months, I confronted him and told him how I had started feeling, and he get nervous and started avoiding me. We ended up in an argument and I told him I didn't want to talk to him anymore. From his response, during the argument, he made it clear that he was interested in getting to know me and to see what happens, but that he didn't feel anything as intenstly as myself (yet). That it was too early for him to make any decision, and therefore he was unable to proceed our relations any further, but that he still wanted to talk and get to know me. I didn't want that as I'd already developed feelings for him, so I told him that I respected his decisions, and wished him well and that he could choose to date anyone he liked, but that I was leaving and that he shouldn't approach me if he is still uncertain of what he wants with me (so don't flirt with me unless you like me and are ready for something serious- *because that is what I want/need*). 

He apologized for flirting with me, and told me that he wished me well and wanted me to be happy. He also told me that ""who knows what the future holds"" but I didn't take him seriously. I wished him well and started ignoring him (in order to move on). 

After a month, I started noticing that he wanted me attention again. He'd try various ways of either ending up where I was, or talking louder around me, saying things he knew would get my attention. All of this behavior, sort of confused me as I didn't understand what he was doing and more importantly; *why*. I still kept ignoring him, because I made a rule for myself; ""*He will never see me vulnerable, and he will never know that I still like him (because I did) - UNTIL he's being direct*"". He kept going on with this ""attention-seeking"" behavior for a while and when I started talking to him a little again, he started teasing me. On a daily basis. Name-calling, trying to make me laugh or to banter with him, annoying me, taking my things and hiding them, talking about me loudly to other people around us(so that I'd look) and purposely doing things he knows would get my attention. To me all of this was so weird, because of the context; ***our history***. He knew I liked him and I confessed, he then hurt me and wished me well. How did we end up in this weird dynamic? Every now and then, apart from the attention-seeking, I'd catch him looking at me to see if I'd look back. Then he'd look away. He'd also focus all of his attention on me, watching everything I do, listening to everything I say (because he'd talk about the things I'd do or say). He'd also act jealous (staring (he'd literally stop everything he was doing to stare) and he'd storm off) when I'd talk/laugh/be close or nice to other guys around him. 

At this point, I didn't know what to think. He was the one to tell me that he was unsure and didn't harbor the same feelings as I did. He simply didn't know what he wanted in life and yet he'd act like I was the only thing he could focus on. I didn't understand how uncertainty and interest could be compatible. I always knew he was physically attracted to me, and I let the teasing continue (even though it'd hurt me if he still didn't like me), because I decided that I'd just ignore him again in the end. He continued this behavior around me for a while, and then I started feeling as if his behavior was a result of him *testing the waters*. Trying to gauge my interest, or trying to figure out whether or not I still felt the same for him. So I decided to ""give him a chance"". In other words I started opening up a little bit, and instead of ignoring him I'd talk to him more, stare at him, approach him a little bit, initiate conversations, tease him back, and show small signs of interest (shyness etc). BUT in very subtle ways, almost enough for him to feel something's changed, but not enough for him to confirm my feelings for him. I did it to ""*test the waters back*"", to see how he responds.

During this time he was acting super weird around me, he'd get all flustered and he'd move away as I'd get close. He'd still tease me, watch me and want my attention and yet he'd be nervous when I'd get closer to his body. He’d look at the ground and smile and then he'd get all fidgety. I got confused and didn't quite understand his behavior. I knew though, that he was nervous, I just didn't know why. Was I making him nervous now all of a sudden? During this period, he randomly contacted me again and sent me three ""subliminal messages"". He was driving in his car, and filmed the road while listening to heartbreak songs. He sent me spesific parts of the songs while driving. *The song lyrics were about a guy realizing that he had lost a good girl and wanting his love back because he realized his love for her*. When we used to talk, before our fight, he used to send me songs like this (a flirting method). Also, we had no contact on social media at this point. We only talked a bit face-to-face. 

I didn't know what to think, and I reacted by withdrawing. I didn't react to the songs, I sort of just ignored them. I withdrew because I was scared. I was unsure of what he wanted and I was scared of being vulnerable. Fast forward to the last day of school; he kept staring at me the whole day. We looked at each other the whole day and he'd try to get closer to me. It was almost as if we were sad that we were leaving and it almost felt like unfinished business between us for some reason. When we were saying goodbye, he couldn't even look me in the eyes. He looked at the ground, smiling, and left. It broke my heart. I missed him and I wanted to tell him how I felt, how I felt still, and yet I couldn't manage to do it. I couldn't open up, so I just left.

During the summer break he tried contacting me here and there, and I responded half-heartedly. I was scared. I still thought about the songs, and I didn't know what to do about it. Why had he sent them? Did he want to convey his feelings, or was he simply trying to check if I still liked him? (but then again why do it for no reason?). I spent a month wondering if I made the right choice. Was I being too scared? Was I overthinking it, should I reach out, or should I leave it be?. All of this caused me to question my own defensiveness against him and protection of my heart. Basically, it got me thinking again. Thinking about him. He was my friend, and I knew for a fact he wouldn't purposely do anything to hurt me. To me that in itself started working as a catalyst and resulted in me being open to my feelings. Open about what I truly felt for him. I had, for so long, tried to hide and suppress what I thought of him and now I felt like being ready to feel it again. All because of the chance that he might have fallen for me too.

My feelings had resurfaced and I contacted him out of the blue. Just a casual conversation here and there. After a week, we met again at school. As soon as I laid my eyes on him, I froze. It was as if my feelings that had resurfaced hit me as a hard wave hitting the rocks. I didn't think or say anything, I just sort of ""ran away"" from him, all flustered and nervous. We got eye-contact for 3 seconds before I ran away. I regretted it instantly as I expected he'd be sad and confused as to why I ran away at the sight of him. Maybe he thought I didn't want to talk to him at all now? I didn't know. The whole day I kept acting like this as he was noticing the change in my behavior. 

I tried calming down and acting as if I wasn't nervous around him, because it'd be too obvious that he was making me feel something. Instead I received a text from him where he started by asking me why I was running away from him. I instantly got in defense-mode and acted like I didn't know what he was talking about. He started teasing me about it, and purposely saying stuff like he won't bite, and that I don't have to be nervous around him. He said he'd catch me and make me shyer that I already was. In other words, he was flirting with me based on my behavior around him. I realized he knew the vibes. He understood that my behavior meant interest. He was all happy and giddy around me and started contacting me. We got in contact again and started talking again. It was a blissful time where we'd tease/flirt and joke and banter. He sent me songs again and this time the lyrics conveyd a message where a girl is in love with a guy. It was exactly like the time (a year ago) when we first started talking. The only difference; he kept asking the reason behind my behavior around him. I was still nervous to talk to him so our face-to-face interactions were minimal, rather we'd talk on text on a regular basis. He'd ask, in different ways, but he'd act like he didn't know the reason. His behavior had made it clear to me that he already knew why I was acting this way, but still he kept asking as if he didn't know. I kept being defensive about it for a good 2 1/2 months. I was too scared to be vulnerable, because I didn't know why he wanted this information to begin with. One night, as we were talking, he told me ""*I know the reason behind your behavior, I just want to hear you say it*"". He finally confirmed what I thought. He knew. He wanted my confirmation. He wanted me to tell him I liked him. So I did. He got all shy/nervous and started laughing, but never confessed back. I felt my heart breaking again. I couldn't believe that he would have done this to me for fun. That he wanted me to confess and be vulnerable only to not reciprocate at that moment.. We didn't talk for a whole day after, and he just popped up again asking me why I didn't come to school. He kept sending me multiple messages to make sure I was okay. It almost seemed like he was ""*trying to fix the hurt*"" or ""*trying to check if I still respond*"". Like he wanted things to go back to normal, w/o discussing what just happened. It was weird to me so I decided on being curt. He kept contacting me and saying stuff to me. At first I thought he's just being nice so he's probably going to apologize soon. Instead two days later he started teasing me about my behavior again. And he did stuff and told me ""only for you"". So basically he knew I liked him, he got me to confess and confirm it for him, and then he was teasing and flirting with me right after. He still keeps telling me that he likes teasing me and that he wishes I'd never leave school etc. This has been going on for almost a month now, and he still hasn't confessed. It seems to me (because I tried teasing him about it indirectly) that he's not going to confess any time soon. Remember that we are close and we're friends, so I'm pretty sure he isn't playing me or trying to hurt me. Whatever going on it definitely confusing, and yet I'm 100% sure he's not a bad guy. 

So I don't know what's going on? Is he fearful-avoidant? Is that what causes discomfort to him when it comes to intimacy and healthy expression of feelings? Or is he emotionally immature, that he doesn't know how to convey his feelings in a normal, healthy manner?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1154371,public,self,Guy-friend.

Is a bit wall of text-y so here's a TL;DR:

A  girl I was seeing for a few dates ghosted me and now returned from  beyond the grave to apologize. I don't buy her story (reasons below). I  kind of feel indifferent about her as I'm seeing other people now and  moved past her, but I don't want to come across as an asshole, and if  her story is true, I want to be fair and accept her apology at least, or  it might even be fun to reconnect with her.

Full story:

Back  in the summer, I (21F) was seeing this woman (23) and went on a few  dates with her, we had sex once and agreed on meeting a second time  after that (we both enjoyed it). I made it clear from the beginning (in  my Tinder bio and our conversations offline) that I'm looking for a  fuckbuddy/FWB and BDSM-partner and not a relationship. She seemed on the  same page with all of that. Some days later I developed a yeast  infection and suggested that the next time we meet, I could just do her  so she won't get infected or we could just do something not sex related  (grabbing a beer or whatever). She replied she would rather postpone  because she was scared of catching the yeast infection, which I was fine  with. I texted her some days later to just check in with her and asking  how she's doing, and since then I was ghosted. I sent her a last text  asking what's going on and whether I did something to make her feel  uncomfortable, but I obviously did not get a reply. I was kind of hurt  and also just really annoyed since I had to get back on Tinder, but I  moved past it quickly.

Fast  forward to this week. After some trial and error, I found a new  fuckbuddy some weeks ago and it's really going well. But suddenly, this  person who ghosted me returns from beyond the grave and sends me a  lengthy message on how she got locked out of her phone, and she couldn't  restore her iCloud backup because her two factor auth was linked to her  old number she had back when she still lived in the US, and thus lost  my contact info. Some days ago she miraculously was able to restore her  WhatsApp backup with my number in it and texted me because she felt  really sorry and never intended to ghost me and I didn't make her feel  uncomfortable in any way.

Now I  don't know what to reply and if this would even be worth my time at all.  I had almost forgotten about her. I'm tempted to ghost her back.

The other issue is that I don't quite buy her little story. She could've texted me on Tinder, where she changed her profile up *after*  ghosting me (including that she's now looking for a girlfriend instead  of having no info on that in her bio) and then unmatched me after I sent  her my last text (there was a span of like 10 or 14 days between her  ghosting and my last text). She literally knows where I live since that  was where we had sex as well, so she could've done *something*  about it. Also, I have been ghosted before so I pick up the vibe when a  text convo is turning into that direction, which it definitely did. Me  forgiving her would be unearned if she just made that story up, and I'm  not a person who just lets people get through with lies. It's just not  cool.

On the other hand, I could  be falsely accusing her and hurt her feelings for no reason by calling  her out for the ghosting and for her creative fairytale or by just not  replying to her. I appreciate her apologizing because not many ghosts do  that and I don't quite know how to react to that or what to say.  Linking in with the fact that I do not care that much. If her story is  true, it wasn't her fault and it might be fun to reconnect with her. Or  at the very least, I don't want to be an asshole.

So  I guess I'm mainly looking for input here, I dont have strong emotions about it (I'm not hurt anymore or anything), but I also don't want to be an asshole, while at the same time not giving her more than she deserves. I'd love to hear some different opinions, maybe that'll help me find a solution.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1154377,public,self,Person who ghosted me returns as zombie,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sb3sir/person_who_ghosted_me_returns_as_zombie/,no_ads,0,,,,

She’s really pretty. I mean, her face is literally perfect. And she’s also a cheerful girl. I really like talking with her and making her laugh. 

But I’m not physically attracted. Even if she’s beautiful and has a perfect personality, i’m not attracted to her body. She’s underweight, and i don’t really know if she’s ok with that or not. I’m always been attracted to chubbier girls, or normal weight girls ( not to offend anyone ). I’d totally help her gaining a better physique, if she wants it too.

Anyway, i think that getting to know her better might change my idea in a positive way. We’ve been talking for a bit and i’ve never been in such a weird situation. I was planning to ask her out… would it be a good idea? 

My main fear is to hurt her feelings if i find out i’m not attracted. I already know she likes me and i’m actually feeling guilty for what i wrote.

He messaged me and then he must have looked me up on facebook, because he told me we had a mutual friend. So we add each other on there and start talking. We check in with each other every day, and at first he was talking about dating, but then out of nowhere he started talking about sex. Well then I explained I only have sex with people I'm in a relationship with. I asked if he was interested in me romantically or as friends, and he said friends for now because things have to build naturally from there. I said I was ok with that, but he still keeps talking about sex. So I told him thats not gonna happen if we aren't dating. He then made it clear that he had every intention of dating me,and that he just was a very sexual person. Ok whatever. So I kinda started pulling away, because I was depressed about him never asking me how I was and not trying to get to know me and some stuff going on in my life as well. I honestly didn't expect him to reach out, but then he did. He was asking if I was ok. I said I was fine. He calls me and said that he knows when a woman says shes fine, shes really not. So I told him everything that had been going on with my family and everything and he was actually very sweet. He listened. He said he understood and opened up a bit about himself. He said he has built a wall to not get hurt. And we talked for over an hour. So we are both only available on the weekends due to work, and I had figured he would want to see me so I let him know I was free saturday night. He said he had plans with a friend but would let me know if he could see me afterwards. Well he ended up staying out all night. And so this morning we are messaging and he says I can come over and have breakfast with him and sex. I tell him I am busy and remind him that we wont be having sex when we date.

She was looking for something too, and it seemed we might be able to help each other out. We started chatting and it was going well - nice and easy, we were chatting for ages. We quite quickly exchanged SFW pictures and made arrangements to meet up yesterday (Saturday - this was Monday). She asked if I preferred to stick with reddit or more to Whatsapp - gave her my number and the conversation continued. 

We talked for hours a day for the next few days, making plans for the weekend.  It started out as meeting for a coffee then going to her place. She asked how long I had so she could work out dinner plans - I was free the whole day so she offered to cook. Then suggested I stay and we spoon and watch a movie together. We were basically creating a FWB type arrangement so there was lots of NSFW chat about what kinds of things we wanted, but we were getting to know each other too - likes and dislikes, interests, hobbies. We even told each other if we were going out or on calls etc so the other knew not to expect a response for a while. 

We really seemed to be on the same page - we both said we were a bit distracted from our day to day lives. I was really looking forward to the weekend - and it really seemed she was too. Eventually she told me to bring a toothbrush etc so I could just stay the night rather than driving home really late. I said I would but that I wasn't going to make any assumptions and we could just see how it went - there really wasn't any pressure either way. She told me what she was making for dinner, and what snacks etc she'd got us. I had told her she didn't need to cook and that we could get a takeaway or go somewhere but she wanted to. Wouldn't let me buy any of the ingredients either. 

On Friday she messaged saying she hoped I was having a more productive day than she was.  This was probably about midday and we spent the rest of the day texting about the weekend and various other things. She told me that ""if a woman has spent say the best part of a week chatting to you over  text messages or whatever for hours a day, she is probably happy to be seduced by you"". I took that as a pretty positive sign! We ended around midnight wishing each other good night and saying how much we were looking forward to meeting. 

On Saturday I woke up and went to send her a message - and I couldn't. I couldn't see her profile picture or status any more, and messages only have a single tick - so haven't been delivered. Initially I thought nothing of it - whatsapp can sometimes be a little temperamental with this stuff and things had been going so well it never crossed my mind that anything untoward might be going on. However as time wore on I was getting more concerned - I tried calling her through whatsapp and it just said ""calling"" without ever going to ""ringing"" - i.e. no connection was made. I tried calling normally - straight to voicemail without even a single ring, and sending a normal text - again nothing. I knew it was pointless but I still went to the meeting place - I had originally said I could get there from around 2pm but we hadn't confirmed the time - I was just going to message her as I was leaving, but I got there for 2 and waited over an hour, just in case something had happened to her phone or something and she still turned up. Needless to say she didn't. 

I'm pretty sure I have been blocked, mainly based on the evidence from whatsapp, but I have absolutely no idea why. Her reddit account no longer exists either.

I'm just so confused. Everything seemed to be going so well and she seemed to be at least as into everything as I was - communication was really open and honest and very much 2-way. Yesterday should have been fantastic but it ended up being such a shit experience.

Not really sure why I'm posting this - maybe it's in the hope (as unlikely as it is) that she sees it and gets in touch. Maybe it is just to get it out there and see what other think so it's not just in my head any more. Is it just me - was I being naive? Does stuff like this happen all the time?

Now I do genuinely believe that he is busy, his job is in the arts and he has periods where it's pretty time-consuming when he's working on a project. I asked him to hangout weeks ago and he said he wasn't sure of his schedule and explained why then I asked the other day again if he'd wanna see a movie or something and he sent a long paragraph explaining to me how he's busy due to a project he's working on but when it's done in the coming weeks he'll have more free time. I feel like it's important to say we live an hour apart too (I offered to drive to him though). I just don't know what to think. I think if he had no interest and didn't want to hang out or continue our casual (sometimes flirty) conversations he wouldn't. But also you're telling me he doesn't have a single free night, ever? (Until this project is done I guess??) I don't know how to feel! I guess I should just feel/wait it out? I know that being ""busy"" can be an easier, nicer way to not hang out with someone if you're uninterested, but the fact that he still is texting me and gives me good reasons for being busy makes me think it's maybe not just an excuse?

Definitely a bit jealousy fueled but for those of you saying it was racist.. go eat it.


Some things led up to me become concerned over my gfs new job at an Asian massage parlor.  She is not a licensed MT and we'll ive recently heard stories about those places...

So I found her place in a shady site and got a little jealous when she asked about the HPV vaccine.  And sorta opened up the topic for conversation.

Everything she said jives with what I found online.  About five years ago it was bought out by new owners and to some 'became a complete waste of time' thank God!

Also it is filled with some complaints about leaving the door open and no extras and being pushy for tips.

When we talked she said her friend started working about five years ago there and she had started with some new owners.  They do leave the doors open.  And it does reduce the number of attempts and they also have cameras leading up to it.  She said she's the bully and customers need to watch out for her hahaha.

When we were talking this weekend her friend said some guy did try complain about the door and did ask her for more.  My gf said it has only happened the one time she told me about otherwise no issues for her.

I did not go in because I don't trust her.  I didn't know how to bring it up without saying 'do you give hand jobs for cash?' which seems highly offensive but at the same time I think there are some reasons to ask.

We recently got into a fight about my income.. i make six figures but have student loans.  She was asking why I don't join the army.  Which I dislike the military machine so we got into a fight a little about it.  I asked her if she wanted a military guy or something and she responded that she just likes money.  Then we went to help get her a car and she pulls out ten k in cash after having job issues during covid.

It was just a lot of small things that I was like wtf is going on here... But we cleared it all up and I'm comfortable with our discussion and trust she is honest with me that she is not doing gross things.

Also I should have known because she listens to songs like 'only you' are the only lyrics i understand lol.  The way she looks at me.  The sweetness.  I should never have thought she was capable but again I've dated girls from many different cultural backgrounds and you can find yourself quite surprised when you make assumptions based on historical context (primarily if you have not really had friends or weren't raised in that culture).

My (28) girlfriend (25) wants to get married but I don’t feel ready for it yet. She tells me that I need to decide within the next six months. She implied that she will leave if we are not engaged by then - for good reasons, which I will explain.

Just for context, we have been dating for 1 year and 3 months, and have been living together for 8 months. She is a grad student from abroad. Her life after graduation has already been arranged by her parents if she returns home. She will become a lawyer and have a career at the bar. It is her dream and something she has always wanted. If she stays in my country, it will because of me. At the moment, if she stays, she has no direction, may never become a lawyer here, and will be away from her family and friends.

She believes that life plans can be changed based on circumstances in life. At this point, she knows she loves me and wants to be with me. She wants to stay with me despite the sacrifices, but she needs to know that I am committed to her. She says it is worth changing her life plans for the one she will potentially spend the rest of her life with. She needs an answer within the next six months because that is when she will graduate and need to make a decision.

Considering the fact that I am not ready to get married, she suggested for us to have a long engagement, say a year or two, and then get married later when I am “ready”. That way she will have the sense of commitment and assurance from me for her to stay and I also get a bit more time before I am ready.

I know that I love her and I know that I want to marry her at some point. But I am just not quite ready now - for following two reasons which I will explain:

(1) She gets very anxious about an ex of mine within my friendship group. I see those friends about 2/3 times a year so they are not part of my day-to-day life. But it bothers me that I have to restrict my social interaction with that group because of her anxiety. She is medicated on a daily basis and is usually fine. It is only when group events are proposed etc that she gets very anxious and upset. Those friends live all around the country. They are from university. They are important to me because they have been with me through very difficult times.

(2) It is not clear to me what her plans after graduation are. I know - it sounds like a chicken and egg problem. She says she needs to know whether or not we will be committed because her life choices after graduation depend on it. Financially speaking there isn't an issue - we are both sorted in that sense. I'm just worried she might be bored staying at home if she doesn't manage to find a suitable job that she enjoys. Its not great when she gets bored. She'll need quite a bit of attention. I would like her to have something to occupy her time.

Those issues aside, I think we are very compatible. Our life goals, lifestyle, interests, etc all seem to align. I can see her as a great mother and I love her very much. We are both stable and financially independent. We have discussed children, expectations etc.

So I had a date with a very cool girl two days ago and the date was amazing; she invited me to her house, we ate and talk a lot we then watched a movie and made out a bit and then I had to go back home cause I was working and the date ended there! As i said, it went, I think, pretty well:)

So the day after I decided to texted her to let her know that it had a very nice time and she texted me back some hours later to tell me that she was happy to hear it and asked me how the road went (I had to take the train etc.) so I answered her but after this...no answer? 

I know it has just been a day, but she used to text me pretty often before the 1st date (like in between 30 min to 2-3h) and now for both of these messages she's taking a lot more than 2-3h to answer! 

So, that being said, My overthinking mind is screaming at me that she'll drop the bomb saying that she's no longer interested (and I'm fully prepared and lowkey already mentally there to just let go easily ish) but at the same time I'm telling myself that she might be busy or something and I could just wait and see (pretty much the only reasonable thing to do anyway).

Apparently, it didn't click and that he was suffering with mental health issues and was just unhappy in general. I went through quite a heartache after he ended it.

Yes, i know ""there is no such thing as the friendzone"". But it's easier to say it this way.

So the story is like this, that 2 years ago i actually had a chance with someone. I matched with this chick (who is way out of my league looks wise) on tinder and we actually had a very nice conversation. She seemed interested but sadly i fucked up and it never went anywhere. I have shown myself to be too emotional and clingy and what i realised lately i never asked her out properly. From what she and other people told me i think she isn't aware of the fact that i like her (thought i take it with a grain of salt). So like i said, things never went anywhere. Never got formally rejected, she just got together with another guy and i ended up in what is commonly known as the friendzone. Or maybe even just the palzone, it's hard for me to say. Now, while i don't really regret staying friends, i could never really get over her. The opposite in fact. I started out as being somewhat interested because she was hot and gave me a chance. I ended up falling in love with her due to her personality. Honestly i realised she is the only person i ever loved and propably will ever love, because frankly since i met her i don't think i've even been so much as interested in another woman (which actually made my life as a FA so much easier). Now, while i couldn't get over my feelings for her, i respected her choice and didn't make any moves. Just accepted that we are friends and i better get used to it.

At least until now. I did a lot of self improvement over the last year, got into shape, got a job, got better as a person when it comes to personality and mental health. This all gave me a massive confidence boost. And the idea got to my head that maybe i can still somehow make things work. That if i just tell her things honestly (but casualy) and just straight up ask her out on a date there is a chance she'll say ""you know what? ok"". Now, i'm aware that the chances are slim. We know eachother for two years and i've already shown myself to be a clingy and lonely loser. But i really did improve a lot so i can't stop myself from clinging onto that. I really need your opinion if it's actually possible or if i'm just deluding myself.

Honestly though i decided i'm gonna tell her how i feel anyway. I really need to do this for the sake of closure. I think she won't get upset over it. I just need to wait till the end of february so i can lose a bit more weight, pass my half year exams, get my contract at work renewed and get my pills prescribed.

I really enjoy being with him — but my top love languages are tied at Quality Time and Physical Touch.

He’s very structured, travels a lot, texts me all day long (I don’t prefer texting… I’d rather FT, which he’d said he’d do more of and still hasn’t.)

My issue:
We’re only intimate about 1X/week right now… it just isn’t enough for me. 

About 4-weeks ago, I stopped entertaining other men that I’ve been involved with casually for years… so, now that I’m only with this man, I’m honestly am getting bored constantly waiting around for him.  I don’t feel like my needs are being prioritized, but I feel like his are fulfilled.

It just isn’t often enough for me and I feel like I’m being a bit pushy about it — which frustrates me further, because I don’t WANT to be annoying or have to ask for intimacy. 

Even when I was married, we had sex OFTEN — it was never a problem in the relationship.

I really like this guy, and I’m trying to be understanding, but every time he goes out of town I feel more disappointed deep down… and it’s been building up more and more. 

I tried to address how I feel about it, but I think he thought I was just being silly-dramatic, because he kinda laughs it off and then continues the conversation in a cute-joking manner. 
Then says he’ll fulfill my needs more, but it doesn’t seem like it’s happening (I may be rushing my expectations though).

I just want a relationship where the person wants to see me at least 3X’s a week… 
But I don’t know what the norm is for people in their 30’s in the dating world, especially as adults with real jobs and school, etc.

I know this because she sent a picture of her through snap… so obvious she mentioned me to her and probably said a thing or two.

 But last night she was trying to ask deep questions like “is there anything you want to tell me “any struggles in life” stuff like that. But when I was talking to her friend I was probably around 10 pounds skinnier or so while she was maybe on the bigger said and may have thought I was skinner for my height or age. And keep in mind I haven’t even met this girl I’m texting in person yet. But when yesterday she asked “did you eat yet today” I just said yes. Keep in mind I do get 3 meals a day and work out. I didn’t workout freshmen year but still ate. But this time when she asked “u eat yet today” I replied “Are you trying to ask what I ate today or did I eat today ???”. I think it’s weird she’s saying it like that… is she trying to see if I have some type of mental health issues or something ??

After a month we ended up having sex, but the day after that she said that that happened too soon since she had broken up with her boyfriend less than 2 months ago, and so she was not feeling ready yet to start something new. 

We stayed friends for the following months, however, in September I moved to another country to do my master's degree. I was really sad that I would not be able to see her again for at least 3 months, but at the same time maybe this would be a great opportunity for me to meet someone new and forget this girl. 

In December I came back to my home country for the Christmas holidays, and I stayed there for 1 month. During this time I reconnected again with the girl, and we were seeing each other pretty much every single day (not sexually). Although most of the time, the ""dates"" were very causal such as simply going to the gym together and me taking her home, I began to feel like in love again with the girl, and I thought she was too, especially considering the fact that we hooked up before. Eventually, I decided to try and kiss her at the end of one date, and she just backed off and said she just sees me as a friend.

Now my question is: is this normal? how can a girl be hanging out with a guy literally every day for over 10 days, knowing the fact that we had sex before, and just see me as a friend? Also, she flirted with me a lot in different ways. So I was pretty confident we were on the same page, but guess I was wrong... Im fucking shocked and I can't understand what I have done wrong. Can she be lying?  Why would she be wasting so much time with me if she just likes me as a friend? I never met a guy and girl who were simply friends, meeting so often, and I definitely don't think that's normal.

But it's easier to say it this way.

So the story is like this, that 2 years ago i actually had a chance with someone. I matched with this chick (who is way out of my league looks wise) on tinder and we actually had a very nice conversation. She seemed interested but sadly i fucked up and it never went anywhere. I have shown myself to be too emotional and clingy and what i realised lately i never asked her out properly. From what she and other people told me i think she isn't aware of the fact that i like her (thought i take it with a grain of salt). So like i said, things never went anywhere. Never got formally rejected, she just got together with another guy and i ended up in what is commonly known as the friendzone.  Or maybe even just the palzone, it's hard for me to say. Now, while i don't really regret staying friends, i could never really get over her. The opposite in fact. I started out as being somewhat interested because she was hot and gave me a chance. I ended up falling in love with her due to her personality. Honestly i realised she is the only person i ever loved and propably will ever love, because frankly since i met her i don't think i've even been so much as interested in another woman (which actually made my life as a FA so much easier). Now, while i couldn't get over my feelings for her, i respected her choice and didn't make any moves. Just accepted that we are friends and i better get used to it.

At least until now. I did a lot of self improvement over the last year, got into shape, got a job, got better as a person when it comes to personality and mental health. This all gave me a massive confidence boost. And the idea got to my head that maybe i can still somehow make things work. That if i just tell her things honestly (but casualy) and just straight up ask her out on a date there is a chance she'll say ""you know what? ok"". Now, i'm aware that the chances are slim. We know eachother for two years and i've already shown myself to be a clingy and lonely loser. But i really did improve a lot so i can't stop myself from clinging onto that. I really need your opinion if it's actually possible or if i'm just deluding myself.

Honestly though i decided i'm gonna tell her how i feel anyway. I really need to do this for the sake of closure. I think she won't get upset over it. I just need to wait till the end of february so i can lose a bit more weight, pass my half year exams, get my contract at work renewed and get my pills prescribed. I want to be at my best when i tell her everything.

At the start of the pandemic, I (25F) was an average build and had shoulder length hair. I was successful in my career, confident, and really involved in hobbies! 

I have been talking to this guy on and off since April 2020 after connecting on a dating app. We haven’t shared pictures of our face/ bodies since talking on the app and haven’t met in person. We made plans to meet multiple times but things kept happening on both sides.

18 months later, my looks and overall life has changed. I cut my hair short and gained a bit of weight, stress has been overwhelming so I lessened my responsibilities at work and that impacted my confidence. 

I feel like we can’t ever meet now because I’m so different from who he started talking to. I didn’t MEAN to do this, I just realized one day that I look different than I did when I was on the apps. I’m not intentionally trying to lie.

2 months into the relationship, she quit her job with no follow up job. She was not financially capable of doing this. She quit as she was moving to a new apartment, which has a slew of costs attached.

About 2 months of no job, and she has rent due at her new apartment in about 6 days with no means to pay for it. I’ve helped all I could to get her where she wanted to be, but today was the last straw.

I came back to her place and it reeked of alcohol and marijuana. She came up to hug me and tried to kiss but I couldn’t even muster up the energy to kiss her cause her breath smelled like shit. It was at this moment I knew she wasn’t changing for the better, and was going to take the relationship down with her unless I broke it off.

It’s so sad because in a period of 4 months she went from being an independent woman who was very attractive and very engaging to date and be around to dependent, using drugs to stave off problems, and broke.

When I reflect back on the relationship I have no idea what went wrong. We had strong chemistry and I knew very well that love can be blind and I tried to confirm many times that it wasn't a one sided thing and that she was also putting in efforts so definitely I wasn't loving a ""projection"" of her. And also I had past lessons from dating and didn't do common mistakes like getting overly attached or showering her with interests. And I didn't mistreat her at all so why the fuck did it end ? 

I truly loved her I truly did I reflected it with my actions not words I made her happiness the priority. You see words can be boring even if your feelings are genuine. I made the relationship exciting for her to have a good experience and initially she told me she was busy with her studies so I waited 1 year before we entered a proper relationship and supported her in her bad times (She had some family issues - issues at college...etc), there were some girls that showed interest in me in the relationship that my friends told me were prettier than her but I didn't care at all to me she was the prettiest girl alive. Sometimes I wish she was ugly so I can talk with her more freely. And even when the relationship ended I cared about her wellbeing first I gave her encouragements for her future career and a number to some connection that could help her when she graduates. That's the kind of lover I had for her. It was about commitment and effort and not just infatuation. 

But when her turn came to help me, she didn't. You see last year I started developing an illness (hypothyroidism that was diagnosed later) and I started falling behind in grades. I really needed her support but when I talked to her she was stony cold and eventually I got dumbed. And a few days later I see her hanging with another guy.

I kept thinking and thinking about it and you know what I realized ? Men are biologically wired to take on responsibilities to make sacrifices to hold on to their words. When I decided to commit to her, I continue to commit even if I was hurt even if I found better girls even if I fell out of love/became bored with her. Because as a man I was taught to never break my word. But girls on the other hand just care about their emotions and well beings. Their words and promises are empty. She's infatuated with you / feeling love ? -&gt; She will say ""I will always love you"" or whatever but once her emotions (infatuation) changes, she just dumps the relationship like it meant nothing for her. So how are there long term relationships ? Simple, either she can't find better or she's invested in children or she's afraid to leave.  It all comes down to her well being. 

I don't hate women but this is just the truth and I don't blame them for it. It's known in science that female emotional centers are way stronger than her logical centers. But I'm just annoyed that the beautiful ideas of love in my head turned out to be just pink dreams. It's why I named this account so it's just a fairy tale it doesn't exist. 

I cared about finding deep connection more than looks and I put my heart on the line and I invested a lot but what did I get ? I just got stabbed in the back. The time I spent in the relationship I could have spent somewhere else productive. I used to believe strongly in the saying that hard things to come by are hard to lose but I was just delusional. 

So I've just decided to invest all my time in my happiness and good investments. And if someone confessed to me that I have feelings/chemistry for, fuck it I'm just gonna tell them to go to hell. I might date or hire prostitutes but I will never fall for someone or commit.

I told him I needed time to recharge as I'm socializing again very soon. There was no point lying at that point I think.

I am almost sure I hurt his feelings, and I messed up because he asked me to go out on Wednesday instead and while I agreed, I panicked and asked him if tomorrow works too. He now seems hesitant about tomorrow, and I wish I just went with Wednesday and had been cool with it.

I know no one knows what will happen next, but I'm just wondering if I did the right thing with taking that time to myself. I love my alone time just as I love socializing with people, and I want to believe the right person--no matter now connected we may feel for each other--understands that.

We meet in one state, and then she relocated to my state, not for me but for work. She's young 19 and I'm 24. We were sexting, and talking about our lives, doing the whole LDR thing, without the term. I even asked if we were exclusive and she said she wanted to say yes, but wanted to wait till we were together in person to commit. 

She finally arrives on Thursday night. I decide to throw her a welcome to your new home party! We had been wanting to have sex for a while, but I told her that we didn't need to have sex on that first night. I figured she'd be tired and would want to go to bed after a some festivities. She responded that we weren't going to have sex that  night or ever. I asked why all the sudden a change. She says she started talking to someone and sends me a picture of her hand and a wedding ring. I got mad, we insulted each other, and it ends with her telling me it was just a joke. She wasn't married/engaged, she was just being mean. 

I forgive her, but tell her I'm feel betrayed. She tells me I'm thinking too much. I decide to invite her to a party where there is alcohol. I was the host, and I just wanted us to get along either as friends or partners. She comes over, we all drink. At one point in the night she begins to yell at me in Spanish, telling me that "" You like it when I yell at you don't you? It turns you on."" I do, and there was another Spanish speaker in the room with us. She left to use the bathroom, and everyone leaves cause they understood where everything was heading. 

&amp;#x200B;

Everyone's gone, and she comes back. I begin to start kissing her feet, and telling her how much I like her. She askes why, and I just say ""do I need a reason to?"" All the gifts I had sent you, and time spent texting, I did it without thinking we would ever be close enough to one another. Now we are. She tells me she was molested as a child and that's why she has trouble engaging in intimacy's with people. I tell her I understand. 

&amp;#x200B;

She then pounces on me, and is pinning me down, dry humping me. She makes out with me and tells me "" I like you a lot, I like you a lot, but I love Polish boy."" She just keeps telling me, saying that I should just be her brother. I ask her if she wanted to move to my bed, because we were just laying on the floor talking and kissing. She agrees. We go to my bed and I tell her we dont have to have sex. We lay there kissing and cuddling, but she sticks her hand in my pants and starts jerking me. The she begins to blow me. She then says shes cant do this, and I put on my pants. She's new to town, and so I decide to walk her back. 

All the lovely duby feelings disappear and I start getting mad. Cause she had the chance to tell me this earlier, and instead she pulls this stunt. I get mad, and I tell her that I'm upset, because she effectively manipulated me to into having feelings for her. She never told me she loved him, or anything. I keep brining this up. She just gets mad at me, and then starts insulting me telling me that I'll never be able to beat him or match him in any way. Very emotionally abusive things. I get mad and just leave. To be fair, all she needed to do was walk straight and she'd be at her barracks (oh we are in the army too). As I'm leaving some guy pulls up and askes me if I need a ride. We are in the army, we are all friendly to one another. I say no, but that she might need a ride cause she drunk and being mean to me. 

As soon as I get back to my barracks, I call her asking if she made it. She says no and then I rush back to see her. She took a turn and ended up somewhere else. I begin to guide her back home. The entire time insulting me, and telling me she never wants to see me again. just very mean stuff. I finally get her back to her barracks. 

&amp;#x200B;

We talked today and agreed we probably shouldn't see each other again. I am very sad, because I feel like I failed her.

It’s hard to say exactly what I want but I will start from the beginning,

Met this guy on a dating app so randomly and were texting daily for about a week until we met up for the first time. The first hang out went perfectly and we continued to talk as the time passed. He had expressed that he wasn’t looking for anything serious and I was okay with that since I didn’t know what I was looking for either. Throughout the 2 months, we maintained very steady and daily contact. Texting all day everyday and phone calls or facetiming at least once a day. We hung out about once or twice a week in which we did things couples did and enjoyed each other’s company (sexually too but never all the way bc I would get too attached) We also bought each gifts here and there, and he even introduced me to his friends on more than one occasion. To be honest, I was feeling myself developing feelings and asked if he was still not seeing this as developing into something serious since he had made several comments that proposed it. He said he needed more time which was once again, fine with me but left me in an uncomfortable grey area. He had expressed in the past that he was attached but also mentioned he had just went through a break up not too long before he met me. On one of our hangouts, even telling each other we both liked each other as more than friends. Fast forward to the last week, he began to lag a little with replying which was when I knew something was up. At the end of our last hangout, I asked if he was still interested since it seemed like he wasn’t. He said that he didn’t lose interest and thought I was a good person but is dealing with a lot at the moment. He said we can be friends and that he still wanted to be around. He also said that there was potential for a relationship. After leaving it at that, it was mostly very spaced out conversation that eventually died out over the span of 3 days. Double texting like a week later, I asked if he wanted to finish an activity we had started on our last hangout. He kept normal conversation and said he wanted to. When trying to plan a day, I was once again left on delivered. We still followed each other on instagram but after a post that hurt my feelings (sort of matching shoes with another person), I unfollowed so I could start to get over him. Since things were left on sort of good terms, I wondered if me unfollowing made it weird so I followed back a week later since I regretted cutting all contact. I left the follow for a day and no follow back so I took it back (I know way too much but I was overthinking). Since it has been 2 months since the “breakup,” my feelings have died down but still admire him as a friend. I wonder if I should believe that he wanted to be around and try to reach out again to see if we are in a good understanding of friendship since the last interaction we had was me unfollowing him (1 month ago.) I don’t want be annoying but don’t believe he didn’t care at least a little bit since he made a mutual effort with initiating phone calls and interest. Should I reach out in the near future to check up on him or take his behavior as a hint that he is not even interested in a genuine friendship?

PS. keep in mind we had to make about an hour drive each one time we hung out, which was equally done (extra detail because i personally wouldn’t make that drive unless i liked someone)",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1154483,public,self,dealing w 2 month situationship breakup,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sbc3pl/dealing_w_2_month_situationship_breakup/,no_ads,0,,,,

When I picked up my order, I grabbed the bag from her then proceeded to hand her a note that said, “Here is my number so I can take you out for those Scallops.” 

I’ve never done that in my life but I guess I was just feeling myself and said fuck it. Worse that can happen is she throws it in the trash and I’m no worse spot than I was before.
