The only issue was that she kind of took a while to respond which can be annoying but I didn't have much of an issue with it cause she always responded. The only thing is that obviously when someone takes a while to respond it's hard to get a real text chain started.

Anyways long story short we were texting for a week. She got into some pretty personal stuff and overall we had a great convo. Normally I'd ask a girl out after a few days but in this case because of the long response times I thought I should give it some more time because I didn't want to rush into things if we've barely spoken to each other. I asked her out after a week and then she just never respond and I'm like wtf.

I've been ghosted before and this exact circumstance has happened to me before but I just don't understand why you just want to waste both of our time. Seriously, just don't match with me if you're going to talk to me for a while and then ghost me once I ask you out. The whole point of dating apps is for us to talk and then lead to one of us asking each other out. I understand you might not be interested but then just say that. People really need to stop hiding behind their phones instead of actually saying no. I don't care if you're afraid to hurt someone feelings by saying no, in my opinion it's much worse to just not answer because at the point your not even respecting the other person.

Like I said this has happened to me many times before. I've come to the realization that for whatever reason, majority of the girls I deal with can't answer a simple yes or no question (I'm sure that guys do this to girls too but it's so frustrating). For example, it annoys me when I ask a girl out and she never answers. Just have the courtesy to say no. It's so disrespectful to just ignore the other person when they built up the courage to ask you out. At least just say no.

Another case that was really bothersome to me was when the first girl I asked out said yes to a date and then I never heard from her again. I was so excited to be going on my first date and then nope! Again a simple yes or no question. I'm completely fine if a girl tells me sorry I don't like you or if they come up with some pretty obvious bs. That way I have my answer and I can move on. But when you either say yes and then don't follow through or don't respond at all it's just so frustrating and disrespectful. If I have the guts to ask you out then have the courtesy to tell me no.

Like for example this one girl I asked out told me I'm so flattered but I have a boyfriend. Long story short she didn't have a boyfriend she was actually trying to hook up with my friend. I had no problem with this because even though she lied she was straight to the point. Meanwhile, a lot of the other girls I ask out either lead me on or never respond. 

Anyways, this post is a lot longer than I expected it to be but long story short if someone has the courage to ask you out have the decency to actually say no to them.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1110424,public,self,People please stop doing this,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qjgmkl/people_please_stop_doing_this/,all_ads,6,,,dating,,

Things were okay for the first three months or so, but after he had a life altering moment which I won't describe here for the sake of privacy, he started to change.

I tried to support F the best I could during this time. At some point his mental health was falling apart and he started to act a little paranoid. It was expected, since a major life shift happened. I let it go, excusing some of it as stress.


Unfortunately it started to get a little out of hand between us. F was paranoid that I was talking about him negativity between my friends and family. I assured him this wasn't the case but it kept becoming a topic after I would ask him why his mood was so poor.

The next level of paranoia comes with him explaining to me in an accusatory manner that I was sleeping/flirting with his friends. I had met this person once (he introduced us) and that was it. And I definitely hated this person's guts so no, wasn't into him lol. There was also mentioninv that he thought I was sneaking men into the home at night when he wasn't there. Also untrue. At some point he even went through my phone in front of me, looking at my conversation on SM etc.

If it was only a one time thing I think I could have managed, but it became a thing that happened like twice a month or more. And it would always end with us both crying because he wouldn't believe me, and he was frustrated with everything.

At some point he got upset with me because I was liking a certain persons posts on social media and that turned into a big fight over ""respecting"" him. They weren't abnormal posts, and nothing that would make someone think it was inappropriate to like these posts.

The last straw for me is when we became long distance because of my career. I was busy for a couple of hours so I forgot to text him back. He tried to call me but I was busy so it went straight to voicemail. He was upset, and asked me for a photo of my location. While I agreed for the sake of not starting a fight, I was extremely mad and uncomfortable with this request and for me it cut very close to the lines of abuse.

I asked for a break the next day. We eventually broke up because he couldn't take it. I left a lot of details out, but I think what I've shared is enough.

As I write this - my doubt of my sanity is slipping away but I still feel like somehow I fucked up. What do you think about this? Was there something I could have done differently to change the outcome of this relationship based on his strange behaviors?

what really made me traumatised since yesterday is that i had too much of the pain i get multiple times.

a lot of Guys just literally went so Romantic like they're talking to forever but sooner or later, they will just go away and abandon me. i had too much of it that made me traumatised.

Since i am in the same-sex male dating sphere, it is hard because most or at least many, of the Guys i encountered just primarily want fun or online hookups after all. this is why it's hard in the homosexual dating sphere.

Alright, so I'm pretty torn about this and not exactly sure how to feel. Last night I went clubbing for the first time with friends from a college club. 


We met up beforehand to pregame and in that time I got drunk and started getting touchy with one of the girls there who gets buzzed. I'll call her Lily for the sake of this.


 Eventually, we go to the car as a group to take a drive to the club. In the car, on the way to the club, we get a lot more touchy and start kissing. Once we get there she takes my hand, leads me to a spot where we dance, and kiss some more. We part ways for a bit and I hang out with the guys from the group. She comes back around to find me, and leads me back to the spot, where she grinds on me and we kiss. At this point we are very drunk.  



After that, we wander off again and I chill with the guys. This time, she comes back to us and happened to bring a guy with her, who's also intoxicated. We'll call this guy Sam.


Sam was trying very hard to get her home. Apparently she knows Sam from meeting at the club before, but he seemed like a complete stranger to me, judging by his behavior. 


I was very suspicious so I told him to back off, and she insisted that she knew him.  I told her that I wanted to make sure she wasn't taken advantage of. 


Then she tells me that she'll be fine and some other nonsense(she was literally fucking cross-eyed while talking to me at this point). I said whatever and I walked with the girls back to the car, while the guy followed. 


She was stumbling and shit so me and one of the girls had to carry her back. We get in the car and they want to drive to Sam's place to fuck, so I just tell the driver to drop me off by my car, about 20 mins away. 



During the drive, Sam, still drunk, starts heavily flirting with Lily and the other girls but the way he spoke was fucking slimy. He was saying stuff like, ""Hey Lily, remember Tom? Tom is so hot, right? Yeah, you're going to get with Tom. You like his lips?"" She was drunk as fuck and being agreeable. Then he calls his buddy and says he's bringing along 3 girls. 
And this entire time, I'm uncomfortable as fuck and looking in digust. 


The driver finally drops me off and I ask her if she actually knows the guy and his intentions, since he seems so sketchy, and she says yes. Then she asks if I'm upset and I just say that I wanted to make sure they're safe. Then I leave to get to my car, and sleep the alcohol off. 


It's been 2 days and I've been thinking about it quite a bit today. We're not in a relationship but what Lily did rubbed me the wrong way, given that she was being intimate with me beforehand. I have to see this group of people again, excluding Sam, and I don't know how I would handle it with her. Do I just act as if nothing happened or what?

Relationship Advice

1. I met a girl and the first time I saw her I thought she was the most beautiful girl I have ever seen in my life. Honestly, I could not believe she was even talking to me. We spoke online for a few months before our first date.
2. After our first date, I thought she was the one. All the years of working and suffering finally paid off and it was all worth it.
3. I found some  deal breakers about her past. I thought about it for a while and realized it didn't matter, that's who she was but not who she is now. If anything I respected her more for it.
4. After a few nights together, she requested no condoms. She had an IUD and I accepted, my thought process was if she would get pregnant I would do my best and she would be my family.
5. I really believe we can understand each other better than anyone else due to similar trauma and help each other grow. She is good at everything I'm bad at and vice versa.
6. We spent the next few months dating and my goal was just make sure she was happy. I'm doing well financial and with work so trying to make her happy was more of an honor that anything else.

Fast forward a few months, she breaks up with me saying she doesn't like my personality and does not see it working out intimately. I was shocked but she wanted to stay friends. We spoke for a bit and then one night I founded she slept at someone else's house. I blocked her the next day but she called me one last time. I told her to forget me.

I'm not sure it was the right move. She doesn't want to date but I really think she's the one and I don't want to move or settle for someone else in the future.

Here‚Äôs the long story, I moved from Georgia to Utah about 4 years ago. I came with my immediate family and have loved living here since. I met a guy on Tinder and we really hit things off. We both moved here from GA, we‚Äôre both half Mexican, really family oriented, and just a bunch in common. We have been talking for a couple months and have not had sex but we have exchanged pics (before we found out). I have never met someone in my life who I have felt more compatible with and I really thought at first that this was my person. I finally found someone who treats me like I deserve. What we have is electric and this is the first time I‚Äôve ever felt like this about someone. Here‚Äôs comes the big drop, he noticed that his grandmas brother had commented on one of my pictures on IG, provoking him to ask how he was related to me. Upon further research it turns out that his grandmas brother is one of my dads 10 aunts and his uncles that my dad never knew. I have an absurdly huge family. I had some of these family members on my social media but never even knew how they were related or anything about them. We shared no mutuals friends. There was no indication we were even remotely related. I moved here from across the fucking country, away from everyone I have ever known. Somehow I managed to start talking to a long lost fucking second cousin. Now here‚Äôs my dilemma, what the actual fuck do I do? I have such strong feelings for this man. I really saw myself having a future with him. I am falling for him. I don‚Äôt want to stop talking to him. But I can‚Äôt help but feel wrong for wanting to continue a relationship with him‚Ä¶ I just found out today and I have been a wreck over this.

I met this guy three years ago and I instantly found him attractive. We had the same sense of humor and many things in common. I met him through an ex-friend of mine. We were from the same College. I was 17f and he was 20m. I think he saw me as a kid. He did called me a pretty girl but he was trying to make me feel better since I was feeling sad. He also posted a pic of me on his social media, but he is sort of a photographer. Two year after that, I went through a rough patch because I moved to another country. His understanding and our constant banter made me fall for him just way harder. December 2020, another friend convinced me to confess my feeling to this guy. I did over text on Christmas Eve. I told him I didn‚Äôt expect anything because I lived far away. He told me he liked me back and he wished me well. We didn‚Äôt speak about it after that. We kept on talking as we usually did. Nothing changed. But I felt some type of ownership. Not like I thought he was mine. More like we both liked each other and in other conditions we would date each other. I wanted to know if he still liked me months later. I told him I found it funny we never talked about it ever again and he told me something like ‚Äúwhat do you think what my deleted messages are about?‚Äù. I got nervous, so I changed the subject. I really like him, and I deeply care about him as a friend. . We mess with each other but it's just playful banter. Recently, we were talking about an ex-friend of his that broke up with her boyfriend. He used to like her so I asked him if he was still talking to her, would he try something with her? He said, laughing, ""of course"".

I guess I feel stupid because I want to know if he still likes me. I am visiting soon for 2 months, and I am going to meet him, but I am not sure if I should try something with him. The thing is I would love to date him, but I know long-distance relationships suck. Should I do it? Or is it just a mistake? I just don't want to regret.

Two guys and two girls, and the girls bring up sexuall harassment and how fucked it is and then my crush says that she has been lightly harassed before and almost all of them have been some sort of friend. I  lose my mind, did I do it too?

Anyway, we take taxi to club together and about 2 hours in I‚Äôm walking around and find her hardcore making out with a girl. I go up and ask out what‚Äôs going on and she says she says she wants to go home with that girl.

I think it‚Äôs crossing the line. You can do whatever you want but I‚Äôm not ok with this.‚Äù Right away she says she‚Äôs really sorry and that she‚Äôs glad I set that boundary.

We get back to her place and I figure I‚Äôll smash because why not. Then next morning talked about it saying it‚Äôs disrespectful and she agrees. She feels bad. Anyway, we cuddled for a bit, smashed, and then I kissed her goodbye.


1) How bad is what she did? We have never talked about what we are and never had an exclusive talk.

I was exposed to sex at a very young age and from then I guess I would consider myself hypersexual. After I officially lost my virginity at 18 I was off to a slow run into my early 20's where sex was like something I felt I had to do to keep a man, and at times I did feel liberated and enjoyed sex as an adult. A really huge turning point for me was an age gap relationship I had where the sex was very good, but I felt manipulated and used. From then on I had sex here or there, but for the most part I've been abstinent for the last 4 years or so. I also worked in highly sexual environments as a stripper for the past 3 years and then a webcam model for a about 2 years. During this time I virtually had no sex, because I wanted to prove something to myself I guess and I also didn't really trust myself. I chose to get out of the sex business to live a ""normal"" life, and date, but still abstinent, and I don't feel pressured to have sex, but I do want it. I'm not a fan of casual sex, but I do want some kind of casual/beneficial sexual relationship. Realistically I don't think I can just share my body with a person and that just be that. If I know myself I will want more.

Ok so fast forward to this weekend. Friday I randomly met a man, and hung out with him friday and we had some sex play. He was high on cocaine and his dick didn't work do I let him give me oral and masturbate me. I kinda wanted sex, but the feeling was confusing. A part of me feels like I'm going to ""mess up"" my abstinence as if I'm on drugs and relapsing and then theres the ""no strings attached"" thing that I just can't get jiggy with. I could probably screw him twice until I know I'd want more. I also want to get married one day and have grown to subscribe to the ""no sex before marriage"" thing which seems to help me weed out the guys only wanting sex, but I also want sex sometimes. I kinda still wanna screw this guy lol but he's got a hectic life too with the cocaine habit and stuff.

We chatted for a while then decided to meet up for a coffee.

It was nice, she told me she likes plants, and I have an allotment, so we talked a lot about different kinds of plants. She was really into medicinal herbs etc which I'm not really, but it was interesting. The date went well. Until we left the cafe.

We weren't in a countryside area, just a town, but it was one of those pretty streets which have little trees along it. After we left, she suddenly stopped, closed her eyes, sighed and said:

""The trees whisper words which we can never understand.""

I was a little taken back and unsure what to say. So I just awkwardly laughed, and then things went quiet. When we parted ways she seemed a bit off-ish, and when I got home she text me saying she 'felt very unheard at that moment.'

I explained it caught me a little off guard. And while I liked plants, I wasn't really into the idea of talking trees, but if she was that was cool, it just came out of the blue and I didn't know how to respond at the time.

She then went on a rant about how the earth needs us to be it's voice. How she will speak for it and how she can teach me to do the same.

When I questioned that she said ""We can never understand"" she went on to say that not all words are verbal and that we were texting right now which proves that.

I replied stating that she said we can't 'understand', not that we can't hear.

She then replied there are other ways of connecting and that my plants are likely calling out for me to hear their unspoken words.
