1,pe997u,1630290878,"I am 22, attractive and cannot find a gf. I’ve tried everything. Help","I first want to start of by saying two things. First, is I am not here to present myself as a victim. Before I began writing this post I lurked around and I saw many guys try to act like a victim when it comes to stuff like this. I’m all about personal responsibility and I sincerely feel like there is something within in that I need to change in order to fair better with women. Having said so, the second thing I would like to say is that I’ve literally tried everything. When I say everything I mean everything that I can think of

I’ve tried an platonic approach as friends. I’ve tried a strong approach letting a woman know I’m interested in that way. Ive tried tinder. I’ve tried bumble. I’ve tried Reddit. I’ve tried real life cold approaches. I’ve tried women at work. I’ve tried literally everything short of buying ass from a chick on the corner. Heck I’ve even tried a combination platonic and strong interest and I’ve had no success. 

Now, I do consider myself a highly attractive guy. If you would like to see what I look like in an effort to be constructive don’t hesitate to ask me and I’ll figure out a way to send you a picture. For some reason I cannot add it on this message 

Furthermore, I feel like I’ve done everything right. I’ve gone to college, I’m a self driven guy, I have a couple of business I run. Not even just from a career perspective but also in other regards I am very funny, highly charming, and a pleasure to be around. So many people have told me I’m so much fun and easy to talk to

So in closing, I would prefer ladies opinion because I feel like they might be able to see things from that side of the table. But I am open to every perspective. 

I need to know what I am doing wrong so I can find a gf. I hate being alone and I wish I could just find that right woman already!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pe997u/i_am_22_attractive_and_cannot_find_a_gf_ive_tried/
2,pe9acm,1630291002,How do you avoid catching feelings too quickly? I’m super nice/open and it’s often mistaken for a mutual depth of attraction.,"Hey fam. I’m M32 and married at 19… Haven’t been single since my young teens and don’t really know who I am as a single man. While married, I made myself emotionally unavailable to mostly all other women that were not my partner. This was a defense mechanism to cope with my own protective/jealousy problems…. “I wouldn’t want her to feel what I’ve felt emotionally” type of mentality. 

Well… We are pretty awesome together, but it’s ending so we can get out and become who we need to become. Aaand im absolutely terrified / already being pulled into certain peoples gravity.

We have been separated for a few months now and the most I’ve done physically with another woman is a fist bump… But when we talk... “That” feeling of connection arises so easily that it feels like im getting messed with. 

After talking to me for a short while, they start dropping hints about roping me in and being connected in all these deep ways. This has already happened a few times now. It feels like I’m being manipulated but in a way that they would believe to be innocent.

I hope you know what I’m getting at? Maybe?

Anyways… How do I protect myself and others from getting too attached and infatuated too quickly? I have a strong loving vibe that people tell me about and I’d hate to hurt someone when I didn’t intend to. 

My submissive mirroring/niceness gives the illusion that I’m some kind of soul mate material and suddenly things get too intense. While I am totally ok with opening my heart up to them, I do not want to be roped in and feeling like I can’t escape their gravity. Or better yet feel guilty for misleading them.

Talking about it directly is simple enough. Im more curious about how to avoid the need for those “slow” down talks.

25/F , good paying job, own home, vehicle etc . (Not that that truly matters) 
And a HUGE family person. I spend more time with my family than actual friends.. 
With that being said.. 
I’ve never been in a REAL relationship. I’ve “talked” to plenty of guys, hung out with them, had a good time but they would never ask me out or anything of that nature.. even when I attempted on my end to let it be known that I do like them.
It never fails that they get into an actual relationship soon after me making it clear to them. 

Recently, I met a guy on Tinder. 32M
I’m VERY hesitant anyway when it comes to Tinder and online dating. I don’t trust it..

I gave it a shot, we went out, made it clear we were both interested in the same thing. Great. 
At this time we were both talking for about 3.5 months or so.. maybe longer. 
I attempted to explain to him in the beginning that when I’m not working 60hrs a week, I’m with my family spending time with my grandparents (I know my time is limited with them) ultimately he told me he didn’t like I spent so much time at their house and would like to be invited.. 🧐
MAYBE I’m wrong. 

We’ve only been talking for a few months
He asked to move in together 
Talked about having kids.. (His body count 22, mine 1 just an FYI) and would get upset that I wouldn’t sext him


I told him he was moving to fast an ultimately we parted ways but he has recently started trying to get back in contact with me , which is fine.. as friends. 
Am I wrong? 

Now I’m back to the single life

8,pe9lc1,1630292231,"Awkward ""friend"" situation"," 

Hey guys, 23M here and I am in a very very odd situation.

So here’s the story:

I started hanging out with this girl recently. We hung out 1 time years ago and she recently got introduced into my friend group. So I started hitting her up, making jokes about the time we met up 1 time and never spoke again and then we started hanging out again.

So we hung out together at her house, took her on a date, after a few times we kissed. As time went on, things were going good. Fast forward, we got into arguments, eventually told each other we’re not good for each other and that’s that. I helped her family move out of their house and I think she saw another girl texting me? Something like that anyway. She started crying and she said something along the lines of “I really like you, but you just do stupid things sometimes” and I expressed to her that basically I don’t know what to tell you. But after a while, I was like alright. Told her we can be friends and see where things go. Days/1 week later I expressed to her that I can’t be just her friend and these are the things specifically that I like about you. Being “friends” didn’t last long. We started hanging out again, getting more and more feely, cuddling, holding hands, and then we finally broke out and had sex. 2 nights in a row. 

But after the 2nd day, she started being weird and getting distant, no physical contact, nothing. I finally confronted her about it and she confessed to me that she just had gotten from an engagement with someone who was an absolute asshole and told me that she wasn’t ready for another relationship. She’s expressed this to me before. She didn’t want to make me a rebound and still needed time to recover so that she wouldn’t “lose me permanently” if we jumped into a relationship prematurely and that she had feelings for me. It made me slightly upset. I felt used and expressed that it made me upset. She said that she isn’t ready and that we can be *friends*. She also expressed that she’s uncomfortable with people liking the idea of her (which I’m assuming is just sexually/physically) and so I agreed. Mind you this girl has expressed to me how she feels about sex. She wanted to wait until marriage and has only had 1 other body which has her ex fiance and doesn't take sex lightly.

But naturally, I’m not very fond of the idea because I don’t like being friends with people I’m romantically interested in. So we fought more and more. I expressed I didn’t want to be friends with her, that I'm not desperate and I have other people that want to talk to me. She got offended and said “if you’re not willing to be friends with me it makes me question your true intentions and motives” I told her all my concerns about the whole situation. She expressed that she’s not talking/seeing anyone else, talking to anyone else, that most of her relationships have stemmed from friendships and has given me examples. Told me the one time it DIDN'T and she got fucked over. That was her ex fiance and she said everything was rushed. Told me while it would upset her, she’d be okay if I started seeing other people. I told her that I didn’t want to. She found out the other night that I was speaking to another girl and expressed that it hurt and that she isn’t going to do the same. Because we hang out nearly everyday. I distance myself and act uninterested. She still does the things like subtle physical contact, or touch me, grab my ass, grab my arm, poke me, little stupid things but nothing like kissing, cuddling etc etc. I NEVER initiate contact with her. For fucks sakes, we've slept in the same bed and when I had work in the morning, she was grabbing my arm and rubbing her hand on my chest when I woke up.

And here's where I'm a little fucked. I like her family a lot and her family likes me. I help them and they take care of me, feed me, appreciate me, tell me I'm part of the family etc etc. I care about her and have an attraction to her. HOWEVER, not just specifically in a friend way and I made that EXTREMELY clear. She told me that doesn't believe there's such a thing as ""friend-zoning"" and that things can still progress. I take her to school, still continue to help her family and her, and spend a lot of my free time with her, get to know her interests and passions, debate things, etc, she looks to me to make decisions sometimes, help her, lift heavy shit, man stuff. Part of me wants to believe ""okay, well we did kind of rush things and we need to see each other for who we really are. stick around and it could blossom into something greater."" but the other half of me is like ""dude you're being friend-zoned, stop being stupid and stop giving this girl so much of your attention and time willingly. find someone else."" And so I do, I don't text her, I distance myself and she begins to start putting more effort in subtly, and being more flirty. She initiates most of the hanging out. Invites me over to the house to eat and hang out. There's no way I spend this much time with her and her family for her to fuck me around and be interested in someone else and playing me. I'm confused. I acknowledge the fact that there's a slim chance what she is saying could be the case and MAYBE things could happen. But I also am not entirely comfortable with the situation and want to set my foot down.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pe9lc1/awkward_friend_situation/
9,pe9o71,1630292530,"what am i doing wrong, that i repel men? advice needed.","my question might come off as rather shallow at first glance, however i can assure you it is as genuine as it could possibly get. what am i doing wrong? what is it that compromises my chances of getting into a relationship? what particular traits that men look for in a woman, do i lack and is it possible for me to gain them?

for the record, i am a young woman in her late teens, legally an adult, and i have yet to be in a relationship. i have never been engaged in a romantic connection with a man before, nor have i had my first kiss either, which is quite embarrassing to admit, nevertheless necessary to confess to in order for my question to make complete sense. 

i have spent my teenage years and (very) early adulthood surrounded my happy couples, all of my friends, regardless of gender, having been involved in numerous relationship and also… intercourses, with me always being the third wheel, the only one left waiting for someone to notice how miserably single i were the entire time. (i am not saying that i value romance over dignity or my moral values, and i am certainly not the one to say that a relationship is necessary for me to be able to validate myself.)

guys my age hit girls up all the time, ask them out early into their acquaintanceship and are utmost straightforward with their motives, or so i have noticed from the interactions i have witnessed so far, however i have never been even mentioned in a conversation by men, always being discarded and completely disregarded while they talk about their female colleagues or friends, me being one of them.

i have been told initially by my female friends that it is all because they believe i am out of their league, however i am self aware and realistic enough to acknowledge that this is just a vague excuse for me not being enough even taking into account as a potential date. my question remains, why exactly? i am in no way detached or aloof, i am actually quite sociable and outgoing and have no ‘enemies’ whatsoever.

i am not popular, but not disliked either and i am as friendly and sociable as possible towards everyone, and people tend to compliment my personality and openness quite a lot, which makes me believe that my demeanor is not what keeps men away, especially since i also have a significant amount of guy friends, that i interact with on a daily basis, as well. i found it inappropriate to ask any of them what makes me repel men, as they are all in relationships, and i regard it as odd to question them concerning this. 

in terms of looks, i could not say i get complimented, and i am not confident about my appearance either, thus i never post on social media either, unlike all of my female friends. i am not certain whether i could be regarded as average or below average, as i do not stand out in any way. i am well aware most men claim that looks do not matter too much to them, but i am also rather certain that it is a half truth and appearance is definitely a crucial aspect.

i am blonde and blue—eyed, big eyes, long hair, small nose, okay face shape, i guess? not to tall, not too short, 5’9” and 115 pounds. my skin is clear and i have very good hygiene, i am quite slender, however i do not have significant curves but dress according to my body type. my fashion sense is not too flashy, i prefer being modest, yet still appear confident, both with my wardrobe and the way i carry myself. i wear perfume and noticeably take care of myself, so it is definitely obvious i care a great deal about how i present. 

i am not athletic either, and i mostly spend my time either studying or reading, so this might be a turn off, i guess. i do not have anxious tendencies, however, and behave well and easygoing when the circumstances require it. i have really good grades and were top of my class since primary school, lost many friends due to the sole fact i got multiple scholarships, as i used to be part of an exceedingly competitive friend group, but that is not entirely relevant. 

i have a great relationship with my parents, am productive and i believe well—mannered and spoken, can cook, and have my life together, at least from my point of view, so what exactly am i doing wrong? i did attempt approaching certain guys, and they have all dismissed me as anything but a potential partner, always playing the friend card and never showing any interest in me, so at some point i gave up. i am well aware i am not special, nor interesting, but none of my female friends who have scored several boyfriends, are, either. 

i am seen by every guy i know as the ‘female friend of the group’, while all of my other girl friends are known as ‘the cute girl’, ‘girl with big boobs’, ‘the hot chick’, ‘peng bint’, ‘sexy’, etc. i may lack sexual appeal, indeed, and i seek out advice as i have grown tired of being overshadowed and continuously dismissed by every guy ever. so, men of reddit, offer me some assistance as i am quite desperate :)

16,peaeoa,1630295523,"21 and still single, can't seem to relate to anybody let alone men. Want relationship but its easier staying single","Not sure if this is the right flare or not, but felt like posting about issues on a related sub I guess. I don't expect anything out of it just want to share experiences and maybe see if anyone else has the same issues.

I'm 21, female, and have never been on a date nor do I seem to attract men.

I often wonder if this is something wrong with me; after all I don't show my face on the internet(anymore) so maybe the lack of my face adds to it, or something. But even on certain sites where I had male friends/people added(Facebook, namely) and some individual friendships with men I never seemed to attract any. I also mental/depression issues and social anxiety which has kept me from dating. I don't want to be the clingy emotionally damaged girlfriend which is likely to happen.

  
I guess it's not like I'm trying that much, I've kinda hoped a guy I end up dating would be someone I had a friendship with before hand and it just sort of ""developed"" into something more. I haven't been putting myself out there, much if any. I've debated tinder but a lot of dudes on Tinder just kinda want sex and I'm not in the mood to get casually plowed I'm looking for companionship. I assumed I would've lost my v-card by now because all my other friends have but I guess if I wanted that trophy I'd just go on tinder :/

All my friends are either married or dating and I'm still single.

I find it hard to relate to anybody, let alone men. I've been told multiple times on multiple sites over the years that the people I interact with think I'm male. ""You talk/type/act like a man"" whatever the hell that means. I assumed I would get along with men, I prefer them as friends and feel I relate to them more than my female friends on certain levels. I was boyish growing up and closer to my father, I like boyish things so I assumed my boyish interests would have men more interested in me but I think that has had the opposite effect. Given I've been told I come across as a man multiple times over the years when nobody has seen my face, clearly something about me as a person online comes across as ""male"".

I have guy friends, none of which I've considered dating. Not because they're ugly or aren't nice, I just don't feel anything towards them like that. I can only think of one guy I ever felt anything romantic too and he turned out to be a asshole(also, he turned out to be gay) and I haven't felt like that towards a guy sense. A few of them have been interested/asked if I'd be interested in dating but I don't feel like right admitting to them they're be the ""practice boyfriend"". Not a single one of them has one thing in common. They all play games I hate, watch movies I'm not interested in, two of them are furries which I don't relate too/I have issues with furries. They're fine, they do not sexually harass me but furries are kind off my dating list for reasons.

My parents seem to think internet dating is a bust and I should ""date in person"" but everyone out here in the sticks of Texas are country hick bum men(the ones my age) half of which don't own pcs or know anything about video games. There are no video game nerd types out here. I literally cannot relate to cowboys roping cattle, chugging beer and talking about their trucks and work.:/ I've not tried internet dating yet but I think for a young person it is my only option.

I don't think its a requirement for dating, but literally none of the men I have ever interacted with(even including the guy I really liked) had any interests similar to mine. Not even my friends like the same things I do.

&amp;#x200B;

How do I meet people that fit my ""requirements""? How do I meet men in general? Tinder? am I not trying hard enough? Am I too boyish in how I type? Is there some secret to dating my homeschooled-hermit-ass has not yet found? feel free to share dating advice

So I just entered a new relationship a 2 months ago. 

We had an argument and apparently I gave him attitude - all I did was ask for an apology and he told me:

“I was giving attitude” 

“ watch who you are talking to” 

“ who the F do you think you are talking to like that”. 

I was not rude, I didn’t cuss. I just expected and NEEDED an apology.


The tone, the words he used I felt intimidated and scared. His face changed. 
It was aggressive. 


Who talks like that? Am I over exaggerating? 

“Who the F do you think you’re talking to” 

That one hit hard. I immediately backed down.

I joined them for a bit and chatted briefly about stuff with her before she and her roommate left.

Now I’m sitting here kicking myself a bit for not getting to know her a bit more, though it was tough with other people around directing the conversation.

31,peboiw,1630300936,"3 months after breakup feeling violated, used, empty (23f) rant","You ever read ""the giving tree"" when you were younger? Thats me, the stump. And that boy will never come and sit on me as an old man because he is a huge narcissist. He will never know how much of me i gave. Lovingly, i gave it all. I will make another silly analogy to our relationship. I was the faithful golden retriever to an abusive owner. No matter how bad he treated me i was always so excited to see him. Everyday for all four years. 

He talked the big talk, and i blindly believed him. So i kept reaching and reaching inside myself to satisfy him because he always knew what to say to make me feel like what i gave was never enough. And he whole heartedly believed it. Do you know what its like to give someone the best parts of you just for them to tell you that their shit? 

Its been three months and I've been through ups and downs. Ive been loving myself and all that jazz, going out with friends, sometimes talking to guys. But i dont look for anything too serious (havent hooked up with anyone either). I do okay in the daytime usually. Until lately. Night time i am tortured with dreams of him almost every night. I wake up randomly and then cry. My sleep has been terrible bc of this too. I was being punished while dating him and i am being punished now. Why? I got the short end of the stick either way. 

We dated for four years. I loved him everyday. Writing how much stuff i supported him through would be too much to write. I know in my heart even though i was not perfect, that i tried to do right by him always. I supported him through very intense physical and emotion moments. 

Everyone talks shit about their ex but how he treated me during the relationship and how he broke it off was so fucked up. I dont want to get back with him. I wish i would have gotten the decent breakup I deserved instead of what he did to me.

I hope i can continue to be good and not let this bitter me. Its a battle everyday and sometimes im afraid he broke me 🤷🏻‍♀️",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/peboiw/3_months_after_breakup_feeling_violated_used/

I want him to watch the shows and play the games I enjoy but in the middle of it he goes off and does his own thing says the things I like aren't really his cup of tea or just gets on his phone.

During sexual things most of the time I'm pleasuring and doing the things he wants me to, when he goes down on me he barely does the things I ask him to do and he doesn't really do it for long yet I do things until he cums. When he does cum I of course ask to get eaten out or anything but he just says that he's tired or it's time for him to take me back home. I did draw the line at one point when he asked me to do something I wasn't comfortable with since he doesn't do any of the things I requested.

I also ask for cuddles at the end and he does only for a little bit then goes and does whatever

There's other small things but at this point I kinda gave up, no matter how many times I talk to him about these things nothing really changes. I know this doesn't sound like a big deal but I've just accept and do everything he wants me to and he doesn't really want to put effort into the things I enjoy like I do for him and I'm just getting frustrated and feeling like I'm alone.

46,pecr6t,1630306082,Ha!!! I was right!!!,"So a few months ago I posted here detailing my encounter and the replies made me feel like such a jackass that I deleted the post.    So let's recap: 

I go to the post office to mail a package and this hot girl is working the counter.  She notices that I live in a very small town outside this major city we both work in. She comments that she lives there too, and in fact, turns out she only lives less than a mile away!  As we continue the small talk she tells me *exactly* where she lives.  ""Down this road, all the way, and I'm the last house on the left.""

And I froze because I'm thinking: This lady just told a complete stranger where she lives.  I was kind of taken back by this, and I'm very shy so talking to girls has always been hard for me, and I'm all the sudden finding myself wondering if she's interested.   So again she makes sure to tell me EXACTLY where she lives.  By this point she had taken my package and my time in the post office was over.  We smiled, I left and went outside absolutely blown away and wondering ""did she want me to come over!? ...like really!!! Why else would she tell me exactly where she lives!?"" 

My question here was: did she really want me to come over? 

I was met with replies telling me how creepy it would be for me to show up to her house (part of me agreed) and what a weirdo I was for assuming such a thing.  One said ""she's just a nice lady doing her job.""   ...I wasn't aware giving out you homes location to men you've never met was part of your job.  Anyway, I felt like such an idiot I deleted the post.

So over a month goes by and I go back to the post office a few times but I never see her again.  A few more weeks go by and I get this random ""like"" on an old public FB post and I go to the profile and guess who it is!!  Post office girl!!  Yeah, her!!

49,ped845,1630308445,"I wish she’d just tell me she’s not interested. But, I also wish I didn’t care so much.","28M. I met this woman via Tinder. Which is mistake #1, I assume. I was impressed with not only her photos, but her confident and proactive nature in terms of her making the plans. After a few brief messages, she suggests a day to meet. I tell her that day works fine, get no response. I try to play it cool and wait two days and figure I’ll just shoot a follow-up text to check in with her the day of the proposed meet-up. It had been five days at this point from her suggesting, three past my last text, so my expectations were next to none, moved on. Anyhow, she responds and says she’s busy, but instead lays out an entire date proposal with the restaurant and everything for another day. She even books a reservation for this vegan pizza place. I’m not vegan, but I’ll sure as shit be for her for at least one meal. And she figured I wasn’t one, so that didn’t seem to be an issue at all. The pizza was good. 

Anyhow, she also straight up told me, not asked, that she was driving out to me. Plus the pizza spot is in my neck of the woods, she lives across the Bay Bridge in Oakland like, over ten miles away; me in SF. Seeing all this effort on her end made me tidy up my room and do laundry prior just in case she stepped foot in the jerk-off den. 

I go there first, snagged the table and patiently waited. I made sure to stand up and greet her with a hug as she arrived.

We talk over the meal until the place closed, hours passed. We both had two drinks each and she insists on paying the check as my card is already pulled out. I seriously don’t expect shit for paying, but the fact that she drove all the way to me made me feel like it was the right thing to do. She says it’s fine, she just got a new promotion or whatever. I tell her to let me at least pay half on venmo, and she says to get her back in the next. Tight - works for me. We both smile.

As we’re leaving, she says she has to go pick up a friend from a park in the city. I see it as a clever out on her end, until she suggests we have time to walk to the beach nearby. This took the pressure off though, now I don’t have to try to invite her over. Mind you, it’s now dark, so things are clearly comfortable in my mind. She shows me some cool stargazing app, walks barefoot in the sand. She calls her friend after maybe 15-20min and I begin to walk her to her car. I ride a motorcycle, and took an uber because I figured we’d drink. I tell her I’m gonna just uber (barely a mile to my house) and she offers me a ride. To which I say I wasn’t gonna ask for and accept. 

Dropping me off, she goes in for the hug, I’m a horrid closer on first dates, probably why I never really get second dates. I am a big ball of anxiety in those final minutes, never knowing what to do. We talk about hanging out again and I get out. 

I text her the next day (Friday) to tell her I had a good time and to make sure she got home okay. She double texts and asks how work was for me with a smiley. I’m feeling good about this now and send a normal response. I wanted to mirror her effort and suggest a second date, but it seemed rather quick, so kept it simple and polite. She doesn’t reply, she did this before; fuck it. I’ll wait for her - kidding. I only made it to Sunday night, before asking her if she went skydiving (something she said was a 50/50 for the weekend). So, sort of a double text, but A) first was a reply to her and B) second was a random one two days later about a crazy-cool potential decision. Well, no response. That was maybe six hours ago. Time to give up. 

Maybe she died skydiving, that’d be sort of morbidly funny in a movie situation where the guy is just beating himself up about thinking she moved on. 

Anyways, I wish I didn’t care so much about whether or not she texts me back, but it’s gonna eat away at me for a bit. The only silver lining here is that every time this happens, I always try to improve. I just thought I did alright, and that we had a lot of things in common. We both had crazy solo travel stories, both new to analog photography, blah blah blah fuck this.

I’ve been talking to this man for just over a week. Everything in common, amazing banter. It’s safe to say we became obsessed with each other.

Today we have been chatting but the connection is so off. He’s taking a long time to message me back, we haven’t been joking around and I can just tell he doesn’t want to talk to me. No compliments or affectionate statements. He’s even been a bit short and rude to me today. 

I’m obviously disappointed because I was invested in him. I realize this is a lot of my fault because I drank too much and my verbal filter wasn’t working well.

54,pedqqz,1630311126,Some hope for nerds,"This post is intended for people who have had the same problems as I had. I am a nerd, and a proud nerd too. The type of nerd who played World of Warcraft the majority of his days and his desk with figures of Roman emperors.

You may be somewhere in your mid twenties eager to date someone, and having this haunting thought of ''no one ever wants to date me''. I'm *not* going to tell you that I have a magic pill for you because I don't, but I will tell you that it is not as bad as we think. 

**What went wrong**

For the longest time, I always tried to impress girls with the most petty crap like my watch or the investment that made me a lot of money. *Spoiler alert: Don't do this*. I pretended to be this guy who had everything in place, I created this ideology of the ''perfect guy''. Didn't work. I could tell how quickly girls would be disinterested. I was ignorant about this whole process and blamed it on my height, my big head and the gap in my teeth I back then hadn't fixed. Date after date failed and then the best thing happened. I got tired of pretending.

**Things changed**

I decided to ''grow the hell up''. I went to my date with the intention of ''I honestly do not give a shit how things turn out''. I'm just going to be myself, talk about my interests and listen to her, I'll probably never talk to her again. For the first time I was myself, I was calm and didn't boast to pretend I'm someone I'm not. Instead, when exchanging who I was, I told her I love to read books, craft wallets by hands and spend way too much time on this game I'm trying to quit. She appreciated the honesty, and she could see that despite my dorkiness, my heart was at the right place. For the first time someone wanted a second date with me. We're now living together and I can tell women became more interested in me. 

**Controversial topic**

I know the name Jordan Peterson might be controversial to some people, but he taught me to be humble, mature and spoke in his videos to me like a father I never had. I believe this is what shifted the attention of women towards me. I grew up. And this is by no way meant to be a pat on the shoulder for myself. I know how difficult it is, so I'm hoping that one person will read this and thinks ''you know what, maybe it's my me that needs to change''.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pedqqz/some_hope_for_nerds/

On my end, it was an impulse thing but I couldn't tell if he was skirting around the topic or something so I told him that I just thought it'd be funny as a status since it'd be funny if I did get a response. 

Fast forward a couple days of daily chats, I grab some breakfast and he starts sending me song lyrics and tells me to guess their song titles. We did it back and forth for a few days straight every time we were both up (we're on opposite timezones), but he'd always be the one to start his lyric game without a prompt.

The thing is, none of the lyrics he sends are romantic or love songs or anything. They're all rap and hip-hop ones from artists he follows. On my side, I send some romantic ones, some rap, some rock, some musical ones so I don't give full love songs either.

So I'm confused if this is some way to get me into the music he listens to (we listen to very different music genres), if this is some flirting method that I'm unfamiliar with, or if it's just some game he enjoys playing with me.

So just a bit of back story. We met around 3 years ago on holiday. She was there with her best friend and I was there with mine. I’m 20 (M) and she’s 19.
We hit it off etc and things between us progressed when we got back to England, even though we lived 3 hours away from each other. We both liked each other but I decided to call it off as it was never gonna work out due to the distance. 
A year later while I was down near her for work staying at a hotel, we met up and had a good catch up. Nothing nsfw happened. 

We’ve remained really good friends since and speak occasionally, there’s even been times where all of us have suggested meeting up like old times. We were still really good friends, and I thought we had a good friendship

Anyway fast forward to today.
I sent her a message the other night suggesting that we could do a surfing trip down to devon (just the two of us) and what her thoughts would be. She sounded really enthusiastic, so I sent her across a few nice looking hotels we could potentially stay at. 
The next thing I know I’m blocked.
I send a message to her on Instagram saying ‘have I done something wrong?’ And just apologised if I had.

Nothing back

I’m not sure what could have warranted a block considering she’s also suggested at times we meet up while she’s at uni.

Always said she was bored we broke up twice and got back together I broke up one of those times she did the other. I was working an apprenticeship at the time 7-3pm everyday, played sports, worked  out hung out with friends. Took her for dinners , movies , aquarium. She started drinking and going to birthday party’s all the time at clubs bars sometimes while I was asleep for work. She never really worked a real job maybe just 2-3 days per weak.

Down to the issue I was in love with this girl even though I knew I was being treated poorly she slept in my bed everyday for 4 years. She’d constantly say I’m so boring but if I asked what she’s bored about she would not know what to say except like let’s go for a random drive and you know just dumb bullshit. She finally ended it with me, we mutually agreed was for the better as I was sick of it. I am a slight introvert with a bit of extrovert I usually video game 2/3 hours day hit the gym work 8 hours make some food and watch Netflix. Weekend I like 1 off day and 1 fun day.

I feel like the last relationship was more of her problem with drinking and being very young probably wanting to party and I’m not big on partying she had no hobbies except her phone and Netflix.

This caused me to try online dating and I slept with like 7-8 girls in past 4 years and just was emotionally numb to even date longer then 2-3 weeks worried that I’ll just get boring to them I don’t know what women expect out of relationship not everyone has a 10 friend group like the tv show friends to call over all the time like life is fucking boring when your not on vacations.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/peeqjx/need_advice/

A few weeks ago she told me she had a dream about having twins, then today, she said “I had this weird dream. The only thing I remember is bikes and babies.” I would dream about babies too if I talked about it this much.


We were talking and she said “Why am I hornier on my period?”(I’m think this normal) I replied “I think that’s normal” She then says “I think i’m pregnant”, and what’s funny is she says “I think i’m pregnant” almost every week.

She says irrational stuff like “My back hurts, Do you think i’m going into labor?” OR “My stomach hurts, Do you think it’s the baby?” What the fuck?


She also “pretended” to have a kid with a celebrity(that’s just her) then said she’ll name it “Christian” which is my name. She said “If it’s a boy, I’ll name it “Christian”. Good name.”

A few weeks ago we were chilling while watching a movie and she said “That baby is so cute.” and she kept bringing up the neighbors kid that cry’s 24/7.

She even said “Imagine having kids yuck, I can barely take care of myself.” (how ironic she keeps talking about it).” I replied “yeah” She said “I never want kids. What if it turns out like me?” I jokingly replied “I will be annoyed by it.”

Picking between girls

I like two girls, I don’t know which one to go for. I work with both of them. I’ll call them Girl 1 and Girl 2.

Girl 1 talks to me a lot, we both joke around together a lot and both of us tease each other and when we have to do group tasks in work she seems to want to pair with me. I think she likes me, she always laughs at my jokes and stupid things that I say, Conversations aren’t awkward, we always have something to talk about. I’ve caught her staring at me sometimes or looking at me and smiling. Good personality, good looking, get along well together. Funny.

Girl 2. I’m 100% sure girl 2 likes me because she always finds a way to be around me, always laughs at what I say, staring etc etc but she is very very shy. She’s kind of starting to talk a bit more maybe because she’s getting more comfortable around me but she is shy. She doesn’t continue conversations much but it’s due to shyness I’m sure if it. She doesn’t start conversations much but she is starting to do it more.

Both girls are are good looking. I’m guessing I should probably go for the one I get along with better?

71,peftkg,1630321270,Searching for an advice,"First of all, I’m sorry if the story seems a bit erratic.

I(F, 23)’ve started a new job a few months ago. A few days after, I met this super cute co-worker (M, 22), I could tell we both felt attracted to each other since that moment. We went out, as a group, a couple of times and then once, after work, just us and one more colleague. We ended up having sex that night and then spent most of the next day together. We went out once more, just the two of us, before he had to go away for a business travel for a few weeks followed by another 2 weeks of planned vacation. We haven’t spoken during that time, he never reached out to me and the time I texted him to ask how he was doing, he answered very briefly and seemed uninterested. It hurt a little, but I tried not to focus on my feelings and hoped it would soon go away. 

During the time he was away, I met another guy(M,25), a friend of a friend. Talking to him was extremely easy and I opened up to him about my life very quickly, which has never happened to me before. I got very drunk during a party he organised and we slept together. I didn’t remember anything the next day and was only told about what happened by him. It felt strange, knowing I was still thinking about the co-worker and missing him and yet I ended up sleeping with someone else so soon. We met twice after that - first time we met for a drink, I told him I wasn’t interested in anything more, that I really appreciated the time we spent together and all the things we talked about but that I wish that night never happened. He told me not to worry about it and that sex sometimes is just sex. Then the next time, he asked for help with something and I agreed to come over to help out. He tried to kiss me and again I told him I wasn’t interested. He said he understood and that the last time we talked I didn’t directly say I’m not interested so he had to try one more time to be sure. Then we talked a little and I wanted to tell him that I had feelings for someone else but that’s when I found out that he is quite a close friend to the co-worker, so I figured it was better not to tell him. 

Around that time, the co-worker came back, we kept smiling at each other at work and then about a week after, he asked me out. We met and he kissed me straight away. I was rather surprised because it seemed like the time he was away never happened, he acted as if we were in the same place as when he was leaving. We’ve been seeing each other since that time and it’s been great - though the thought of having slept with his friend is eating me up from the inside. I’m not sure if we’re exclusively dating or not, or how he’d react if he knew but somehow not telling him makes me feel like I’m not giving him the choice to decide if he still wants to see me. And I’m scared that if I told him what happened, it would hurt him or that he wouldn’t want to see me anymore. 

I’m not good at understanding how dating works these days, what’s okay and what isn’t. I’ve only ever been in one, pretty long, relationship. 

Anyway, I feel that chances of the co-worker finding out that there was something between his friend and me are quite high, which is why I’m not sure what should I do - just act like it was nothing and own it if he finds out or just straight up tell him about it once the time feels right (if there ever is a right time for such a conversation)?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/peftkg/searching_for_an_advice/

I have fun with him on the dates, do feel like we have a good amount in common, and we are similar ethnic backgrounds (South Asian) which I value.

We have gone on 7 dates (dinners, activities) all planned and paid by him. I limit contact in between dates unless he reaches out but am warm and open on the dates, which I believe is key to building the relationship. He keeps asking me out so he must have some interest in me.

He has not made any moves on me though in 2 months aside from hugs. No kisses, no handholding, nothing. He’s mentioned a previous gf so this cannot be all that new to me.

Besides that he doesn’t do much to increase my interest or be a gentleman to me. In fact he has been 5-10 min late on almost every date that we’ve been on and has never verbally expressed how he feels about me to my face.

What gives? Why would he keep on asking me on dates if he’s not romantically going to make a move?

I’ve stepped up my flirting game, grazed his hands, and even leaned back to allow him to step up and still nada.

I think my next step is to tell him when he asks me out again is:

Xx, I’ve had some time to process and I feel like I am on a different page than you. Dating is a lot of fun but the intent has been in hopes of a romantic interest eventually for me. I’m feeling confused about where you lie and feel like I need more clarity by this point

81,peguh0,1630325534,What to do- first day few months back,"So I met someone from Tinder once and the date was great, which we both agreed on.

The person later wrote that day and I failed to make up for a new one. I sent some awkward message some days later to get back into it and got an awkward response aswell. I think we both did not know how to act tbh.

Well, the person was busy at that time and we failed to meet up again. We both wrote irregulary to try to meet again, but some cirumstances played into it and we both did not meet up. Suggestions came from both sides and I was unsure to meet up aswell tbh. I once wrote it feels difficult to plan a new date and the person trys to fit everything together under one belt atm but can't gurantee anything.

A bit later I stopped writing on whatsapp after a response, because I felt like I carried the convo and the person didn't ask questions back to keep it going until something new is planned. I reacted on one insta story a week later, but there was not enough to build trust I guess so I feel more comfortable at new meet up aswell.

Texting wise the person was completely different than at the date, but I often find people like that and before the date the person wrote exactly the same.

Yesterday I saw a new post and I asked myself. Did I cancel the conversation, because the person kept the convo going and didn't ask questions and I just cut it there? Like if you talk with a friend and somebody says ok and the convo is temporarily over at this point until the friend asks something completely different a few days later.

The date was in May, I don't even know why we still follow each other. I thought about sending a message again. But I have a feeling at this point it is awkward and I don't know how to put it out swiftly. I think deleting would be a shame without giving it one more try.

82,pegxm9,1630325874,Partner and I have two different beliefs when it comes to religion.,"Good morning all, I (29M) am dating (29F) and have some concerns regarding the future. Some back story: She and I have been close friends since we were 14 years old and have an amazing relationship. However this core difference poses issues for me.

I was raised in a conservative household, attending youth group on Wednesday and church Sunday mornings. In my adult life, non - denomination Christianity is still a part of me. I am not heavily involved in church but do still attend Sunday’s. I’m a down to earth guy who is very laid back and enjoys a good time (I don’t have harsh views). 

She was brought up attending church occasionally but not as regularly as my family did. Her mom believed in God but her father did not. Out of love for the Mother, her father attended church with them. My girlfriend believes in God (she is not atheist or agnostic) but she is fine leaving it at that - The acknowledgment of God but not needing anything further. She believes in having the best morales and ethics as an individual and thinks she should be that way herself, not due to a higher power.

Now we’ve known this difference for many years, even before dating - in fact, it’s why we did not date sooner. However, she had come interest interest of following Christ, so we had some agreements.

The agreement was that she would continue attending church with me and that when we had children down the road, she was comfortable with them attending church and me leading the house in that direction.

Now the more we talk, the more she seems to be unsure. She still gladly attends church, prays with me, and is open to devotional…. But she doesn’t believe a child should be “molded” to believe something until they are the age to determine for themself. 

I’m unsure what to do as we are best friends and have a love for eachother like I’ve never known possible… we’ve loved eachother for 14 years. I am respectful and understand that you cannot force your beliefs or opinions on others. To each their own. But the thought of having a child and her possibly not being comfortable with the youngster being intentionally raised to believe in God really bothers me. Since that is what I follow, it feels like my responsibility to raise my child in it. She does not seem concerned and peacefully / confidentially said “don’t worry, we will figure it out babe”

84,peh8oh,1630327042,Should I finish losing weight before dating?,"(25M) The past two years I took an ass kicking from mental issues, stopped dating to focus on that, and in the process I gained a TON of weight. 

I’m down 80lbs now with maybe another 40-50 to lose. I want to start dating again. I’m happy with everything else in my life, career is going well, my own apartment, a pet, and after 3 years of therapy I think I’m better rounded.  The only thing missing is a relationship. 

I’m just not sure if I should keep waiting to date when I’ve already lost 2 years to this. I’m thinking I’ll be done losing weight around January, but then I’d just wait until after Valentines Day to avoid that early dating awkwardness. 

On one hand I want someone to like me for who I am and me getting back into shape a bonus. And I’m putting off my life by constantly waiting. 

On the other hand, I’m obviously not as confident right now, I’ll get less (but probably more genuine) matches, and I probably won’t attract anyone I’m attracted to",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/peh8oh/should_i_finish_losing_weight_before_dating/

I’m conflicted because the logical side of me knows if I’m thinking about him then he would be too if he liked me and him not responding is showing he me that he probably doesn’t.

88,pehser,1630329071,Going on third date and haven't kiss her yet.,"Hello everyone,

So I've gotten out of a 3 year relationship about 3 months ago. Totally my fault and I'm continuing on working on myself in terms of communication, affection and putting in effort in a relationship. Left me devastated but gave me an appreciation towards the experience throughout and things I've learned and skills and traits I have to focus on.

Fast forward to now I am feeling much better I'm over my previous relationship and focusing on myself, career, happiness and health.
A new smoothie shopped opened that I've been going to very frequently and there is this cute girl working in the front. 

I followed her on social media and just started talking about her pet cats where she's from and getting to know her. Eventually I asked her to come with me to my favorite coffee shop and we talk for a couple hours and still just getting to know her and the basics. Afterwards I asked if she wanted to play darts and we left played for 30 mins or so we then hugged and parted ways.

She was very sweet and texted me she had a good time. So did I but I didn't necessarily felt a big connection or chemistry. I've been out of the dating world for a bit and I'm just a spring chicken of 22 years of age, with meh self confidence that I'm working on. 

Fast forward a week I ask her to play mini golf and we didn't talk much about anything just focusing on the game and having fun with it. Afterwards we had dinner at a small Greek restaurant and we talked for 3 hours until they closed just telling stories and getting to know each other a bit more. Movies came up in the conversation so we left and watched a movie that turned out to be lame. Some how we held hands on the last 5 mins of the movie. We left,  we didn't kiss just said our goodbyes. 

She texted thanking me for a good time and we agreed to hang out again soon.

So now, I'm no sure what I'm doing. I'm not suavè, and I don't have that much in common with her other than liking animals, working out and being foodies. I don't sense that chemistry or spark but I enjoy her company and think she's interesting. I don't know if I should be messaging her until our 3 date so she doesn't lose interest. I was planning on going to a roller rink since she said she likes to skate and then maybe just eat something small and walk around the city. But I'm honestly kinda lost. I like her and she seems like a wholesome girl. I would like to kiss her next time but I'm not sure if she's the type that wants to be asked or just go for it. She's very much about respect and I don't want to disrespect her boundaries if I just go in for a kiss. Should I tell her I like her at this point? I don't want to mess this up to were it gets awkward cause I go to the smoothie shop almost daily and I see her there but I don't want to miss a opportunity because I'm afraid of a bit of awkwardness and rejection. I wouldn't mind being friends because she's cool but I'd like to go out with her.

This was constant for about 5 months. I am not someone who needs to talk to my partner 24/7 I work a full time job as well as have multiple side sources of income. So the morning and night texts with a bit of conversation in between was wonderful. But he recently added a new partner into his life in July. Since then, I’ll be lucky to get either and the conversation during the day has subsided substantially. Even though I still send him a text every morning and night. I know there comes a point of comfortability but I can’t help but feel like the interest is no longer there now that he has someone new.

92,peij4i,1630331604,"Is it weird that I, as a guy. Turned town a potential one night stand?","I recently met a new group of friends that are alot more out going. We all decided to meet up at a popular bar where they have a live band and great outdoor area. During the night I’m just opening up, personality wise and talking to these new folks. I’m pretty introverted but I’m trying to be more social so that I can more opportunities pop in my life. 

At one point in the night, I’m pretty tipsy and one of my new friends goes over to a table and brings these girls by. We all start to socialize and I start talking to this one girl. She’s kinda drunk and I have no idea where the convo is going but at one point gives me her number. She leaves with her group of friends to a bar that’s downstairs and wants me to join them. But I decide to stay with my friends. During the night we are texting and I’m getting the hint that she wants a one night stand. Which I kinda wasn’t prepared for mentally. I was also drunk at that point and it felt weird to try and hook up with someone that barely had her eye open and was walking around like a baby deer in high heels. I also felt like even if we did go back to my place that I would pretty much pass out immediately. Since that’s exactly what I did and me being really tipsy didn’t help that I probably wouldn’t be able to even get my dick up. 

So I ended up texting her that I was heading home. That I did enjoy her company. That I’d love to take her out sometime. She said she would love to see me again and that’s it. After I asked her to text me when she got home. She never did. So I just assume she was looking for a one nighter. Kinda sucks because I knew it would end bad but I still liked her enough to maybe try when we are both sober. 

I’m kinda overthinking it I thinking it and maybe I should’ve gone through with it? But I’m not sure if it would have ended well anyway. Which is kinda why I kept my distance. But now I’m beating myself up because this was a chick that was way out of my league and almost everything I found attractive about her.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/peij4i/is_it_weird_that_i_as_a_guy_turned_town_a/

Corporate Recruiter 
Single with no kids 
6ft 175 
Black


I currently live in Ohio and I’m relocating to San Antonio this fall for a fresh start and new opportunities in my life then being stuck in my awful state. 

I visited the state and enjoyed Austin a lot more but was too expensive to live so I chose San Antonio and got an apartment already approved for me this fall. 

How’s the dating scenes and are the women in SA or Texas in general more hospitable and nicer than the Midwest women? 


I don’t ask a lot I just want a feminine woman who won’t discard me for someone else and isn’t full of herself, somewhat active and without children since I don’t have. 


Is it best to cold approach or go to events to meet women? My tinder account got banned but I’m mentally over using dating apps due to the low results and being rigged for women to make things happen and start and end relationships and conversations. I refuse to participate in those apps anymore due to constant disappointments and being unmatched after I asked for a social media or number after hitting it off with a woman due to her unlimited options it’s frustrating as decent guy to deal with shit like this. 

Any advice or tips of San Antonio dating or Austin dating will greatly be appreciated. I would like a relationship but it seems like situationships and flings are more popular I don’t want that no more something real will be nice.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/peiya4/the_dating_scene_and_making_friends_in_san/
