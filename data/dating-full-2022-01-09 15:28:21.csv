We met at a club &amp; started having sex and hanging out with each other. I saw her around 6 times before winter break (also exam season so less during that time). We always had a more than casual sex vibe together but we would text irregularly around this time and she took longer to answer texts etc. Nonetheless on dates/hangouts she had already given me a nickname we had a good vibe and I even cooked for her etc so we definitely liked each other more than just sex. I told her the last time I saw her before winter break that I'd take her out in January and she was excited, we had only texted on phone and IG since and we added each other on snapchat for the break to send pics etc.

Ever since I said I wanted to take her out and got her on snapchat we've been talking everyday for 18 days straight now pretty frequently during the day flirting/talking/planning things. Over the break we've planned more potential food dates we wanna go on, shes talked about forcing me to watch certain shows, asking me questions about my day everyday and she started sending hearts saying shes excited to do x and x with me. Also responding way way quicker than she would over text. She was supposed to be back in a couple days but her friend and her family invited her to go to Fort Lauderdale for a week. So I won't see her for another week.

We haven't had a DTR talk yet I was planning on having it pretty soon after she gets back and I take her on a proper date. I want her to have a lot of fun on holiday but I kept thinking about her going out and maybe hooking up with other people. Ik I can't claim her now or be technically ""mad"" but was curious as to peoples opinion on whether it would be normal for her to hook up on holiday with someone now or if its likely she would not do something like that given the direction we're going.

I'm sorry for the long read, but It's really important for me. I think about it and can't focus on my winter exams because of that. Thanks for your advice.

&amp;#x200B;

I and my female 32 y.o friend have known each other for around a year, and we were chatting every day since then and became best friends. She is already an established self-confident woman, already has a great career. We were living in different cities, but every 3 months, we usually have a meetup together. She helped me a lot with becoming a better person with her very useful advice and life experience, and she said what I helped her with my own advice, motivation and my ambition as well. We always have topics to talk about, we always have fun with each other and what is insane - even with her age, she stays very innovative, open, and young-minded. She looks very beautiful, in her 30's, she looks very young and even better than a lot of girls of my age. 

And yesterday, she confessed to me, what she likes me. I've been thinking, and I think I like her too.

I'm unsure about everything. I have a lot of concerns about this, and these are my main points:

&amp;#x200B;

\- I Feel like I've been slowing her ambition down. She was planning to relocate to another country, but now she's considering do not do this. If she decides to relocate then what is the point of the relationship?

\- I've never had a relationship before. I was cringey about this stuff, but now, it's hit me back. But I'm so inexperienced. Nor do I have an experience or time for a serious relationship. I'm studying in uni right now, working on a job, and was thinking about trying to found a startup, and I don't think I have much time for that. Also, I don't think I can act ""right"" in a relationship, again, because I didn't have one.

\- Age gap I think is quite big. This will show up in family and friends social interaction and etc. I feel this is gonna be a problem for both of us.

\- I'm still unbelievable young. My brain is still underdeveloped, and I can change so much in the next 5-6 years, so I would be a different person, not the person she fell in love with. I can become a worse person, and I really don't want to destroy our connection by that.

\- I don't want to ruin our friendship. Even If I decline, I know what we still will talk about with each other, I think we even gonna be more connected because both of us can joke about this story. But If I start a relationship and if smth bad happens, I'm not sure if we are able to stay friends after that. And even, I still have such friend also while having another girlfriend of around my age, so it's good from both worlds.

\- I feel like I'm not seeing something. Something obvious, what can be bad for me in long term.

&amp;#x200B;

So, this is my main concerns. Do you know couples who have such a gap in age? What do you think about it?

I (27M) been on 3 successful dates with this girl (25F) I met via an online dating app. We progressed slowly but surely, as all bars and restaurants are closed in my country right now, the dates took place at my apartment. I understand it can be weird for girls to meet someone they barely know at their house, so I didn't want to scare her off and take things at her pace.

I was a bit nervous for the first date, I was afraid it was going to be awkward and then we just would be stuck in my apartment. But it actually went great, we talked and laughed for hours. We had a lot in common, so I thought this had potential. We held hands on the second date and cuddled and made out a couple of times on the third while watching Netflix. She responded well to my texts and all seemed to go well.

Then comes today, we arranged a date at my house. I thought we'd be continuing the Netflix series we were watching, cuddle up on the couch on a lazy Sunday. But she actually gave me the talk that she thinks I'm a great guy and she likes me, but not in a romantic way. This took me by a huge surprise. After talking about it she left.

Now I do appreciate that she came over to tell me this, and if she doesn't feel it, it isn't going to work. But I got this feeling of emptiness right now. I have to start all over again after I thought we really had something going.

Hi all 22M here and the the past years my dating life changed before that i had no problem with rejecting and stuff but since i loved a girl everything hurts more or i dont know. I would like to tell you several stories so its easier to see the whole picture. I would like to know why or where i fail.

Story 1: So i was dating this girl , we met several times , i think she was really into me when we met she couldnt stop hugging me and we were kissing a lot , a really enjoyed it. I started to fall in love in her , she said stuff like "" i think i love you"" and "" are we a thing now "" i thought im on the right track toally she even met my mom. After that we had sex and after that she changed. I dont know thats becouse of the bed experience or its the other thing. But she was losing intrest , One day she texted me that she is not in love i was so confused. However i did bad and started to convince her that we can fix this, she even said that she might be lesbian, ( of course now she has a boyfriend) the thing is after our ""breakup"" she invited me to her home it was kinda fun but she would let me kiss her. And then she was in the bed so far away doesnt even talked to me like im nothing to her. I know i did bad that i stayed there and hasnt left. I should have gave her space. I mean its okay if things not working but if i dont know whats the problem , i cant change.

Story 2 : Same as before we met we texted a lot had an awesome date , we were just watching tv and kissing. But for several hours. She said she had a good time. But after that i couldnt get her a new date becouse she were busy and so as i. We finally managed to meet after like 1,5 week. But she changed too, i mean she was hoenst with me we had the big talk and we said that we can try this with less meetings. I thought cool. So several days later i asked her out and she just said that se cant do it. Maybe she was already seeing someone else.

I could tell several stories but theese are the most hard that i lived. I know it could be worse but somehow im never good enough for someone. Like in a party i was talking to a girl we were dringking and half an hour later she already kisses someone else. ( But i know lots of girl does this at parties) So my question is am i too needy ?

So, it should go without mention that I am one of the weakest ""scorers"" in my friends group, given that I am on Reddit. I was hanging out last evening with some of them, and of course the discussion drifted toward women. A while later, as I was thinking through the conversation, I asked my best friend about a particular guy, who seemed much more successful than the rest of them. Now, I should mention, he looked similar to me (5 foot 10-ish, dirty blonde, in reasonable shape, at best a 7.5/10). He told me that this guy scores by ignoring girls who might otherwise receive tons of attention. To paraphrase my best friend, ""their egos get hurt and he piques their interest"". Now, my retort was that this could maybe work for hookups, one night stands, but not for a LTR or some such, but no, no, he had some of those as well. Mind you, the girls he pulls aren't too bad either, certainly beyond him in terms of culture or intelligence (given that I was classmates with a couple of them). 

And yet, even though I trust my friend and this has been confirmed by another friend, I can't wrap my head the logic of this. None of my close friends got together with their partner without some sort of mutual interest, and most if not all of my dates were based on the same principle.

I understand not swooning over every single guy that might pay attention to you, but ignoring all of those and instead going for the one who cares the least, and not only banging him one or more times, but also even getting into an assumed relationship with him?

I can come to my own conclusions here on why she’s not responding and just assume she’s uninterested now hence the ghosting. Sucks but it is what it is. It has now been 7 days since then

I'm not sure if this falls under dating but,


I have this girl I like and I've been trying to win her over for a good long while now. It hasn't been easy. At first, things were going good. She even said she has feelings for me. But lately she's been getting more and more distant. There's a lot of factors that went into it. We stopped seeing each other in person because of covid. College pressures and personal problems began bothering her. Then another guy came into the picture so now she apparently likes both of us. More than once, she stopped talking to me because of personal reasons, and at one point she told me she wasn't choosing either of us because she was ""choosing herself"".

Now I understood all this and I wanted to respect her choice, but she keeps coming back and talking to me and calls me by the nickname we gave each other. She's dropping these hints that she still has feelings for me, but as soon as I ask, she retreats back into her shell. I don't want to pressure her because she's already pressured enough as it is, but its infuriating and heartbreaking to be going back and forth like this. I don't even know what she's thinking most of the time because when I ask she just hides.

I've tried the ""give her some space"" route, but what ends up happening is she just stops talking altogether. And this whole time, I'm just sitting here wondering if she's forgotten about me. I've tried asking her what the problem is but she gives these vague answers and again, goes silent for a long while.

I've had so many long talks with her about trying to be more open with me to make things easier for both myself and her, but that's gotten nowhere.

And on the times that we do meet, it's like nothing happened. She's just all smiley and happy (which still makes me happy too, despite of all this shit sjdnskdns) like nothing happened

She keeps apologizing for being so secretive, and then goes right back to being secretive

Its the same cycle over and over, with me being confused on how she feels, her refusing to answer me straight, her hiding from me, her coming back, us talking again and becoming closer, and then her getting all distant.

I'm just confused and if any of you read this far, please give some advice. She isn't a bad person. I believe she just has trouble with all this and that she can't really process stuff like this too well. Problem is, I also have trouble with this and I'm constantly thinking about her and how she feels. It's like I'm in limbo just waiting for her to confirm things.

This was few weeks ago.

On Tuesday at work we agreed to go on a date on Thursday around 8 pm to a restaurant and that we would talk later to confirm. On Tuesday after work we continued messaging until late at night when she didn't reply my last message.

On Wednesday we didn't talk during the whole day, and around 11 pm I text her: ""to avoid misunderstanding, tomorrow we won't go on a date ""(with a thumbs up emoticon, that I erased right away - I don't know if she saw the emoticon). Half an hour later, around 11.30 pm, I call her and she didn't answer the call. (She saw the message and the call and didn't text back).

On Thursday afternoon I texted her asking ""if everything was OK and if she was offended by anything I did"" and I said that the message I sent her on Wednesday night (""to avoid misunderstanding, tomorrow we won't go on a date "") was a question and I forgot to put the question mark.

Everything was going perfectly fine, he was really happy, introducing me to all his friends and his family in just first 2-3 weeks and was saying that he still couldn't have believed how he got so lucky to have someone as beautiful as me. We come from different countries and he had moved to mine few months before I met him. He was so excited that was even showing his friends who live abroad my pictures and telling them that I'm his girlfriend now and then would show me how they had reacted to the news. Long story short he was really happy and so was I.

After around first 2 months he got emotionally unavailable, was tired all the time and acting a bit weird . I tried to talk to him many times and asked if something was wrong or if he had any problems but he'd always say that everything was fine and I had nothing to worry about. After some time we had wild argument about him not being as attentive as he used to be towards me and so I initiated break up. He was devastated and I was even more. After around two weeks he texted me saying he was sorry and also he admitted having serious alcohol issues and that was the reason behind his unusual behaviour. (I knew about his alcohol issues but didn't think it was so serious that he was staying up and drinking at nights alone). It was hard but I took him back and he promised he would work on his problem and I told him I would have helped him.Around a week ago I was staying at his place and for the first time ever I thought of going through his phone while he was showering and I found him texting one of his exes who lives abroad and was telling her to come with him on his upcoming trip to another country where he had to go due to his work. Then I also saw him planning to meet up with a girl who he barely even knows on his trip to the ski resort which he had to do without me because I had to work and couldn't join. Moreover, he had replayed to some 3rd girl's story on IG saying she was really sexy. (all these i saw within just 5-10 minutes)

I was shocked and he still blamed it all on alcohol and claimed that he was usually doing silly things after drinking and thats why he wanted to stop and there was no way he would have met up with any of those women. Of course I didn't believe him and left after telling him it was all over. He was texting me afterwards and still trying to fool me and make me believe that he wasn't planning to cheat. I'm devastated and would never have imagined he could have done things like this. I really loved him and would do everything to help him to overcome his problem but this I don't think I can forgive.

We have hung out a handful of times, 8 times over 3ish months. But we met on tinder and the first couple dates weren't really real dates, more just getting to know each other.

I'm 21, he is 24. I haven't had sex before, I just haven't found someone I am really emotionally interested in. So sex still feels like a big thing for me. Though I am very comfortable around him I don't feel ready. The issue is that he is ready now. 

I told him I won't be ready to do anything sexual until a lot later in the relationship and he said that was fine but I have a bad feeling about it. It really caught me off guard he would bring up sex so early on and it makes me think we are not on the same page at all. I didn't see him for a month before this due to christmas break and we haven't even talked about being exclusive.

He said all the right things to make me feel better at the time but I don't believe he isn't disappointed. He won't tell me anything other than he dosen't mind waiting, but I am sure he has feelings he won't share. Im worried he may be reconsidering things. I don't want him to build up frustration about this over time. I'm worried this might make us incompatible. 

Is it possible that he really dosen't mind waiting significantly more time if he already feels at point where he is ready to be intimate? I really like him, I don't want to end things.

I was talking this guy for 3 months (but never met in person) he was somewhat of an enigma at first but as I got to know him , he was a very l, emotional, angry, “I hate the world” type of dude. 😐
He never fully expressed why he was that way but he said he had been through a lot of trauma and let down by others, especially his parents… I wanted to understand him. 

In the beginning of December, I kept bringing up that we should finally meet in person. We had only known each other through Facebook through pics and posts. Hell, we never even talked once on the telephone. I would beg and ask him to send me an audio of his voice to at least hear what he sounded like..

Anyway, I kept suggesting we go and catch a film. He would turn me down every time and pull the, “I’m still busy with school card”. He started telling me that I was being vindictive but I didn’t understand where he was coming from because if you ask anyone who knows me I am a very nice and caring person, and pretty damn funny. I’ll do my best to lift your spirits up and crack a
Smile on your face. Well, not the case with this guy. He all of a sudden ghosted me. Blocked me on text messages, blocked me on Facebook and Instagram. I was shook and shattered. I accepted it and went on with my life until he returned a week later.
He said I was pressuring him on dates and he wasn’t comfortable enough yet to go on the 🤔 (I found that odd when he was the one that planned a date for us when we first started talking in November,
Planned to watch Ghostbusters in theater) Anywho, we made up and he said let’s make this work and take it slow. I agreed. It was going well the next two weeks until Jan 4th. He up and ghosted AGAIN. This time I have no freaking idea why…. And it is still driving me crazy and I am completely heartbroken and shattered all over again. 

I was been really nice, being respectful, not asking him out, still getting to know him. So why did he ghost me?! What is this dudes deal?!! 

I feel stupid and disrespected. I know now that I deserve soooo much better. And I promised myself if he pops up and texts me again I am going to straight up tell him to FUCK OFF.

Tried to work things out, but we confirmed us as over at the very start of October 2021.

Now I dated in October and saw someone for a few weeks that I used to work with, not a rebound (but accept that some may see it like that)! During this time I realised what I had been missing, not just during the 2021 but more importantly from my previous relationships. 

So my issue is, I’ve signed up to Bumble. Chatted to a someone last night until 1am talking about zombie apocalypse plans and where we could steal a helicopter from. She asked what I’d done that day, and I told her I’d been to see an apartment and had also hosted a viewing on my house as it’s for sale.  She ended the chat there saying that she didn’t think I was ready. 

My response was that “I can’t prove I am or am not ready for a relationship, however I know my housing situation is far from ideal, but I’m comfortable talking about it. You seem really awesome and I fully respect your decision on this”

So I guess if anyone has got any advice or been through a similar situation, please chuck a comment in!

I was in a short relationship for a few months, then was dating immediately after that ended and I went on to date a little bit more, finding one guy that I liked a lot but things ended in sort of a complicated way. 

I’m a very analytical person, work-oriented, type-A. If I could get what I wanted professionally and academically by over-analyzing and sticking to a strict list of what I wanted, then my dating life could work that same way, right? Wrong! I found myself in a series of situations that went too fast and crashed and burned. I was so obsessed with having the safety of a relationship. In my mind, having that security allowed me to figure out if they were genuinely a fit AFTER we made that commitment. I went back and forth deciding when I should have sex with someone, if I could handle casual (which I could not), etc. 

After things ended with the last guy I was dating I was devastated. He was so much of I thought I wanted in a partner, but I let my insecurities build up and eventually got angry at him about the lack of commitment after 3 weeks (yes, I know, insane) and things ended. In retrospect, we probably weren’t the best match, or so I tell myself. I was much more into the idea of him and who I wanted him to be than who he actually was. After being ghosted by him, I spent 5 months reflecting, readjusting, spending time with myself, finding myself again, and figuring out what it really was that I wanted. 

It was after this time that I decided a few things. 

1) I don’t want to get in a relationship with someone that I don’t really know. I want to see them when they’re happy, stressed, upset, etc before deciding if I want to commit to them. That takes a while. I have to give people time to show me who they really are.

2) I need to hold off on sex. When I have sex with someone that changes everything for me. Sex is great but it makes me feel like there is more at stake than there really is. I’ve only had casual sex once, but I have never felt less self-respect and less control than when I did. It just doesn’t work for ME.

3) Now when I go on dates instead of sitting in front of someone analyzing if they could be everything I want in a partner, I simply enjoy my time with them. I don’t have any expectations, I don’t owe them anything, I simply enjoy getting to know them and sip my drink. I view it as an opportunity to meet new people, network, make new friends and see what happens.

(M22)

Hi guys, getting kinda bummer out to be really honest. I can't talk to my friends since they don't get me and all are pretty much in a long term relationship so I don't think they can relate to me at all.

I'm 22, self employed and since I'm a freelancer, I mostly work from home, based in a small village. I'm not in college anymore and because of CoVid, all venues are pretty much locked down. This means I can more or less only meet girls through social media or date the ones I already know.

I get replies on social media and manage to hit off quite a few conversations. Some of the girls I talk to accept my invitation and we go out for drinks mostly, since I like to do something casual for the first date. I try to keep the conversation light, fun and about her and they seem to enjoy my company, laugh a lot and are receptive to my flirting, touching, etc. I usually combine drinks with a short walk afterwards, where I make a move most of the times to ""close the deal"" or at least see if it is going somewhere.

Now if that's relevant at all, I'm 5'9, 170 pounds (trying to get leaner), short beard and short hair. But for some reason, I simply cannot attract great looking girls to go out with me again, even if we kissed at the end. For example, in the past 3 months, I went out with 6 girls, kissed 3 of them, I got kiss-rejected by 2 of them and with 1 it didn't go anywhere. Out of those 6 dates, 5 of them (including the ones where I thought it was successful because we made out) didn't want to go out with me again and  got some wishy-washy excuses like they aren't looking for a relationship right now, are still hung up over someone or did not feel what they should.

Looks like I just cannot attract any girl in a sexual way and it's starting to make me feel kind of sad, even depressed on some days. Looks like something about me just screams out ""don't fuck me"" or something and I cannot figure out what it is. It's getting hard to be in this game for so long without success while my friends are happily in long-term relationships, dating, hooking up and having time of their lives while I'm here being invisible to other gender or something.

I try to follow all of the dating ""rules"", showing intent, flirting, touching, escalating, showing genuine interest and I really want to find a girlfriend for a genuine relationship, not just bang them. But looks like something about me is just not making any girl feel like this and sometimes I just think it's better for me to stop trying for a bit and trying to get in a better shape or something and maybe then somebody will find me worthy of being together with. This might all seem really negative and needy, but truth be told, I don't even care because it's really starting to hurt. I really don't want to be that ""weird"" guy that's always single, always alone at gatherings, friend dinners, parties, etc.

Maybe I am punching above my league and should start to date down? Or just stop dating altogether and trying to find my peace alone?

I’ve met some girls that reciprocated interest in me, some where we talked for a bit met up and didn’t feel a spark, and some where I was interested but she wasn’t and vice versa. 

Last night I went on a date with a girl I’ve been talking to for a few weeks now. She seemed sweet, cute, kind and had similar interest as me. I kind of messed up by showing up to the date about 3 minutes late bc gps said the place was 20 minutes away but when I decided to leave gps said it’s now 30 minutes away due to traffic. I told her before hand bc I felt shitty for getting to the place after her. 

Anyways I get there and I accidentally startled her since she was standing looking at her phone waiting for me and I said her name. She didn’t know that I was there since I didn’t text her saying that I got there. I was rushing to get to the place. Another mistake of mine. 

We talked and things got a bit awkward. She was very anxious and I knew she was anxious bc she told me she was. It was her first online date and  playfully said “ohh so I popped your online dating cherry, what an honor!” Or something to that nature. I sensed that made her uncomfortable so I changed the subject and talked about my hobbies, what I study in grad school, etc. We both studied politics in college and we are both left leaning so I decided it would be interesting to see her perspective on things. Usually on a first date I refrain talking about politics for obvious reasons but with her it just made sense to me. 

Anyways, most of the time we spent together I could tell she was just not interested and/or extremely anxious. I did most of the talking and she seemed very simple with her responses if she even said anything at all. I felt a lot of pressure on me sube she was like this. We had planned to go by a nice view that I know of that’s nearby where we were hanging out and she didn’t want to go bc she was scared of getting in my car?? She didn’t drive to where we were meeting she orders an Uber there and I offered to drive her back home but she refused. 

I was like okay then that’s fine text me when you get home I guess. I was very confused and upset bc shit like this makes me feel like some kind of weirdo or predator but I don’t think I did or said anything to that nature other than that stupid cherry shit

Currently dating long distance (3 states away), can see her every 4 weeks or so due to logistics/time.

When we see each other it's usually for a weekend. When we were together (work proximity, shared stressors, life) we were inseparable. 

But now that stress is adding to dilute the quality of our relationship. Neither of us seem to be synching anymore. It's also got me wondering if our relationship worked because we were ""teamworking"" through a shared experience of something very high stress, and that camaraderie made the adventure a lot of fun. 

But now she's going through a lot of therapy and self discovery, and I'm supportive, but it feels like I'm facilitating the process more than growing on my own. There's nothing fun about it. Nothing carefree or loving. I feel as if I were a therapist and she a client. When we talk on the phone i know she wants the relationship but I feel like it's forced on my end. I intentionally miss calls from her because talking to her for 15 minutes because she's busy with everything else in her life is exhausting. 

I'm more than happy when she's here or I'm there, but when we leave i feel like I have to put my emotions on hibernation mode in order not to get riled up or frustrated. 

We have plans to relocate in a year, but even that would ""maybe"" afford 2 weeks on and 2 weeks off due to the specificity of her job.

One of the pieces of advice I (M25) got was to be more open and passionate in expressing my feelings/goals. I  had a first date lined up this Saturday so I figured I would give it a shot.

At first the same nervousness and self criticism made me overly polite and boring. Eventually she (F23) asked me why did I become a history teacher? I decided this was the time to try being more expressive, so I started talking about it.

I explained how I feel people have the wrong impression of history from bad teachers and boring teaching methods, that history is not names and dates but is thousands of very human stories filled with people with the same thoughts and desires and worries as us today. History is a series of movies and novels, of poems and plays, tragedies and dramas and everything in between. All I am trying to do is develop that appreciation for history in a interesting way for my students. Basically the same speech I give at the start of the year to my classes.

I ended up talking probably too long, but I think it worked because this is the first time I ever had the girl offer a second date! I don't know if it will go anywhere but I think I learned I need to be more willing to express myself on dates.

As the title suggests, I'm interested in dating. But I've developed this thing where I can only pursue a romantic relationship with someone I've been friends with. Sadly and surprisingly, all of my friends are faraway for college or in relationships. I've been thinking of maybe just using a dating app, but I've heard that they are mostly for hookups which I'm not interested in or ready for. I don't want to do long distance either, but even if I did start dating in my immediate area, I can't drive nor do I have a job to pay for anything. I get really bad anxiety behind the wheel, especially in southern California and I've had no luck securing interviews :') And right now, those are kind of a big deal when it comes to dating. 

I don't use social media, other than this and sc, so I'm afraid I'd come off as untrustworthy if I said I didn't have insta. I just don't like being online. I've also got some insecurities about my body as well, which I'm afraid would turn off some people. I've got rolls, visible body hair, dark spots, and a pouch. I know some people don't care about those things, but from what I've seen and heard, they're basically nonexistent. I'm also living with my very nosy and overprotective parents. They complain that I don't go out enough and that I should start dating, but I know damn well they'd go through my things if I mentioned anything about a boyfriend/girlfriend or just started using my phone more often than I already do. They don't like me using social media but they won't ever tell me why, so they'd probably find a way to delete whatever I have.

I don't even know what I'm looking for when I post this. Maybe just someone else that can relate to any of this.

I've been single for 3 years and sexless for 4 after a toxic relationship where she used me and I zeroed myself out trying to make it work.. I have a negative view of my own sexuality the last few years becuase I struggle with women naturally due to Tourettes and really  mental disability that causes me to have hypersensitivity reactions to stimulations.

Despite women will flirt(I think) or do a dirty joke here and there(mainly workplace in my case) I dont cross that line out of guilt and fear.    What makes this all crazier is I'm very naive with women.  Because  while I'm deep down just a horn dog I have taught myself to react negatively to women who cross the lines I'm scared to cross.

I (19M) have been into this girl (21F) for a few weeks now. We are always flirty with each other and we touch each other a lot (not in a sexual way), which I haven't seen her do with her friends, so I believe that I am the only one she does that to. Anyway, I feel like there is a connection between us. 
However, recently, I learned from herself and another friend that she is the kind of girl to regularly hook up with random guys. Although I am not sure, I believe that her body count has already hit the double digits. I, on the other hand, have ZERO sexual experience. 
She's funny, kind, smart and an overall amazing person and she makes me feel so goddamn special. But ever since I found out about her sexual life, something went off in my brain.

* I myself am a christian and I want my partner to respect my religion but I also don't want to date a person who is anti-gay anti-transgender and want to wait until marriage.
* I don't want to date a republican.

These things are preference but not necessary.

why can't handle people have normal conversations anymore?

you  ask questions, express interest, and tell them about what you like. and  replies are ""oh cool"" and ""thats interesting"". at what point did people  become auto-reply bots? you get better conversations from amazon  customer service agents.

you say  ""what kind of music are you into?"" and the reply is ""i like everything"".  but you don't really like ""everything"". actually, you seem to like  nothing, because when i ask about some of your favorite bands or songs,  you're like ""idk everything"".

yawn.

here's  a tip for life, people: when someone asks about your interests, you  tell about them a little bit. then YOU ask the other person ""how about  yourself?"". you don't just say ""oh everything i guess"" then stop  talking.

here's a simple way of  looking at conversation: it's like ping pong. you tap the ball over the  net, and the other person taps the ball back.

it really isn't that hard.

you don't have to share your life history. but why are you on dating sites if you don't want to *attempt* conversation?

how  is anyone supposed to get to know you, or anything about you, if you  don't share that info? how will you know whether you two click unless  you learn things about this stranger?

idk.  it makes zero sense. why put yourself out there if you're just gonna go  dark and be silent? don't you like talking about yourself? don't you  find it cool when someone wants to get to know you, and know more about  you?

Also I will add I made him wait a while but our sexual chemistry was insane. 

Things fizzled with me and this guy due to my lack of interested when he admitted he had started falling for me.. which was unintentional I just have a hard time showing my feelings due to getting hurt in the past so safe to say I messed this one up. 

Anyway we remained friends and he has recently suggested we should hang out again but we was both busy over Christmas and we do live quite long distance but anyhow I knew I was going to be in his city this week so I dropped him a messaged to say if he wants to do something together let me know and he replied with “yes I would love to let’s get something planned” so the next day I asked him what day is best and he ghosted me it’s been a week now and still no response which is odd from him, his WhatsApp picture is also gone which again is odd for him.

I will also add he is still active on the dating website we are both on as he was last active an hour ago so he obviously isn’t ghosting me because he met someone new. 

So my point of this is why would a guy who is single ghost a girl he originally asked to do something with? Also not to sound big headed but a mutual guy friend of ours told me he was saying how nice of a girl I am and how attracted to me he is only a week ago! 

So guys if your single and (in your opinion) a nice, attractive girl asks you to hang why would you say yes then ghost her but remain looking on dating sites?

I met this guy there, and while I was drunk falling asleep, he was hitting on me. Putting his hand around my waist and my head on his chest. When I had to be taken home, he told his friends how sexy I looked in my underwear and bra, and that he could take care of me while they left. Thankfully, another guy put a stop to it.

It’s been over a year, and I still think about him. Part of me should be disgusted with how he tried to take advantage of me, but I’m not. I’ve never had my first kiss before, and I’m a virgin. I would’ve been glad if he took my virginity from me that night. I was also ovulating that night, so I could’ve gotten pregnant, but I’ve always wanted to be a mother, so I wouldn’t complain about that.

I’ve never had another guy like me before. Maybe I have, but they’ve never been so overt about their interest in me. Judging by how confident he was with me, it’s not too far out of the realm of possibility to believe that he’s probably done this to at least one, if not several, other girls before. He likely has taken advantage of other girls.

I want to marry him. I want the wedding, and I want to move across the country where he lives. I want to have several kids with him. He has an abusive nature to him, and he’d probably beat me, and likely even take advantage of me, but I welcome it. He’d probably force himself on me if I’m drunk or asleep, but I feel like it’s not such a big deal. If I want marriage and a family, it comes with a catch. But it’s one I’m willing to take.

I know it’s not healthy to think this way. There’s another amazing guy that I like who would never do anything like that to me, but I don’t know if he likes me back. On bad days, I think about marrying a guy who attempted to rape me. I still keep in contact with him, and he always likes my Instagram posts and is the first to watch them.

One day, her colleague girls came to me and my colleagues and asked for our names and phone numbers. After that, she, herself, added me on Facebook (21 November). I didn't text her momentarily. I texted her after two days on her birthday. She got 22 years old. After that, she started texting me, and we started chit-chatting. i considered her interested in me and she was also giving vibes. After some weeks, I asked her for the date, but she refused and said she was busy. We continued chatting, and I felt that we got closer, and I was asking for the date again and again. After one month, after the new year, she said yes on the date. We went on the date, but I felt no affection from her.  Forget about kiss or hug, I felt that there was no place and time for that, I just asked to walk with arm-in-arm, but she refused even on that.

So today I texted her and asked if I made some mistake and made her bothered in some way, that I don't want to be a pushover.  She said I am too sweet to make someone bothered by.

Before the first date, she told me that ""I kind of downloaded hinge just to get myself out there again, I don’t really know what I’m looking for yet but I’d love to meet you"" and in our dates somewhat alluded to a breakup in the past year. First date was super good, second was decent and lasted over 4 hours, and the third date was the best one yet. We had an amazing time and painted pottery for close to four hours. We click better than I do with most of my friends, I think she's really cute (and she's said the same), and have very similar hobbies, music taste, sense of humor, etc.

Yesterday, after the third date, I told her I had an amazing time. Later that night she texted me saying that days before the date she'd deleted her account on the app (I haven't checked for a while) because she realizes she's not ready for a relationship again, but told me that she really enjoys hanging out with me and that I'm the only one she's met off of the app and she's really happy she did. She then says that I'm awesome and hopes I ""don’t mind that this may not go anywhere romantic"".

I was really sad after reading that, I'm not gonna lie. I told her that I appreciate her honesty and that I would love to be friends with her because I genuinely love spending time with her. But for the past day I've struggled a lot dealing with this. We've messaged a fair bit since then, and she's invited me to hang out at her house next weekend, but I still have a lot of feelings for her because I really liked spending time and going on dates with her.

I'm 100% sure she's being honest about this and not just putting me down easy because she's been a very honest person with me and generally warned me from the get go. I've been in a similar position before and time really helped me get over it, but this time it's a lot harder because my feelings are/were a bit stronger for this girl. I really want to be friends with her because we click so well though.

Should I have some hope that in the future, when she's ready for a relationship that she may change her mind?

Just really low key walking around and coffee, and nothing physical happened.

He seems nice and smart and a good guy, overall the meetings were well above expectations from dating app dates. We've been sending each other 1-2 texts/day. He just asked if I wanted to hang out again soon.

We haven't talked about it but I don't think either of us feels like there is a ton of chemistry, I'm open to continuing to talk to him but I don't feel *excited* about meeting him again/taking things further. I think we're both just social people who can hold a good conversation but we're not that into each other.

On the other hand, I personally have very little dating experience (I'm just not attracted to people that often) and since this guy really seems nice and trustworthy, I feel like he'd be a good person to date casually if he wanted that. We're both leaving the city in \~6 months so it's not really clear if things will continue after that anyway.

Is it a good idea to try to date this guy casually (if he agrees) if there's not a lot of chemistry? I'm worried that I'm forcing it a little on my end and don't want to lead him on, but I also just take ages to warm up to people so it's possible I'd grow into liking him more over time as well.

I responded saying we could reschedule and she asked me if I knew where she could get appointments, but she just never responded.

I should also mention I was on vacation away for 3 weeks and she replied to my story a couple times and I did as well for her, but that was it. And something just feels off so I just sent a text saying I noticed she didn’t respond and was just checking to make sure everything was good. Almost like in a polite way being like what’s going on, her lack of response was a little weird. 

She’s supposedly big on communication and being direct, but idk it seems like something is off and she’s losing interest or something, which I find weird bc before I left e talked about wanting to do all these things and we talked so much about the future.

I honestly am slowly just detaching myself from her, and I came to the conclusion that there’s somebody better out there who I’ll like more and things will be better. So I’m in the process of already moving on, but like i didn’t want to seem pushy or anything, I’m just genuinely like wtf. And I waited a couple days to see if she responded and nothing, so ya.

Don’t know if I’m a too over eager or whatever but just wanted to let out my feelings.
