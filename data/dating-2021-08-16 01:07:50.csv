1,p5aec6,1629094723,She gave me so much anxiety,"There was a girl (20F) who i (20M) often used to see around in the gym, in the library. I would notice her looking at me at times. She seemed kind of timid, introvert and nerdy which is exactly my type lol coz i am also the same way. I would also never see her talking to guys. I am particularly shy around girls and have never asked out a girl before. So one day I decided to talk to her. I gathered all my friggin courage, I went upto her when she was sitting in the library working on something. I approached her from front made eye contact. I asked her name, shook her hand and then I said something like ‚ÄúHi, I see you around quite often and I thought you were pretty so i figured I‚Äôd say hi‚Äù. I could see she was dumbstruck and I don‚Äôt think she heard any of it tbh. Then i asked her about what she was working on and stuff. She seemed really nervous and kept on switching between her screen and answering my questions. I didn‚Äôt talk too much, later i asked if she wanted to hang out, she said sure and i asked her number, instead she gave me her Instagram. Few days later I texted her, she didn‚Äôt even open i message or followed me back. I kept following her for a couple more weeks and posts she would like would appear on my news feed. She would like posts about anxiety, relationship anxiety. From there i knew she is going through some stuff and suffering from anxiety. I figured she had never been a relationship before either thats why it could have been hard. This made everything more clear and it just melted my heart even more. Some days, i would see her in the gym or so and she would just pretend to ignore me. I got pissed and I unfollowed her. As soon as I unfollowed her everything changed, she started posting stories about ‚Äúmissing someone‚Äù etc. she also started looking at me, started to workout closer to me. But I felt too embarrassed to talk to her now and tried to ignore her. Few months passed, now i came across posts of ‚Äúloving someone, can‚Äôt you tell I‚Äôm in love sort of posts‚Äù. I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore and I followed her again. Later i made a Stupid mistake of changing the chat theme on insta to love and then changed it to earth. This sends a notification to the other person, i was afraid she was gonna block me, think me of some creep. But to my surprise, she accepted the chat request(since she didnt follow me back). I was ecstatic and 2 days later, i shot her another text, but same she didn‚Äôt open the message. I followd her for another month, then last week I unfollowed her with a broken heart. Today i saw her in my class, she looked at me when I wasn‚Äôt looking, i looked at her she wasnt looking.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p5aec6/she_gave_me_so_much_anxiety/

8,p5bf2g,1629099701,My GF (19F) dumped me (21M) after telling me she loves me just to get into a long distance relationship with her abusive ex less than 2 weeks later.,"So I haven‚Äôt had a serious relationship since high school, COVID and depression/insecurity playing a major role. At the beginning of July I met a girl at my job who asked me to go hang out with her and some other people. I wasn‚Äôt very attracted to her at first but I thought we hit it off. I had multiple people telling me I could do better but I really loved this girl for her personality and sweetness. However she didn‚Äôt tell me for a few days after we first went out that she had recently gotten out of relationship of 3 years with a 18M who she stated gas lighted and her and wasn‚Äôt very nice in general. (Also said I was an upgrade üòê)

In the first couple weeks of dating she told me that I‚Äôve told her she was pretty more times than he had ever had. And that she was really happy that I was so sweet about her body. However there were certainly red flags. She was very physical off the bat which I sort of rejected her the first few times she tried to kiss/make out with me (which was in the first few days of meeting). However as I actually began to really love this girl, I went along with it. 

Things were going great for about 3 weeks (we started telling each other we loved each other ~2 weeks in, yeah that‚Äôs bad I know) until one day she didn‚Äôt want to hold my hand while we walked around the city. I thought this was so weird since she was making all the first moves and now I couldn‚Äôt even hold her hand? I was little upset with her and let her know. Only two days later she would have me take her to a doctors appointment where I noticed she was being quite distant. I straight up asked her in the waiting room if she didn‚Äôt want to date anymore and she said ‚ÄúYes‚Äù.

Now I‚Äôve never been really heartbroken over a girl but this absolutely destroyed me. She told me it was her fault and not mine, and that it was for mental health reasons and that she really still wanted to be friends. She seemed visibly upset when she asked me if was dead to her after this even though I assured her that wasn‚Äôt the case.

Only 2 weeks later she completely stopped talking to me and is back with her ex that goes to school 12 hours away when we both live on the same campus. Even though everyone I talked to tells me that she made a huge mistake, I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that I‚Äôm the equivalent of human trash. Her best friend told me she‚Äôs an idiot for dumping me and going back her ex. (I still talk to her best friend) and that she‚Äôll probably try and get back with mein a month or two.

I don‚Äôt know what advice I‚Äôm looking for. I‚Äôve just never felt this shit about a girl in my life. How could you make the first move just to completely fuck my emotions up a short time later? I feel like a girl when a guy fucks her and never talks to her again. The worst part is it‚Äôs been nearly a month and I still have this love/hate relationship going on in my head. I love everything about her but I hate her for devaluing me as person and tossing me to the side like a piece of human trash once she got her physical satisfaction from me.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p5bf2g/my_gf_19f_dumped_me_21m_after_telling_me_she/

12,p5bola,1629101079,"Between being myself and improving myself, I don't know what I want.","The way I see it, you can only be doing one of these things at any given time.

""Being myself"" means *not doing what other people* (including women) *want me to do*. That means I don't work out, I don't eat healthy, and I don't take care of myself in any way that would make me more physically attractive to the opposite sex. Because on a strictly personal level, I hate doing all of those things. They're not ""me."" So if I'm doing those things, I'm not being myself.

But I know if I continue to live the way I do, I'm going to die alone. I don't want this either, for obvious reasons, but if I make an effort to improve myself despite that being against every fiber of my being, then that means everyone who has ever told me to ""just be myself"" was **wrong**.

So which one is it? Should you be yourself, or should you improve yourself and try to be someone ""better"" out of a sense that you need some kind of romantic validation? I feel like anything you do to impress a potential romantic partner can ONLY be in the pursuit of validation, not genuine love-seeking. If someone really loved me, they wouldn't want me to change anything about myself, no matter how much of a mediocre schlub I am‚Äîand that's what they say, right? That there's someone out there for everybody? Why do we tell ourselves that? Why are we so afraid of admitting the possibility that some people are just destined to die alone?

Sorry, this is devolving into a rant. Despite my bitter phrasing, I'm actually trying to ask a genuine question here. I don't know what to do, and I don't know how to figure out what I want to do either, and I feel like I'll never be happy until I find the answer‚Äîbesides accepting the obvious truth that I don't actually need anybody.

All I know is that you can't simultaneously be yourself while also trying to improve yourself. One of them has to be right, and the other has to be dead wrong. If being yourself is the wrong path, then I'll say sayonara to the idea that I'll ever find someone. Because I'm not changing myself for any woman. It's just not happening. If improving yourself is wrong, then there's still a sliver of hope for me.

Too give some details, I have known this girl for over 5 years, dating back to junior year in high-school. I'm 23 now and I'm living inside of a hell I feel I can not escape. I have made a deep connection with her and on top of this, I deal with generalized anxiety and depression disorders. I make art and music. This detail is also important. I have made several attempts to reach out and for a while being friends worked with me. But after I graduated things got very lonely for me personally. Getting a job and getting a life was much harder than anticipated. My ability to go out and be social was very difficult and even though Iv outgrown social anxiety I still feel like something is missing, I know why. After I got to know her more I built up courage after 2 years to make a move. Although I did not realize she had a boyfriend at the time. She is simply beautiful. Just to give an example of just how amazing she is, imagine being trapped inside of a dungeon without anyone there to protect or save you. Imagine that you knew life was fixing to end. She would be the woman to slay the dragons and rescue you from the deepest depths of hell. If I had a bad day while I was in school I knew that seeing her would make it glorious afterwards. In fact she made me feel like I could conqour the world. I'm sorry if I'm kinda skipping from present to past right now. I'm sad and crying while writing this. But eventually I wrote music and created art about her. It made me feel good. Until I chose the wrong time to spill my guts out. My timing was wrong and I had to tell her how I felt because I was losing my mind. After I told her everything the worst possible scenario happened. It NEVER goes the way I want it to. I just recently started another relationship and it didn't work out. I try my best and I'm a nice guy and would do anything for the people I love.

I should note that I am a late bloomer, I was considered repulsive up until a few years ago.

Even so I'm very good at reading people so I'm usually good at spotting and avoiding red flags.

One thing I've noticed is women who are interested in me being very controlling and trying to dictate my life. The first few times I just ghosted them but it really stood out when a female friend I hadn't seen in years (saw me after I started to bloom per se) also got very possessive of me to the point where she actively started putting me down.

29,p5dv24,1629111962,Is it possible to build genuine rapport and attraction through text?,"So, my go-to approach (online dating, Instagram DM, etc.) has always been to find common ground and/or traits of genuine interest and curiosity in the other person, then text a bit and then ask them out for a casual date, and I've always had a great deal of success with that approach. Frankly, I live by the saying ""strike when the iron is hot"" when it comes to dating, because I often found that the alternative just doesn't work for me - where you're texting too much before you've actually met in person, and the interaction just fizzles out before it ever really got started. Honestly, I see texting as a tool to building rapport and attraction to be a bit of a minefield where everything you say runs the risk of being misinterpreted, whereas in person, a lot more factors come into consideration, eg. body language, tone of voice, humor, eye contact, touch, conversational skills, etc. etc. In person, everything flows really smoothly for me, but on text, I guess I tend to get too much in my own head if the conversation drags on for too long. I feel like I can't really progress and escalate, so to speak.

However, due to a state-wide lockdown that is currently going on the 3rd month (and doesn't look like ending anytime soon), I think I have to expand on my approach a bit when it comes to building rapport and attraction with women through text if I don't want to succumb to loneliness.

What do you think, is it really possible to build genuine rapport and attraction through text? And if so, how is it best done, given the current circumstances I'm living in at the moment?

39,p5f8cv,1629117520,My crush removed me from social media,"Hey guys,

Crossposting this because I would like this subreddit's thoughts on it aswell (see original thread from relationship\_advice [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/p5256j/my_crush_23f_removed_me_28m_from_social_media/) and also the comments if you'd like).

In the beginning of July I (28M) matched with a girl (23F) on Tinder who lives approx 150 miles away from me. I've been dating quite a lot this year but it's mostly been casual sex and none has made me feel anything at all, until now.

Me and this girl who obviously lives far away from me immediately hit it off, and we communicated constantly through Snapchat, text and phone for a couple of weeks. I mean constant, she was all over me and for some reason I fucking loved it. I guess I've been doing most of the chasing with the other girls I've met this year, so perhaps it was a breath of fresh air.

So eventually she tells me she recently got out of an LTR, so I should keep my hopes down, but I'm already feeling shit for this girl so of course I accept when she wants to meet up for a 24h date in her hometown; and as she lives with her parents for the time being (because of the recent breakup) she booked a hotel room for us, a table at a restaurant and also planned a day full of activities as I'm arriving early in the morning.

I took the train to her (2h ride) and we had the most amazing 24h date. This included a day time boat trip on a sunny day which was like something out of a romantic movie on Netflix, dinner with drinks and this ended with amazing sex in the evening and in the morning. Everything seemed fucking GREAT (but you already know where this story ends otherwise I wouldn't be here).

Before we leave the hotel room she tells me again that she's not looking for anything serious right now because of her recent breakup but ""we'll talk soon"". When she told me this I felt sick to my stomach because of the phenomenal date we just had; and she could see it on me. She asked me if I felt used by her and I asked ""a little yeah"" and she says ""sorry if that's the case"". We end the 24h date like this (I mean WEIRD) with her going home and me heading to my train back to my town.

The same evening I got a text from her saying something in the line of ""sorry if I wasn't sincere enough with my intentions and if we misunderstood each other. I had a great date and you're a great guy"". I answered something basic like ""it's cool"".

Two days after our date she went on a planned vacation with a friend for 2,5 weeks and our communication pretty much died. After a couple of days she sent me a Snapchat video of her and a guy drinking in a bar (I'm assuming her friend was out of picture at the same table so not like a date) and I immediately Snapchatted her back a picture of a girl I was talking to at a party at this time (yeah I got pissed). She replies ""fucking asshole"" and I answer ""why would you say that"" and she replied ""because you're sending pictures of a girl to me?"". I answered back (drunk) ""you know I miss you come on"" and she replied ""yeah it's cool but it was weird of you to send that picture"". This coming from her actually starting the conversation with a video of her and a guy in a bar?

Couple of days later I still can't stop thinking of this girl, so I send her a Snapchat asking her how her vacation is, and she answers ""it's great, how did it go with the girl you sent a picture of the other night"" and I replied ""we just hung out at a party, what are you doing tonight?"" and she said ""I'm going to sleep now"". Wtf.

A week later of no communication she sends me a Snapchat with just the text ""Hi"" and I got fucking happy. I answer casually ""Hi"" and then she leaves me on read without answering? I mean this girl, what the duck is up.

Like three days later I ask her if she's home from her vacation yet, and she says ""yes"". I ask her how it's been, and she says ""it was great, what about yours?"" and I answer ""nice, I've had a great time too"". She doesn't answer this last Snapchat from me. This was like four days ago and I just felt her disinterest with leaving me on read on the last snap.

NOW yesterday I see that she removed me from Snapchat and also unfollowed me on Instagram without giving an explanation why. Just fucking removed. Who even does something like that.

I also want to add that I still have her as a match on Tinder where she has uploaded new pics of her from her vacation..

I'm fuming since I can't get this girl out of my head. When I'm writing this I understand that she lost interest somewhere along the way, perhaps the date wasn't as great as I thought it was even though it fucking felt great to me, perhaps I should have just listened to her words from when we met, that she doesn't want anything serious right now. But why removing me from social media?

What do you guys think goes on in this girl's head? Should I have had chased her MORE after the date? I was acting pretty cold after our date considering she sent me that text ""sorry if we misunderstood each other bla bla bla"".

I still have her number, should I text and ask her why she removed me from social media or is that just creepy shit? 

Sorry for this rant and for seeming immature but I really can't get this girl out of my head. Perhaps someone has time to help me analyzing this girl's behavior.

Thank you!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p5f8cv/my_crush_removed_me_from_social_media/
40,p5fcx0,1629117999,GF farts a lot! I HATE it.,"So my lady (27) is such a cool and hilarious person. Lots of her sense of humour comes from her childhood, how she used to play with her siblings and the kids movies they would watch (she still watches them). 

One of the ""fun"" things they grew up doing is farting on each other  for laughs. I get it, kids. But it is disgusting to me. 
She has no qualms about farting. 
We'll be on the couch watching a movie, she let's loose so many times, I even ask ""Are you OK? Is ur stomach OK?""

My blankets are all stanky now. Yesterday, I had to open up all my windows just as she was about to leave.

I'm comfortable farting around her, and I do...about 4 times less. It's a natural thing of course, but I do think she also doing it just to ""have fun"" around me.

We love each other a lot and spend so much time together. We don‚Äôt live together yet but do a lot of hotels together as we live 2.5 hours away.

She has anxiety and depression and recently it‚Äôs got worse to the point where she can‚Äôt sleep when she knows I‚Äôm not back home yet at night. She recently got upset and started crying because we agreed to meet but I had last minute work come up for my business and decided to take it on. I‚Äôve done this many times with her already as I run a business and need to take the jobs on. But it seems she‚Äôs upset because I do it all the time.

She feels self conscious and always thinks she‚Äôs not pretty and that I may look at other girls.

She feels anxious that I think she‚Äôs not good enough for me.

Her past relationships have been abusive hence why she has all these mental health issues.

I always comfort and reassure her that I like her for who she is and I love her. She always says she loves me so much. And I know I really mean the world to her especially as she‚Äôs got anxiety, her being able to be close with me makes her heart warm.

She was telling me the other day she‚Äôd be so heart broken if I left her.

She‚Äôs a lovely girl. Very loyal and caring. Treats me very well and I like how I‚Äôm able to take care of her and treat her well compared to the people in the past.

Sometimes it is a bit stressful and I have to try be understanding when her mental health issue triggers her. I‚Äôm happy with how things are between me and her in a way, as she treats me well with care and loyalty and respect. She is very clingy though and sometimes I feel she‚Äôs too attached to the point where I don‚Äôt have much me time as she always wants to be with me.

I‚Äôm a very patient person and can manage this but sometimes it gets to me and I picture if she was different and more open and not reserved, it would also open me up more and make me more outgoing as a person. Right now, I‚Äôm more reserved as she is so we can be similar.

With all these problems, is it still ok for me to be with her or should I consider leaving and finding someone else?

She had to go through a lot of abuse and other very bad experiences in her past and also never really got the right support from her family, and it took a toll on her when she got with me.

There's this girl that I've known for a couple years, we are not exactly close friends but we do know each other. She currently is in a 3 year long relationship.  A couple weeks ago we started getting physically closer, and with that I mean long and continous physical contacts. It started as some kind of a joke but it escalated very quickly. So, still as a joke, we started touching each other everywhere except for the genitals. Yesterday we went to a party on the beach at night. The loud music the dancing and the alcool created the perfect scenario and basically we picked up from where we had left off. Then I saw her talking to a friend of mine, and he told me she was saying all night that I am good looking with a nice athletic body and nice muscles. I also read her lips and she said ''he got nice abs''. After that she asked me to go in the water with her and obviously I didn't refuse. While in the water she literally jumped on me and grabbed on me with her arms and her legs. So I started kissing her on the chest on the neck on the cheeks and when I almost got to her lips she told me ''no we can't, we just can't"". But we still continued with the touching the grabbing and the kissing (just not on the lips) until the sun came up.  This is pretty much what's going on (her bf obviously hasn't seen any of this because he was never there, he was always at home or away). I want to keep this going because after she showed all those appreciations for me I would be stupid to not take advantage of it. His boyfriend is a rude stupid fat fuck, and of course I look like a greek statue in her eyes. But she also said that she doesnt want to cheat and that she will continue her relationship even though she will move to another city next month, so it will become a loooong distance relationship. Honestly I think that what we have done is already cheating but that's up to her. I'm not deluding myself thinking I can have a serious relationship with her because she will move away next month. It's basically 95% physical between us, we do want sex with each other, we both admitted it and it's undeniable. What do you guys think I should do? I was thinking about telling her plain and simple that we should just do what our insticts tell us to do and have fun. I'd like to hear as many opinions as possible. Thanks for your time. P.S.

On the EXTREMELY rare occasion someone messages me back (about 1 out of every 400 messages, less than once a month), i try to find out what they like, offer to take them to whatever restaurant they want, go out to the zoo, hot springs, you name it, i always do whatever it takes to avoid being crude or pushy, just let them dictate the pace, sometimes they interrogate me to the point of having to type out the entirety of my life story, so every time someone takes the effort to speak to me, i always manage to get them to agree to a date.
Of course nobody will come out here to visit me, so i make the 45 minute drive to the nearest major city to meet up with them, and every. Single. Time... i get stood up and ghosted.

There isnt any advice under the sun i havent heard, anyone can stick it out and hope beyond hope for that lucky break, but there are those it never gets better for, you think its so simple as just having someone with a warm body and a sympathetic ear, that if you just have SOMEBODY, you can be happy, but it doesnt work that way.
What truly breaks your heart is when you realize that EVEN IF someone was to show up at your doorstep, you wouldnt be able to connect with them.. oh sure, you could pretend easily enough, probably quite convincingly, but you know the moment you start to spend time together it just isnt sustainable in the long run, so you have a choice to compromise your principals and be miserable, or go back to how things were and be miserable. Of course they dont connect with me, how could they? An intelligent impulsive rock and roll free spirit that detests social media would be out enjoying life, dancing and crafting frightening wooden masks, not wasting away hours talking to weird looking guys on dating apps. Anyway i give up on all this, im just going to focus on my work and dancing by myself.

60,p5hp30,1629125778,FWB sleeping with another girl (I‚Äôm ok with it) but now she won‚Äôt talk to me oops.,"I am **F/25** and I was at an overnight party recently where my **fwb M/27** was there. Over the weekend this other girl **F/24** and I became friendly and had been hanging out a bit. I went to bed that night and woke up the next morning and noticed her waking up/ leaving his camp. I knew they were friends but now can see they were also having a little fling. (Which is cool‚Ä¶ not a big deal to me, maybe something we can bond over?)

That day, her and I were hanging out a bit and I asked her ‚Äúso how long have you and him been seeing each other :) ?‚Äù She responded and I replied saying I had also been seeing him and we both mentioned that didn‚Äôt know he was seeing other people. I also mentioned that our fwb relationship had maybe run it‚Äôs course.

We haven‚Äôt spoken since that conversation. Things got bitter and she didn‚Äôt accept any of my requests on social media. I saw her on the street recently with him and his friends, and she quite blatantly saw me and turned to ignore me. 

The guy seemed off when I saw him last (in a friendship setting). Understandably he is probably annoyed I spoke to her and I thinks I should have kept it private.

Was I too forward thinking that I could openly communicate about this with a new female friend I‚Äôd connected with? It was really not my intention to cause any trouble and feel anxious about it now. The guy wants to know my side of the story but I‚Äôm worried he won‚Äôt understand where I was coming from and will think I was trying to cause drama.

What do I do from here? I live in a very small town where I will be seeing him around and would like to stay on friendly terms. (She has left).",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p5hp30/fwb_sleeping_with_another_girl_im_ok_with_it_but/
61,p5hul3,1629126205,Did he lose feelings?,"Hi Reddit! So one of my best friends and I were both seeing people for around 2 years, and a couple of months ago they broke up as well as my boyfriend and I. After some time he told me he was in love with me and I also had feelings for him too, so we hung out all the time for the past semester and even went out to get dinner together. We basically did everything together and said we weren‚Äôt gonna talk to anyone else even though we weren‚Äôt together officially. 

The summer hit, and things seemed to be normal at first. In July we had a conversation and he said he feels like I‚Äôm going to expect to be dating a month after we get back and was saying how he isn‚Äôt ready for anything serious because he is battling depression. I respect this and even though I can‚Äôt imagine what he‚Äôs going through, I want to be there to help him. He said it wasn‚Äôt anything I did but in general he feels like he has no feelings for anyone and can‚Äôt even think about a relationship. 

We spoke about this again the other night, and he said he‚Äôll still hang out with me when we get back like normal and right now he loves me as a best friend but nothing more. He also asked me if my situation was a thing where if hypothetically he liked someone else in the future or we didn‚Äôt end up together that we wouldn‚Äôt be friends, and I said with the feelings I have for you I don‚Äôt think I could right away. He said not that any of this is gonna happen but I just was wondering because I hope it doesn‚Äôt come to that. He also said he doesn‚Äôt know anything that will happen and said we could even end up together. I‚Äôve just never been in this situation before and don‚Äôt know whether he lost feelings for me or if it‚Äôs just his depression that is taking over and making him push me away since I may have overwhelmed him with my feelings. We talk almost everyday and I don‚Äôt know what to do at all and I‚Äôve been overthinking the situation because I don‚Äôt know how long his depression will last and if he‚Äôll feel the same way he initially felt once he‚Äôs better. We see each other in a week for the semester and I also don‚Äôt know if maybe things will be better when we get in person but I just don‚Äôt know what to do because my feelings get to be more each day. I want something more out of the relationship and would be fine waiting and taking time, but I also don‚Äôt know what the best thing to do is if he keeps telling me ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù about everything. He is seeing a therapist this week and I hope things will get better. 

I want to go about this in the best way possible so that we are both happy and that there is still a chance he‚Äôll feel the way he initially did, but I don‚Äôt know what to do. Thank you!

He is straight and I‚Äôm bi and we definitely wouldn‚Äôt want the other to get a lap dance or something. Honestly not super comfortable with the idea of him going to view other woman in a sexual light but we‚Äôre also a couple who aren‚Äôt into porn bc it‚Äôs a turn off for our partner to be hyped by another person even if it‚Äôs only visually.

A lot of people have a lot of different views on this an I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a wrong answer. It kinda depends on the couple but I think it can also easily be messy or misaligned since strip clubs are pretty normalized too same as porn.

For instance my bf was on a boys trip and they all were single except for him so when they wanted to go for his friends bday he went along. He didn‚Äôt get a dance or anything but he was pressured into going even after he said he wasn‚Äôt comfortable. I think the fact he wasn‚Äôt comfortable was funny to them so they wanted to go even more. I wasn‚Äôt upset about it but I was a little annoyed since these guys are my friends too and didn‚Äôt listen to him.

66,p5i7wm,1629127300,"Asking out your crush doesn't need to be a scary or embarrassing experience, you don't need to wait!","So I've always been someone who keeps crushes a secret, I don't tell them usually because I find it embarrassing or whatever.

What I wanna say is that learning to shoot your shot is a part of growing up, and so is learning to handle people asking you out with respect. If you like someone, ask them out. If someone asks you out, be respectful in your rejection and understand that it took strength (excluding people who are pushy about it and are disrespectful to you about it or make you feel unsafe, they've lost any respect they deserve at that point).

I am saying this with little experience, I have confessed to one crush so far. He unfortunately rejected me, but he told me he respected how hard it must have been for me to tell him. Anyone who responds to a polite message admitting your feelings with any rude comments, then they're doing you a favor at that point. You really shouldn't be chasing someone who you believe would react in a disrespectful way.

I have always been someone who said things like ""I need to create a friendship with him before asking"" or ""I need to wait for the right moment so he'll say yes."" Well, the one guy I told was a friend who I talked to regularly. He knew me pretty well but just didn't feel that way about me. This taught me that sometimes attraction just won't happen, and that's okay.

For this reason, I've decided not to wait anymore. I have a new crush I've known for a couple years. We are in the same club but unfortunately haven't been able to talk much one on one. I kept telling myself that I would need to create a better bond for a better chance of a yes, but I don't think that's true. He knows me a little bit, but the point of a date is to get to know each other one on one. So if you want that with your crush, just go for it!

I think this is a perspective on dating that may help some fellow shy people on here! I am very shy, but I realized me not taking my shot is stopping me from pursuing possible relationships. I think even experiencing kind rejection is helpful in realizing that rejection doesn't have to be a horrible embarrassing thing. A rude rejection will also show you the kinds of people you wouldn't want in your life anyway.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p5i7wm/asking_out_your_crush_doesnt_need_to_be_a_scary/

When we finally decided to meet up it happened to be at his giant apartment complex. Like not inside his apartment just by the pool. So I drove out there and he offered to get me food or anything else, I refused but I thought it was sweet of him to ask. 

We finally met, sat down and talked for a few hours. There were some awkward pauses, he brought up his extensive dating history a few times, but overall not a bad experience. Eventually he was exhausted so I left - mind you this was in downtown and he barely walked me to the door of his apartment. It was weird. 

So I was used to his good morning texts by now. But the next day it was pretty much silence.  In the evening I texted asking if everything was okay, he apologized in this paragraph text and said he has a lot going on that day - like a family member was genuinely sick.

I told myself that I wasnt going to date someone if they did drugs, unless it was for a good reason when I was younger, but decided that I should start being more open. 

The story is, one night at 4 am I saw she was up and I had decided to give her a call because I wanted to talk to her as we hadn't spoken the entire day. She tells me that she couldn't talk atm, and that she was gonna get high, so I told her goodnight and have fun.

The next day she calls me and sends me a video of her when she was high saying that she had invited a friend over to get high with her, and saying that she had sex with them. She told me that because she was high, she didnt really know what she was doing, as if she was under the influence, like with alcohol. I dont know how getting high or smoking weed works so i'm not really sure if she is telling the truth or not. But I was really devestated and hung up on her, and removed her from my social media. I texted her a few hours after the call to ask her to imagine how she would feel in my position. I havent texted her since.

I made sure there was mutual attraction at the very least. I was honest with her about my thoughts and intentions and I took her on my opinion on a very adult date. For context we are both 21 (M) and (F) but she is in my opinion very sophisticated. 

She said honestly the two years of me being persistent like this was one of the reasons we went on the date. 

She had a really good time which made me happy asf. I don‚Äôt want to take a girl on a date and be around a girl if shes not having a good time. That makes me feel hellla selfish.

After the first date she was texting a bit weird but soon after it was all back to normal. So i invited her to a second date and she replied with ease yet again, this time was something more romantic that stated my intentions, or so i believe. We went on the date and it was very good aswell but, my main struggle now is to know if she is intrested in me because after the date she told me to send some funny pics of me eating the leftovers of my meal (i didn't eat everything on the date) so i did that and she was texting quite nicely until the day after (wich was yesterday) she was busy and i know that for a fact, but her energy just sounded a bit off and she was taking more time to reply so i told her that the next time, she would be the one who'd make all the plans for the date and she just replied ""NO.. too much pressure"" so i could know if she's intrested in being with me. I think something might have happend during the date and i haven't realized it. I also didn't try to make a move on her because i don't want to seem pushy or to make her think that i just want to get on her pants and then leave.

86,p5ko4z,1629134584,Is anyone else insecure about dating/marriage due to their family? (26M),"I used to be and am still proud of my family but every time I start thinking about dating again, it makes me anxious. 

My ex‚Äôs family:
 * mixed, spoke another language fluently, made twice as much as mine.
* their parents put in a lot more effort into them, this included taking them to coffee shops quarterly like a business meeting for check-ins and having them be involved in both arts/sports. 
* The dad was poor, joined the military, and then got multiple degrees to get into a good position. I mean they had their own issues but they were largely more ‚Äúpolite‚Äù or better able to ‚Äúmask it,‚Äù is how I phrase it.

In comparison:
* my parents marriage is in better shape. 
* However, they both smoke, and my father is an alcoholic and chews snuff as well. The spitting sound is gross and he can be quite a child/asshole if he‚Äôs chugged a 40 oz (which my mom battles with him all the time about so at least I‚Äôm not the only one). 
* He works in a blue collar job, so I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs hurting over it, worked there for 30 years and essentially never wanted to move up because ‚ÄúOT made more money.‚Äù 
* He was kinda absent and left my mom to do all the work, which itself can be exhausting. 

So I essentially had to figure everything out myself. Which led me to becoming the first one in my immediate family with a Bachelor‚Äôs and I‚Äôm the only one to live in other areas of the country/travel to other countries. 

Even though she was proud of me as an individual, she was definitely resentful towards the halfway point of our relationship. 
* Her family traveling and staying at hotel‚Äôs to visit her siblings who all went off to 4-years. 
* Whereas, my siblings went to the trades or community college. Even then, I tried to coerce them to see us on the weekends so that it felt ‚Äúeven‚Äù but they would refuse and use the excuse of one sibling still being in HS. Now, that they‚Äôve graduated - they‚Äôve taken several trips to other places. 

My ex would frequently have her parents give her money for things or call them for advice. 
* Meanwhile, I never asked for money (I feel too prideful and embarrassed to do so, it was a huge ordeal just to have them co-sign a loan for a car before I graduated college for a job) and if I called for advice it would always ends up with them arguing with me or giving very little advice and then going off on a tangent about some unrelated matters. 

Anyways, I guess my concern is having something similar happen again. I know this sounds terrible but I‚Äôm almost at the point of waiting till at least one of them dies before even considering something like marriage. 

Like seeing some of my closeted racist and right-winged relatives at my wedding makes me cringe, I‚Äôm not like that whatsoever.

Seeing my dad getting piss drunk if my girlfriend/wife or having him spit snuff in front of her relatives makes me want to climb into a shell.

**I guess the TL;DR would be:**

I don‚Äôt want to feel like my family is competing with my future partner‚Äôs family in terms of support, attention, and overall ‚Äúimagery‚Äù because it feels like my family will lose everytime due their economic/social status.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p5ko4z/is_anyone_else_insecure_about_datingmarriage_due/
87,p5ksjl,1629134951,[UPDATE] What is the best way for me (26F) to rekindle a relationship with my ex (34M)?,"[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oq89rg/what_would_be_the_best_way_for_me_26f_to_try_and/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)

So after the post, we spent quite a bit of time talking and I ended up letting him know that I still had feelings for him and if he ever felt ready, I'd be interested in dating him again. His reaction was very positive. He said he always thought of me and there were many times he wished I was still around in some capacity. He said he was very happy that he reached back out to me and to have me back in his life. I ended up taking the trip to see him and we spent a weekend together. He said he is interested and he likes us together but just wants to take things slow. I told him I understood completely. Well, this morning he just asked me to go to a concert in my area next weekend! I wanted to get tickets and just go alone as it's my favorite band but decided to pass. He knows how much I like this band and got tickets for us so we can go together. He's going to be coming in on Wednesday and staying for a week. 

I am grateful for his interest and the effort he is making to rekindle our relationship but I think the best thing about this is that I am able to help him and bring him happiness. I think he's a great guy and seeing him smile again means so much to me. 

I don't know where things will go but I will always be grateful for time spent with him. 

Tl;dr I told my ex I still liked him. He reacted positively and said he is interested in dating again. I took the trip to see him first and now he is coming here to spend a week with me and is taking me to a concert.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p5ksjl/update_what_is_the_best_way_for_me_26f_to/

92,p5lijg,1629137073,He called me his girlfriend when he was drunk.. does this mean anything?,"I (29F) have been dating a great guy (31M) for around 3 months now. We‚Äôve been seeing each other a couple of times a week, lots of sleepovers, constant texting - everything has been great. 

There was a little blip a couple of weeks back where he thought I was about to ask him to go ‚Äúofficial‚Äù (I wasn‚Äôt - though I‚Äôd like to) and he panicked and told me he wasn‚Äôt quite ready for that. His last couple of relationships have ended badly and so he‚Äôs being super careful not to get hurt again I guess. As disappointing as that conversation was for me, I decided that it was probably worth me being patient for a little while longer and seeing what happened. 

We took a trip together over the weekend - a 3 night stay in a city (all his idea). We both had an incredible time. On the Saturday night after a few drinks, he referred to me as his girlfriend. I was a little surprised but didn‚Äôt react to it in case he‚Äôd said it accidentally. Later on, he did the same thing again - we were laughing about a conversation we‚Äôd had with another couple earlier in the day when he said ‚ÄúI bet they looked at you and thought ‚Äòher boyfriend is a right jerk‚Äô‚Äù. Again, I didn‚Äôt react to the use of the word ‚Äúboyfriend‚Äù - though maybe I should have done.

What makes things awkward now though is that the next day when he was sober, he referred to me as his ‚Äúfriend‚Äù when speaking about me to someone. So now I‚Äôm wondering wtf I am and if he only said those things because he was drunk?! I‚Äôm scared to ask him about it after we only had the conversation about him not being ready 2 weeks ago.

94,p5lkbz,1629137221,I don‚Äôt know if she‚Äôs right for me,"I (23) started dating a girl (22) several months ago and we got to know each other pretty quickly.
She is mostly like me when it comes to silliness and humor and we can discuss endlessly about all kind of things. It just feels easy and effortless if you can understand what I mean. It just kind of flows.

But there are things I just can‚Äôt get out of my head. 
I personally want to have children one day - she says she does not, which is very, very bad.
I like to do a lot of sport. Calisthenics, hiking, things like that - she does not.
We both spoke about that and in general she is more like working most of her time on a horse farm which is kind of her hobby as well. In her free time she is also working on another farm. Horses are a major pet in her life. But other than that she doesn‚Äôt seem to have any major interests in anything what bothers me a bit because I wish she would like to go hiking with me or share some interests so we can do more than sitting on the couch talking.

I don‚Äôt want to change her but I also can not really accept those things so I don‚Äôt really know what to do. I really enjoy the time I have with her but will I do in the long-term?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p5lkbz/i_dont_know_if_shes_right_for_me/
95,p5ln3f,1629137453,My Work Crush,"Back in March, I began to notice my coworker is behaving differently with me. So I learned about body language signs a girl like you, and I ended up realizing she likes me. 

I waited until May to make sure if she really was interested in me. After seeing several signals, and consistently, I made my move to get her phone number. We started to get to know each other, and she was reciprocating. After a week, I asked her out in person, she said yes.

However, after a few days, she opened up to me that she was still going through a recent break up. She then said it was best not to go out. I told her I understood, and that I hope she feels better with time. Here's the interesting thing, she still gives me signals to this day. Whenever I talk to her at work, she starts giving me signals, and we have good chemistry. She also recently began to open up to me about her family, nieces, etc. My friends say that she's still interested, and it could be she's hoping I'm still available when she feels ready.

Some of my friends have also advised that the ball is in her court now, so it's best I don't make a move again because I can't guess what her headspace is. In other words, let her come to me to tell me in a subtle way that she's ready for that date.

So my question to everyone, what would you do? What advice can you provide in a situation like this?

TL;DR: she wasn't ready for that date when I made my move. But she still shows she's interested through her body language. I can't make a move again because I can't guess when she's ready, so do I let her come to me?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p5ln3f/my_work_crush/
