Two months ago, I posted here that I just had my first kiss ever (**FIRST POST HERE:** [https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qbxxec/had\_my\_first\_kiss\_this\_sunday\_23m/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qbxxec/had_my_first_kiss_this_sunday_23m/)) , and since that so many people liked my story and I gave a second update after that, I wanted to give feedback some weeks after, because of the fact that things have changed.

Ever since those first and second dates, we’ve been dating once every week, and honestly, I’m super excited and hopeful of what’s coming in the future. She’s a wonderful person, inside and outside, and I think I was very lucky by meeting her just out of the blue on Tinder.

Last Saturday, she spent the night at my place, I made her dinner, we watched Netflix while cuddling, we took photos of ourselves, we talked about deep stuff, we slept together while hugging (super cute), we had breakfast, and last but not least, we had sex. Yeah, if you quite figured out, I haven’t kissed a girl ever just until our first date, so you’ll decipher that I was a virgin too. So that was it, **I had sex too for the first time** (a bit complicated must I admit, but enjoyable and funny too lmao).

I am seriously on absolute cloud nine with this girl, and **I’m thinking seriously of a “couple-ish” talk pretty soon**, but given the experience that I have, I don’t know when or how I should put it on the table (maybe too soon). I should also give the fact that we’ve already made a future plan, we bought two tickets to a concert that’s happening on February, so I think that’s a good point.

So that’s the most recent update on this story, I hope guys enjoy it, and for sure if this thing goes straightforward and we get exclusive, I will rush into Reddit to give you feedback ASAP.

And please **let me know your opinion**, not just about the whole picture, but about the *exclusivity thing* too, if it’s too soon (or too late) and when to bring it up.

Thank you everybody!!!!

TL;DR: After first date and first kiss with this girl from Tinder, we’ve been dating once every week since then, and things are great. Last Saturday, she slept at my place. First time having sex, no longer virgin.

Please be kind:)

I started seeing a guy earlier this year - we met on a dating app, he was really interested in me. I kept pushing him back, but eventually gave in.

We got along really well, and were committed really quickly.

First month, he was super warm, and then started pushing me away - I wondered at the time what had changed.

Having established myself financially, I wanted to make sure he was not left behind, so I encouraged him to purchase a property, and given I work in real estate I started helping him out, and spent countless hours on this. Whilst I work really long hours, there was this expectation that no matter what, I would deliver to him on this, and speak to him as and when required.

At the 1 month mark, he mentioned that his business was struggling. This was not an issue for me as such, going out with someone - I wasn't looking for money or how much they have, I was looking for someone who cares for me.

We went out for 3 months.

In the 2nd month he asked me if I could contribute $200 - $300 toward a course, which I refused, as he has savings.

Then he said that for his birthday he wanted me to pay for a doctor's appointment. When I mentioned to my family and friends, they were horrified. I told him I couldn't do this for him, and I wanted to decide for myself what to get for his birthday. At the time he got so annoyed at me that he cancelled lunch on me.

In the 3 months we went out, I saw him 6 times only. He was always too busy, and his priority was study (as he was doing a university degree). In those 3 months he cancelled me a number of times.

We broke up. He didn't even see my last set of messages to him for weeks - apparently he was 'scared' - not sure scared of what.

I missed him a lot, and we started speaking again after a couple of months apart. He told me he loved me...

I had an appointment near his way, so we decided to catch up. We planned this catch up over a long period of time and I was really looking forward to it.

After the catch up he started acting really weird, it took 2 weeks of asking what was wrong with him and what had happened and how he wasn't being the same. He said that apparently when we caught up he didn't have the 'right vibes' when it came to paying for lunch and that I (ie me) didn't seem to want to pay - which I find rather bizarre. I had assumed I would pay (he had made a point in the past that I must pay for every time we go out). He started acting weird pretty much the day we caught up. I am not sure how he made all this up, and how he felt this way.

He was also annoyed that I offered to pay for a package which got stolen from his mail box the day we caught up - I did this because when we were together my makeup had rubbed off his white shirt and he had made a big deal out of it and had told me he was struggling and couldn't afford to take it to a laundromat (note - he had specially taken a picture of this the night we caught up, and sent it to me the next day) - I had just reacted based off my previous experience with him. There was another thing he raised...but I won't add here, as its complicated.

I wanted us to go on a trip as friends, but he told me he couldn't go halves and expected me to pay for the entire overseas trip as I am doing well financially.

I have worked very hard over the last decade or so, and paid a big price to be where I am financially. I do like nice things, and do spend on nice dresses and shoes. He complained how I didn't have the light-heartedness to spend on him, like I do for myself. I asked if he was my fiancé or husband that I am expected to do these things for him?

Note though in this time I knew him - he never once got me flowers or did anything for me vs what I was doing for him (investing my time and resources helping set him up with a property purchase). My family could see that he was barely doing anything for me, whilst I spent hours on his well being.

THEN, shortly after the last heated chat messages, he came back and asked me to lend him $600 - he was testing me as he wanted to show something was wrong with me - he had lent $600 to his ex girlfriend. I told him that he was saying this after me spending countless hours on him, and wanting his well being. He got really angry and told me he was off the app, and he never saw my last set of messages. This is very typical of him - he did it before when we broke up, and he did it again (even though we were no longer going out, we were speaking every single day, so it has been like a break up).

My research has indicated that he is a narcissist and I am an empath.

I know if I ended up with him for the longer term, he wouldn't care for me or give two hoots about my emotional needs or well being.

I have been blessed with a lot, and I wouldn't mind buying gifts for my partner or doing nice things for them  - but in this instance, it seemed forced, whilst he was doing very little for me. I didn't feel emotionally supported.

I am still missing him and care for him. But perhaps we may never speak again. He has locked me out of his life again. Its been 2 weeks. Just like last time, he hasn't seen my last messages.

I can't put a finger on it on how someone could expect financial benefits, when they haven't even committed to you, and continue expecting it after breaking up?

Is it odd for a man to expect this? Btw he is 40yo. I know I should have better self esteem and let him go. I have been pretty inexperienced with relationships as I have been just focussed on career and work for a very long time. All I know is I genuinely cared for him, and wanted to provide emotional support to begin with - but he seems to just measure things I do in dollars - if its not monetary it doesn't count.

So the other night, I watched this new movie on Netflix called Love Hard, and I want to put it out there. Netflix stole my life, and I want my money! 

I have been a writer and blogger for the last 8 years since I got divorced. I write all about my nonexistent love life and my many horrible dating experiences. I can't tell you how many times I have written about my dates that have gone south and fast, so much so that I call myself the Taylor Swift of blogging because if we go out, chances are I will blog about our date.

So when I watched this show, which was based exactly on what I write about every week, I was like, ""Hey, that's me!"" That's my story, so of course I had to write about it.

It's about a writer who writes a weekly column about all of her horrible dates. She's about to give up when she meets a man online who she clicks with. He checks all of her boxes, and they start talking a lot. He mentions that he would love to spend Christmas with her, and so she decided to surprise him with a visit. But when she meets him, he is a catfish.
For those of you living under a rock, a catfish is a person who steals someone else's identity and pretends to be them. 

I won't spoil the rest for you but will say sometimes it's not all that it seems, and sometimes you may have to step out of the box to find love. I know for me personally, I have definitely stepped out of my box, going alone to single events, stepping out of my own race, religion, and even age group. I wanted to open up my horizons, and as growing up, I mainly dated Italian men. Yes, that old school thing that you only date your own nationality, but I knew I needed to be more open to find love.

Being more open, I have met a lot of wonderful men I wouldn't have if I wasn't. Watching this movie made me have hope and yes, I realized that it was a sappy Christmas movie (my favorite kind of movie) but no matter how many crappy dates I go on, I still have hope.

So today my friends, remember to step out of your box, to be open to different people and to not give up hope even if you've been kissing many frogs because somewhere is your prince charming, maybe just not in the package you were hoping for.

Since we are currently not able to have a physical date, we've had one over a video chat. We live in the same country, he's just abroad now. We had one on Friday and since then I have not heard a word from him. Decided to say hello to him a few days later, only for him to read my messages and never respond to me again. We have known each other for quite a while, had a tiny falling out before resuming talking again and I have not noticed anything off about his behavior.

We were talking just fine before, so I am very concerned about his behavior. He has seen my most recent pictures, so he should not have been surprised about how I look. He even complimented me a few days prior on my picture. I already came up with tons of reasons why he might have disappeared on me - but none of them makes sense. I have not said anything remotely stupid that I have not already told him over texts. So, he should have been aware of this quirk of mine.

Not even once I felt anything off about him. Didn't get a vibe that something was wrong. To make him feel comfortable, I told him that we don't have to exactly talk. We didn't have a chance to meet up last time we were talking, so we decided to make up for it and he said that he always wanted to see how I look. But he has been very chatty throughout the whole conversation. We were always talking. Admittedly, I am more on the shy side and even with my (current) best friends, it took me a little bit to warm up. I have a stupid habit where I like to learn more about other people first but still won't force them to open up to me like a book.

I wish he could have been upfront with me and told me that it was not working. I don't want to chase him, I'm way past that age. And frankly, I am looking for advice on how to deal with this situation, get a better perspective of how it looks from other people's eyes, make myself feel better and move on.

I need to get this off my chest, so here goes:

Almost 9 months ago, I (24/m) broke up with my Ex (of 8 months) because I was struggling to find my own happiness and somewhat wasn't really over my first parter (of 3.5 years). I made the dumb mistake of jumping into a new relationship. However, my new partner was great at sex and we had amazing chemistry. We even enjoyed a lot of our time together. But somewhere, I understood that she wasn't getting the whole deal simply because of my poor mental state.

So, for the next months (almost a year now if you give me 3 more months), I focused on finding my own happiness and spent time building my career, finding new hobbies and giving myself the 'alone' time I deserved. Right now, I am in a much better place mentally. I have been through therapy, I am quite content in my own space and don't mind being single for the rest of my life.

However, my sex drive and understanding of romance don't mix quite well. While I have no issues attracting women, I quickly jump in emotionally and start understanding their patterns, attachment styles, drive, etc. What happens later are either of two things - I get dad-zoned (this is hilarious but true! women see me as this 'father figure' and seek comfort in my words) or rejected because I don't want long-term intimacy. 

Given my hectic life and plans for the future, I have no time to invest in a relationship. At the same time, the moment I find a woman interesting, the pp-energy starts working and all I can think of is ""will this woman be comfortable having a purely physical relationship with me?"" 

It sucks because I never thought I'll become this person. And, I don't know what to do about it.

So i had a guy ask me to meet. But any place i suggested that is not the road or metro station he makes some excuse not to go. This has happened before. Even if the place is not costly. And i am willing to pay for my share.

I feel like a lot of guys i meet end up making excuses to not go out anywhere with me. The kind of places they pick are more like places i would meet someone if i had to pick something and go and not actually meet.

I usually tell them to meet some other time when they have more time. Or they ask to meet at their home, and i need to know someone to a certain extent to go to their home which happens by spending time together and not after i am alone with you already. This is backwards to me. And I see a pattern here.

And it's making me feel like people don't want to be seen with me. I look ok. And i dress fine. I wouldn't say i look very good but i am fine even if slightly different. It's starting to bother me. Especially because i am a freelancer and already spend most of my time alone at home. If i am going to socialise i would rather play boardgames with my group rather than go to an almost stranger's home. You gotta think about what you are bringing to the plate before you ask me to make the effort to travel to a noisy road for a 5 min meet or all the way to your home and back.

It's asking too much from a person you know very little. Let me make that decision after i know you so i WANT to spend time alone with you instead of meet me alone or bye.

Anyway, I've reached to the conclusion that i should approach the men that i am interested in, rather than waiting for someone to approach me. 
I wanted to know, obviously, being overweight how can i approach the guy I'm interested in without looking desperate?
Does approaching a guy make them think that you're easy? (I've had this experience in the past, i do admit I was too available for him)

We went on a few great dates together and I was having a lot of fun getting to know him. I'm in a place where I'm looking for something more serious and was excited to see where it was going. It became clear that we were most likely on different pages - I felt he wanted to rush into things sexually (no judgement), and it became hard to figure out time to go on dates which was frustrating because I'm really busy and last minute plans don't really work for me.

I ended up breaking things off with him but was polite about it and there wasn't any bad blood between us, just felt like it wasn't working out. After about a month or two of not speaking, he reached out to me and asked me to get drinks - I was hesitant at first but we started talking again and eventually meeting again in person. 

Long story short, because of how he behaved before I really don't see this going somewhere serious with him, but he was fun to hook up with so I was open to keeping things casual. To give some more background, I'm not super sexually experienced and have been wanting to explore more so when he asked if we could keep things casual I agreed and figured it wouldn't hurt to have some fun while also pursuing dating other people more seriously.

Last week we made plans for me to come over one night after work and we ordered dinner and watched a movie. After a few drinks, he said something like ""I can't figure out if you actually like me"" and asked if we could be casual but still go out together sometimes. I asked him to elaborate on that and when he started stumbling over his words, I told him if we're going to keep this fun and casual he can't be confusing and give me mixed messages and moved on from the conversation.

We ended up having a fun night together but when I woke up I couldn't help but think about his weird commentary and slightly mixed messages.

I missed him very much in those two months, they seemed like forever. I went back to just being by myself and trying to cope. I got busy and trusted my best to be optimistic about the situation. But despite deleting his number and unfollowing him on social media to help me get over him I still could seem to get over him.
I though about him all the time and how I wished he was doing well. I wanting to share so many things with him and needless to say everything reminded me of him. 
I would later then try to go on a date and see if maybe that would help. But I couldn’t stop looking for him in the other person so I decided I wasn’t ready to date just yet.

Recently my car had been having so trouble and I took it to the shop yesterday. It so happens that our little ice cream date spot was right across. And it was the same parking lot we danced in for hours in the rain. Needless to say everything rushed back in. I had been fighting the urge to call him and ask how he’s doing for the last couple of days. Seeing as he clearly didn’t want anything to do with me. I was the last person to text between the both and he never replied after having told me that there was nothing that could scare him away and that he really liked me. 
I though I would preserve what little dignity I had and not call or text him. No matter how much I wanted to.

After that errand I went home and fell asleep but my phone ringing woke me up. When I saw the contact name I though I must be going insane. Could it be that I missed him so much that my brain was starting to change people’s contact in my phone? Was I dreaming???

My heart pounding in my chest I take the phone call.
He started apologizing. I couldn’t believe my ears. His voice made my heart so happy I was scared that I might forget how he sounded. 
And yet he started explaining himself. Mind you, I had not said a word other than your standard “hello?” 
He said he didn’t think that I would pick up and that he had been mentally getting ready to leave a voice message. That he’d been a jerk for leaving the things the way he did. That I never did anything wrong. He said I had been so kind and understanding that he should’ve jus communicated with me. He also said that he couldn’t stop thinking about me since the last time we saw each other two months ago. 
Said that he was constantly reminded of me and that he missed me and hearing my voice. That there was never anyone else and that it holds true even now. He said that he missed me and that if I would have him he would make it up to me. That he would love to keep seeing me.

I was stunned beyond belief, hoping so badly that this wasn’t a dream. Even then I couldn’t bring myself to feel any type of anger or resentment towards him. Is this not what I had wanted and exactly how I wanted it?  
I struggled to get my thoughts together but told him that I was glad he called. To forgive me if I was a little off as he had caught me completely off guard.
I said that I understood, though I was not mad at him I had been left disappointed. But I would love to see him again and that I a would think on him a lot.

He apologized again and he asked me on for a date this Sunday.

I’m very nervous but I think above all very very happy. My friends and family are also very happy for me but warn me that I should be a little more cautious with him this time around. 
And I agree, but how do I do that when all I want to do is move forward with him and be happy with him.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1134332,public,self,"Got ghosted for two months, he called yesterday out of the blue",0,[],0.5,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rb193a/got_ghosted_for_two_months_he_called_yesterday/,no_ads,0,dating,,,,,,

Afterwords she starts telling me that she doesn’t know what she wants anymore, we start talking about it and what she wants to do at the time she was saying stuff like , “I don’t want to break up”, “we’re still gonna see and talk to each-other” , “ I just need some time to my self to think about things and what I wanna do” “it’s not gonna be this drastic change that you’re thinking of”. After all of that I was still upset obviously but if she felt as if that’s what she needed then that’s okay with me I’m not gonna force her to be in a relationship if she doesn’t want it. So after this talk I left her house and this is when the truth started to come out. Little things started happening every day.

First she deleted almost all of pics on instagram not even a full two days after. 

She started to talk to me less and less every day. From being on delivered for a couple hours to a whole day. Then she stopped flirting all together no I love you or anything like that not even a how are you. Which to be honest I completely understand but why lie and say all those things to just be flipped around like that.

Then thanksgiving comes along and I receive a phone call from her saying how she wants me to come over for a little bit, even though I was still upset and everything I still wanted to see her as I still care and love for her and her well being. But from the moment I get there to the moment I leave she’s acting so weird and distant, genuinely she looked as if she didn’t want me there and it’s like why even invite me then if that’s how your gonna be.

Then another week passes of talking on a phone call maybe 10 mins every other day. At this point we’re still not even officially broken up yet. So that’s when I fully just connect the dots and stand up for myself a little, I went over her house to grab a bunch of my clothes and I start telling her how her actions and feelings to me are obviously saying she does not want to be together anymore. She cried for a while , I don’t know why she’s the one causing me the pain. Then after words as we’re talking about this she finally admits saying that we’re still gonna talk but we’re not together and to be honest I wasn’t mad at her because she finally gave me a straight up answer and wasn’t leaving me hanging. 

Until 4 days later she calls me and says “ this is a little weird but do you wanna hang out today” I was shocked and kinda happy that she reached out to me like that so I said yeah and I went over her house. Everything was fine we were chilling until she was showing me something on her phone and a text from a guy named Kev pops up on her phone that says “still out”. I didn’t get angry or mad I was kinda jokingly like “ oh is that your new man or sum” and at first she kinda avoided the question until I straight up asked who is that. She said it was her coworker and that they were just friends and that she doesn’t hangout with him or anything like. Didn’t think anything of it told myself whatever and I left. 
Then I get a call the next day again from her and she’s asking to do something again , I tell myself what ever and go. Everything was fine until this kev guy starts calling her and she starts laughing as he does. She doesn’t end up picking up but she was reluctant and seemed scared to tell me it was him calling. I calmly asked like if she had plans with him or something and she says no we’re just friends I don’t know why he’s calling me. I forget about until he calls again 30 mins later and she doesn’t pick up again. She said it’s not like that or anything he’s just a friend that have normal conversations. I just don’t know what to do I feel like the signs are obvious but I know she won’t admit to it if it’s actually true . I guess it could be coincidental but I don’t know she seemed so weird when I saw it , it was too much to ignore.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1134342,public,self,Please help,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rb21fh/please_help/,no_ads,0,dating,,,,,,

**The Background**

So, I work at an Antique Store. I work 5-6 days per week and the hours are 10 AM to 6 PM. We have anywhere from 50-450 people per day visit - depending on the day of the week or time of the season. So, we can either be really slow or very busy.

Well, my coworkers / friends are quite helpful in helping me with advice, tips, and even workload when it comes to giving me a shot with a girl because they are fully aware that I am a hopeless romantic (still virgin at 29 years old). I've never had a first date, first kiss, or anything sexual occur in my life. I've asked dozens of women out on a date, been on dating apps for years (5+ for some), and have absolutely 0% success.

That is... until Molly came along. 

This girl visits once per month. Every time she visits, it's like we get lost in each other's eyes. For the first couple of months, I was too afraid to ask her out due to fear of rejection. But then something different happened to me - I feared the ""yes."" So, for 3.5 months I struggled to deal with this newfound fear of receiving a ""yes"" from Molly, because I thought she would genuinely want to go out with me. Then came October - an exceedingly busy time for the store - and I found myself wondering if maybe this wasn't the right time because I'll be too busy working to have time for her, etc. Once I went there, I had an epiphany - there's never such a thing as the right time (I already knew this), but you never know if something will work out in life. So, why not ask her out, then she'll say ""yes,"" (probably) then I'll just take it one step at a time. Sure, I'd probably fumble, make mistakes, and screw everything up, but I'd feel better knowing that I tried and failed rather than never tried at all.

So, her parents are Dealers at the store and own multiple booths. She's not a customer, but she does occasionally drop by to help them with their booths (sometimes when they aren't there, which gives us time to chat one-on-one). So, once I made up my mind, I talked with my coworkers/friends for some advice (I have a tendency to act irrational if my heart flutters too much), then texted her mom asking when the next time would be that Molly would be in the store and specified that I needed to talk to her about ""something personal."" Her mom said: ""She'll be in later this week.""  


1 week later. She's a no-show. I even worked extra days and burned myself out just to reduce the chance of missing her. Now, from what we gather, she's quite close to her mom; so, I'm sure that she got the message and understood my underlying meaning. 

Her mom ended up coming in by herself on a Friday - and for some odd reason she avoided the heck out of me (in a very strange manner). I wanted to ask her where Molly was, but decided against it because I figured that the reason why she was acting strange was because she figured I was going to ask Molly out and Molly wasn't with her. Or something along those lines.

Now, I didn't work on a Wednesday, but my coworkers did and they said that she got a new boyfriend and that he came in to the store with her to help her with the booth arrangement. They got a video/picture of the guy and showed how giggly and happy she was when she was with him.

Now I'm crushed. I was pissed off to the core. Super enraged. I had fully moved on from her and everything about her... or so I thought. The strange thing about Molly is that every time that she walks in the store - everything that I was thinking about goes right out the window. \*Poof\* 

So, the following Friday (2 days after she came in with her new boyfriend), she came in to the store by herself. She needed help with a table and some chairs out of the truck and my boss/friend immediately volunteered me to help. I wasn't happy, but I consider myself to be able to handle myself in a Professional Manner towards a Dealer's Daughter. So, I helped her. 

Naturally, being around her and getting lost in her eyes, again, I wasn't angry any more. So, as I was helping her, some customers were checking out the booth where the table and chairs would go. So, I recommended that we walk around the store for a bit and chat while we waited for them to finish browsing. So, we chit chat for a bit, then I moved in the table and chairs, and then when she was writing the tag out for the table and chairs I noticed something particular - her hands were shaking. I think she was nervous being around me and in my head I thought: ""Maybe, she still likes me.""

So, I was like ""Eff it."" I decided to ask her out - knowing full well that she had a boyfriend. And I got an unexpected answer. 

**Asking Her Out Session**

So, I popped the question: ""Hey, would you like to go out to eat lunch sometime?""  
Molly: She took a step back. Leaned against the chair. Then asked: ""You mean... like a date?""  
Me: ""Yes, like a date.""  
Molly: ""Well, I have a boyfriend that I just got, but if it doesn't work out with him, then Yes. I'll go out with you.""  
Me: ""OK. Well, just let me know if it doesn't work out."" Big smile on my face.  
Molly: ""OK."" Big smile on her face.  
Then, I walked away and went back to the front desk area with my coworkers.

**The Next Day**

So, she showed up the next day with her dad to move a piece of furniture in to the store. Unfortunately, this was a very busy Saturday and the order came down to not help any dealers because customers were first. But fortunately, it was the first day that we had convinced a Shaved Ice Food Truck to setup in our parking lot. So, naturally, I waited for a time when her dad wasn't around (because I knew if I asked open to the floor - he would definitely of taken me up on it) and asked her if she wanted a Shaved Ice. She said she wanted Cherry flavor as that's her favorite flavor. So, I bought her a Shaved Ice and she was super happy/jolly about it. I felt good. I always wanted to do that for a girl - so, even though we're not dating, I still got something good out of it.

**1 Month Later**

She didn't show up for another month. We were busy at the store, but I thought about her every day. I don't have her phone number and, literally, no one can add her to friends on Facebook (her privacy settings are almost maxed out). Heck, I even had a ""spur of the moment"" back in July and asked her out via Facebook Message - to this day it goes unread. 

She showed up on a Thursday, which was perfect because my manager that day was a really cool guy and he let me spend an entire hour with her while he and the other staff did End of Day close out and such. It wasn't too busy, either. She wore comfy, yet sexy clothing (like yoga pants, which are the best invention ever). My boss said she was teasing me the whole time with her clothes and the things she did. I was happy to be teased, honestly.

Anyways, we talked a good bit and I helped her with the booth. We realized that we watch a lot of the same shows and that we liked the same characters. She even initiated a majority of the questions. But somewhere along the way she was cleaning an item with her shirt and I offered to get her a duster, but she said: ""It's fine. It's my boyfriend's shirt, anyways. Not that he can have it back since I cut it in half, but yeah."" And I asked and she said she was still dating him. I said: ""At least he's a good guy, right?"" And she said: ""Yeah, he's a good guy.""

Before leaving she gave me a big hug. I asked my friends whether that was a hug as a friend or more - to the best of my knowledge they claim it was a hug for more than friends because of how close she got to me. She even forgot her stuff before hopping in her car - so, I brought it out to her and she said: ""It's your fault. You had me so distracted!"" as she said with a smile on her face. I said I was happy to be a distraction.

Admittedly, I forgot to ask for her number because we just hit off so easily, but I digress.

**Another Month Later**

Tons of changes have been occuring at the store. The other co-manager has since been let go and so I stepped up to fill the void. My friend is now the only manager and we're happy with the changes and progress, but it definitely has us working to the bone. My schedule has shifted now to working on Monday and Wednesday and have Tuesday and Thursday off. So, naturally, she wasn't aware of this and came in on Thursday by herself (probably to see me, again). 

So, I'm not sure what to do right now. I don't know what to say or whether to ask for her number or not. I want to talk to her more than once per month - that part is driving me nuts, but I don't know how to reach her. I don't want to ask her parents for her number since she's currently dating the guy. 

I don't know what to do. I initially thought since we'd been talking for those 8+ months prior to me asking her out that the boyfriend wouldn't last long and she'd break up with him, but 2 months later and she's still dating him. 

I know I should move on, but every time I see her I just get lost in her eyes and I can't help it.

**TL;DR**

Girl has my head spinning and now that she's got a new boyfriend - I don't know what to do. I want to be her main guy and not her backup guy, but she's still with him. It makes me jealous that he gets to have her for all the good holidays that the year has to offer. Just don't know what to do.

Some background for context me and my boyfriend have been together a year and a half long distance. He works traveling. I live in California while he reside in Atlanta but visits California weekly . These past few months I’d say 3 months in total he was sent to New Jersey weekly I flew out once to see him in the 3 months he wasn’t able to come to California for a week. Now he is back to regular schedule and coming to California weekly. Before he went to New Jersey we would see each other almost every day if not every other day and talk daily. Now since he started coming back to California weekly I see him maybe twice a week if I’m lucky and he barley checks in on how I’m doing. But has all the time for a female coworker. He does work a lot and I get the traveling but I’m feeling like im not a priority at all anymore and I’m begging for attention or communication and I hate feeling like this. I recently tried to talk to him about it to let him know how I’m feeling and I’d like to see him more and he said he’d do better but turned it into me “complaining”.

So In the beginning of me (23F) and him (23M) dating, he had told me that he was dating another woman. As time had went by I would feel anxious and a little scared. because many times before it would be men who would have other woman in the picture and they would choose them all the time.

I didn't want this to happen to me so sometimes I would be emotional about it, but I would have to realize that we were JUST dating and not in a relationship yet. months would go by and all the bundled up trauma I had would be sometimes make me very emotional. Especially because me and him would go on dates so often and be around each other, so the thought of him laying down with another woman while doing all that with me made me depressed, insecure and i would ask for reassurance often.

This would go to me crying about how I didn't feel like I was doing enough, I didn't feel like he liked me, and wanting to fully understand if I was doing right. he would say he couldn't reassure me all the time which was understandable because I had to learn to stand on my own two feet at one point without him. He asked me to be less affectionate because when the girl was in the picture I had such a hard time accepting it. I think that right now, he is still thinking that I'm going to be emotional but I'm not. he made the decision to let her go when he rethought about his feelings with me.

Im happy but I don't want to be emotional or too sentimental anymore. I'm in therapy which is doing me some good. I try to make sure he has a lot of attention and affection since I work a lot. I mostly work all day so I wanted to make sure I would cover all basis. I hate complaining and whining, I do make sure that he is being reassured and cared for 100 percent especially since he works over night.

Handsome, smart, good job (public school teacher), articulate, witty, charming, etc etc etc

SO EXCITED until he dropped this bomb: ""I like my women to spoil me""

I thought about it for a couple minutes and said to myself ""Surely he's referring to being spoiled in a sexual capacity, ie starting every romp with oral, or whatever floats his boat""

So I said ""You mean like sexually?""

He goes ""No, I like my women to buy me things and take me on shopping sprees""

This man makes 3 times the money that I do, and he knows this based on what we both do for a living, has a beautiful house (saw the inside briefly when we met up to drive together to the restaurant) a new SUV and an excellent job.

I'm a struggling single mother.

I just found it SO bizarre... like I can understand wanting to be remembered on birthdays and Xmas, etc... which I am very thoughtful and good about, but just random ""Spend money on me"" when I don't necessarily have that to give?

I got out of a 5 year relationship right before covid. Been single for almost two years now, decided to work on myself, got into shape, reached some educational goals and got an awesome new job.

I decided I missed having a partner in my life. Joined a few online dating apps and went on a couple dates. One girl I was very interested in, and thought she was interested in me, but now trying to accept the fact she just isn't.

We've gone on 4 dates, first 2 were awesome, ended up hanging out for 6-7 hours just talking over drinks, held hands on the second. Went out for a quick bite before I went out of town a few weeks ago for our third date and our fourth was over this past weekend. We were suppose to go grab food, which we did, and come hangout and watch a movie at my place with some adult hot chocolate. I've initiated all but the last date (She asked me if I wanted to do something, but I initiated text)

Other than once or twice, I've initiated text conversations, not like a madman, just conversations here and there throughout the week and she would respond positively from what I could tell. After the weekend, I've texted her once, just to check in and it seemed like a very uninterested response or maybe I just think it was an uninterested responses because I am an over thinker and after I sent what may have been a weird text? (I don't think it was that weird though - just straight up)

I picked her up, we had dinner, and we stopped somewhere to pick something up and she hits me with ""Do you mind just taking me home?"" Of course, I said, while feeling like I was gonna puke from the feeling of rejection. She had a valid excuse, but also could have been an excuse to ditch someone out. Kiss on the cheek, she said ""see you soon?"" ""text me"" as she left. She tried making conversation on the drive home, but I was just feeling so down I probably seemed like a debbie downer while stuck in my own head

I tried to be straight forward later that night and straight up asked her if she was into me  because I liked her. She said she really likes me, but shes just busier than she thought she would be and is stressed from work. I said OK cool I can deal with that, just want to make sure I'm not missing something (IE wasting my time). No response to that.

I went out and bought ingredients to make some spiked, made-from-scratch hot cocoa, cleaned myself up, cleaned up my house. I was excited to come have an intimate evening, not even sex, I was just expecting an intimate environment where we could connect. I can understand if you're not feeling well. Regardless, I felt like a total.....idiot I guess. 

She says she really likes me, and our dates have gone well I think, or else why would she agree to more than one? But then, really, you can't take 5 mins out of your day to say hey, hope you're doing alright. You're THAT busy? Just to show someone you are thinking of them? No reschedule after going home early?

Since then I had dated using apps, but never got past more than a 3rd date and generally would only get to one date and would get ghosted or told it wouldn’t work out. Deleted dating apps in 2016 and was actually content with being alone. I wasn’t opposed to dating but just didn’t want to go through apps anymore. In 2019 a relationship fell into my lap and we were happy for a while but didn’t work out. We needed things amicably in January this year. 

Since then I’ve really wanted someone again and I’m currently in search of a long term relationship. Got back on apps (basically everything except tinder). I am  pretty upfront about wanting a long term relationship and all of the women I talk to are looking for the same thing. 

My problem is I’m getting stuck in a similar rut as I used to with apps. I don’t get a ton of attention on the apps but when I do I generally have really good conversations with them and when we meet the dates have been good. They even say things like “you’re so sweet, nice, etc.” and get gassed up about being a breath of fresh air on the apps. I will talk to them for a week or two and then either get ghosted or told it’s not going to work out.

I asked him on our second date (after 4 months of talking) what his intentions were and he said he wanted to 'go with the flow' and see where things go. I took that as 'I want to keep things casual and don't want to commit'. While I want commitment, I decided to take things casual too and enjoy the company while it lasts. We haven't had sex btw.

* Called me twice (while he was a little intoxicated) and asked how much I liked him. He told me he liked me more than I liked him and that he was acting like a simp towards me. Asked me if we can get married and called me his wife the entire night. Told me he was sitting by himself like a loser because all he wanted to talk to me. He also asked where I was and joked how he's like a jealous boyfriend.
* Told me he's deleted all dating apps for me. We met on Instagram and I don't have any dating apps so not sure why he told me that.
* He has said repeatedly that he is not talking to anyone else even though I call him a fuckboy (inside joke). He said he invests whatever time he can get for me.
* I said I was going out for a friend's birthday at a bar and he said 'just don't hook up with anyone please but I know you're not like that'

Am I reading too much into what he says? I just feel a bit confused. At this point, I am saving myself from getting hurt and not becoming emotionally invested in him but it is still confusing.

After she told me that I told her no worries etc I think your a cool person etc.

And I texted her a lil bit more I know probably shouldn't and she then told me to bot etc and a couple of months later this November was her birthday so I sent her a bday message and she blocked me etc.

I have never strongly cared about any woman as much as her and still think about her months later, I feel bad for pushing her boundaries by texting etc and want to message her or send her a voice message apologising etc but don't know if i should.

All I know is I really like her and would like to remain friendly or at least on friend terms, I value her and I'm normally not the sort of person to have became needy and feel terrible and also that she sees me in that light.

In essence when she ended things she said that she liked me but in essence although she didn't say it felt i was needy etc.

I don't care if I ever see her again all I would like is to wish her a happy birthday etc and chat a little bit here and there.

We had something quite special initially and she even said so herself.
