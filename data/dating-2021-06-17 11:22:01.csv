2,o21kuj,1623948045,Did I do the right thing?,So I went on a pretty sweet first date with a girl. She texted me after saying she had fun. I tried to set up plans again the day after but she said the date I picked was far ahead and she would let me know. Then she let me know that should couldn’t hang on the weekend but she would be down to chill again. I told her the days I was free and then I got silence. I’m not going to reach out to her again because I’ve been doing most of the initiating and I want to to see if she actually likes me. The way I see it I told her when I was free and the ball is completely in her court. Am I right to just give her silence since I was the last to text and told her when I was free? She hasn’t hit me up in almost two days so I’m ready to just chalk up the L. But I made the plans farther ahead so maybe she is waiting to let me know.

She had a really tough past and has been in abusive relationships a couple months ago she was admitted to a rehab centre for personal reasons. She was there for a month and it hurt because I couldn’t talk to her. When she came out it’s all just seemed broken. She sent me a screenshot of her snap a few months ago to show the pink hearts and on there I saw a guys name that she was best friends with. Out of curiosity I asked who he was and she said her cousin. Well yesterday the name came up again and it turns out she had a boyfriend a few years ago with the same name. When questioned about it she said it’s not the same guy and I’m being dumb. When I asked her to just be honest she said it was him and lied to me. There’s also been days now where she suddenly talks to friends she hadn’t spoken to in years. One day she went to meet a friend who tried breaking us up and she said she wouldn’t talk to again but refused to say where then it was a friend from work the next day and then a friend she hadn’t spoken too since high school the next. I may sound possessive here but after lying aboht her ex I just don’t know if I should trust her.

We both have busy schedules and live almost an hour apart, and I told Barb from the start that I wasn't sure if I was looking for something serious or not. Barb was cool with that, and agreed to just take it as it goes. The only thing she asked of me to was just to be up front with her if my feelings about anything change, and I promised I would. Hanging out with Barb was always nice, but I never felt any big sparks, at least not yet.

Now things have changed, because I've met another woman (I'll call her Mary) that I'm really excited about and really interested in. Lots of sparks. Even though I've only gone out with Mary a few times, it feels uncomfortable to me to think about continuing to see both women. My connection with Mary is a lot stronger. I want to break things off with Barb - I'm just not sure how to do it, or what to say. I'd rather not say ""I found someone else I have a better connection with and don't feel comfortable continuing to see both of you, so ... this is it for me"" -- I feel like that would hurt a lot to hear, and she doesn't necessarily need to know the reason behind my decision.

I texted her saying that we met a year ago and asked if still remembers me and I invited her for a BBQ party along with the same group at my new house over text. She replied that she remembers me. But, as she's going on vacation for 2 weeks she can't attend. At this point I don't know if she's being nice and avoiding me or it's the truth.

My initial plan was to talk to her after she shows up at the party and express my interest in going out with her. Now that, it didn't worked out what are my best options to approach her and express my interest in her. I'm not looking for 1 night stands. I want to date her and see where it goes.

If you aren't interested in reading all the way through essentially I would be very grateful If I could have some help starting conversations and some general tips (and pep talks?!?! 😂) for a Brazilian girl who wants to video call me.

___________________________________________________

 I very recently met this beautiful brazillian girl online. We are both 16 (you don't have to point out thag we are young, I knoe) and despite the language barrier of myself speaking negligible Portuguese and her very basic english we have made some conversation she asked me to video call her sometime soon. I've been holding it off today, staying off my phone because as you can expect I am pooping myself, to stay less vulgar. In a way it is the closest thing to a real interaction we can get thanks to this little barrier called the ocean (Damn you water!) so I don't want to mess this up - I don't know what to say. You know, all of this ""first impressions are everything"" malarkey has me feeling quite threatened. Also the previosuly mentioned language barrier is less than ideal... 

I'm not just saying this like some normal delusional teen, she is absolutely gorgeous, she looks like one of those women you only see on instgram that many believe to be myths with her and all her exoticness- A solid 9 or 10 compared to me who is quite a bit below the level she could pull which Is why, for a change, I am quite nervous and suprised that she has taken at least a little interest.
It feels like a job interview! 😂

 And isn't just based off of looks alone - I'm not just thinking with my little pecker, we actually share a surprising amount in common in terms of interests, from what she wrote in her bio, and I think we couod get along very well. 

Essentially, I don't know what to say or wear since it is almost like a date essentially. I'm also nervous that she won't think I'm that great looking even though she has already seen my face before.

I feel like a big part of the 'game' is to 'like bomb' the shit out of every new post a woman makes. I see male Realtors doing this to female Realtor friend groups all the time in an effort to create attraction/ interest/ jealousy among friends in friend groups and general intrigue. The man will just like every new post for 20-30-40 attractive females continually till he starts getting attention. Whatever it is, this is most certainly a thing that is being leveraged to great results by people that do it well.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the thing though, this is clearly manipulation, so I can't engage in it. But it works.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't think it will work in the long run of a relationship however, only as a pick-up skill.

&amp;#x200B;

Once a relationship starts I feel like this would become very constraining, you should love in a way that allows the other person to be free, and this is not freeing. This behavior is onerous, monotonous, tedious, and has to continue and when it continues it loses it's mystery and make you a predictable nice guy stalker THAT WILL NOT GO AWAY WHEN THE REALTIONSHIP ENDS.

We've had a few virtual dates that went well, but the downside is that she lives inside the city (a bigger city) about 50 minutes away and she doesn't have a car to get around because she relies on public transit. We're both in our 30s, and the reason I was considering this situation is because while I live in a densely populated area, I tend to find women who live in the city are more my type.

Ultimately, I realized that distance and amount of effort that keeping up a relationship would require would be more disruptive to its success, though. Meeting up for a date or two at first seemed exciting, but if I have to drive out to her every week on a regular basis, or pick her up to come visit me, it would likely become a lot of work and time-consuming. She doesn't plan on moving away from the city and currently, I have no plans to move closer in either.

I feel bad and a little sad, though, because this was a rare good match and I normally don't come across promising matches before they end up ghosting/suddenly losing interest.

His self confidence isn’t great and he’s a little shy.  We’ve known each other for ~4 months now and we hang out pretty much every day.  He obviously likes me in a friendly way but I’ve also picked up on what I think are hints he likes me more than that.

Well we just went to a new restaurant we wanted to try.  Afterwards we smoked a blunt and at one point he said (paraphrased as well as much as possible) “you’re like an angel sent from heaven to look after me - you’ve always been there when I need you and you’ve never said no to helping me.  I hope sometime I get to repay you for that”

My mind is interpreting that as either I’m super deep in the friendzone or he was hitting on me.  Is that a reasonable interpretation?  He’s also dropped hints like effectively describing me when talking about ideal person he’d like to date (I’m a stark contrast to his usual “type”) and using my name in conversation frequently.

39,o25g68,1623957885,Ending things for my own sake,"I've been seeing one guy since the beginning of the year, we've known each other for about 5-6 years and always kept in touch through social media. Usually, he was the one to reach out first.

We've started of casually, and have talked about past hook ups/ fwb and relationships.

Ever since meeting up, we're having a great time and we both acknowledge each other. 

I do have to admit that I feel some type of way for him, and what we have is more than a fwb situation.

I'm really angry at myself that we didn't label our ""relationship"" as anything and just went with the flow.

Even tho we had a great time, there were also some bad periods too. I don't want to go too much into detail, but he didn't want to break things up even tho I told him that I wouldn't get mad at him if he'd want to cut me off as it would've been completely understandable.

This past weekend I got a bit angry at him, because I thought he was having sex with others (we agreed to not sleep with anyone else so we don't need to use condoms). 

We talked it out, and as I understood it it's really just a fwb situation for him. I am important to him but it's platonic. At least that's how I grasped it. 

I guess I just got influenced by the comments of my friends, cause everyone agreed on the fact that we are more than fwb.

I CAN NOT talk about my feelings, idk why, but something just stops me. So I decided to write him a letter and give it to him the next time he's here... 

I really let my emotions take over and didn't hold back while writing. The letter hes about 6 pages lmao, and yeah.

I showed a little bit of it to my friend and she started crying because even she felt how strong my feelings are. 

I don't think that I have ever cut someone off this way. Well, I'm not cutting him off - I wrote that I can't act as if there isn't more, and that I need time to sort my emotions out.

If I know that it's just a fwb situatiom for jim I'm fine with it, it's just that I need a break.

It wasn’t bad sex or anything but there was a lot of nerves on my end so I wasn’t fully comfortable. And when we talked about it he said he didn’t feel a connection. I asked if he meant mentally or physically and he said both but mostly mentally. He said we should take a break from the sexual side of things and get to know each other better.

When I would ask to hangout, before we had sex he would tell me everyday he was available and we’d make plans. I asked him recently and he was like “I’ll let you know my schedule” and he hasn’t followed up about it. I’ve been wanting to ask about it again but I feel the energy of desperation or like I am more invested than he is and it is bothering me. 

I know he’s keeping his options open so I feel like maybe I should just move on. We’ve been communicating everyday but it just doesn’t feel as mutual as it did in the beginning. Like I feel so anxious about whether or not the feelings are still there for him.

53,o27n1s,1623963369,You Got This!,"18-year-old female here. I know I’m younger than a lot of you, but I do understand that dating can be super hard. Until recently, I had not dated in a year. No one had ever taken me on a date and all my relationships lasted less than a month. The only relationship that was long term lasted 3 months and it was incredibly abusive. I had very low self-esteem and felt like guys would only ever want me for sex and that was it. Due to the abuse I experienced and other things, I really struggled to have any kind of positive relationship. I was aggressive and manipulative because I was scared to deal with the constant pain I was feeling. When I was around 17, I started to really work on myself. I focused on deciding which morals I wanted to follow and stuck with them. I began treating other people better and I slowly began to feel like my old self from before the abuse happened. Not only was I happier, but the people around me were happier. I began to work even harder to be fair and kind to people, and soon I not only had a lot of friends but guys showed interest in me for more than sex! I had a few crash and burns before I met my current boyfriend, who is amazing and everything I’ve ever wanted. We are fair with each other, we argue but do not fight, and we are happy. It’s been a huge weight off my shoulders to feel like I can be loved. This all happened because I became a better version of me. I think the question to ask yourself today if you are currently miserable and single is if you are your best you. Not “are you perfect?” but rather “have you become someone that not only others love but you love?” I promise you that it can be very frustrating to know you’ve tried and failed when you’ve done your best, but I urge you to keep trying. If you’ve put in your all with zero results, it’s not your fault. The only thing to do is keep trying.

TLDR: If you want love, put yourself out there. Be real and genuine, and be confident in yourself. The right person will see your effort and reciprocate. It’s hard but I know you’ve got this!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o27n1s/you_got_this/

55,o27rso,1623963707,Started a new job and discovered I’m gonna be working with an old high school crush; how can I make this less awkward that it needs to be?,"
Basically what the title says. I’m 22M for reference. I had a big massive awkward crush on a girl I used to sit next to in class who I got along really well with, I was always too shy to do anything about it, and was a bit of an ugly duckling so nothing ever happened, but all my friends knew and would tease me about it in front of her. Typical high school shit. We talked and messaged for a bit and I told her I liked her, she told me she’d already known for a while and when it became obvious nothing was gonna happen I kinda let it be. We’re still on good terms though obviously and I’ve saw her on a few drunken nights out where we’ve been happy to see each other. I was completely over it years ago, now it’s just something I look back on and laugh at.

Over the years I’ve become better looking and less awkward, and she got a boyfriend.  One night at a New Years party we bumped into each other, and her boyfriend was standing right there while she was getting all close to me and saying ‘you know, it’s such a shame we don’t talk anymore, I miss you so much’, being all flirty, etc., she was clearly really drunk and her boyfriend was looking at me like I’d murdered someone so I kind of just exited the convo as soon as I could hahaha. It was kind of gratifying to have your unattainable high school crush kind of flirt with you, but that was it really.

Anyway, i recently started a new job and out of curiosity checked the schedule for my shift tomorrow to see if there’s any familiar names (it’s kind of a small town), and guess who’s on my shift with me. Yeah, her. I was vaguely aware she worked there a couple years back, but was under the impression she went back to an old job she had. But nope, there it is.

Even though I have no feelings towards her, I feel like seeing her is gonna make me revert into that shy and awkward way I used to be. There’s just a bit of history there I suppose; she knew I liked her, we were pretty close at one point, the whole thing at that party that one time, etc., I just think there could be a bit of awkwardness there. I feel like I just have to act completely aloof and like none of it happened, and just be friendly and happy to see her, but it just makes me internally cringe knowing how shy I was with her and how badly I handed that crush. I know she still thinks well of me, but it was all so awkward and just full of high school bullshit. I have no idea how I’m gonna act around her. How can I not act the same way around her as before? We get along well and I’m sure it will be fine, but I fully realise we both know how I used to feel and I want to make sure she’s as comfortable as possible with me.

 I don’t know if this is the proper subreddit but I would greatly appreciate any input.  I (26F) don’t want to misjudge an acquaintance from childhood (26M), who I have kept occasional contact with. Some background: 

We has crushed on each other in elementary school. This changed as we got older, but I’ve always sensed that he hangs on to it, but I am unsure? 

He attempted to flirt in middle/high school. I would not engage if too direct. We would talk, but sometimes I felt the need to distance. On occasions, we talked after high school. Two years ago, we met for coffee. I enjoyed catching up, and mentioned that it could maybe be a yearly thing. 

However, he made odd comments like, “I see this as a new beginning. I see this as a new chapter. I want to keep seeing you and creating a friendship. Even if you have only fifteen minutes when you come up to your parents for a walk, I can always drive and meet up with you.” He offered take me out for a drink on my birthday, I politely declined. I felt uneasy, like he was trying to push something on to me? I tried to communicate that my main focus is school. 

Today, he reached out and asked to meet for coffee. He said I could join him for a walk with his dog since he is often near the area where my parents live. 

He is a genuine person. I truly want to see him happy but I am not interested in him. We have different communication styles, goals, etc. I worry that if I agree to meeting up, he may make odd comments again. It's just awkward because I don't know how to respond. I do not want to say anything that would negatively affect him or his confidence. I just have this odd gut feeling. I don’t think he would do anything bad, but I just feel uncomfortable?

Am I misinterpreting his intentions? Am I misjudging this gut feeling I have?

I’ve (24F) been talking to an OLD match (25M) for a couple months now, and just recently I’ve noticed him casually and briefly bringing up an ex (or both) at least once daily. It happens relatively naturally, and there’s no strong emotion associated with the statements. In a way, if he had substituted “my ex” with “my friend or brother” it would’ve been really normal. Plus I understand that, in a way, it’d be almost odd if he didn’t think about his exes because they were once an important part of his life. The only weird feeling I’m getting from this is how much more frequently it’s been happening, if there is a need for him to bring them up every time he’s reminded of them, and if I’m weird for thinking something of it. Also- he’s mentioned that he uses cosmetics that his ex left at his house- again, am I being sensitive or is it great that he doesn’t feel the need to purge everything that reminds him of his ex/be wasteful.

63,o29gbk,1623968212,How to tell girls I can't date (M20),"So recently I found out I have XXY syndrome. For most of my life I was fairly outgoing and had no trouble meeting people and making friends, of both genders. But girls never saw me in the light of someone who was “datable.” Of course it was because of my condition but I never knew. All that changed when I started TRT 6 months ago. Physically, it helped to finally put on some muscle and start to look more my age. While mentally, it gave me a kind of confidence that I never had before. NGL, looking back I feel like twice the person I was before I started. 

I can’t ignore the fact that it's changed the way girls see me as well. So far, I’ve been pretty lucky that only major giveaways I have physically are things like a low WHR and softer, less masculine facial features. Still I don’t expect women to be attracted to me for reasons like these, and until recently this was always the case. But now with TRT I feel like it’s somehow masking those aspects and I’m worried it might trick some girls into thinking I’m a normal guy. 

I should put it out there that I’m fully aware of the fact that XXY men are not “real men” and shouldn’t try to trick girls into dating them. And it's absolutely not something I plan on doing. If I hooked up with a girl without telling her I don’t think I would ever be able forgive myself.

While, I don’t actively try to date, situations have inevitably started coming up. For example, recently I’ve had multiple female friends try to set me up with their other friends and some of them are pretty adamant about the idea.

I was only expecting a casual fling, but I've fallen for this guy hard, despite neither of us being at a place in our lives where we want or are ready for a serious relationship.

I've never clicked with somebody more than I have with him, and I think we were both surprised at the connection. We talked for hours about everything, laughed till we ached, had amazing sex. He ticks boxes I didn't even know I had.

Anyway, I spent the night with him on Monday and left on Tuesday evening, had a great time, whatever. We didn't speak all day yesterday, but he sent me a flirty message this morning, which I answered. I haven't heard from him since.

He's a very busy guy, and he's leaving my area tomorrow.

He said that if I'm ever in his city or vice versa then we should meet up (I actually might be moving near him for uni/work, funnily enough).

It all feels like so much more than just a fling (trust me, I've had plenty). He's really thrown a spanner in the works, lol.

I just don't know if it would be weird for me to message him tomorrow to say I hope he has a safe journey home and how much I enjoyed spending time with/getting to know him?

He had even been talking about things that we were going to be doing on our future dates. Then, during the time of being intimate/snuggling in his bed, I made one statement that said, ""Sometimes just certain sexual things (like finishing) can be very difficult for me because when I was younger, I was sexually abused."" He did not say anything in response to this. He did seem upset though afterwards mentally (although did not say he was verbally). Soon after, he told me that t was probably best if I left because he had to be at work at 6 AM (I understood, he works from 6 AM - 10 PM most days). I then texted him a week later (after no contact) stating that I was very sorry if what I said upset him (I said it multiple times within the same text). He never responded. It's been a month since that date. I am utterly heartbroken and also concerned. I just think his reaction is so odd and bizarre. If I text someone apologizing if I upset them and that person never responds, doesn't that mean that clearly they are upset and giving me the cold shoulder? I'm also worried that I could have possibly triggered him if he had abuse himself in his past, and he was so upset by this. I really did not mean to cause such a mess by this, I just wanted to tell him that my hesitancy to do sexual things has absolutely nothing to do with my feelings for him - it has everything to do with sometimes I get very embarrassed and ashamed of my body. He definitely did NOT seem like the ghosting type, I feel like he would only ghost someone if he found them unsafe or if he was truly mad at them. I just think his reaction to everything is so bizarre. I mean, I really thought he was a nice person. He's a physician, so he has had to have some education on this topic in medical school before. I just think his reaction is really unusually cold. He's not an emotional person by any means or good about talking about his feelings, but I thought that saying something like this might bring us closer, but instead he just tossed me to the street like a piece of trash.

71,o2aj5v,1623971209,Am I wrong to expect my fwb to be on time and uphold plans?,"

Hi,

FWB is constantly late, and often cancels, changes or moves plans. I realize some of this is out of his control as he is military, and has extremely demanding work hours that often run late. (Sometimes 80 hr weeks)

However, when we first started seeing each other a few months ago, he was on time, so I know he can manage his schedule like an adult. I am admittedly more uptight about time than a lot of people. I consider lack of punctuality a sign of contempt. I’m 10 minutes early everywhere and then I wait for the appropriate time to knock/enter/ask for a table/what have you. In my view, there is a 5-10 minute grace period, within which is tolerable, but should not be frequent. Beyond that, you are rude and doubly so if you don’t notify the other person. 

I try to tell him it bothers me, but he says my irritability about it is pushing him away. Quite frankly I find it horribly disrespectful, and I’m OK with pushing away someone that completely disrespects my time. 

On top of that, his response to it is that he works quite a bit more than I do, and so therefore his time is more valuable. I don’t necessarily agree to that. Between my day job and my side business, I work 55 to 60 hours a week, I am scaling back to start grad school in two months, and I’m trying to publish a paper. Even so, we each have 168 hours in a week. He chose his line of work, and I don’t think his choices should be my problem. 

What started as sexy and fun is now feeling really one-sided and disrespectful. We typically only have sex once a week (low libido on his end). I don’t feel like my needs are being met. At the same time, I’m hesitant to 86 it because he is extremely attentive in bed (but not in any other area). I’m making this post because he’s making me feel as though I’m being unreasonable for asking basic respect. 

TLDR- FWB is being disrespectful. Am I out of line? Can we adjust or do I just yeet him? Basic - 23F25M",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o2aj5v/am_i_wrong_to_expect_my_fwb_to_be_on_time_and/

So I finished my project for my writing class, I only had that writing class for 5th period.  But I decided since it's almost the last day to turn in my project in 1st period. And 1st period was my teacher's honors class, So I walked in and they had cupcakes and a whole party. So, I decided to stay for the cupcakes. Then while I'm sitting down with my best friend who also had honors. I saw him, He looked like a Senior and when asking if he was he turned out to be a freshman like me. Moving on, Long story short he had 3 classes with my friend and I was able to go in two of them. (cuz it was almost the last day, none of the teachers were doing anything so we were able to go to any class we want.)

Anyways, the day ends, and I wasn't able to talk to him.  Cuz 1. I was scared and Lil nervous. Anyways the next day is the last day of school. And my friend gave me his snap. I added him and say hi. Which i was going to delete cuz I didn't believe he was going to text me back. Since he takes forever too. But he did text me back. So, we started chatting and getting to know him better. Right now, we are playing would you rather and it's taking 2 days to respond.  But, the first time we chatted, He did mention he had bad wifi. So I just assume, It was his wifi. cuz I after two days, he randomly opened the message and texted me back. 

Now, this dude knows nothing bout me and I don't know anything about him.  Just some information that my best friend told me like he is very dramatic and Rude to one of my other friends.  But when I talked to him  In person, he seemed very nice in person, and in chats, he is pretty sassy. ( i just get sassy vibes in our text messages.)

{I also befriended one of his friends, who told me he was very friendly} =\^= and plus my friends don't hang out with him that much. 

Now I'm hoping that next year, I would get a class with him even if it's just one class or two. So I can get to know him better. Though, I do tend to overthink a lot, wondering if I Should continue a friendship and see where it goes.

For a brief moment, I opened my eyes and noticed she was smiling while kissing me. I was also smiling, but seeing her reciprocating made me feel warm and fuzzy. We'd stopped for a moment and she said something like, ""Wow... I feel floaty"" as she was sort of awkwardly laughing.

Eventually we had to stop as it was getting pretty late. She'd made several remarks about not wanting to lose touch with me, about planning more dates, and doing more things together in the future. That night was also the first time we really, truly complimented each other's looks outside of just being like, ""You look great!""

About 2 months ago, I went out with a guy I really really liked from a dating app. We spoke over facetime once for a few hours ( I was nervous and never dated through a dating app) and we went out twice. I really liked him and was so excited about him because he was exactly what I was looking for and exactly my type physically. The first date went well and when I spoke to my friends I kept saying how scared I was about how much I liked him even though I hadn't known him that long.  

The second date was nice but I was not myself. I was much more closed off, quieter and did not let my personality through at all. He was really nice and tried to engage with me but I was so off kilter I was not being my warm, fun self at all. 

He even waited with me for over 20 minutes in the heat for my transportation even tho I told him I've and over he didnt have to wait with me. At the end before I left I told him I had a nice time and he seemed surprised I said that and stammered out he had a good time too. But the response let me know the inevitable. 

The next day he texted me he had a nice time on our dates but he felt we were missing something. I responded I understood where he was coming from but asked him what it was he felt we were missing. He said he felt like I was too closed off and he wasnt able to open up and attributed that to us not having the best chemistry. I totally got where he was coming from because I was closed off but I thought it was  becausw I really liked him a lot more than any other guy I dated and it was only the second date. I told him I understood his thoughts and appreciated his honesty and then explained that I was just very nervous because he was the first guy I ever dated through a dating app which he knew, but that I also was unsure about his intentions (if he wanted something serious, casual, hookup)which also made me closed off but I still appreciated him telling me and at least now I know to be more open. He said he was happy to hear what my thoughts were and I said back, of course, good luck and good night and the next morning he responded and said thank you, you too. 

Since then I've dated 2 other guys through the app and even an ex came back that I had the courage to reject again but I still havent stopped thinking about this guy. A part of me thinks if he rejected you and didnt see the potential than keep the L and move on but a big part of me feels upset at myself that I couldn't just open up and be myself around him because we definitely hit it off in the beginning and I was just so nervous that I second guessed everything.

We talked Monday evening, and everything seemed well. Things were flirtatious, things were fine. I suggested that he take Tuesday afternoon off to spend time with me...I suggested it in jest, but...I would have been all for it. But, he just laughed, so I let it go.

As it was, I had an order pickup in his city, let's call it Gotham City. I live in a rural area, so the home improvement store in his city was the closest one that had the item in stock. I also had a cabinet that I was wanting to pick up there while I was in town.

Now, I didn't tell him I was coming to Gotham City. For one, I really didn't know my plans 100%, so I figured I would just let him know when I was up there. If I saw him, I saw him; if I didn't, I didn't. Secondly, I didn't want him to feel obligated to see me, especially when he was working, and I was doing my own thing.

So, when I got to the home improvement center, I sent him a picture, and also told him they had a particular part he has been looking for. He replied relatively quickly, but all he said was that he was looking for a different part. But, he didn't say anything about me being in Gotham City. Not the response I expected at least. I expected a ""Oh my gosh, what are you doing in Gotham City?!"" or something similar.

Anyway, I haven't heard from him since. Now, it's only been a couple of days. He could be busy, he could be working on projects. It might be nothing. It just strikes me odd that he hasn't shown even the slightest curiosity of why I was in his city.

I do wonder what the chances are that he might be upset....upset that I came to Gotham City without telling him I was coming. Also, that I came without any plans to see him. Maybe I am getting the cold shoulder?

Then, the guy ends up ghosting me — but I’m so confused because they always say and initiate a second date but never follow through.

I’m getting sick and tired of them just ghosting or not initiating anything — I know I’m funny, pretty and a good time so I don’t know why they wouldn’t want to go on a second date. 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️ 

Do I just move too fast or are they just scared of commitment?

93,o2dvui,1623981650,Trying out polyamory for the first time,"I tried out polyamory recently, and was open to the idea of starting a partnership with a guy I met off hinge. He was already in a partnership when I met him. The banter, and conversations flowed so easily. He was consistent with our texting, and I was overjoyed that I met someone that met my energy and was open to a non traditional way of dating. I felt more comfortable with him, and confident in our relationship then I had felt with any previous relationships and that surprised me because it was very fresh. It didn’t bother me that he had another partner  when he was consistently showing that he was prioritizing me in his life. We went on a total of four dates, and I thought I met the guy of my dreams when I hadn’t felt this way since my last ex of over two years ago. Last night we talked on the phone and we’re getting on the subject of his birthday and how he was going to the skate park, and was inviting me to join him and friends. When I told him that I wanted to do something one on one it started the conversation of that he wasn’t looking for a primary partnership with me. ( his partner ending up breaking up with him less than a week ago while we were  together. He said that he felt sad and unfilled. I cried on the phone and I told him that he didn’t seem to care and said he was processing his feelings. At the end of the call he said that he still wanted me in his life and that we would talk later. Still hasn’t texted me and I’ve been crying in waves all day.  :(",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o2dvui/trying_out_polyamory_for_the_first_time/

99,o2ehi3,1623983559,"When a girl does this, does this mean she has something for you?"," Here is my situation. I work with a girl for the past 7 months and I find her very attractive.  
She is usually very receptive to my flirting and flirts with me and also teases me a lot (which i guess is part of flirting). Today she posted a snapchat story wearing my favorite sneakers and scrub pants and said ""first one to do this""... Although I've been wearing the same thing for months. Next day she asked me if I saw her status.
