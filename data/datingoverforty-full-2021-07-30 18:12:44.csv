My conclusion is generally you are more open minded as you get older but not necessarily settling. I made the case that as you get older you are more likely to see the whole person. You know what is important to you and have reasonable expectations. Wisdom\*

In any case, I matched with a 54/M who I was instantly attracted to, I appreciated his assertiveness and readiness to move things along from the app so within days we were on the phone every night for hours, the first night we met for dinner we were extremely comfortable with each other and the magnetism was so strong by the end of dinner we were practically sharing a chair… he pulled me in for a kiss which was amazing and we spend the rest of our time together pretty much entranced with each other, that night once we were home we spoke on the phone until after sunrise.  We talk about our expectations, about life, past relationships and sexual encounters, current events, music trivia … anything and everything …. Our next physical date we had already expressed our mutual desire to have sex so we met at his place and had an amazing night and subsequent morning together our chemistry translated well into physical intimacy. I am smitten. Our late night talks continued (without exaggerating) we spoke more than 2 hours a night an average of 5/6 nights a week for about the first 5 weeks… 

The next 5 wks things started changing up a bit. One day he asked me about my plans for the future/retirement etc… He is a big shot finance guy and I am more an academic/ social scientist, free spirit type of gal so I answered his question aloofly, something I got pressed for ..which in turn made me a bit self conscious b/c the truth is I don’t really have a plan beyond putting my kid through college, mostly bc I have limited finances while he certainly does not.  From this conversation on, I felt he always seemed to be in a “mood” with me - he would scrutinize the things I would say, even things he once found cute or funny. He cancelled plans and was less available for phone conversations which he always initiated before.  I understood that things were picking up now post CoVID and he was back at the office dealing with very high pressure situations but I did confront him about the change he at first denied anything being different and wondered if I maybe was just acting insecure  and that nothing had changed but then one night after me making a silly comment he blurted out something about you aloofness being the reason he feels he had to put his guard up bc he was to close to the “point of no return”  (note: from our earlier convos I had noted this was his way of saying “head over heels”) but when I asked him to clarify what he meant we ended up on a tangent and never got back around to it. At this point I decided to give him some space while I went back home to visit family and friends.   I am now back and this week has been a lot like the beginning…. We don’t talk as long but he is being very deliberate in subtly letting me know what he does every day and his scheduling without me asking…I know it’s only been 10 weeks but I am crazy about this man and I want this to be a long term consideration so I want things to play out organically. But , his hot and cold behavior is driving me mad! Do I just suck at dating?  I’ve always been terrible with the rules and the timelines …, or is he acting a little suspicious?

I asked some of my female friends and their advice was ""I mean, if you just ask once it's okay. I've gotten those messages before. They're common with dating.""

I'm 51, female, and have a pretty horrendous relationship history - I've basically been a serial monogamist, going from one unsuitable relationship to another and even getting married twice (big mistake!). I've made very bad choices over the years, but that's not to say it was all down to me that the relationships didn't work. Every time I have had a 1 year plus relationship, it has ended in one of two ways: either (a) my anxious attachment side comes out full force and I end up pushing the other person too far, or (b) once the relationship has become 'safe' and secure, I totally lose interest and end it without looking back.

I've been single for nearly a year now, which is an absolute record for me and is probably only because of the pandemic! Last year's breakup forced me to take a long, hard look at myself and my behaviour patterns, and I have had lots of therapy. Now that things here are opening up again, I am back to seeing my friends and doing what I love most weekends, so there is a higher chance of meeting someone IRL (I don't do dating apps) although I'm not really looking for anything.

Last weekend I was out with some friends and, long story short, I got chatting to a guy who seemed interested. He's 10 years younger than me. We got on really well and had a great laugh, lots in common, found each other attractive etc.  Eventually I got a cab home, and he shared the cab with me part of the way as it was on his route. He held my hand in the cab, and before he got out he gave me quite a long kiss. We had already exchanged numbers. 

He messaged me the next day and said that he is in a long-term relationship with a woman he lives with, but it's a genuine ethically non-monogamous relationship. He had a great time with me and would really like to see me again, but would of course understand if I was angry with him or didn't want to know. I was slightly taken aback at first - I've never (knowingly) met anyone who is in any form of open relationship. I took some time to think about how to respond, and, in the process, began to warm to the idea that this could *possibly* be a way forward for me.

This type of arrangement would enable me to spend time with someone whose company I enjoy and who I find attractive, but not in the all-consuming way I have felt with other people. It would remove any pressure that comes with a 'regular' relationship, and I wouldn't be jumping into something in the way I have always done before. It would give me the freedom of being single and still open to meeting someone else. It would also give me a much-needed ego boost (he has already said he thinks I am awesome). However, I'm aware that this all sounds very naive bearing in mind I have zero experience of anything like this! 

I don't really see any reason to be cross with him for not mentioning it when we started talking - we did nothing more than kiss and hold hands, so it's not like either of us was used, and there was no need for him to be honest with me at all if he was just after a ONS. Also, just to clarify, both he and his partner are open to others outside of their relationship.

I'd be interested to hear views from folk who are, or have been, involved with someone in a similar situation. Thanks for reading if you got this far!

Sometimes I respond right away, sometimes it takes me a day or so. I typically keep my attention on my work phone and cut over to my personal phone during my downtime. The separation helps me stay sane — I’m introverted by nature but my job is quite demanding and requires a high degree of focus and timely responsiveness any time I’m “on”.  I get distracted and overwhelmed by so many texts, chats and notifications so I do my social communications either early morning or wait until later in the day.  Sometimes I’m so mentally drained that I literally just can’t do the social thing at all and skip a day entirely, but it’s rare. 
This appears to be an issue when I meet someone new and we’re getting acquainted based on what happened with the last two men I was trying to get to know. One flat out said that my responding a day later shows that his “crush” (I.e. me) isn’t as into him and he doesn’t want to get hurt. The last one got sore because I didn’t respond until later at night to his multiple texts (all were just social, no emergency or anything), to the point where a date we had set 2 days later ended up getting cancelled because he was so bothered by my tardiness, and we fizzled out. This current guy seemed cool — meaning he also responds sometimes the following day just like me — but now I’m not so sure. On Wednesday he asked when I’m free for dinner. I let him know I’m out of town for a couple of days and he said to let him know when I’m back in town. I said “sounds good!” and left it at that. I texted him yesterday letting him know I’m back. His response was he figured I wasn’t interested anymore when he didn’t hear from me “for so long.”  But then he said he’d still be up for finding a night that works, so this one isn’t dead yet. Hence my request for advice. 
In the dating world, how do you find the right balance between under-communicating  and overindulging the other person’s need for instant gratification after every text? Especially for those of us who work demanding jobs? What is reasonable? I’ve already shared that I’m not the best about checking texts throughout the day. They were fine till they weren’t.

This wasn't really an issue until one of our upcoming date nights got canceled because a ""Friend"" is coming into town ""unexpectedly"" and wanted to meet up with her before leaving town. I had to specifically ask if she was meeting someone she was romantically or emotionally involved with because she chose not to volunteer this information when I asked ""Is there anything I should know about this friend you're meeting up with?""  

Normally if it's a girlfriend she's going out with she gives a name and a rough idea of their plans or invites me to tag along, so that's how I was able to deduce it was a guy in the first place. It wasn't until I pressed for details of the nature of the relationship that I found out she had a romantic interest in him at one point… for me, that's a huge violation of trust especially when I asked if there was anything I should know about the relationship (trusting her to volunteer information) and she got upset/ defensive with me for not being direct in my line of questioning.

I understand men and women can be friends. I have quite a few female friends myself, but none that I've dated or had an interest in, and would certainly volunteer that information if asked about the nature of our relationship. 

What I didn't like was that she was secretive about this meet-up and that she seems to have a few male online friends (at least 4) who she keeps around for emotional support, because they “get her”.  She has no female online friends that she speaks of.  I get having male friends that she shares interests/ hobbies or guys she has met organically … but not dudes she connected with emotionally and developed feelings for at one point or another.

I'm skeptical of the intentions of any man who accepts ""friendship"" after a relationship has run its course. I'm my experience, I've known MANY, MANY guys who will be friends with a woman if they've expressed interest in them and those feelings went away for reason... because they hope she will eventually fall for him or just to have sex if the opportunity presents itself. I think any man who denies this is full of crap, but I'm only speaking from my point of view and not all men, so please don't beat me up for my belief. 

I really like this woman, but this is actually a huge issue for me. I'm taking a big step back to evaluate if this is a deal-breaker for me or if her lack of candor is a red flag that can turn yellow over time.

Dating 9 months. Him 47. Me 42. 
Everything is great. Met each others families. Laugh and have fun together. No complaints about the time spent together but...
We hardly see each other. We live a mere 20 mins drive from each other but only see each other once a week. When we first started dating it was twice a week. I was fine with that, I felt like we were building a strong connection. That dropped down to Saturdays only. I thought i would be patient and not voice my concerns about this but he seems totally fine with just seeing me on a Saturday.  Then this weekend he had a boys night so we didn't see each other at all because he was hungover. He wanted to sleep all day rather than make the effort to see me. 
I feel like I'm not valued. I feel like I'm a fun weekend thing and that's it. Is it wrong to feel this way? I raised this with him and he said I would probably just find him boring during the week because he gets home late from work and has early starts. But then he suggested dinner this week to make up for the lack of weekend time. And it's now Wednesday and he hasn't done anything about planning that dinner. 
There's no secret double life or other woman invoked. I've met his 23 year old daughter who lives with him and his mother. 
I really just think he either doesn't love me and doesn't see a longterm future with me or he's lazy and doesn't want to put any effort in. I've probably messed this up in letting him get away with it for too long, so how do I address this? Is it even worth addressing or is the writing on the wall?

There's a lot to tell, TLDR at the bottom.

Just over 2 years ago I met a woman online. We'll call her Betsy. Chatting was great for several days so I said let's meet tonight! And she said OK!! Then she says, ""I have to tell you something first though... I'm pregnant.""

So, that's an unusual bit of info to find out from someone on a dating app.  But I figured - what the hell, this should be interesting - maybe I'll make a new friend at least. I was pretty curious about her circumstances because she said it might not be what I think it is. She also wanted to hear the details of my 10+year LTR that ended. So we met up.

I think she was about 4 months pregnant at the time. Definitely showing. We hung out for a few hours talking and really enjoyed each other's company. At this point I don't think I got all of the gritty details of her pregnancy situation that evening. Essentially what I learned at the beginning was that her clock had been ticking - bad - and having not found ""the one"", and looking into sperm banks, adoption, etc., and finding those options either extremely expensive or complicated, with many unknowns, she decided to make an arrangement with a guy for him to just be the donor and not be a father. Apparently this guy had done this for a friend of a friend in the past which gave her the idea so she talked to him and decided he had good genes and all that.

Definitely not an orthodox situation, but sounded somewhat reasonable. She wanted to be a mother, and she was about to be in a few months. Mission accomplished I guess!

Anyway, we get along great and after a couple more times hanging out, she really wants to have sex. Apparently her hormones are raging and having that effect. We don't really discuss what this could turn into, but it sounded like she wanted a FWB situation (with someone that doesn't mind her being pregnant). Turns out I'm that guy, apparently. (A guy not turning down sex, crazy, I know!) She asked me to get tested, and then we were off to the races. Great sex, and we would just chill at her place watching movies usually when we saw each other. Sometimes I'd sleep over. Sometimes an outing here and there. But as she got more pregnant we just stayed in all the time because it was easier for her.

It basically started feeling like a relationship, but I started to have doubts for a few reasons.

1. I found out the ""donor"" and her had zero legal arrangements. Just a handshake that he would have no rights. Wow. No need to go into how crazy that can potentially be. Another tid bit about the donor that I found weird - the ""donations"" happened via sex. She told me she wasn't attracted to him so it was awkward. Purely a transactional deal. I believe her, but it still weirded me out.
2. The elephant in the room was that this baby was coming. I've always been on the fence about having kids, but I wasn't even sure what to think about being in a LTR with someone that is having someone else's kid under odd circumstances. I just started getting more and more unsure about that whole situation the closer it got. We didn't really discuss it that I recall. I take responsibility for that. There's a LOT we should have discussed if things were to keep going.
3. I wasn't even sure if I was dating the real her. What I mean by that, and maybe some women who have had kids can help (or tell me I'm crazy), is that I know women can have extremely different experiences from each other when pregnant, but some might have slight changes in personalities, priorities, moods, emotions, etc. during that time due to the hormones. So, I was concerned that I'd gotten myself into a relationship with someone and the version of her that I was attracted to might change. Also, because it wasn't long before it became difficult for her to go out much, I wasn't really experiencing life with her as a way to get to know her like I would if she weren't pregnant. We would talk about things and watch movies, but that was most of what we did.

So I started to back off and put up a wall. We talked and she was very emotional and upset, having grown real attached to me. I was so torn because I liked her too, but I just had so many unknowns, and all I could say is that I didn't know how I felt about everything and I needed to step back and take a break. A few weeks later she had the baby. I was checking in and she was sending me photos and let me know they were both doing great. Soon after that I was set to go on a trip, so she said we should touch base when I got back, and I said I'd like that. But, I never did, and neither did she.

That was around 2 years ago. I felt guilty about Betsy, like I had left her at the worst time. I really have no idea if she quickly forgot about me because of her new bundle of joy, or if she had the bad luck of getting postpartum depression and me leaving only made it worse. I've thought about that a lot. Around that time, post Betsy, I had some personal issues I was dealing with so I wasn't interested in being with anyone. A few months later things got better and I randomly met someone else and ended up dating her for over a year, but that ended a few months ago.

Betsy has crossed my mind a number of times and lately I've had the urge to contact her to see how she's doing. I always try to analyze my intentions as objectively as possible, but I'm having a hard time. It's easy to think that by reaching out to check on her that I'm letting her know that I cared enough to see how she's doing and it would make her happy, but she might just not want to hear from me. And if I know that's a possibility and I still do it, then maybe it's a selfish purpose. But even if she's upset with me, I'm happy to talk with her about it now that I've had time to think back, and hopefully give her some closure. Or is it just me thinking I need closure because I feel bad for walking away from her at a really vulnerable time? Difficult for a stranger to answer that, I know. That's why I tried to give as much context as I could.

Any perspective and advice is appreciated :)

TLDR; Met gal online that was pregnant. Turns out it was an oddball donor situation so she could fulfill her dream of being a mother. She wanted a FWB situation with me that morphed into a sort of relationship. The baby situation and everything else became a lot for me so I took a step back, which made her sad. Essentially things ended right around when she had the baby and I haven't talked to her since then, 2 years ago, and I'm considering checking in just to see how she's doing.",False,False,False,datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,54917,public,self,"It's been 2 years, should I reach out again?

We’re both divorced, but I have kids. I have 50/50 custody of my daughter and can only see her every other week. I make time so that we can go on 2-3 dates that week. I was myself early on, but then as feelings grew I started to become a little more guarded and agreeable to avoid rocking the boat. I could feel her pulling away a bit one month into it. But she talked with me and I explained that hey, I’ve been hurt, so I was protecting myself. We differ on communication styles. She’s introverted. I’m more verbose, but get text is the preferred method for her. I adjusted my communication. All good. When we started sleeping together, she felt that it went awol and I wasn’t matching how I texted early on. She felt that it was disrespectful and hurtful. I apologized and explained it was a miscommunication. She also felt like I overthink things and say stupid shit sometimes. I’ve since felt like I have overcompensated and initiated a lot of the communication going forward. I set the tone, but then it all falls on me because I’ve now set the expectation. We dropped the ball in discussing our styles. She’s a little hesitant in getting into any deep conversations.
We’ve both been out of town and hadn’t seen each other in several weeks. Had the chance to spend a few days together before not seeing each other for a month. We both made the effort and she elected to see me when it wasn’t the most convenient for her as she was getting ready to make a cross country trip. I got a “I missed your company”, which was great. We didn’t get into a DTR convo because time was limited and I thought it was best served being light and enjoying each other’s company.
I checked in several times (once a day) along the way to see how the drive was going. Asked if she could let me know if she got to the first stop ok, but no response. I had to follow up and she had just got there. Had a brief convo on Sunday. Asked a question that by the face of it she chose to ignore as my reply was immediate and she wasn’t driving.
Haven’t spoken since, but have put the ball in her court to communicate. Am I overthinking it?

He’s a 47 y/o man and is super healthy too. I’m just gonna say it: he looks younger than me and it makes me really self-conscious (I was &gt; 9 years younger than my spouse of &gt;20 yrs so this is very new to me).
