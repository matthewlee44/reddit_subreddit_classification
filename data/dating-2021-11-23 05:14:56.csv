It was a bit of a curveball because now i had to think of something to do so I asked her if we should get drinks on Thursday… and she’s left me on read for over 24 hours… what should i do now?

2,r0b5gi,1637666684,(19F) Is the guy I went out with not interested in me??! Help,I met a guy through a dating app and we got along really well. We went on one date but we almost talk everyday. He scheduled the next date. The way he acts just makes me think his not interested in me for example I’m always the one reaching out and starting Conversation. He never compliments me or asks how my day is. He doesn’t even do the bare minimum. His excuse is that he is studying and doing his assignments and doesn’t get free time to text or call. I know that there is always a chance that his talking to someone else but his not the best looking guy at there and probably doesn’t get attention from women at all. When I confronted him he said that his interested but very busy with work. My question is why would he keep talking to me if his not interested in me??! Why doesn’t he just tell me the truth about how he feels and we could cut contact? Can anyone give me advice on this situation thanks,dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r0b5gi/19f_is_the_guy_i_went_out_with_not_interested_in/

Me. ""Maybe we should meet up, I'll take you for a drink in town?"" Her. *Sends picture of random man* ""Only if he can come too"" Me. *puzzled* erm yeah sure you can bring a mate? I'll bring one too if it makes you feel better"" Her. ""He's my boyfriend"" Me. Still hasn't responded.

I was prepared for him to not say it back, and he said he needed more time, which I understand. 
But then he said he wants me to keep saying it, to not hold back. And it honestly feels so weird to say ""I love you"" and just have him smile or kiss me in response. One time after I said it, he asked me ""how much?""

6,r0bfbw,1637667821,I don't know how to make her trust me.,"So this is a long story I'll try to make it as short as I can.
I have like close to zero experience with dating, I have spent nearly all of my teenage years looking fat unattractive and ill. I have lost weight and I am healthy now, I basically turned into the most perfect version of myself, which has given me more confidence. I just never really thought I'd be in this position I am now.
My friend and his gf hooked me up with girl back in July. She blew my mind and got me instantly in love with her.
Even though the convo was sometimes dry I thought we could make it happen. I tried my best and asked her out many times and she pushed it away even though she wanted it. The day we were supposed to go out she outright friendzones me which has left me ruined. I was depressed for like 2 and a half months. I really never knew why she did that because according to my friends gf she was feeling the same for me. Meanwhile I have found out that right before she met me some guy tried to use her and dumped her when she refused to come to his place, so I kinda used that information to make myself believe I still have a shot.
Fast forward to 4 days ago. My friends gf had a birthday party and she invited me so my friend doesn't be the only dude there. Guess who was there? Her. She was kinda quiet and we both were just staring at our phones trying to avoid eye contact (i still caught her looking at me i think), we have small-talked a little but I was shy asf. In the middle of the night she has to go home (health problems) and she asked her friend if I can walk her home (eastern european commie blocks really aren't a friendly place for a girl to walk alone at 11PM). So we go out and she gifts me a hair tie she told she would give me back in summer and we had a good talk and cought up some things. I walk her home she hugs me and I felt I was on top the world. I reach out to her tommorow to ask If she feels better and after a day of talking I had to end the convo because she didn't contribute to it at all.
Last night I was really depressed about it and tried to get tips. I found out that the reason we didn't make it because she can't trust anyone.( probably because of that guy). I need help or tips on how to make her trust me or do I just leave and don't do anything?
I am not a fuckboy or anything. I don't have any bad history that can potentially push her away. I just like her a lot and need closure.

Sorry if my english is bad (It's not my main language).
Just give me an honest opinion or If you were in a similar situation what was the outcome?
Thank you in advance.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r0bfbw/i_dont_know_how_to_make_her_trust_me/
7,r0bsgn,1637669254,Girl has gone cold,"I met this girl on a dating app in late September of this year. We are both 37. We have been seeing each other regularly since.  


At the beginning everything was great. We ended up having sex for the first time on the fourth date. Sex every time was underwhelming for me. I would go down on her and eat her out for 10-15 mins or fuck her until she orgasmed and then she’d say ‘im done’ and hop into the shower and that would be it. The first time we had sex she commented that i take too long to cum and shes never been with a guy that takes more than 2 mins. She tried giving me a bj the first time after i made her cum. She seemed inexperienced and then complained it was taking too long and it ruined the mood so we stopped.  


Shes given me maybe 3 bjs the entire time, giving up after about 1 minute. We’ve had sex maybe 5-6 times and shes orgasmed every time.  


Our actual dates have been extremely fun and she has been persuing me pretty hard, sending pics of us to her family and posting our date nights on instagram etc. She typically messages me 4-6 times a day, often sending me pictures of her meals and stuff shes doing etc. I am not a big texter and tend to use the phone to make dates only but still respond to most of these but not right away/only when im free as i have multiple jobs and do freelancing as well. I like to keep busy and on my mission.  


She has seemed ok with this as i established this pretty early on in our dating.  


Two weeks ago we were at her place after she made us dinner and we ended up having sex. I went down on her for 20 mins making her orgasm. Then she said ‘i want you in me’ and i proceeded to make her orgasm again. She then said ‘thats it im done’ and ran into the bathroom to shower. When she came back i was still naked on her bed, jerking off waiting for her. Keep in mind i have not cum once in the entire 2 months when weve had sex. She then said ‘i dont know how to make you cum’. So i said ‘come here’ and guided her towards me in a position to give me head. Shes like ‘what are you doing? im not going down on you with all that lube and everything going on down there’. I said ‘forget it’ as i was completely turned off by that and got up and put my clothes on. She came running after me ‘are you mad? are you mad?’. I said ‘im not mad. i have to go home’ calmly. Then i left.  


She texted me a goodnight hope you got home safe message, which i did not respond to as i was gathering my thoughts on what i wanted to do with this situation.  


Two days passed and she reached out again and sent me a long ‘take care’ message. She had updated her dating profile in that time and also deleted me so i could no longer see it. I told her i needed time to process things and explained to her the problem with our sex life and how her saying things like that and not even trying is a deal breaker for me in a dating partner. She then apologized and said she never realized that she was selfish in bed and she could see why i would think that. She then promised shed ‘try better if i gave her another shot but i dont know if we can continue seeing each other as maybe we’re just incompatible sexually’. She asked me if i still want to keep seeing her and i said ‘yes’. Her:’Can we continue with the date you scheduled last week for saturday?’. Me:’yes’.  


Texts leading up to the date were a little lukewarm in comparison to before. We meet up and its just like old times on the date. We had a great time. I walk her home and she invites me up to her place. We start watching a bit of a movie at 11pm but i have to work early the next morning at 4:45am, so i left at around 11:30-midnight - no sex.  


On the date she suggests i come stay the night with her on the following Tuesday night after work (10pm) as i have Wednesday off. Then we could do something Wednesday night. She was spending the weekend with her best friend as it was her ‘40th birthday’ and they had plans in Niagra Falls to do a spa retreat thing all weekend. She had planned this retreat earlier in the year before she even met me.  


I tell her ‘sure. Ill come directly from work Tuesday night, Ill stay the night, we’ll part ways and then Ill come pick you up from work at 5 and we’ll go out for a lovely dinner’. When making plans she opened up her calendar on her phone and Tuesday night at 6pm said ‘date-so and so restaurant’. She said this was a get together with a female co-worker before i even said anything and shed be done with it before i got home.  


Monday she texts me ‘lets go get Korean BBQ. Ill make reservations’. I tell her I already made reservations at another place and have a lovely evening planned for us.  


Tuesday night she texts me after a couple of light texting days telling me she bought me a pizza to have at her place when i got home from work and she cant wait to see me. When i met her at the door she seemed a bit off and aloof. I just thought ‘whatever’.  


We got into bed and she told me shes on her period, so we cant have sex. Ok. I set my alarm and she sets hers and we talked a bit before falling asleep.  


The rest of the day was ok. She was still sending me texts throughout the day and i would respond when i was between errands. I came and picked her up from her work. She seemed ok on the way there and then once we got to the place to eat she made almost no effort in convo whereas before she would constantly be talking or asking me stuff. They seated another group right next to us and a guy said something to her about them seating us so close together and she seemed super flirty in her body language when responding back. I ignored it. She spent more time on her phone than ive seen her do before during the meal. She told me ‘remember this pic i sent you of my lunch a couple days ago, when i told you blah blah blah etc’ and she shows me the picture on her phone and i was like ‘no you didnt send me those pics or tell me that’. Very weird. She usually remembers everything from our convos.  


We went to mini putt after and things seemed a little better. After half the course, she turned and said ‘just 9 more holes and we’re leaving right?’ like she was bored. She also complained about being hot. I joked about it etc but something seemed off.  


I dropped her off at her place and she asked me to come up. I get up and this time she doesnt turn her tv on nor seem interested in me staying. ‘Im going to shower as soon as you leave etc’. It was like she was waiting for me to leave. Very weird. I could feel it. No sex again. So after 5 mins of convo i get up and let her know i have to work early. She asks if she can take me out on a date the next Friday-9 days away. She usually asks me when the next day im free is. I dont think weve ever gone that long in between dates. I say ‘sure’. Thursday she doesnt msg me. First time since the sex incident this happens.  


She texted me a couple pictures of her over Friday, Saturday from her spa retreat at her friends 40th bday. She also texted me a ‘miss you-cant wait to see you’ msg which i reciprocated.  


The last couple days after getting home her texting has died down. She still initiates, but will respond with one word answers minutes or even hours later (a first!). This is the first time im getting ‘haha’ as a response without her trying to keep the convo alive by sending additional messages. I dont respond to these.  


Since the sex incident we’ve only seen each other twice and its been the longest time in between dates as we’ve ever had.

He told me that he never makes the first move because he wants to give the person he’s dating time and space until she feels ready and comfortable just because of respect.

On the 3d date I initiated sex since he previously told me he’s not going to do it and he went along with it. The day after he message me and said that we shouldn’t have done that because it was too early and didn’t know each other well enough yet and we’re moving too fast, I apologized for initiating it and I agreed with him that it was too early, but he told me not to worry about it, he still had fun. 

This was 2 days ago and since then he’s been very distant and just answer very short when we’re messaging and it doesn’t feel like he wants to have a conversation with me. I asked him if anything was wrong but he said no, but I still feel like something is off.

I don’t know how to move on from here, I don’t want to come out as too pushy or try to force a conversation on him if he doesn’t want to talk. Should I leave him alone for a while or just move on?

Before you say just shorten it or something, it doesn't work, it's already short and you can't really do anything with it. I once dated a chick for a month that i matched with on Tinder, using a westernized version of my name following a flatmate's advice, and after the whole month she realized and asked me ""YOU'RE NOT A CHRISTIAN"", literally, and twice, while on a date. Too bad because the chemistry was actually great between us and we couldn't get our hands off each other, but hey, religion was just too important for her, so she broke it off a few days later.

Anyways, now i'm just in a toxic place where i literally avoid opportunities when a girl shows interest, because i just feel like as soon as i tell her my name or where i'm from, that will be all the information she will need to stop acting genuinely and turn into this politically correct robot that will say it was nice to mee you and then fuck off.

I am 32 and live in a large city. I'm recently back in the dating game and I am no stranger to Bumble (dating app) or dating in general.

About six weeks ago I made a great connection with a match on bumble. Nice initial interaction on Bumble, we scheduled a date for the weekend and texted intermittently. I am not huge on texting before you meet, or really even consistently thorough the day with someone I'm dating, it leads to false intimacy or a false idea of what the relationship is (texting is not dating).

Anyway, on our first date I was surprised the guy was 3 inches shorter than he claimed on his profile, but I understand this sometimes for short men (I am 5' 7 and so is he). I don't care about height as most women do, so not a deal breaker.

We had a great first date, he is a Gynecologist and honestly seemed to understand women (as people), very empathetic and gentle, we talked about what we are looking for, and ended the date with a pretty hot make out waiting for my cab. We have seen each other once a week since, which is slower than I'm used to but a nice change of pace. We slept together on the second date, I stayed the night and we stayed up for hours talking about our parents, life, very vulnerable topics.

He then went on a two week trip to Europe but stayed in touch via Instagram, a message or two a day to know we were thinking of each other. Since he got back three weeks ago I've seen him twice, we talk about things like kids, how many we wanted, but also what's important to us for our future and even what we look for and expect in a partner, he even told me if we had kids he hoped they would look like me (???). He works very very long hours with a long commute. I really am fine with that part as I don't need constant interaction, and like to maintain my own life and space too.

The last time I saw him was last weekend. He wanted to see my place, come to my neighborhood, and meet my pet. Good sign, right? We had a great time at dinner, slept together after and talked for a few hours before he went home. In the morning we both agreed we had a great time (via text). However in the past week I'm not sure if I am being ghosted, slow faded or what?

He texted me early in the week but then I didn't hear from him for 2 days. My last response to him was a restaurant I wanted to take him to (trying to take him out now that he's taken me out several times). I thought maybe that turned him off but on Thursday he replied, said how sorry he was to be so busy at work, long hours before the holidays. Ok no problem! I was not nasty or demanding in my response. I get it. But then we made no plans for the weekend, and he posted several times on Instagram without texting me back. I finally heard from him Sunday, just a quick reply to my last message from Thursday. Then nothing yesterday...

To me, I do not expect to see or talk to someone constantly or all the time. But when you are sleeping with someone I think consistency and communication is important if you are into someone. Am I being slow faded or is this someone that's just busy? Why ghost on someone and not send a simple test saying you're not feeling it? I'm honestly blindsided here. 

No I haven't reached out via text to check in. He knows how to get in touch w me.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r0e18x/ghosted_by_a_gyno/

40,r0f3pp,1637679643,Guy I broke it off with two years ago randomly contacted me recently leaving me confused.,"As a disclaimer I have moved on with my life and have no romantic interest in him whatsoever. We ended things in early March of 2020 because we wanted very different things. I F(23) wanted a loving exclusive relationship and he M(23)  wanted to solely have sex. I was going through a lot at the time having just lost my father and getting out of an emotionally manipulative/abusive relationship and he was the first guy I tried dating afterwards as well and the second person I had ever been intimate with. So, this was a big deal for me in my life. I was crushed when things didn't work out and he became a completely different person that I had nothing in common with. He told me that I was worse than his ex and needed a hobby to seem interesting. (Didn't have much of a life due to being homeschooled and having a controlling ex. So, I didn't have the chance to explore myself.) So we went our separate ways and I moved on. Present day I get a message on Instagram from him stating ""Hey, I know you probably don't remember me, but how have you been? 😊"" Which confused the heck out of me lol. When I hear someone say ""Deuce's"" or ""Have a nice life."" To me that sounds like ""Good riddance/I hope to never see or hear from you again"" but low and behold lol. I guess I just wanted to get this out because I wanted to know why a guy would reach out to a woman he gave the ✌️ to almost two years ago? What's the logic behind that?

We're both 30 and have stable lifestyles. However, we didn't have the relationship conversation yet. The thing is we're both a bit shy so neither of us brought it up.

Now I think he wants more than casual dating but obviously can't be sure without having the conversation yet. I'm planning to wait a bit more and bring it up if he still doesn't but I only wanna do this if I'm at least a bit certain that he likes me in that way.

So what are some things that men do if they're serious about you? Or if they potentially want a relationship with you?

I know this might not apply to every case but I just wanna have a general idea. Also, I know the best way to find out is to directly talk to him but I wanna wait a bit more...

We went on a first date after two days of matching and it went really well. We ate sushi, played billiard and totally kissed  after dropping me off. Of course I took some safety precautions. I shared my location with two of my friends so they know where I’m at and I shared this guy’s IG as well. 

After a week went by and I wanted to see him again and he said he wants to see me too so we agreed to just drive around the city listen to some tunes and eat food. So second date comes and I told him he can pick me off after work (7pm). So he did, before that I texted my friends again letting them know that I’m going out with this guy again so I’m sharing my location again. After driving around he says if I want to come at his place and we’ll just order food. So I agreed. My friends asked where we’re off too so I told them I’m at his place and they immediately freaked! They keep telling me to GET OUT AND RUN and that all he’s after is sex and that I’m so much more than that and stuff. But I told them to relax I know what I’m getting myself into but this one friend insists on picking me up and I told her NO. So after eating, me and this guy are chilling in his bed watching netflix and we madeout a bit but I couldn’t do it all the way cuz I had my period so he understood. 

During cuddling, I checked on my phone AND 16 MISSED CALLS FROM MY FRIENDS. I called her and she yelled “WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU! I AM DOWNSTAIRS RIGHT NOW! YOU’RE SO STUPID! I CAN’T BELIEVE YOU’RE DOING THIS!! IF YOU DON’T COME DOWN IN 10 MINUTES I’M CALLING YOUR MOM!” So immediately got out and the guy was so concerned asking me if he did something wrong and if I called them and saying that maybe we should’ve picked a different location. So I got downstairs and my friend was there and the whole ride she was just lecturing me about getting pregnant and getting raped and all that stuff. During the ride the guy kept calling and apologizing to me and my friend was like “DON’T ANSWER IT”.  so when I got home my friend DM the guy on IG as well and he blocked her and she got furious saying “THAT DIPSHIT DOESN’T EVEN HAVE THE BALLS TO FUCKING FACE ME” and the guy texted me saying he doesn’t want any trouble. After being so overwhelmed with the situation I told him lets just talk tomorrow. But after the next day this guy didn’t message me at  all. I tried calling him and no answer.

Met this girl on tinder, we hit it off and I got her contact info.

Set up a first date, we went to the park after work and played basketball, got a bite to eat, and talked for like 1-2 hours. Ended the night by kissing her in my car and that's it.

Next few days we were both busy but we kept texting and emojis were flying.

We set up another date this past Saturday, I was gonna take her out to my favorite dessert spot and then a movie afterwards, maybe dinner after that if we were up to it.

Picked her up and gave her a kiss right away, she kissed me right back and we were off to get dessert. We were running late to the movies so decided to get it to go.

Here's where things got a little off, once we picked up the food she took out some condoms and made a comment ""hey look at these weird flavored condoms I got from work"" we talked about it for a bit. I thought this was her hinting at something so I asked her if she wanted to go back to my place instead of the movies. With out any hesitation she said yes, so we went back to my place. 

I put on a movie, we ate dessert, and I started to make a move. We kissed for a bit and I tried escalating but she looked puzzled and immediately said we're not having sex. So I stopped and was just confused? 

We went back and forth and it eventually led to her asking if I can drop her off. Dropped her off, we didn't really talk on the ride back which was about 15 mins, really awkward ride.

I texted her the next day, and asked if she'd like to do a do-over on our date. She said she felt a little weird about me. So I dropped it.

I jokingly asked if I was enough or if my height is still too close. Also since I’ve asked out girls near my height like her before but they’ve rejected me saying they want someone like 6’5 ish to make them feel small 

Anyways we were discussing height &amp; how she normally gets messages from guys like 5’7 &amp; below which she doesn’t reply to

Then I mentioned how my preference has always been women near my height like her

Since I like the height ratio of index finger extended vs middle finger(like me dating her at 5’11) as opposed to index finger vs thumb(which would be like me dating someone who’s 4’6 ish)

Of course I respect anybody’s preference but it’s just not my own which I think is fair 

Then she didn’t reply for 2 days so I tried changing topics asking about her preferred love language &amp; said mine is acts of service then boom unmatched 

Now that I think about it among women I’ve met/dated at university who are tall, they get super awkward or uncomfortable whenever I discuss how much I like their height 

I get society kinda lowkey implies sHoRtEr = mOrE fEmInInE when any height can be beautiful but tall women always remind me of like lowkey Gal Gadot gorgeous amazons or something which I’m very attracted to

67,r0hju0,1637686357,DATING AS A SHORT MAN,"I'm a 23 year old man and just 159cms. Is it hard dating while being this short? You bet. 
After my break up in 2017 with my long term girlfriend in college over her friends telling her that I'm too short and she deserves so much better, I was completely devastated. I asked myself ""why am I being punished for something I have no control of? I can't magically increase my height?"" 
I wasted the next year doing exercises and finding pills that could grow my height, but that obviously didn't work.' dissatisfied and defeated I got into drinking and smoking for rest my college days. My taller friends would get date after date and when in public girls would check them out. I kept wishing I was a little bit taller so that I could experience the same attention they've been getting. I tried asking people out, I tried going out to make connections. There were times I would get rejected on face, there were times they would ask me to be just friends but the worst was when they'd ask me to introduce them to my tall friends.
One of my friends suggested me to get on tinder. WORST ADVISE EVER. 7 MONTHS OF NOT A SINGLE MATCH. I even bought the premium thinking maybe that would work. Well it didn't. 
Mid 2019, I realised what a fool I've been. To think that I could control something that was not in my control to begin with i.e. my height, way people saw short people etc. I took an oath take control of my life and to not look back. 
I quit drinking and eventually quit smoking. I gained alot of weight due to my drinking habits so I got into a gym and started working out. I read books on self-confidence, emotional intelligence and pubic speaking. I got into community service groups and gave back to the society. I got so confident and started feeling so good about myself that I forgot about my need to date. Dec 2020, I met a woman through one of the mental health community service groups and it was an instant attraction. We've been dating for an year now. 
LESSON - Stop ruining your life over things that you can't control and work on yourself. I compensated for my height with my personality. We need to understand there's only so much we can control and we can only control the things that are within our power. We can't change the way people perceive short people but we can change the way we see ourselves. And the the way we see ourselves dictates how others should see us",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r0hju0/dating_as_a_short_man/

74,r0i3m1,1637687750,Can we normalize sexual health awareness in dating?,"I'm a woman (27, F) who has been dating and sexually active since age 16. What I'm realizing is that each time, I was the only one in the partnership on top of sexual health. 

For me, my reproductive health is very important. I'm on birth control, I know my options would an accident happen, I get tested pretty regularly etc. I know being a pre-med student means I learn a lot about health I general so thos might explain my approach to things. 

Now, with the guys I've met no matter the educational background or class, it doesn't seem this way. My exes have all been eager to jump into raw sex the first time we slept together even when I reiterated how unsafe that is. Then dragged their feet to get tested. Some didn't even know how to go about getting tested. Then one guy told me he has never gotten reproductive care until that one time he had such a terrible case of gonorrhea he thought he ""would loose his junk"". So he waited til his d*ck was about to fall off before going ""Oh maybe I should care about this huh"". And these were not douche guys or dumb guys at all but somehow when it came to sexual safety, thinking flew out of the window. 
With the new guy I'm dating who I really like, as soon as things got hot and heavy he was ready to go raw despite me telling him I had been tested and we should wait for him to get tested. He told me ""You smell and look clean"" lol?!  He was jk and do get the condom but If I hadn't said anything he would have been happy to risk his life. 

On this sub I rarely see conversations about how to normalize and practice safe sex. I just see stigmas against STDs, people saying ""Yeah I'd never date someone with herpes never!"" But if I ask how many of you even know you for sure don't have either strain (both can cause it genital herpes btw), the response is crickets. 

My take on this is we need to do better given all the information we have. Important things:

1. Don't be embarrassed to discuss sexual health up-front, how they react will be very informative.

2. Condoms are not fool proof but they help a ton.

3. Normalize getting tested together. Very well has some good kits for both genders, many Planned Parenthood centers has ways to help those who cannot afford care. 

4. STDs are a risk you take on when sexually active but there are many ways to reduce risk of contracting them. 

5. Rethink STD stigma. You are bound to catch something or a loved one of yours might have had it or still does. Silence can he golden instead of proclaiming marginalizing things about them.

Still friends but yeah)

Everytime I have an interest in someone, always feel like I'm not good enough and let it slip away, isn't helped that a few times I've been getting close to someone a friend comes along, and to the person it feels like I'm instantly dropped for this new person, further fueling these feelings of inadequacy. This has happened twice with 2 different friends this year.

Currently, I've decided to stay single for a while in which I plan to work through these issues in my head amongst others (&amp; hitting gym etc.), just I don't know how to go about it.

I am super picky to whom I share what I currently feel for the reasons to get ignored or something. 

Whenever I got breakdowns, I don't share it with anyone else but my 4 closest friends who are very good listeners.

So this guy that I've been talking to,
He tends to share a lot with me. When he feels anxious or sad. Probably once or twice a week. I am a very good listener and I don't judge, by the way.

On our first week of talking, he shared with me that he was shooting heroins before which I didn't mind because it was over 10 yrs ago. But I thought it was too early for him to mention it to me (I was thinking that maybe he was just weeding out as well)

Now, we usually talk about his sick father which makes him really really sad. But he's aware that he brings him up a lot. Also he's telling me about his frustrations because he's having a hard time on quitting alcohol. These are totally fine with me

It's just that, I got a feeling that he wants me to share something with him too. I mentioned to him that I cried almost the entire week last week because of too much stress at work. But that's just it. I didn't get into details. And he said ""Why do you always cry but never tell me when you're crying?""

I feel that it's kind of unfair for him because I don't share while he does. A lot. I told him that I am afraid to open up to people because I might get ignored and it will make me feel much worse.

I am truly taking my time to share personal things with him, especially my mental state (I have depression and anxiety) for the reasons that 1. I might get ignored 2. Scare him off

He told me that I've been his favorite for quite some time and I was the only one he shared his complete truth to.

But, that isn't all to be in a relationship. Just because you aren't someone they would sleep with in an ONS situation doesn't mean they can't grow to find you attractive.

There are women who are unattractive, too. You must find someone who you don't \*find attractive, who probably won't be attracted to you either, and develop a relationship between you both. This is what they mean by ""attraction can grow"".

Yes, the woman you're with would probably much rather prefer to be with a tall guy, but then, you'd feel the same about her.  
Yes, it's unfair. Life isn't meant to be. But, you can't really sit around complaining, can you? You have to do something. Get fit, get well dressed, groom well, get a good haircut, be giving in bed, don't be sexist in any way, get a stable financial situation, be hygienic, have a clean and well-furnished apartment, get rid of any insecurities that you have, and develop a good personality.

Hope I could help. Best of luck, guys!

We've had sex multiple times and this is the second time it happened.  So damn frustrating, it legit ruined my day.  She said she already forgot about it and it's no big deal but it is to me God dammit!  😔😔  we were on a time crunch and only had a half hour but still is not a good feeling.  Still got off but when that happens I'd rather not even have sex than be embarressed like that.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r0j5j0/i_want_to_curl_up_and_die_right_now/

95,r0jgbe,1637691439,I chickened out from talking to a girl and now I'm pissed at myself.,"I was at a bookstore today, and I saw a cute girl browsing the shelves. I wanted to go up and say 'Hi, I hope this doesn't come off as weird, but I think you're really pretty, and I just wanted to say hi,' but she kept moving away from me. She stopped when she went into an alcove, but I didn't want to follow her because she might think I was trying to trap her. I went to a different part of the store to psych myself up, but by the time I found her again, she was already checking out. 

I feel like such a loser right now.

I’m 24f, for reference.

There are no wrong answers! Just be honest because everyone has preferences, but please answer respectfully. 

Would you be open to dating a plus size person and why/ why not?

I would. I have. I like the comfort they give and, in my experience, plus size people are quite funny and very attentive. Interested to see others opinions 😊",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r0jh32/would_you_date_a_plus_size_person/

99,r0jk8d,1637691736,Mixed Signals,"I met a guy on Bumble that I was somewhat interested in and we hit it off really well on our first date. We sat and talked at the restaurant for 3 hours until they closed. At that point we had not exchanged numbers. But he made sure I got home okay and gave me his number. We started to text but he would often take a while to respond. But whenever he did respond, they were long and thoughtful messages. 

However, his texting habits became so bad that I almost gave up on him. 2 weeks goes by and he asks me I’m back in town. I had told him our date that I’d be going to NYC and he remembered this small detail. I told him I just got back in town and he initiated a second date. 

Now this second date went even better than the first one. While talking he mentioned we should get drinks next time and even said he would show me pictures from one of his trips next time, etc. Once again, we spent another three hours talking and getting to know each other better. Lots of laughing and chemistry. The night ended in a hug and he said “we should definitely do this again sometime” and I replied, “yeah definitely, let me know when you’re free”

However, this was Saturday night and I haven’t gotten a single text from him since. I came home feeling all giddy and really interested; yet, he’s radio silent. I ended up texting him Monday morning saying how much of a great time I had on Saturday and that I wanted to see him soon, asked about the rest of his weekend, etc. I still have not gotten a reply and it’s driving me insane. 

What do men do these things? Either he’s an Oscar winning actor or he also had a great evening. I know for a fact he did. So why the mixed signals? I feel like he’s ghosting me now out of no where.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r0jk8d/mixed_signals/
