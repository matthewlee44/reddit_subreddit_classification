1,mhnfr4,1617250841,Feeling like I won't Find Anyone Better than Him,"I have recently gone through a breakup. It really hurt me initially and seemingly came out of nowhere. In a way, I felt like the carpet was dragged from under me. Even though the relationship was relatively short (a few months). I had really fallen for him. We were really compatible with each other. We shared nearly all important values and beliefs. Even more than that, we really had a lot of chemistry. I rather not go into much detail, but I have been thinking... Would I ever meet anyone like that again. Someone I work super well with and can talk to for hours. Someone who's my match so-to-speak. 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I'm more so asking how to escape this mentality of feeling like my dating life is heading towards a downward spiral. I have dating some pretty interesting and fun people before, but we never clicked the same, and obviously a no relationship came from them. I am just scared I'll end up in a flurry of mediocre relationships. Is there even a way to avoid this? I really don't want my ""best"" relationship at such a young age. I wanna find more wonderful, quality people but it doesn't feel like they exist.

Anywho, last night he made a bit of a strange comment . We were talking about arranged marriages and he said he wouldn’t want to be told who to marry, unless it was me . I was a bit taken a back and before I could respond he said “ just kidding !” . I just ignored it . Maybe it means nothing , but it hurt my feelings a bit . As if the idea of marrying me is a joke ? He didn’t even give me time to respond . Maybe it meant nothing.

3,mhnofs,1617251827,She Wants to Get to Know Me More But She Wants to Take it Slow,"So I have been messaging this girl for at least 7 months since I rekindled our interest in dating each other (we met through a dating app and had 1 date in person a few years ago, but I was being cynical and for reasons I won't go into too much atm I decided not to follow up on a 2nd date since she got sick). We only started virtual dating about a month ago because we felt weird about video chatting for a while and dating in person was not possible due to this pandemic. 

After a couple virtual dates, she tells me she still wants to get to know me more and wants to do it little by little since she has had some issues with relationships in the past. I told her that is fine and I am cool with that. I am concerned I might have come off a little too strong or fast-paced. 

So my question is, do I tell her she can let me know when is a good time to have another date? Or should I ask her if we could not do another date for another couple weeks or so? What I am concerned is if I tell her to ""let me know"", I feel like I would be giving her too much power or simping, while the other option also seems simping.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mhnofs/she_wants_to_get_to_know_me_more_but_she_wants_to/

8,mhol5w,1617255583,Not feeling ready to put myself back out there,"I’m no stranger to the dating world, I don’t consider myself shy, and I really don’t think I’m ugly or antisocial. So technically there’s no good reason why I should actively avoid people and hide from the world. But I spent a good three years of my life focused on someone who was emotionally unavailable, and I just had the courage to end it with him, once and for all, this month. Our way-too-long situationship really ended up hurting my self esteem and my belief that real intimacy, real trust, and real love exist out there, let alone that I’m worthy of them.

Now I’m in a weird place. I’m a very sensual and sexual person and I crave connection, but it’s not that easy for me to let anyone into my space. I can go on a date and have a really good time, but then I ghost the person regardless of how nice they may have been. I can look at people and say who I’m attracted to, but it’s very matter-of-factly and I don’t really feel an urge to go talk to them or do anything about it. Pretty much no one seems impressive or interesting enough to keep my attention. People have to be very persistent to get through my walls, and no one has that kind of patience. They just interpret my silence and passiveness as lack of interest.

I know this is entirely my problem and there’s nothing wrong with the people per se... but how long is this phase supposed to last? Does it mean I’m not ready to move on yet? How have others gone out of this purgatory where you really crave a real connection, but you’re completely closed off to even giving other people a chance.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mhol5w/not_feeling_ready_to_put_myself_back_out_there/
9,mholrd,1617255653,Girl seems too eager?,"Hi! I (19M) met a girl on bumble yesterday and we traded snaps after a few messages and started talking on there since last night. I suggested we could hang out this upcoming Monday. Initially I felt pretty into her, but recently somethings just not sitting right with me. Out of the blue, she asked me when my birthday is and she told me hers, so I told her mine. She then asked about my music preferences and then jumped right into taking a video of her stuffed animal collection for me. She also asked if when we hang out I could pick her up (despite literally only having met on bumble yesterday), and she literally opens my snaps as soon as I send them.

I don’t know if I’m being the weird one here, but she just seems... overly eager, if that makes any sense, and it’s just not sitting entirely well. We also didn’t really establish what we’re both looking for (she put down “don’t know yet” on bumble). She also has repeatedly told me how cute she thinks I look, saying, and I’m paraphrasing “I know I’ve already said this but you’re just so cute I can’t even”.

12,mhpb6b,1617258708,Situationship gone sour,"Okay so long story short, 

Long time fwb (25m) and I (25f) had been wanting a threesome for a minute now but things took a wrong turn.

Backstory: He’s def more like a situationship bc I have feelings for him. We met about three years ago, while still in college. Didn’t attend same college but nearby so convenient. We have been semi long distance (opposite sides of LA) for about a year and half now since we each moved back home. See each other about every other week. Super close, tell each other EVERYTHING, not even exaggerating it’s true. 

Anyway, we had been wanting a threesome for a minute. I wanted a stranger bc I felt more comfortable kinda like a one time thing with that person. But last weekend I wanted to go out and get drinks with him and friends nothing sexy. He asked I he could bring over another one of his “friends” which was the girl he sees much more often bc she lives down the street for him. Lucky girl. However, she also has feelings for him and I know that bc he told me. He also told me that he doesn’t reciprocate those feelings. I felt bad for her bc I know how she feels. However my fwb doenst know I still harbor feelings for him (I lie and say I got over him) which is why he tells me everything. Anyway, he had to lie to this girl that we hadn’t seen each other in a long time (even tho we got a hotel room the weekend before) in order for her to feel comfortable. Even tho he’s been honest about him seeing other girls, she’s more sensitive so he twists some truths (which I see wrong and have pointed it out to him.)

Fast forward to last weekend. The three of us end up going out, drinking, laughing. Tbh I really liked her and thought we can make good friends. We got a room, more liquor, and started to fool around once we broke the ice between us. My fwb due to a mixture of liquor and insecurity, could t get it up. We just laid there, consoling him and making sure he didn’t feel emasculated. The girl heads to the bathroom, and I told my fwb to place his phone down bc I had seen him grab it multiple times due to work. I had been a bit bothered bc we had waited so long to have this moment at last (the threesome) and here he was working. Well he snapped and raised his voice at me.

Never in the years I met him did he do such a thing. With alcohol in my system I got emotional and started crying. The girl came out and tried to calm him down but he was still not having it. Then I decided to leave and he grabbed me and started hugging me, while apologizing. I told him we never ever fight like that and how could he do that to me. Next day, he texts me to say sorry, I forgive him, but he’s the one that says he needs distance to clear his head and he told both the girl and I that. 

My dilemma is:

1) should I really forgive him and/or keep seeing him? (I’d be fine to be strictly platonic friends in The future)
2) should I befriend the girl? (I really liked her but I know she will still see him)",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mhpb6b/situationship_gone_sour/

16,mhpko6,1617259865,Does he want a serious relationship? Should I start making myself more available?,"I'm seeing this guy since the end of January, I really like him and I think he does like me the same. In the beginning, I confess I started seeing him try to get over another guy that played me hard, the kinda guy that sends super expensive flowers to your house, takes you on trips, and great dinner finally gets sex, and then ignore you for a month, he uses the excuse he is always traveling for work and blah blah and sends more flowers to be forgiven, and 2 weeks later disappears again. I really reeeeeaaly liked the flowers guys and I wanted to make it work with him. I felt rejected and terrible when he disappeared so I blocked him in every form possible and decided I needed a distraction. I felt skeptical of putting my heart in the line so I decided I was only gonna date for fun, and I would do everything the opposite that I did with the flowers guy: not making myself too available, waiting to have sex, not hyper-focusing on him and let him take initiative.

I met this really cute guy on hinge we went on dates basically every week and we waited to have sex until a month and a half in, and even now we don't do it every time we see each other.  He asks me out for dinner, we have great conversations every time. We went ice skating and on walks and all that stuff. He messages me every day in my native language. I was really dating to pass the time but I ended up really liking this guy. He is a sweet and real gentleman when we hangout. He has that traditional charm to him you would expect an actor on an old movie to have. He has a great job, is finishing up college, and owns a property already at a very young age. He loves kids and plays the guitar, and has great smile. He is very supportive when I talk about projects and he is overall a great listener. He likes to go out with his friends and drink a little and I kinda like to do the same with my friends and none of us see it as a problem.  I really do think though that he gets confused with my actions sometimes because I try to be very diplomatic and I don't say what I feel/think, and I'm never the one setting up our dates or messaging first. Pure PTSD if you wanna know. Of course I show a lot of interest and make sure he knows i love spending time with him. 

I like him and I think that's the moment where I have to decide if I want to risk it (again) and let myself feel more. I really feel like I start falling for a guy once I start letting myself express more of what I feel for him. And I really don't want to get hurt again. I also don't want to directly ask him if he is looking for something serious or not because I feel like that puts pressure and I don't want to pressure anything. I just want to at least have an idea of his intentions and let it roll. 

Those are some indicators I got from him:

\*Our 2nd date was actually on valentine's day. He specifically invited me that day.

\*He introduced me to two of his friends.

\*He makes plans with me for the summer.

\*He takes me to his house and he told me last week I could come over whenever I wanted.

\*He invited me over to hang out with him on his birthday.

I know it seems pretty obvious, but my question really is: would any guys here say and do all of this to a girl they didn't themselves long term with? Do you think he could still just be looking for something casual? really don't want to get hurt. And should I start to take initiative sometimes?

18,mhpty7,1617260960,I [M19] think my friend [M19] might have messed up a relationship for me with [F19] when he was “looking out” for me. Or maybe I did.,"This happened last year so this is why age has been changed 

So me and my friend go to the same university. We get along just fine and often laugh at funny memes. A cute girl liked me and I don’t really care. I was excited at first because I like them too but you know act cool and unphased. My friend didn’t look happy about that. 

I told him about this girl who kept staring at me in class and how we started talking. He told me that he thinks he knows who I’m talking about. He told me that her ex was a gangster in a gang, she had a boyfriend last year (2018) and when some kid asked him out he got rejected and left the school. What weirds me out is that he said that “she’s hot af but has a bad choice in men”. She likes tough guy. I’m no tough guy. I was put off by him saying that but that’s my friend. He did seem a bit put off by the fact that she liked me. 

I’m a skinny fat, asian nerd who wears thick frames, works part time, goes to classes and yes I have been in fights and done some crazy stuff but nothing like gangsters would. I’m not built for that. That too when I was young at ages 12-16. My parents getting called up everyday and me getting suspended. I was very mischievous. However in college I became more mature, calm and reserved. 

Now I remember what my friend said and took it has the all truth. Me and her spoke I acted like a grey rock and was hoping she lose interest in me. Which she did. 

She was very nice, very helpful and in a way was sharing too much about herself. I wanted to cry. Like you don’t want me, you’re probably going to get my jumped. I felt very guilty. For 8 months. I reached out through socials out of nowhere and got blocked. 

But now when I talked to my friend again he tells me that there was no one who had done that. He doesn’t know anything. 

I feel a bit betrayed because I always looked out for him. We had so many funny and good memories.

Tl:dr friend told me something and then when asked about it again he contradicted himself. I think gaslighted me. Causing me to mess up a relationship.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mhpty7/i_m19_think_my_friend_m19_might_have_messed_up_a/

Contrary to all of my personal experiences, men not only want relationships but they’re willing to fight for them. They want emotional intimacy, and they are capable of compassion, empathy and kindness. 
When a man pours his heart and soul into a post about his lover or girlfriend; I feel devastated. 

Till this day, I’ve only had those feelings for two people. The type of feelings where you cry yourself to sleep and feel physical pain in your chest. Everyday I would emotionally torture myself- will he define the relationship, why is he stringing me along, why am I second or third choice, why am I chopped liver to literally everyone I date? 

I’m tired of the excuses. Imagine spending months on each and every person to hear: 

“I’m not looking for a relationship. I’m too busy for a relationship. I’m just having fun. I hope you aren’t expecting me to get you anything for valentines. I care about you but I don’t have feelings for you like that. I don’t want to lead you on.”

However hard it is, i try to convince myself they also are not thinking about me. I dont go as far to think about why. I just think ""fuck them, they are not thinking about me, so im not going to waste my evening on them either"".

Granted, i also channel the times she left me standing there into anger for bench pressing. I still can't forget the person but i waste less time now, I hope this helps other people too.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mhqqoz/an_advice_i_read_that_i_want_to_repeatshare/
28,mhqzd4,1617266384,my partner (M31) doesnt want sex when im on my period,"i (F23) have a fairly new bf (M31) - weve been dating for about four months now. everything is perfect - sex is awesome, im really falling for him etc. = just UNREAL really i like him a lot

but whenever im on my period, we dont have sex. seems legit. but my friend just told me that she always has sex on her period and that her bfs never cared. (i then asked most of my female friends and most do have sex with their partners on their period).

so yesterday i told my bf that im supposed to get my period today (which i did) and were supposed to spend the whole weekend together (our first weekend together like this) - so id love to have sex with him all the time this weekend. so i told him about my period and asked him if hed care having sex on it (as i wouldnt) and he seemed a bit hesitant, so i felt hed rather not.

and now im having an inner dilemma - one part of me thinks that period should be really normalized and having sex on it should be ok, wed just extra clear ourselves before and after. so that part of me is a bit sad/annoyed that hes making a deal out of it. but the other part of me is really understanding, its just something hes obviously not comfortable with, so no prob, ill obviously not push him into anything and well just wait for a few days and enjoy the weekend doing something else than sex haha. 

so my question is what are your stances on period sex and to what extent should i (or anyone) accept that your partner doesnt want period sex and be understanding or are my negative thoughts about his dissmisal reasonable?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mhqzd4/my_partner_m31_doesnt_want_sex_when_im_on_my/

He then added me on Instagram and we started to talk on there - on and off. Last weekend we were both out and decided that I would come and meet up with him at his mates place. We ended up kissing and stayed the night at his mates place and caught an Uber to his place (he still lives at home with his parents) the next morning. When we got inside and after we went in his room, he came in and asked if I wanted to meet his mum. So I went out and met her. As we were leaving so that he could drop me home his mum asked were I lived and said “that will be a bit further away when we move into our new place”, my interpretation is that it was hinting I would see him again. Since we’ve been talking and he’s been saying things like I looked so good the other night, we should go out for dinner and hang out this coming weekend. He is a really nice guy and we get along so well. I’m genuinely into this guy and am starting to like him as more than a friend but I don’t know how I feel about the fact he’s recently been in a 5 year relationship and not knowing exactly when it was they broke up except that it was recent.

I don’t get this and it happens a lot.

Words on a screen only go so far.

It's unbelievable how stupid people are.,"Don't know if any of you have experienced this, but I \[28M\] have had a few times over the years being on and off online dating the following progression:

1) Match with a girl, we get chatting. 

2) Chat goes well! We arrange a date, we exchange numbers, move things onto whatsapp.

3) Keep the chat chill but engaging leading up to the date, ask them the day before if they're still up for it, always a yes.

4) Day of the date, no word, then when I message ""on my way see you soon"" I get a flaked on with ""ah sorry I can't make today, completely forgot I had plans, I'll let you know when I'm next free"" 

5) I begrudgingly respond with a ""no worries!"" and then move the chat to archive and just don't bother to chase them, because hey, someone who flakes at that short notice just isn't worth it.

6) Weeks, sometimes months later, I get an add from them on instagram, snapchat or whatever being like ""hey hows it going? remember me?"" Snapchat is the worst one because then they just plague me with selfie after selfie after selfie which you know is being sent to a mass of people, then I get accused of being ""quiet"" because I don't respond to them. 

Like... I've even had before where one girl said ""hey yeah it's me we were supposed to hang out, don't know what happened but we never did"" LIKE WTF then I calmly remind them that THEY flaked and then they get all uppidy about it.

56,mhw4qy,1617286253,A little mindfulness does help!,"So we’re all aware of the dating world today and how it can be extremely draining. I understand that putting yourself out there is the only way to find a partner and rarely does it just fall in your lap, however I feel like we can all agree that it’s exhausting at times. 

I’m a 26F and have only experienced short term relationships. I’ve earned a masters degree, am very independent, love my friends and family, and have my own interests and hobbies. I only started dating in my early 20s and will admit that my own insecurities, unrealistic expectations, and avoidant tendencies make it even more difficult to date. However, I’m actively working on these things to ready myself for a healthy relationship.

Recently I’ve had an epiphany that really shifted my perspective and I’m hoping it may help some people. 

Since I’ve started dating I’ve approached it rather apathetically and carelessly even though I desire a long term partnership. I’ve always compared myself to others and equated my lack of a relationship to my worth. We all can agree that our worth is not determined by our relationship status and that everyone’s life path looks extremely different, even though many of the people around us are coupled up and in love. I’ve also witnessed a fair number of relationships that start out of desperation, which is something I don’t desire and would rather be single than with someone I feel lukewarm about but am with them for attention, comfort, etc. Always being the third wheel and experiencing everyone else entering into relationships stirred up quite a bit of bitterness in my own conscience. I always thought to myself “why them and not me? I’m dating and have been patient and have been single for a long time so why do they find what they’re looking for but I can’t?”

What I failed to realize was that I was so focused on idealizing the perfect partner/ relationship without taking into consideration the facets of a healthy relationship or looking for a potentially healthy partner. I would completely ignore red flags because he was “my type” or because I liked the way he made me feel (ego boosts suck). I’ve rejected guys that probably would have been ideal partners, but since they didn’t meet my “expectations” or make me feel a certain way, I didn’t want it. Another universal truth I’ve had a hard time accepting is that no one can make us happy - healthy relationships consist of two content people. The happier and more confident we are with ourselves will show when we’re dating. 

I’m committed to taking time away from dating and distractions to focus on a few things: 1. Who am I, really? I think I have an idea, but we evolve. 2. What/ who do I even want? 3. Realizing relationships don’t define our worth, who we are, and what we’ve accomplished so far. 4. Being at peace with my situation at all times, no matter what. 

I feel content and I’m peaceful since redirecting my train of thought in regards to dating and relationships. I no longer feel anxious about dating (or lack thereof) and have been focusing on how I can better myself and work on myself so that when the time does come, I can date with purpose. That doesn’t mean dating will get any easier, but shifting my perspective and remaining mindful of the process may allow me to eventually navigate the dating pool slightly more successfully.

Especially with the men in my university. I see a lot of them who are perceived as likeable and really cool amongst peers. Some of them are really popular and liked by everyone. The thing is, they're assholes. Or at least from what I can tell. They disregard other peoples feelings, and dont really give a shit about anything except what they want, and dont care who they hurt. It usually reels good results for them, i.e more friends, more of what they want, more hookups. They're more confrontational, mean and often sarcastic when it comes to picking on others. 

&amp;#x200B;

I dont really like the idea of hurting others just to get what I want, but it seems to workout for them, plus they get more rewards for it for some reason. Girls seem to just gravitate towards them and somehow they get more girls every week. 

&amp;#x200B;

Some are loud while others are just quiet and speak when they have something to say, the quiet types tend to get more girls than the loud ones for some reason but they still have that mean behavior.

Me on the other hand, I'm more mild mannered. Im not really confrontational, when someone says something thats meant to insult me, It just...doesnt, I usually ignore it, I dont really know how to respond in a witty or sarcastic ways that the ""assholes"" at my university do so I just tend to ignore it, some of my friends think that I ignore it because im offended, but I just really dont have a way of responding thats funny or witty, and I cant really bother to spend energy to do that. If I do end up responding to something insulting i just say, ""Thank you' with a smile and thats about it. I have a small group of friends that I'm usually ok with being talkative, but I guess for some reason, girls from an outside perspective dont like guys who are too talkative. Like I'm a good listener, from what others tell me, but I guess me talking to much isnt masculine, or ""alpha"" idk. I guess I have a wierd hobby, I like spray painting in my free time, and I think Im really good at it, but girls at my university dont think too much of it, they tend to gravitate towards guys with musical talent like guitar or piano, which I wish but I really have no interest in  creating music. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not really looking for a girlfriend, but Im open to one. But I just like hooking up, which I cant say ive done much of since it was only twice, and they only hooked up with me because the guys they wanted werent interested in them so they settled for me. So maybe adopting an asshole-ish attitude would help?

what do you guys think?

First date -

Her:   Oh! You work for a (insert large multi national employer here).  You must be doing awfully well for yourself!

2 days after the first date (via text) -

Her:   I just came really hard!

Me:  That'd awesomeness.  A good orgasm is a reward in and of itself.

Her:  No. You are missing the point.  I thought about you for the past 45 minutes while I did it!

Second date (we were smoking hookah after at a buddies house) -

She was resting her head on my arm and she was getting heavy.  I asked her to move a bit and she loses it!

Her:  oh! So it's gonna be like that now huh?!?! I see how it is.  U don't like me anymore!

Me:  no. Literally my arm was falling asleep.  That's it!

Her:  whatever.... (she then doesn't talk to me for 10 minutes while glaring at me)

She calls me every night. Snapchats me throughout the day and is kinda a bother at this point.

Well, I'm 29F and I had ""serious"" relationship 3 times. 6, 2 and 2 years. I received proposal 3 times. Said yes 3 times. And all 3 of them cheated. One of them used to cheat on me every single time he didn't like what and how I'm speaking or the tone of my voice.

I don't know if it's something wrong with me, that makes my bf to cheat, or it's something wrong with me that makes me to choose guys like them. 

Anyway, I don't know how to trust people anymore. I had a nice guy once, and he left me because ""one of your foot is always outside the door"". Like he felt that I can leave him anytime. 

I really can't understand, why should I trust him, and what would stop him from cheating. Or not him, maybe other guy.

66,mhwyg1,1617288654,Was he in it for genuine reasons?,"A bit of advice on some of these behaviours from a guy I recently started talking to on a dating app. 

I matched with him and he seemed very keen and talkative and we started messaging. He was messaging every day and this is boy something I’m used to but as we got on I soon started getting used to hearing from him every day. Also did a few calls and he would call me on the way home from work. 
I’m a take it slow type of gal as I’m looking for a genuine connection and try to take testing frequency as a pinch of salt. 
I met him twice and we had great dates where he seemed really interested in me. He was also suggesting road trips and possible things we can do in the future together. 
I had to go out of town recently for 2 weeks abs I explained this and said “it’s great getting to know you but as I’m out of town the next few weeks, if you are keen to get to know each other better when I’m back - I’ll let you know when I’m back but in the meantime we can do FaceTime. 
He seemed keen on this but as I’ve tried to keep in touch when I’m away I can feel the change and shift in how behaviour. I tried to suggest a FaceTime but he said it was late and messaging was dry so I stopped messaging but leaving it with a speak soon. 
I haven’t heard anything in almost a week and would now feel a bit silly messaging when I’m back considering his lack of interest now. 
Was he every genuine in the first place? I’ve also had a dating experience where the guy messaged every day and was overly keen and as soon as I slowed it down he admitted it was just for a hookup.

Day before the meet and she texted me again and said something along the lines of “I’ll keep you updated when we finish, but if you made other plans I understand it was last minute”. Seemed genuine. Either way The day of I never heard from her. That was yesterday. So far still nothing 

Sure it could have been that the thing took longer, but simple communication would have been easy. Was I warned enough? Posted stories on snap since. Nothing conclusive.

I recently met a girl through a dating app. We had a few video calls and one in-person date, and things were looking really great. However, the day after our in-person date she told me that she had thought she was a in a place to date someone, but didn't think she was ready for that (she's in a phase of big transition right now). She told me that made her sad because I had a lot of what she was looking for. I asked if she was open to discussing it and she said she just didn't think dating was wise for her right now. Everything ended amicably. This was a little less than 3 weeks ago.

The last thing I told her (via text) was that I promised she wouldn't hear from me again, I wished her the best, etc., including that I would delete her number so I couldn't contact her again. I also told her that if in the future she contacts me, I might be open to rekindling our relationship.

On one hand, I told her I wouldn't contact her again, and I take promises seriously. However, I think I've also done myself a disservice in saying I might be open to trying again and leaving that open-ended, as now I'm just hoping that in the future she contacts me (which could very well be never). Would it be okay to contact her explaining this and ask 1) is there a possibility of us dating again in the future? and 2) if so, can we set a timeline, for example, ""lets talk around the beginning of June"" or something?

TL;DR - Met a girl. Things were going well, but she decided she wasn't ready to date yet. Last text I sent her was saying I wouldn't contact her again, but if she contacted me I might be open to trying again. Would it be okay to contact her asking if that's even a possibility, and if so, if we could set a concrete time for us to talk about the possibility?

**Light, camera, queue juicy drama.**

Among our many conversations then, she said she's going to take at least a year until she starts dating again. The other day I found out via mutual friend that she already started though, doing every wrong thing. The classic why don't they call me back in the AM phase.

I didn't and don't want anything romantic with her, but the news stuck in my head. For most of the day it kept bothering me in some way I don't understand. Friend told me that's normal and I shouldn't worry about it. Eventually the thoughts morphed into a ""noooo person I know super well don't do that to yourself!"" This made sense, at least.

Being the dummy I am, at this point I decide to call her. Move our interactions to being friends instead of brief texts once in a blue moon. Encourage her to date smart, wish her the best, pure intentions only. Figured many years together and her saying before that she cares about me platonically would make this fine.

_Boy was I wrong_

In like my fifth sentence or something I got a smidge sarcastic with ""not going to date for a year? my ass!"", **in context of saying** she _can_ do whatever she wants, it's none of my business, but I just wanted to make sure she's ok and doing the right thing for herself. Saying that hit a nerve for her is an understatement. Latched onto my brief sarcasm, and I got yelled at for it indeed being none of my business and interrogated about who sold her out by telling me. Mmmmk.

That made me mad. I was trying to do something nice, but instead got yelled at for very briefly and in passing calling her out on being dishonest. Five minute call later, I said not so nicely that I don't need this and hung up. Sent an angry scoldy text asking for an apology afterwards, backhandedly wishing her the best otherwise.

Not a proud moment, pretty much the reverse of clear empathetic communication between human beings. But catharsis in its own right. Don't think we'll talk again, noticed she even took me off her social media as a result 🤷‍♂️

Now to the real issue.

The whole thing stirred some stuff up in me. Reminded me of that feeling of a friend turning away from me, kind of like what I felt in the few conversations we still had toward the end of dating. This was the closest person I had for years, now right off the cuff rejecting an attempt at basic friendship and in a not so hot way either.

Guess it's fine, I don't need those kinds of issues in my life. But still, seven years into nothing.. Didn't sleep much tonight. Brain keeps cycling on this, like it hasn't done for a month and a half now.

Idk if this is the really bad kind of baggage and means I should back off on myself starting to date yet. On the daily, I'm excited for trying something new with someone else and am clear of my past. But my strong emotional response tonight, even if not romantically oriented, makes me wonder if I'm really ready.

Your any and all thoughts?

We kissed and he started touching my ass and I was not interested in having sex since I don’t do one night stands. I got the feeling that he was only interested in sex and that I was down for having sex with him even though I didn’t know him that well. I didn’t like that he saw me like that so I told him I was a virgin and saved myself for marriage. I knew he would respect me a lot if I said that cause he come from a very religious background were virgins are a big plus for men.

So I had been going on dates with this person for a few weeks. Things had been going slowly but well, and we had planned on going a date this past Monday. I texted her on Friday trying to throw out some date ideas, and all of a sudden she stopped responding. She doesn't text all weekend, either.

Now I'd gotten the sense that her interest was waning so I thought that if her not texting back means she really isn't that interested she should tell me. So when Monday came along and she doesn't say anything, I'm thinking ""what the fuck"". It wasn't until I texted her two hours before we were supposed to meet that she calls me ""to be honest"" and say she ""wasn't feeling it.""

I'm not mad about the fact that things ended. What I am mad at was how it ended. I didn't get the sense that she was going to text me had I not said anything; maybe it's the cynic in me, but I feel she would have been more than fine ghosting if she could get away with it. Good riddance.

I feel like i wasn't intimate withh her enough before having sex and was coming off as a person who just wants sex. I deleted her because it really hurt that she just completely lost interest in me and would barely text me back anymore or respond to stories and i couldnt handle seeing her stories at the time or her private stories. Flash forward 3 months to today, and i feel like ive gotten stronger about my emotions and been taking care of myself and my focus isnt on women.

We were dating for 2 months before we got together but in those 2 months i still had sex with my fwb i had in the past. Once me and my gf made it official i quit having sex with the fwb girl and told her everything. Now my gf is heart broken and insanely angry with me. She has alot of moodswings where first she tells me to go away and later asking me to come hug her and kiss her. She told me she is changing her mind every 5 seconds between staying with me or leaving me. We were madly in love and i havent felt these feelings for someone ever.

Now ive told her sorry multiple times and ive taken action to proof her i can change. I deleted all other girls on social media, broke all contact with the fwb girl and shared my fb and instagram pw. Im doing all these things but not getting anyfeedback wether we are still going for this or if she is going to leave me. Her explenation is , we are in a grey zone. 

Last night she told me we just had to talk face to face because it is way better than on social media. Which is true because we had some calls and during those calls we can laugh and she tells me she still loves me and we both cry etc.. when on social media she is just acting really mad.

I'm incredibly ugly with messed up teeth that make it literally impossible for me to smile, I have severe mental issues and disorders that make me feel like I'm not even human. I never laugh at anything, I talk with zero emotion in my voice, I have severe social anxiety disorder, depression, anger issues, probably more Ive never been diagnosed with (Im seriously mentally ill, I cant stress it enough, my dad has schizophrenia and I got most of his mental problems). Im asexual on top of all of this so my chances of ever finding love are just dead. I have no self esteem after years of bullying and constantly being called ugly, even to this day by random girls when Im just trying to live my life. Anytime I see someone normal I just want to die, I just can't get over how much life has thrown at me that make every day unbearable to go through. I just want people to like me, but the way I am, I'm better off dead than living this way. Is there really any hope for someone like me? I find it hard to believe when nobody in my life has ever treated me with kindness or love.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mi05f6/i_feel_unloveable_and_ill_likely_die_alone/

87,mi0i9f,1617298495,Should i stay or should i go,"Hello good people of Reddit. 
 Im 38yo and Dad to two beautiful daughters my beloved wife passed away from cancer 6 years ago. First year of her passing was pretty dark for me alcohol,drugs whatever comes to mind while my kids at their grandparents, but i pulled through from that rabbit hole thanks to my girls. Since then i pretty much dedicate my life to my little ones and never touch any substance ever again. While im trying everything i can to do right by them in the back of my head a thought always telling me im not doing enough for them and they are gonna need a female figure in their life and im gonna fuck up along the way somehow while they growing up.
 My therapist suggested for me to try meet/date new people but i think it's not fair to anyone to date someone emotionally scarred as me. Besides that i know im gonna compare people i date to my late wife and find flaws every little action they do even if i don't want to. With that mind set even i start a relationship i know it can't last and became more unnecessary pain for both people . Are there any people among you have similar experiences as mine and how you get through this situation or any girls who live with a step mother and how that affected you positively or negatively to you or the absence of a mother figure. 
Thanks for your input have nice one wherever you are.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mi0i9f/should_i_stay_or_should_i_go/

90,mi0o61,1617298938,What do about childhood being a drag on dating/relationships?,"My childhood was super boring. It seems to be a problem in dating. Most people I'm dating have all these happy memories of trips and summer camps and get always or stuff like that.

My childhoold was basically watching TV. That's all my parents did. We never went out except for pizza/chain food, never traveled anywhere, never took vacation, and I never did any summer camps. My parents literally had no interest in life other than TV. They would go to work, come home, and watch TV until they went to bed, and all weekend, watch TV. We only went out to shop. That's it. For 18 years of my life. I worked since I was 15 to help pay the bills, and didn't have much time for sports or clubs. I had to save up to pay for college.

The people I go out with get really turned off when they find this out. Like go from flirting ot distance, turned off. Sometimes on the first dat,e sometimes on later dates. Whenever it comes up, it's an issue. The only people who seem to want ot date me are those who don't talk about their childhood either. 

Anyone else deal with this kind of thing? I'm not sure what i'm Uppose to do, start lying? It's awkward when someone goes on and on about how wonderful their parents and childhood were, and asks you what your favorite memory is, and it's like 'oh when my dad and I went to the dump to return bottles and spend the money on dunkin donuts once a month...' and they look disgusted at you. But that's the truth for me? 

It's like, people are freaked out when they find out I was poor growing up, that seems to the the gist of it? Most of the women I date have rich parents because I live in a very HCOL area. I never traveled or went ot a nice restaurant until I was like 20.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mi0o61/what_do_about_childhood_being_a_drag_on/

92,mi11do,1617299959,Caught feelings on the person I least expected,"I have been learning a different language for fun for about 2-3 months and there is this girl that I really like. I don't know how to put this, but at first i didn't see any appeal to her but as time went on, her personality, attitude, hardworking nature and positivity drew me closer and closer to her. 
She is 5 years younger than me and we text almost daily.

 Although she doesn't reply to some texts and just abruptly end conversations out of the blue, I believe we have meaningful conversations. I am pretty sure that she might not see me the same way I see her, my assumption is that she thinks of me as a friend almost like a brother. I really don't want to mess the friendship I have with her up so I won't be confessing anything atleast for the time being.

 Is it okay for me to go forward this relationship romantically??  Should I??  
Is the lack of replies a sign of ""she's not that into you?""
Am I overthinking things? 
The language classes ends in 6 months so I am waiting to see how things turn out from here.

97,mi1smr,1617302006,"I'm confused, friends or more?","Hi all!  Looking for what you would make of this weird situation.

I have a guy friend (he's 32M, I'm 32F) who is one of my very closest friends.  We've gone backpacking together, on road trips, even flown to visit our hometown together.  Early on in our friendship, he made it known that he was interested (asked where I would have kissed him if given the chance), and I friend-zoned him because at that point in my life I had just gotten out of a long relationship and was just trying to be single and vibe.  Well, years go by and we get closer and I start to like him as more than a friend.  I know that he had dated women because he talked about one woman he was hooking up with and also he would have me navigating us on his phone and Bumble messages would pop up.  Around this past October, I felt the urge to tell him how I felt; my feelings had been getting stronger and it just felt like the right thing to do.  So, I send him a long text message telling him how I liked him as more than a friend, how my feelings for him were confusing but kept getting deeper, and how I never acted on it because I was afraid to ruin our friendship.  DAYS LATER he texted me about something else but never really responded to my ""declaration of feelings"" text.  A few weeks after my text, he came over my place to cat/house-sit because I was leaving town for a week for a trip.  It was after midnight because I had been working, and I had a 3am flight to catch, so I was trying to get a little bit of sleep.  He walks into my place and immediately says: ""Sooo we need to talk.""  I basically say ""Do we have to?  I really want to get some sleep.""  He looks super relieved and says ""Yeah, I didn't really want to have that conversation tonight anyways.""  Cool cool.  So, I go on my trip and come back and we have lunch and I tell him all about it.  We have hung out many times since then, we text almost every day about dumb daily shit, but have still never had that ""conversation"".  He recently invited me to come with him to his friends' wedding in Alaska, and we're planning the trip and I am super excited (Alaska!), but he has said stuff like ""Yeah, I don't want you to feel weird because it's a wedding, just thought you'd like to see Alaska"".

Sooo basically, my question is, what should I do?  Is he into me?  Or did I blow it?  Is the ball in my court or his?  Essentially, my main priority is keeping our friendship intact, but my heart wants more and I'm not sure how to go about it delicately.
