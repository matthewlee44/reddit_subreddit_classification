And probably just much longer than needed so will edit it down if needed.

So I met this lass online around a year and a half ago during lockdown and had this instant connection. We would video chat for hours, message and just call every day. Eventually we were in what we called a ""situationship"" until we met after lockdown. Unfortunately she lived a few hours away so wasnt easy to sort out a meetup during that time.

Anyway, fast forward 6 month or so and lockdown restrictions were easing up and public transport was available, so I was ready to travel down and go on a actual date etc. But just when I was trying to sort out a plan and get some time off from work she ghosted me for a few days. Then eventually she messaged me apologising and didnt know how to tell me that she met someone else who lived closer and could also give her the physical side of a relationship. I'm a understanding guy and wanted her to be happy so I didnt hold that against her, so wished her the best and sort of just distanced myself a little bit while she worked things out with him.

So fast forwarding again to the beginning of this year, we are still as close as we were, shes currently living with the lad but they arent seeing each other. Shes in the process of moving out and there isn't anything between them. I still live a few hours away from her but always happy to do the travelling and that. Things have sort of progressed further between us again past couple months, a lot more flirting and some things we used to say to each other etc when we first met. 

What I'm wondering is should I try and pursue things again once she moves out and sorts things out, or just leave things how we are and see if she tries to pursue things? I'm not in a rush so dont mind waiting but also a risk that someone else might come along and this just happens all over again lol.

We've texted twice since then, on New Years and her birthday. Very quick hellos. 

She texted me this week asking how I was. We caught up over text, and then she asked if I ""wanted to catch up in person over drinks."" I said yes. Now I need help figuring out if this is just a friendly catch up or if it's something more. Mostly so that I can stop obsessing about it lol.

Like the title says, she’s great. She’s also pleasant to be around and very low maintenance. But I can’t decide if I like her. She’s a great person and we think very similarly. 

And she very clearly likes me. She’s always smiling at me and laughs at almost everything I say. She introduced me to her older sisters two weeks after I asked her out. She also does things she doesn’t really like in order to be around me. 

However, the problem is that she’s pretty shy around me, which I don’t like. It makes conversations difficult for me, and I am constantly the one carrying it on. Also she doesn’t volunteer much information. She seems to be uncomfortable showing me the real her, instead showing herself very blandly, without any quirks, interests, or aspirations. I have shown her mine already.

Anyway, she is very nice and I would hate to hurt her, so I’m considering breaking up before she gets too invested so as not to hurt her since I don’t feel very strongly. What should I do, and is there something I can do to speed up my decision making? If not, when will I know?

We talked about how us trying to fit into the area and how we get judged for being Christians (we live in Idaho which is Mormon heavy), we also spoke about how we were both from California originally and how we missed it there. Eventually I told her “crap I never got your name” and she gave me her name and I shook her hand.
I now figured that this may be the only chance I had to get her number and asked if she wanted to get a coffee sometime….she told me she’s liked too and I asked for her number. I was gonna put it in put she said she would do it. I told her that I have free time next week if she wanted to get a coffee then, She told me that she has to to see her mom in California next week and I told her that we can plan it a different day (I know I fucked up here..I just didn’t know how to respond to that)
I eventually told her that we’ll talk later and left….
Overall I’m glad that I did it. I was a nervous wreck and freaking out but I conquered my fear and asked a girl out. I’m shocked that my first approach resulted in a number but it’s a good confidence booster for me if she doesn’t work out.
How did I do? I know I made mistakes but it was my first time ever asking a girl out and got her number. This was about an hour ago and don’t know we’re to go from here.

Yesterday I wrote here about how my boyfriend talks a lot about his sister. I found out some new things today and it's freaking me out even more. Here is yesterday's post to give you all a background.

I (F 24) have just began dating M(27). He's cool and I really like him but I couldn't help but notice that he talks about his sister a LOT. For example, we were talking about cuisines and he's like I like Mediterranean, Mexican blah blah and (insert sister's name) likes yada yada yada. I mean why? Why do I need to know that. Also, once we were exchanging sort of racy pictures and he sent me a photo of him in a towel with a shy look on. He was still wet from the shower in the picture and was looking pretty hot. When I asked him who clicked the picture, he said his sister did 😶. Isn't this weird? It was a bit too hot to be clicked by his sister? Do men roam around in towels around their sisters? I asked him why and he said he wanted to mark his gym progress. Umm.. am I reading too much into it. I've seen some incestuous porn and idk it's making me think of that now whenever he talks about his sister 💀
Things I found about just today:
 He chooses nail colours for his sister and even applies it on her hand!!
 He makes her sit on her and does pushups sometimes

We were friendly the first couple months but didn't really talk a lot and he stayed in his room.

However, one day he asked me out to the bar and I had the time of my life. He is the most fun, sassy, bad boy I've ever met and he's just exciting to be around. He's also really tall and handsome.

Anyway we spent a couple nights cuddling and he told me he was single. He tried to sleep with me but I told him I wanted to get to know him better. Then a week later he had a BLONDE girl over. She was really pretty and friendly and bubbly.

I stalk him on social media and find out that she has been with him for 2 years. She kept coming over, however, one night she was in the hospital and the guy asked me to come in his bedroom and cuddle. I asked him what his GF would think and he said ""I won't tell her"". Then I start complaining saying things like ""you take her out, you get her nice things"" and saying I was sad. He said ""FINE! NO one is forcing you to be in here!""

Then there was an awkward silence and I went back into my room. From that point on he started almost completely ignoring me and his GF started coming over 3 nights a week, 4 nights a week, and eventually every night. He took her to weddings, parties, and a tropical vacation.

Meanwhile I was literally TOSSED aside like garbage and you have no idea how painful it was to hear her having sex with the man I loved...in the room next to me.

I had to move out because it was messing with my mental health. It's been several weeks and I still miss this guy so much. I just want to go back to how things were before I knew he had a GF, I was actually comfortable talking to him and he kissed me, cuddled me in his big strong arms, etc.

He still follows me on social media and I have this daydream he will contact me again and say it was me all along he liked. What should I do?

But obviously all my classmates who were dating, I couldn't imagine the girls were saying venmo me or cashapp me and ill go out with you. I didn't talk to classmates though because I was scared to do things in person.

They all want money though, why can't I find girls who just want to go on dates and get to know me. I had the same problem all throughout college, I don't know how people were hooking up and getting girls. 

Tonight just pushed it over the top, I was talking to this one girl who lived in the town next over, about 10 minutes away, she put on her story she was looking for a hookup no charge for sex but she needed 30 for gas. When I suggested I go there, she said it was 80. In the last 8 years, she is easily more than the 200nd girl I've asked to go out before.

(I also skip when I'm watching by myself). I also don't want my bf to be constantly seeing other women's naked bodies. Don't get me wrong, I'm not out to see some guys dick in a film, but I just think its not fair that us women have to be naked for a scene with us to be sufficient and whenever it happens it makes me feel exposed myself.

I know this would not be one of the most appropriate places to share this, but it’s simply a bothersome thought that I can’t ignore.

I “had” a girlfriend (she is Japanese, 17 yrs). She has recently finished her end-of-term exams (she was very busy, but promised to talk a lot after), but now she keeps saying (politely) that she is still too busy. Did something change?

A little backstory as to how we met:

You see, we first met each other on a language exchange up around last year. She was trying to learn English, and for me it was Japanese. Yet, after a while the texts became more “flirty”, and she was suggesting the possibility of a call. 

After some time, we both agreed that we should change the platform at last, which is how we got on to Line. From then on, we would go about talking a lot during the dat, mainly through text messages. We would also frequently make video calls - basically, everything seemed perfect. I told many at my school from then on that I finally had a girlfriend.

Yet, this was no ordinary “relationship”. The truth is, to this day we haven’t met in person. Yes, the whole thing was entirely online - crazy how much technology has evolved. Despite me being in England, and she in Japan, despite the 9 hour time difference, the school our busy schedules, we still managed to talk quite a lot.

In that period, about 1-2 months ago, it seemed I was in paradise, though I always remembered that it was only a “long-distance” relationship, without much hopes of seeing each other anytime soon.

Yet, we still continued. We helped each other for various things. The most memorable for me was when I had to make a presentation in Japanese at 18:30 UK time (for her being around 3:30 AM), and she refused to go to sleep before she would have finished checking my writings.

Unfortunately, after this great “honeymoon period, she told me 2 weeks prior that her end-of-term exams were coming up, so her responses would be slower, and we would not be able to face call until the end of the exam period. I agreed and we still texted each other regularly. I was only thinking about the day she would finish, and how the “dream” would continue.

Yet, to my greatest dismay, after having told me that she would be able to “talk loads with me”, when I went about after the exams,  asking her if she could talk again on a call, she again said that she is too busy. 

I am not sure what had happened - it was holiday in Japan, exams were finished, how come you were still busy.

I accepted her apology, then she responded that she did not know that she would still be busy after the tests.

Now, to me it seems peculiar - I barely reach under the 2 day mark before she gives me an answer. Her replies seem to be “less passionate” than even the period she had the tests. She no longer sends me any pictures, and just comes with a polite form of the excuse “I am busy” with a few emojis.

I am jot sure if she is still interested or wether she merely wishes for us to end the conversation once and for all, but doesn’t wish to openly tell me that she no longer has any interest. For me, this feels like one of the worst situations so far.

How come everything seemed perfect, like straight out of paradise a month ago, yet now everything seems to crumble, without much reason.

I know this whole story may seem like complete utter nonsense, but this is simply my experience (everyone has different experiences which make them special). I am merely asking for some reasons and advice, as I am a confused soul at the moment.

Every time I scroll through the photo gallery, I see her happy face, and it actually makes me depressed when I imagine how life was not too long ago. 

I would kindly thank anyone wishing to help me in regards to this very specific issue.

My friend Jessica(F22) and I(M22) met on tinder last year and we decided that it's best that we stay friends at the time.


During November of last year she had to move out of state to take care of some family issues. Ever since we have met eachother, me and her would always text eachother every day and recently she revealed to me that she is coming back in town next month to visit for a few days . 

When Jessica comes back to visit , me and her are going to a night club together. Whenever we talk about her coming back to visit , I start to feel attracted to her for whatever reason. I know with her current situation, a long distance relationship wouldn't work for us. 

My crazy idea is to ask her if she wants to be my girlfriend for a day when we go to the club. I know this seems really weird and crazy but I'm only saying this because I have been feeling attracted to her and to be honest , I want to do boyfriend/ girlfriend things like hold hands , cuddle , kiss , ect .



Is it a good idea for me to ask her if she can be my girlfriend for a day ?

My boyfriend phoned me up out of the blue, he had been distant all week, he was crying and ended the relationship for some random unexpected reasons. He had seemed down for the past month or two, and no longer seemed to care about me

He was crying down the phone and it was awful. I’m gutted because I love him a lot and it’s been the worse few days of my life, but he’s normally very very active on social media, whatsapp and Instagram, and Facebook messenger.

I’m a little worried because he hasn’t been active on any of them since the evening we broke up. He hasn’t blocked me either as he said he doesn’t want to block me. I’m a little confused and concerned about what he might be doing

Anyone got any reassurance as to what’s going on

We had been through a lot post-break up to the point it’s gotten a little complicated but I just don’t wanna lose him as a friend that’s why I stay friends with him. To me, he’s just a best friend and nothing more, but to him it’s the opposite. He had confessed last year that he still had some feelings for me after he found out about my hooking up with some guy. I told him that it’s better if we just cut contact. But he said he didn’t wanna lose me as a friend either so he reassured me not to worry because for sure he’ll get over me then. 

Fast forward, I’m in a relationship now and I still haven’t told him about it. I’m just afraid that he’ll react negatively about it again and I might lose him as a friend. But who knows maybe this time it would be different, right? It feels like I’d have to choose between him and boyfriend. My boyfriend and I have been together for about 2 months now. Part of me feels like it would be wrong to leave a friend for someone I’ve only known for a short time. But another part of me thinks that I should cut my friend off out of respect for my boyfriend. 

Anyway, so at first my boyfriend was telling me that it was ok but then eventually he changed his mind. I always tell my boyfriend everything, and based on what I tell him, he thinks that my ex still has feelings for me which is why he doesn’t feel comfortable with my ex being around anymore. He told me “but it’s up to you tbh. I could be wrong, so maybe just talk to him and ask him if he still has feelings for you”

I personally don't care how many people a person I'm interested in has slept with, but it bothers me when they lie about it to deceive me. For me, depending on the extent they go through to hide things, it kinda just breaks trust, and makes it harder to take them at face value going forward

I'm essentially wondering if going on a date once a week is OK in the beginning like this? I'm used to very clingy and codependent women and she is so independent and busy. She doesn't like texting much but keeps wanting to see me.

At what point can I suggest we see eachother more often? I always ask her when she is free to hang out again and she suggests next week so do I just play it cool until she suggests we see eachother more often?

That’s was like the least important thing about the relationship though, the best part was just the connection, but it’s gone. She portends I don’t exist. She doesn’t talk to me. We did talk after the break up but she either ghosted me a few days later and when she said she wanted to try being friends again, she said she felt a connection but she’s scared to be with me. I asked why and she said she still believes I’m a narcissist. So I left her a long mess and she blocked me on everything. 

It’s like she doesn’t care about how I feel and to be honest with myself it’s not her responsibility to care about me, it just hurts. After two months I started getting better, but the last week I’ve started to go into a deep depression and I can’t stop crying and my sex drive is completely destroyed again. Sleep in impossible and some nights I wish I could just kill my self. I feel so lonely. I just wish I could go back to December and fix everything, maybe keep my mouth shut about how I thought her brother felt about me. I miss her so fucking much and I feel so fucking depressed. I wish someone talked to me every night the way she did. God I’m in such a bad place. Sports is the only place I feel good in. I swim and wrestle. I want to quit my class because of her, but I have done so much grinding and work there that I am going to feel like I wasted all my time if I leave. I don’t even know what I did to deserve this. I treated her well and she said that before I said that five letter word that the relationship was fine and she was perfectly happy with me, which hurt me even more. I feel like I’ll never be happy with someone again. She is my first, and I feel dumb for feeling this way because it was only four Months.

We've been dating for only a few months. In the beginning it was great, I haven't felt so connected with someone since my first love, 7 years ago.  No red flags, pretty amazing on all fronts. It feels like a comfortable, secure relationship I've wanted for so long.

And then I fell pregnant with his child the very first time we had sex.

I found out about 4 weeks later after my period was late. I had a surgical abortion this week at 8 weeks gestation. He has been so supportive and amazing through all of this, he didn't back away, in fact it made us closer. We would make jokes about it to deal with the trauma and awkwardness of the whole thing. Wr still went on dates but we took it easy, early pregancy did a number on my body i tell you what, cramping evwryday, fatigue, nausea etc.

He took work off when I told him the news that I was pregnant, and again to look after me post-procedure. I ended up in hospital a few days later (I wrote another post about the details of this) with unbelievable pain. I stayed there for two days. He watched me writhe in pain, sob when blood dripped down my arm from failed canula insertion attempts. He stayed with my for five hours even when I passed out from the pain.

We were supposed to hang out last night and he cancelled on me pretty last minute to console his friend having relationship issues, I called him this morning and his tone changed. It didn't sound excited to hear from me. This has been hard for him too I totally understand, and I think watching how well he's handled it and how supportive he's been has made me more attracted to him and more... needy of him I guess. There's a bit of a power imbalance right now because I'm struggling to stand on my own two feet.

When I was discharged from hospital all I wanted was to spend time with him. I'm feeling very alone and isolated in my own body attacking itself readjusting to not being pregnant again. It was hard him cancelling on me last minute like that.

Our relationship feels like an elastic band that's stretched too far to early on. More than half of our brief time spent together had been about me being pregnant, my abortion, and now pain, post hospital. I want to get back to that fun, spontaneous, sexual, driven person he was attracted to when we first met. 

I know he still cares for me. But my question is, how do I deal with someone pulling away from me in a time like this, is he even pulling away? How do I give him the space he needs without going insane myself. I'm just really vulnerable and know I'm being neurotic and I'm trying hard to not let it seep through in this new relationship. 

How do I revive this relationship while I'm still recovering? How do I cope with all of this without putting even more on him?

Like the title says, she’s great. She’s also pleasant to be around and very low maintenance. She’s a great person and we think very similarly. But I can’t decide if I like her because she is acting differently ever since I asked her out. She was not shy at all, seemed more confident, and was much easier to talk to. Now, she is very shy and nervous around me, and it’s hard for me to carry the conversation by myself.

And she very clearly likes me. She’s always smiling at me and laughs at almost everything I say. She introduced me to her older sisters two weeks after I asked her out. She also does things she doesn’t really like in order to be around me. 

However, the problem is that she’s pretty shy around me, which I don’t like. It makes conversations difficult for me, and I am constantly the one carrying it on. Also she doesn’t volunteer much information. She seems to be uncomfortable showing me the real her, instead showing herself very blandly, without any quirks, interests, or aspirations. I have shown her mine already.

Anyway, she is very nice and I would hate to hurt her, so I’m considering breaking up before she gets too invested so as not to hurt her since I don’t feel very strongly. What should I do, and is there something I can do to speed up my decision making? If not, when will I know? Again, if she changes to how she was before I asked her out, I definitely would like her, but if this is how it will be, I’m not sure either way. Thx for any advice.

I'm really struggling mentally with the dating life. 

I'm not sure if I'm looking for validation, advice, or just some encouragement.

I recently moved to southern California from a small Texas town. Here in SoCal there are so many beautiful women. It's a completely different ball game.

I've never been flat out rejected this much in my entire life. It's really quite discouraging.

I hear my family make remarks like why don't you have a girlfriend, etc. and it really gets to me sometimes. 

I'm a handsome guy (other's tell me this on a regular basis) who's tan, got blonde hair &amp; blue eyes, 6'1, I own my own successful business doing what I'm passionate about, I love to workout and take care of my physique, I'm funny (from what people tell me), I'm an adrenaline junkie, I surf, I've travelled the world, try to be myself (let my goofy side out), I'm very caring and compassionate for others (part of my business), I love to cook, I love to go all out on dates, etc.

I try to make the focus of a relationship what I can give instead of take (from Tony Robbins).

I value deep relationships and no hookups. 

I value integrity and loyalty above all else in my friendships/relationships.

I just don't understand.

I fell into the society lie that women will flock if you have money.

I contracted 13,500 so far this month as a 20yr old and it doesn't change a thing. 
(I know this is a wrong way to look at it. I believe it's my mind thinking of ways to come up with why I got rejected)

I know it's rare to find what I'm looking for. Just like you don't find a best friend everyday, but I need some words of encouragement.

Maybe people my age just aren't in the same mindset as me? 

Maybe the right one will come when it's meant to be?

Maybe I'm acting in a certain way so I need to find out how I can change it?

Everything was perfect in the beginning.. like almost too perfect. I couldn’t believe that I finally found the feeling I had been longing for, for so long. Eventually I started to feel that he was hiding things from me. That he would spend time with someone else when I wasn’t around. When this semester started, I moved to my parents house to have a shorter commute while he works 3rd shift. We only see each other on the weekends. But we just argue. I asked him why he had a notification from Snapchat when 1. He says he never uses it. And 2. It’s every time I come over. So he flips out and I told him that if he asked me about a notification, I would just show him that it’s nothing? Idgaf. I don’t understand why it has to be that difficult.

Occasionally “location can not be found” shows up but there is always a new excuse. “My phone died.” “My WiFi stopped working.” “You’re crazy for looking at it.”

I had a miscarriage earlier in the year and was living with him until a fight we had made him tell me to get out of his house and to hurry up.

It was a one night stand turned into a situationship. We had a long break during the holidays from seeing each other cause of Covid/ going away/ travels. In that time period I know he’s been intimate with other people (I can’t go into detail but we were having a catch up and it was clear from what he was saying he had been). 

It’s a weird situation as although it is a situationship feelings are involved to an extent as we have actually become closer than we expected so I thought talking about sex wouldn’t be a big deal, especially since we’re adults. But I noticed he would kind of get nervous when speaking about it which he never has in the past. Anyway later on I politely asked if he would tell me how many people he slept with in that time because 1. I’m not tryna catch an Std 2. I’m nosy and 3.stds!! And He seemed shocked I asked that and was like why would you want to know that, I wouldn’t want to know that about you. From his response I couldn’t tell if he was trying fo protect my feelings (but sex is sex I couldn’t care less, I just don’t wanna risk catching anything) or if he was embarrassed if asked him

I was like well it must be bad then if ur not telling me and he said it’s not but like if it’s not why can’t he tell me when it’s not like we’re dating?

I never talked to her except for this one time I helped her at a party when she was too drunk..


Anyways, I reached out on insta back in August, and we periodically have had brief conversations since then (usually initiated by me). Usually I'd react to an ig story or post, and then she'd message back, and we'd have a back and forth for a bit. The odd time she reacts to something I post and we talk as well.


When I get a message/response, it's actually nicely written like she put effort into it, actually responds in a way to carry the conversation forward.. but after a few messages, she no longer responds. And then, sometimes a month or 2 will go by until we talk again


We live an hour or two apart, so I really don't expect anything to happen, but I enjoy our interactions so long as I feel she's down for it.. I'm just getting certain mixed messages, so not too sure what to do.. The way she messages seems a bit over-the-top if she were just being polite.. I sometimes have a habit of forgetting to respond mid-conversation with old friends, so it could be something similar.. she had once apologized for being a poor messager on her own accord before. It's also entirely possible she just enjoys the attention and talk to me just enough to keep me baited..


Anyways, I want to talk to her a bit more regularly, but I want to actually have engaging things to talk about.. I don't want to just be randomly asking what she's upto or how her day is (unless.. is that the way I should proceed?).. also, I don't want to just be starting convos by reacting to how cute her latest post is or whatever (unless.. is that what I should be doing?)

I got out of a very emotionally exhausting long-term relationship where I put up with so much bullshit, I was able to grieve the loss during the relationship.

For months, I didn't think I'd ever find someone until I did. I was on Tinder and I ended up reconnecting with a guy I had a fling with 4 years ago.

We've been talking every day for a month and video calling. We've only gone on 2 dates but I can see myself falling in love with him. The thing is is he's moving in 5 months to a nearby city so we'd have to go temporarily LDR. We'd probably be LDR for at least half a year to a year if we got serious. I was thinking of moving to his city anyways but that'd be in a years time honestly. He's really nervous and stressed about this.

I also feel like I'm slowly falling in love with him. I'm starting to notice his tiny quirks and I love them. He constantly gives me reassurance that he finds me smart and attractive but I don't feel that reassurance that he wants to take it to the next level yet. Then again we've only had 2 dates so of course not. I've been kind of giving him constant affirmation that I'm really into him. I don't know if this will push him away?

Well it gets SO much worse than I original thought.

I had PREMIUM subscription for an entire month. 

On the first day, I immediately ran out of guys in my area that I could send a ""like"" to. It didn't even take long, like 10 minutes, and I had UNLIMITED likes. Well I made sure to check back about every other day, and usually there wasn't anyone new, but sometimes there'd be 1-2 new profiles I could check out. About once a week, I'd get an actual 'like' from someone in my dating radius, and another from somewhere else in the world. 

This Week: My PREMIUM subscription expired.

Suddenly I have 11 new likes, and there's TONS of profiles I've never seen all in my city for me to sift through, only NOW my likes are limited.

BULL. FUCKING. SHIT.

Those profiles have been there the entire time. Paying actual money doesn't mean you get full access to shit. **They block you from seeing everything specifically so you can't find someone too fast**, so they can bait you into another month subscription. 

I didn't even get a full 30 days since February is a short month.

I decided to send him a text on Imessage telling him that I finally applied for the visa and awaiting my interview at the embassy. At this point I already spent X amount of money on the visa agency and the visa fee. He seemed excited, asked me how long I’d be staying, what month, and what city.

However, I found out that he blocked me today on Imessage. His last text was “Hey, good morning, i fell asleep last night” and that was it. NOTHING. When I tried to reply, messages weren’t delivered anymore. I had another number text him, and the text went through.

I’m hurt and devastated. I don’t know what I did wrong for him to shut me out. I did what he wanted me to do, visit him.

But we’ve been back in contact for since like September (we had stopped talking for like a month) and it seems like the feelings are still there.

He has all this experience and I feel like this dumb noob who has no experience when we talk about these topics.

Sometimes I still have this feeling that I want soemthing to happen between us. He seems to want to start the fwb thing again and so do I, kinda. I know it wouldn’t help anything. I just…I’ve never really dated, I’ve never had anyone treat me like he did during our hookups and it felt so nice.
