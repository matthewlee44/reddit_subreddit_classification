1,nezidn,1621306942,What is your definition of the word “relationship” and when do you think you are in one?,"I have a really nice guy that I see quite a bit. We text every day, good morning, here and there throughout the day, goodnight. We have sex whenever we aren’t too busy and my daughter is gone to her dad’s (she is at his house about 5 days a week). He usually comes over for about 2 hours. We cuddle and talk or briefly nap afterward. 

We’ve gone out to eat a few times. We’ve hiked (back when I declared I didn’t want any type of relationship or dating or boyfriend, etc...). We’ve sat on my porch and had drinks or just hung out. We went to his hometown and spent a weekend with relatives. Up until now it has been super casual. No pressure from either of us to do more than any of this.

We talk about future things we would like to do - watch a beach sunset; movies that the other loves that one hasn’t seen;camping this summer. We even talked about my dream retirement plan of hopping in a camper and just traveling whenever and wherever and he agreed it sounded wonderful. We have agreed to only have sex with each other, so we are exclusive in that way.

The thing is, I don’t feel ready for a relationship. I like spending time with him, but I have so much damage from my marriage and I have JUST started to recover and start working on myself (with the help of a fantastic therapist!). He knows all of this and agrees, no need for labels or relationships or any of that yet. Maybe down the line, who knows? But right now, even the idea of calling him my boyfriend just stresses me out.

But I’m having trouble defining what we are. I’m not sure why I feel the need to define it, but I do. So what do you think? Is this your definition of a relationship? A regular hook up? FWB? Something else? I’d like to hear your opinions.

*and looking for some now*
6months exclusive in a happy place enjoying each other. He is nice kind consistent, considerate, and a energy that just lights up a room. We have mentioned we love each other also.
When I visit his place, I spend the night he goes to work in the am, and I usually leave around 10 or 12 just depending on what I have going on that day.
If the weekend, we have bfast or go to bfast. And we go our separate ways.
He has asked in the past and just brought up, that I can bring clothes to his place so I can have a change the next day. He says you can leave clothes here you know, no one comes here but you.
I dont know if this is the avoidance part of me or not. Although I just nodded, not agreeing or disagreeing. I feel like if I start leaving things I will feel more attatched. We have not discussed relationship. But before I open myself completely, I would like to know whats the direction?
I guess my take away is he does want me around, and he cares and so on. Just not sure his thoughts on the relationship part. I am a believer of the talk will not run a man off if he cares about you, I believe he would before than happy to clear the air, if asked.

We moved to texting Sunday night and made a date for the upcoming weekend. Had a fun conversation that lasted most of the night and exchanged a few extra pics.

Yesterday I woke up to the generic (ugh) “Good morning” text. I didn’t respond for awhile, then said hello. Your basic “have a nice day” chat.

Around lunchtime I got “Hi there”, responded “Hi” and got “How are you”. I could feel myself getting irritated, but don’t want to be a jerk to someone who seems nice and interested in me, but with poor texting skills.

I told him about my afternoon plans and he texted a couple of hours later to inquire about how the plans were going. I ignored the text for a couple of hours and then texted back they went fine.

Last night before bed I got a “Hi there”. Probably should have let it go, but I responded. This morning I woke up to another “Good morning.”

7,nfb5vx,1621345671,A Man My Daughter's Age Asked for My Phone Number,"I turned forty a couple of weeks ago.  I had a child very young.  I was fourteen when she was born.  I raised her solo.  Her father passed away when she was three.  She is now 25 years old, living in another city with a long term boyfriend in her last year of University.  For context, her boyfriend is only four years younger than I am.  I really like him and, accept him as a part of my family.

I live in a small village.  There are roughly 1,200 people here.  I go to a small village gym.  There is this one man who comes in.  He is very tall, like 6'4"".  He has a baby face though.  Honestly, the first time I saw him at the gym I thought he was a really tall 16 year old kid working on building muscles for the little girls at school.  I hadn't really spoken with him but, have nodded acknowledgement at him a couple of times.   

About two weeks ago, he added me as a friend on Facebook.  I didn't think much about it.  I know who he is.  We have said hello so, I accepted his friend request.  I know he is older than sixteen now, he is a conservation officer in my village.  

A few days ago, this man approached me at the grocery store.  He was very nice.  I could tell he was nervous as his voice was a little shakey.  He ended up asking me if I wanted to hang out and have a coffee with him sometime and, asked for my phone number.  I do not look like a forty year old woman.  People tell me all the time that they think I am still in my twenties.  I gave this guy my number and, I have been feeling quite odd about it.

I have been single and living alone for over two years now.  I enjoy my solidarity.  I have hobbies that keep me busy.  I am a little lonely these days (this is hard for me to admit for some reason).  After looking closer at his Facebook page, I realized he has graduated high school the same year as my kid.  I do not know if I would feel comfortable being anything more than a gym acquaintance with this fellow but, like I said, I am lonely and, could probably use a good shagging.  haha. 

Would it be terrible of me to hang out with this young buck and, see where things go?",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/nfb5vx/a_man_my_daughters_age_asked_for_my_phone_number/

58,nhcrg9,1621548014,Struggling with a recent bad experience,"I apologize in advance if this goes on for a bit. There's a lot of history here. 

When I was 26, I went cold turkey on men after a date turned violent and traumatic. I gave up completely. No sex, no dating, nothing....for the next 20 years. I felt I was better off alone.

In my youth - I'm 46 now - there was a boy I loved, though we were best friends. We had moments, meaningful glances, and - at fifteen - a hot, brief make out session in a hotel room during a school trip. There could have and  should have been more, but I was young and scared, and he was the preacher's son. 

I moved away and we didn't see each other again, but I kept him in my mind for over 30 years. He's always been my one that got away, the one I compared other people to. It wasn't fair, I know. Nothing competes with that. But when Facebook put us back together as ""people you might know,"" it felt meant to be. 

We're halfway across the country from each other, and after a lot of very fervent and passionate conversations, we decided to meet in the middle. Once in the hotel room, the clothes came off and my 20 year drought ended just like that. It was the best night of my life, and the sex was incredible when he could keep up (twenty years is a long time to stay thirsty).

He was supposed to be with me two days, but left the next morning. I stayed another night and flew back the next day. TSA folk were visibly uncomfortable as I sobbed in the body scanner, sobbed during the pat-down, and sobbed putting my shoes back on. I couldn't stop it, and it didn't ease up for two days.

Tuesday night, he went on FB and posted some pictures of scrap he'd brought home in the back of his truck. The caption said it's from his father-in-law's house. I did some stalking and found his ""real"" profile. Pictures of his wife, who has a debilitating illness. His friends, his congregation, his buddies. I asked for an explanation and got a text that read 'I am not a good person.' 

I've been beaten black and blue, but nothing's hurt like this. All I want is to mourn the boy I loved and try to forget what he's become, but I can't bring myself to block him. It's just a button, and it's the best thing for me, but I cannot cut this cord. 

I can't tell if I'm at a crossroads or on the edge of a cliff. I just don't know how to move on now.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/nhcrg9/struggling_with_a_recent_bad_experience/

77,nhx1kd,1621615571,Feels like an unhealthy attachment starting...please help,"Hi everyone, firstly I've met and have been dating an amazing woman for almost 3 months. We took it really slow for the first couple of months Things have been getting more serious and with it truly fantastic in almost all ways. We really like each other and this week during some pillow talk we told each other we love each other. It was really sweet and feels true and authentic to us both. 

We both have kids, and she's really busy with a new job and other ""adult life"" obligations. I have more free time. We both make efforts to see each other as much as we can, it's about 2-3x a week. 

Lately I think that I've been putting too much emphasis on ""my love language"" needs. I really identify with ""words of affirmation"" and ""physical touch"" (not sexual based). But here is where I feel the problem is. She's a bit of an introvert, self admits that she doesn't like to text much, and doesn't like to talk on the phone. I'm the type that likes to text and talk if we can't be together. So when I know I won't see her for 4-5 days I get anxiety. 

At first it feels like I'm not getting what I need from her. It feels like a void, unbalanced, like I've been unintentionally keeping ""score"". It feels like this whole love language idea is making me co-dependent, making me tie my value to her. I've directly stated that I need more ""touch and words"", and she's said she'd work on it to try harder, which I absolutely love.

It feels like the beginning of the same old pattern of losing myself while seeking validation in another. I know it's not healthy, I've been working on myself and preparing myself for this exact thing! 

How do I stop it? I've been telling myself what it is, to do my own thing, take care of myself, take care of my kids, etc. And in all honesty I'm doing those things. I've maintaining other friendships and relationships. I've been riding my all my different bikes and going indoor rock climbing by myself. 

I want so bad to be able to have a conscious relationship/partnership with this woman. I don't think it's fair to put all of this on her. I want to be able to give her what love I can without the expectation of receiving it back from her. I don't want to change for her or her to change for me.

84,ni6ui7,1621643501,No response ?,"Ugh. I (40f) don’t get it anymore. Talking to guy through bumble 2 nights in a row. Great convo, fun, a little deep, but not too much. We were saying good night 2 nights ago, and I gave him my number so we didn’t have to chat on bumble anymore. I said “here’s my number, text me tomorrow” he excitedly said “I’ll definitely it! Have a great night”

And that was 2 nights ago. Radio silence.

Is that too much? Can guys not handle that? Does everything scare a dude off? It is happening more and more. I can’t even get to a first date anymore, when before the pandemic, I never had a hard time with it. Now men keep freaking out and going into hiding . I know he’s got some damage although I don’t know the extent . 

Is it appropriate to message him? I’m just tired of this. I even made it to a date with someone else recently, excitedly texting me after the date, then the next day, went silent and then short with me, I said something and he said “don’t make this about you, I had a bad day” and I never heard from him again. 

I have analyzed my side and if I’m doing anything wrong, or pressuring, and I’m not!

87,ni8qv3,1621650471,Excited about my first date with the “overtexting” guy. Thanks to everyone in this subreddit who gave me advice!,"So I posted the other day about being overwhelmed by the frequency and lack of substance with texting from a man I met OLD. I got so many different perspectives and suggestions that truly helped my attitude and responses to him.

I wound up asking him to dial back his enthusiasm and frequency a bit, and made sure I followed through with communication by phone and initiating texting with more “substance” myself.

As some people suggested, he said he wanted me to be sure I knew he was genuinely interested and was happy I “reeled him in”.  I told him it was truly about me and my overall dislike of texting, and that I appreciated knowing is intention was to be considerate and show interest. 

Every phone call has been stellar, and our conversations are easy and fun. I find him incredibly attractive in personality and looks. 

Wish me luck, y’all! I think I met a great guy. And thank you so much for all the comments and help!",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/ni8qv3/excited_about_my_first_date_with_the_overtexting/
88,ni9812,1621652276,He wants me to Do All the Work,"About 18 months ago pre-pandemic I met a cool guy on WooPlus,  a dating app for larger people and their admirers. I lived about an hour and a half from him at the time,  across the state line. We met in person twice and I had to drive there and back both times as he does not have a car.

Fast forward to now. After losing my father to Covid last May, then getting Covid myself but recovering,  I relocated 900 miles away to the Deep south from the Northeast for a fresh start, to escape painful memories , and in search of affordable housing. In less than a year I managed to set myself up in a new city, find a small duplex I love for $400 a month (less than half of what my rent was up North) and after a few false starts at a couple jobs I am working full time doing a job I love. And they seem to like me too. I even completed a short vocational training program at a local community college in my new city and earned a new professional certification. All in less than a year. Its been a wild ride. 

Anyway my one remaining living relative (mom) that Im close to is recovering from a health crisis and Im headed north in June for a week to see her and handle some other business. My friend that I met 18 months ago wants to see me and I would love to see him too. Maybe for some intimacy maybe not. My thing is this. I am coming up North at my own expense taking approved but unpaid time off of work. Im paying my own way including transportation meals spending money hotel etc. He told me that the week I am approved to be off work is inconvenient and I should reschedule my whole trip for days that he is off work. I say that I will be in his city for two days and he should call off or schedule off for at least one of those days to spend some time with me since I  am paying my own way and travelling almost 900 miles. Am I wrong for feeling that this is all one sided if he refuses to do this? I already drove at my own expense to meet him twice. And while its true that I have to come up North anyway Im still going out of my way to stop in Baltimore for two days to see him. 

Frustrated. And want to say the hell with it.

90,nidemc,1621669290,Men paying on dates /men expecting women to pay? What's the normal?,"I'm 40F and went on a dare with 48M - Both travelled far to get to the date. He paid for lunch. I offered to pay half, his response was ""oh you can get the next one"" which has been used on me a few times. So, me feeling obliged to pay him back, bought expensive drinks, then he fancied coffee and cake. Together I spent as much as he did on lunch, therefore, I thought it was fine.

 Second date, I drove over an hour to his home town, paid to park ect. Met him for dinner and when the bill camehe began looking hesitatant and squirming whilst trying to get my attention, I felt so uncomfortable, I said oh let me get the bill because you got lunch last time - to which he bit my hand off. I don't know why I said that or offered but It was so uncomfortable and awkward. 

I have to admit, I used to think maybe it was the right thing to do but now, it makes me feel like we are just friends, not dating. Needless to say, that last incident confirmed, I don't want another date with this dude.

18 months ago I got chatting to a guy old...chatted for 3 months and met up. Another 7 went by before we met up again...dated briefly but due to distance it ended.

For the last 6 months this guy messages me all day just about, calls sometimes too but any suggestion I make for meeting is met with a no.

He's 100% single I know this.

It's a couple hours distance so it is feasible to meet...not like in another country.

Why...why waste his own time messaging / calling all day but have no desire to meet???

What do I do? I don't want to ask again and make him do something he obviously doesn't want to do. I also can't quite cut him out as I value his friendship or whatever this is.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/nidiyr/messages_all_day_but_wont_meet_up/

95,niig55,1621689461,Journalist hopeful for interviews with people who have posted online dating profile critiques on Reddit,"Good day,

My name is Michael Stahl and I am a journalist in New York City. I am working on an article about online dating profile critiques that are posted here on Reddit for the digital publication InsideHook.

If you have posted an online dating profile on Reddit, seeking tips and/or approval, I would greatly appreciate the chance to interview you.

You absolutely may remain anonymous if you like -- totally up to you. Interviews can be conducted in any number of ways, i.e. phone calls, message chats, emails through Reddit or personal accounts.

Here are my credentials:

My website: [www.MichaelStahlWrites.com](https://www.michaelstahlwrites.com/)

My work for the publication: [www.InsideHook.com/author/michael-stahl](https://www.insidehook.com/author/michael-stahl)

And if you go to the (NSFW) subreddit PLASTT, scroll down a bit and look to the right, you will find that my identity is confirmed in the Shout Outs section. The mods of this subreddit have also approved this message -- and for that I thank them!

If you're open to being interviewed (or have questions before you agree to one) please reach out to me, here or through my website, as soon as you can. I would really like to speak to both men and women, and people from culturally diverse backgrounds as well, to create as full a representation of this experience as I can.

Thank you so much! Looking forward to hearing from you.
