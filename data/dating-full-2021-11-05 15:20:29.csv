He sometimes sleeps over if we stay out too late or he’s too incapacitated to drive home. We have never had sex. I feel uncomfortable that his frat’s gc makes it look as though we’ve been having sex. He never corrects them. His friends think he’s doing me a disservice by not calling me his girlfriend. In other words, his friends think we are having casual sex but he doesn’t want to date me. The truth is we are not having sex and I haven’t said yes to dating him yet.

I haven’t said anything to correct them because I don’t want to bring him down a peg, but I’ve felt uncomfortable.

I know I’m pretty and he likes me, but from day 1 of my break up he’s been trying to assert an invisible title on us. It hasn’t been that long since I broke up with my ex.

Of course, our experiences are subjective and vary, but I have found some common themes that do seem to have a fairly universal truth behind them.

What I learned dating the last year

1. Feeling confused about where you stand with someone is the clearest indicator and biggest red flag that they're just not that into you.  And the biggest reason behind why you are confused, is because you are afraid to ask (because you already know the answer, you just refuse to consciously acknowledge it). Or maybe they told you already, but instead of listening to what they said, you imagined that they might have meant something else.
2. You should never be afraid, or ashamed, to ask somebody if they are on the same page as you Obviously, you don't do this with somebody you barely met a couple of times, but after spending a fair amount of time with someone and developing feelings, it is absolutely reasonable, mature and necessary to know if you are feeling and wanting the same things.
3. The relationship you have with yourself will ulmiteley be mirrored back to you. Unsure about what you really want, who you really are? Be prepared to attract others who also feel the same. Would you want to be a relationship with somebody like you? Thats a tough one to sit with, because finding your flaws and working through them is not at all obvious or easy to do.
4. For the tedious, confidence destroying initial stages of dating when you are ghosted, used etc - Try and remember that you cannot truly be rejected by somebody who doesn't really know you, because it takes time to get to really know someone :) At best, they can only decide that you do not appear to align with their ideas of what a perfect partner would look like for them. At worst, a lot of people are just looking for hook ups and ego boosts and that has absolutely nothing to do with you. The way we treat other people is a reflection of OURSELVES. Do not take the behaviour of strangers personally, rather look at the reasons why YOU are triggered. Triggers show us the parts where we are unhealed and need to pour more self love into.

&amp;#x200B;

So to conclude, please don't be afraid to expect consistency and clarity. Anybody unwilling to give you either of those things, is not the right person for you. But it really does start WITH YOU. Be consistent with yourself. Listen to your intuition though don't be hard on yourself either, mistakes are how we learn.

&amp;#x200B;

I am aware this is a page for people of different ages, I certainly wasn't looking for anything serious in my 20s, but this is what I have learned in the last year as a 32 year old single female.

When it comes to dating or talking to girls I don’t have any issues there it’s just I don’t want to end up making things awkward for the both of us if things don’t go as I hoped. So we’re both majoring in Education &amp; taking the same class. The thing is when I first saw her I thought she was cute but that was it, for some reason as the semester keeps going on I’m starting to feel more attracted to her, idk if it’s because of the discussions we have in class or something else but whatever it is it’s working. Regardless we do interact &amp; talk from time to time but it’s not on a regular basis &amp; only in class. So I’ve been thinking, “I wonder if she finds me attractive” or if I should ask for her number &amp; let her know that I’m interested in her romantically. The thing is idk how to go about it to not make things awkward afterwards. For example, if she were to have a bf or seeing someone i don’t think she would interact with me the same way. So I was thinking maybe approaching her after class right when the semester is about to end to ask for her number &amp; possibly a date that way it’s not so awkward since we both will be done with that class or just find another way of doing it.

We work in a pretty big restaurant and always had good frequent banter over the past year. Only the other week did I start to see her in a potential romantic way. I always thought she was attractive, smart, hardworking etc. but there wasn't enough substance to justify me pursuing her any further than just another friendly coworker who was on the same wavelength as me.  

Recently she started pushing the physical barrier between us and also made a joke about how much she loved my mum (after meeting her when she came for dinner) and that she'd be her future mother in law, so I figured I'd offer to take her for a drink after our next shift is over (so we could get to know each other better), to which she responded to estactically that she hopes we go ""somewhere cool"". FFW to tonight and we seemed to have it planned, we shared when we'd both clock off (same time), both went to our respective change rooms and said we'll meet in the cafeteria, I never saw her after that. 

  
I don't have her number or socials so I couldn't ask what the deal was. Waited about half an hour in the cafeteria before going home.  I'm not angry or sad, I'm just confused to what happened. 

I guess my main question is was she too afraid to say no to me the whole time for some reason, or should I chalk it up to random events?

We all got along really well so afterwards we hung at my place. When we were at my place I had somewhat of an indicator something was wrong. He got drunker than everyone else and was too messed up.  

This dude was also a child star, had a ton of money, and I later found out when he’s not working he goes on benders.  

So we end up going on a date that went pretty well. We got pretty close pretty fast just because we had similar backgrounds and went through the same things. But, at the same time, I worried about his substance use (I am sober and do not want to date people that are out of control with their drinking/drug use).

So after the date he ghosts me for 2 days. I was kind of offended because I did feel like we were friends to some extent. Then, he calls me last night on a Thursday, completely wasted and saying sad stuff. Talking about how no one cares about him, his life doesn’t matter etc. I called his friend to see if his friend could go check on him, but he was out of town. His friend said he had been on a crazy bender for 2 days and he was worried about him. So he’s begging me to come over and i told him I would just for a little (kinda felt like he needed a friend cause he was not in a good mental state).  

I show up and he does not answer his phone. Some random lady let me into the building, I go to his apartment and the door is unlocked. He is passed out drunk on his couch and wouldn’t wake up. I finally got him awake and it was nuts. He was screaming, throwing stuff, running around his apartment destroying things. I told him to stop drinking for the night but he wouldn’t. I tried to tell him “look dude I don’t know you very well, but we are friends and I Care about you. I’m a little worried. Can you tell me what’s going on” He kept laughing and ignoring me. He kept saying “so? I like to party by myselfffff. EVERYONE JUST WANTS ME FOR MY MONEY” He just seems super depressed and needs helps. I tried to talk to him but he was so messed up.  

Then I got angry because he was acting NUTS. When he’s drunk he turns into a child on steroids. So I left pretty pissed off. I do care about him because I see a lot of myself in him. And I always want to save people. But there was nothing else I could do to help him.  

Then, afterwards, I impulsively met a random dude on bumble at a park nearby. Was the best date of my life. He doesn’t drink or smoke, we have similar views on life, he held my hand and was super cute.

In the past I’ve rushed into having intense, sexual relationships with emotionally unavailable men. Almost all of them ended in disaster.  

Recently I met someone that is unlike any of the men that I’ve dated in the past; he is clearly looking for a serious relationship and so far we seem to have a lot in common. We’ve only gone out on 4 or 5 dates and I don’t feel any pressure to have sex with him, but I find it very strange (and I’m worried) about how nervous even the possibility makes me (to the point where I practically freeze up when I think he might make a move… this is not normal for me at all as I’m usually hyper sexual, very comfortable having sex, and have trouble waiting when I like someone).  

Don’t get me wrong - I’m grateful to be doing things the “right” way this time. But I’m hoping the lack of urgency isn’t bc I am hopelessly attracted to toxic fuckboys and he doesn’t fit the mold. I no longer want to date men that I have instant chemistry with but that aren’t healthy for me. I literally can’t do it and would rather die alone.

Several months ago my gf was acting very suspect with her phone. I asked what was going on. She said nothing and apologized. Then we are in the car one night and a text from one of her exes popped up through car play. She panicked. I asked and after catching her in a lie she showed her text history which was riddled with her exes. Most were innocent convos, a few were guys hitting her up for hookups. I told her that made real uncomfortable and she sat there and deleted contacts and removed people from social media, on her own accord. 

Fast forward to last night, she’s in the shower, her watch is going off. I tell her and she says to read who texted. As I’m going through reading I see this doozy of a text she had sent to one of her exes talking about how she always passes the hotel they used to meet at on her way to work.

During that short time we had a few dates which all went great, it turned out we had a pretty good connection. We texted and snapchatted non stop throughout the days, and I began to really like this girl and was coming to the conclusion I definitely wanted to date her exclusively. We both agreed that we really liked eachother and it just felt right. I waited a few weeks to hook up with her bc I didnt wanna rush anything, and I also wanted to make sure she knew I was serious about her. So we finally hooked up and the sex was amazing, I dont wanna get to specific but it couldn't have went any better. She gave me all the compliments in the world after we finished which got me confident enough to ask her to be my girlfriend officially, she said yes. Everything was going great that night, once we turned the lights on we realized she must have had her period when we were hooking up. She got so embarrassed and instantly changed her attitude towards me, I understood but tried to reassure her it was no big deal and no one needed to know about this. The next day I texted her basically just making sure she was okay, and she texted me that we rushed into things too quickly and she needed time to herself. I was definitely bummed out and hurt, but I still wished her the best. I figured maybe she wasnt ready for a relationship bc she just got out of one previously a few months ago. Fast forward to two weeks after and we matched again on Tinder, I sent her a message but got no response, I never ended up hearing back from her on there so I gave up hope. Now fast forward to three months later today we ended up matching again on Bumble, she ended up sending me a message kinda joking/roasting me which was how we flirted with each other. This obviously gave me hope that we could actually have a run at a relationship this time. I luaghed at her joke and asked her how shes been, but I got no response which was so confusing to me.

We then met for the next two days and it was amazing and we both had a good time, we did some sexual things but not have sex, but either way we had a great connection.

Then we texted and we were supposed to go out on the weekend cos we were busy in the weekday, and then suddenly one day she wanted to meet and told me that we shouldn’t do this anymore because it’s having a toll on her mental health and she has to decide whether she wants to stay with her bf or not, but It won’t be to get with me, and then when I asked whether she would want me to talk to her and stuff still, she said it would be better if I don’t.

Despite that,we did meet one more time (and idk if this makes sense but it was obvious there was still something cos she would just stare into my eyes for a good few seconds very often and then get embarrassed if that makes sense) but that was just to give back some stuff and we texted occasionally over the course of the next month and a bit and the last time we spoke was about 3 weeks ago, because I asked her if she would want to meet  but she said that there’s still the issue that was there before( which was wierd cos she literally said she wouldn’t want to be anything more than friends no matter what happened with her BF so I’m guessing she still feels something ) and somehow it turned into an argument because of some small miscommunication and we haven’t talked at all since.

Now I’m thinking about one last time just asking her out to meet or so and if that doesn’t work to just tell her okay I will delete your number and never talk to you again etc. should I do it? And if so, should I do it now or wait a bit more?

She's a very shy person, but I noticed her staring a lot during classes, and I was already interested so I went over to her table to talk to her. After a week and a half of this, I asked for her number, and she gave it to me. I immediately sent hi it's __, and she didn't respond to that. A few days later I ask her a question about soccer as we both play the sport, and she doesn't respond. At this point I just figure she's not interested and I'm ready to move on

In the next week, she's staring  more than usual. If I'm behind her, she'll glance over her shoulder, if I move to her other shoulder she'll start looking over that shoulder, she'll stare at me in class and she'll glance at me when she passes in the halls. If I look over and make eye contact, she'll look away quickly or it will last a few seconds. The staring has been going on for a few weeks, so 5 days after I text her I ask her after class if she got the texts, she did and she said she was at soccer when she got the text, and so she couldn't respond. She apologized a lot, and has still been staring the few days it's been since I asked.

There is a mutual friend that we have that said she sometimes won't respond to her texts either, and that she's mentioned me when I'm not around. When I was at her table, she'd glance at me a lot to she how much I was paying attention to the other girl at the table, and she'll talk to me if I end up next to her before class.

Me (M22) and my coworkers had a night out and by the end of it all of us were drunk.  Normally, around of 3AM I took it upon myself to take one of my coworkers safely home (F21). As we got to her place she wouldn’t give me back my jacket and was literally begging me to spend the night with her. I refused because: 
1. it would go against my principles
2. she got out of a 2 year relationship a month ago and I don’t want to feel like a replacement to someone again.
3. I don’t want to wake up next to someone that doesn’t want my presence sober.

As I live outside that city, I took the bus and she called me. We spoke for 25 minutes in which she asked me to come back, she told me how she is too shy to approach me at work, thinks I’m very cute and any time I leave work she feels a little bit sad. But the most important part that she told me was: “when I’ll be sober, please ask me out, I’d love to go on a date with you, maybe cook for you and you’ll see that I don’t only want you when I’m drunk”.

Next day I text her to see how is she, asked if she had any regrets to which she replied “none other than the hangover”. Alright, then I asked her out to which she seemed to be excited about. The work schedule was supposed to come in next day and she told me that she’ll let me know tomorrow when she will be free to go on a date.

“Tomorrow” was a week ago, I haven’t seen her at work, could’ve told the boss to give her different shifts than mines. I am not desperate for her by any means, but it only makes me wonder why?.. 

I mean how is it even possible to ask someone out and then ghost?

And do I text her to ask what’s up with that date? Is it even worth bothering?

I’ve been texting and dating this guy for a month already. We’ve been on chill dates with friends and by ourselves. We also assist to the same church and we both are musicians. 

Just to be clear, he was the one who approached to me first. He told me he liked me first, and has been the one to initiate everything. 
At first we talked and established that we’re going to take things slow to see what it happens… but everything we have done has been he’s idea, like, he invited me to a family gathering, he introduced me to his mom, has told a lot of friends we were like going out, etc etc. Also he was the one who first kissed me. 

Anyways, yesterday he threw a bomb at me by saying (again) he wanted to take things slow, that he wasn’t sure about everything, he likes me but he wants to be 100% sure… that he doesn’t want to hurt me, etc etc. 
I was super surprised. 

I’m kind of doubting because he sounds like he’s not sure about me and not about being in a relationship (as he says) or at least that is what I feel. I openly told him that and he reassured it was not about me but about his insecurities (which is a thing I respect). 

I’ve been before in a situation we’re a guy tells me this and was just playing. I don’t think he wants to play but I can’t shake off that feeling, maybe because my own insecurities.

She’d take opportunities to hold my hand, we’d hug whenever we parted ways, we’d have deep conversations about our pasts and plans for the future. She asked for my number, and there was this one time when she wrapped her arm around me and laid her head on my shoulder. All in all, I felt we vibed quite well and I thoroughly enjoyed her company, and I made that clear to her too.

So when I texted her if she wanted to go out again some time, she responded saying she just wants to be friends and that she didn’t want to give me the wrong impression.

Unsurprisingly, this came as a bit of a shock. How could she just want to be friends when all the signs seemed to point to mutual romantic interest? Still, I took the L and I’m now working to get my feelings for her out of my system and move on.

So recently I matched with a girl on tinder and we began the usual chatting and what not. Eventually we decided to meet at her place and we did the usual put on a show, cuddle, and eventually make out. 

I want to point out that I am a virgin and this was one of my first encounters with a girl like this so I was kinda nervous. She even pointed out how my heart was beating really fast. 

Well the making out escalated to us taking off our clothes and when that happened I lost my Hard on. I figured it’ll come back with more foreplay but it didn’t. That’s when I started to figure I was getting performance anxiety. Seeing how things where turning out and I didn’t want to make her feel bad I asked if I could eat her out and to my shock she said no which honestly surprised me. After trying for 30 minutes we decided to call it quits. I do want to point out she was supportive throughout the ordeal and was gently caressing me saying it’s okay.

The next day I texted her to let her know it wasn’t because I found her unattractive , I figured maybe she thought something was wrong with her. She was cool about it saying it happens and she even asked if I was willingly to try again. I told her I’d let her know later in the week what’s up. Later in the week I tell her I’ll be free Saturday but it’s been two days and she hasn’t responded. Normally I’d say life happens but before she’d respond within the day.

Basically I want to ask you guys did she lose interest? Did she think because I couldn’t get hard that I wasn’t worth her time?

For over a year after leaving her I carried a dark cloud over my head, so I  wasn't really in the mood for any sort of courtship. It's only recently  that I started emerging out of that state and doing things for myself.

When  I entered my first relationship, I was at the beginning of my 20s, and  neither of us knew what we were doing. I still don't know what I'm doing. Everything from my body language to what to say, to how polite or  how forward I should be.

I don't  know if I have much romance in me now. I just want a friend. A true friend that is as attracted to me physically as I am to them. In the most honest of terms one I can have sex with in outlandish kinky ways and go straight back to normal the next day. But those two things never seem to allign in the same person. My standards aren't high beyond the woman being interesting. I don't even have the luxury of preferences, but i'm not having great luck.

I freeze up before the rare prospect of a one-night-stand and decline. Without familiarity I feel on edge. Conversely, when I begin to know someone  quite well, I start to feel strong attraction, but they no longer feel  quite so into me. Is familiarity a turn-off in general?

Multiple  online friends have told me I am Demisexual. In my unique experience, I  am depressed, lonely and sexually repressed. But I don't feel strong  attraction to anyone until I really get to the meat and bones of who  they are as a person.

I don't know how to quite explain it without it sounding generic but...  
When  I make friends with a girl, It is not for any ulterior motive, If any motive can be truly pure. I do it because I am alone and there is mutual  interest. Meeting people is the gateway to many things. Jobs, hobbies,  more friends. It's an important thing to try and do. I'm not cultivating  friendships explicitly so that they can evolve into relationships, but a  relationship is still something I am looking for so it will be in the  back of my mind.  
However when I choose to act on my developing  feelings and try to flirt a bit, and move that friendship into a more carnal direction It  never works. I think because it's a shock, or it makes me appear disingenuous, like that is what I always wanted out of it, and the dynamic has settled into an assumption that these worlds should remain  separate. It also hurts to hear about their usually wretched experiences  with other men and it makes me feel quite small, knowing that I want to  give them everything they're looking for in others and more, but from  where they're sitting I can't supply it.  
Nobody is obligated to be attracted to me, but the primal feelings of being demasculated are still there. Especially when the kind of person she's into is the kind you butted heads with historically. The kind who doesn't have to try to get what he wants, doesn't value it and discards it for something new.  
After  that we continue the friendship, and it either lasts or it doesn't.  That or I squash those feelings down because I do not want to jeopardize  it and I know from chemistry or something that they would never be  accepted.

I have ruined at least two friendships by being honest about how my feelings had developed for the person.

On top of that it aint too easy to make friends anyway.

* All  my old friends have moved to opposite ends of the country, or to  entirely new countries. Those still reachable are either too busy or too  heavily invested in their own relationships for me to meet people via  friend networking
* I live out in the boonies so I don't have much prospect of chance meetings.
* I've  tried online dating for half a year now.  Not to generalize but online  dating seems somewhat stacked against males in terms of how attention is  divided.
* Every  time i've matched it's always rested on my shoulders to singlehandedly  carry a conversation, or they simply blank me after reading my reply.  I'm becomming hyper-self analytical about everything I say now, and I  don't like it, as when I talk to someone I usually humour them even if  they've broken a boundary.
* I'm hesitant to hang out in bars alone, I also am frustrated by seeing overtly drunk people considering my history.
* My  work is online, and although I make contact with and make friends with  many people through it, they are only acquaintances, and are also  scattered all over the world.

The  only place i've had any success is in hostels while travelling, as the  people I've met have been gregarious and interested in exchanging life  stories, or i've been with a more confident friend who gives me the  confidence.  But even then, It's for an evening and after that the  mystique that attracted them to me in the first place has gone.

Me (M22) and my coworkers had a night out and by the end of it all of us were drunk.  Normally, around of 3AM I took it upon myself to take one of my coworkers safely home (F21). As we got to her place she wouldn’t give me back my jacket and was literally begging me to spend the night with her. I refused because: 
1. it would go against my principles
2. she got out of a 2 year relationship a month ago and I don’t want to feel like a replacement to someone again.
3. I don’t want to wake up next to someone that doesn’t want my presence sober.

As I live outside that city, I took the bus and she called me. We spoke for 25 minutes in which she asked me to come back, she told me how she is too shy to approach me at work, thinks I’m very cute and any time I leave work she feels a little bit sad. But the most important part that she told me was: “when I’ll be sober, please ask me out, I’d love to go on a date with you, maybe cook for you and you’ll see that I don’t only want you when I’m drunk”.

Next day I text her to see how is she, asked if she had any regrets to which she replied “none other than the hangover”. Alright, then I asked her out to which she seemed to be excited about. The work schedule was supposed to come in next day and she told me that she’ll let me know tomorrow when she will be free to go on a date.

“Tomorrow” was a week ago, I haven’t seen her at work, could’ve told the boss to give her different shifts than mines. I am not desperate for her by any means, but it only makes me wonder why?.. 

I mean how is it even possible to ask someone out and then ghost?

If I'm behind her, she'll glance over her shoulder, if I move to her other shoulder she'll start looking over that shoulder, she'll stare at me in class and she'll glance at me when she passes in the halls. If I look over and make eye contact, she'll look away quickly or it will last a few seconds. The staring has been going on for a few weeks, so 5 days after I text her I ask her after class if she got the texts, she did and she said she was at soccer when she got the text, and so she couldn't respond. She apologized a lot, and has still been staring the few days it's been since I asked.

There is a mutual friend that we have that said she sometimes won't respond to her texts either, and that she's mentioned me when I'm not around. When I was at her table, she'd glance at me a lot to she how much I was paying attention to the other girl at the table, and she'll talk to me if I end up next to her before class.

The issue is, she doesn't sit with my friends anymore, so I don't have an excuse to go talk to her and I feel like I should just text her, and not call as she's shy and I don't want to freak her out.

I hope you can help me a little bit and it's about the fact that I just can't forget my crush. 
On January during the Corona Pandemic, I found her by chance on Instagram, slid into her DM’s and got her number right after. The problem at that time was the distance because she lives in the neighboring country. The writing also went almost 2 months every day, we have always flirted and promised to meet us as soon as possible. She was just the one for me without ever seeing her in person. However, she has lost interest over time, has written less and the times between messages became longer and longer until she told me that she does not want to meet a person only via chat because at that time travelling was impossible. 

This has shaken me deeply because I thought we  really had a lot in common and she was exactly my type. However, I have resigned myself to it. Time has passed until July and I had to spend a month in her hometown because of my work. I dm'ed her right away to meet up. But she refused, because she has a boyfriend at the moment and since then there was radio silence between us again. My plan had also been, after graduation, to move to the city where she lives because further education is much better there. 

During the whole summer months I traveled a lot to forget her and to see the world, but with time I had the feeling that she had broken up with her boyfriend. I'm still not sure if that's true though since she rarely posts her personal life on Instagram. One of the cities I went to was London. I posted a story when I was there and was immediately messaged by her because she was also in London at the time. I thought it was fate to meet her in person, but was disappointed again as she was flying back to her home country the day I arrived. 
I can't get her out of my mind because I always have the hope that she broke up with her boyfriend.

Now the question is whether I should write to her again since my studies will be over soon and I'll be back in her hometown for the summer. Should I lowkey put her on my close friends list on Instagram so she sees more of me?

At first, I was incredibly excited and so drawn to him. Even though it's only been a month, I'm really happy but I don't really feel any excitement anymore. Maybe I'm still getting to know him and my feelings still have to grow, but he just seems way more into it than I am and it's making me feel like something is missing for me. Maybe I'm just used to games and guys that aren't right for me that I became addicted to the chase and the ups and downs.

One thing I should add is that we've yet to have sex. I'm a very physical person and I tend to sleep with my partners very early in the relationship, so waiting this long is something I'm not used to at all. I think maybe even this is what's missing and is what I need to feel closer to him or to feel any sort of excitement again, I don't know.
