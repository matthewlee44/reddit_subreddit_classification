I have been going to see a physiotherapist once a fortnight for the last 3 months due to injury. She is a really good physiotherapist and goes out of her way to do beyond what is expected of her role (replying to emails at night/weekend, giving me exercise bands when others pay, able to find/fix my exact injury)

I've started building attraction for her but since medical professionals are not allowed to have a relationship outside of clinic (morals and code of conduct) I have decided to find another physiotherapist before my attraction grows anymore but I told her I was able to come in more frequently (once a week) just last week! Which she was happy about...

I don't want to just stop going to the clinic, I'd like to keep the doors open. Do you have any suggestions on a good way to conclude it?",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/o5eovl/a_good_way_to_end_it/
3,o5f61c,1624339107,"Going ""all in"" next time","So, I've been hurt a lot...who hasn't, right?  But even before that, I've always been pretty guarded.  I've never been someone that could easily show my interest or love for someone without worrying that I'm showing my hand too early, worrying what they think of me, worrying about getting hurt.  On top of that, I am just not an ""omg I love you so much"" kind of person.  I don't tell my family I love them much, the L word just isn't super easy for me to say.  I much prefer to show my love through my actions, and I'd be way quicker to dole out some playful sarcasm before I would gushy love stuff.

My last relationship was no exception.  We broke up for other reasons after a year, and I am not sure it would have helped....but, I do wonder if I had been less guarded, if it could have made us stronger, and maybe less susceptible to the reason we broke up.  Or at the very least, made our time together a little easier and more enjoyable, if I could have not been so guarded.  He questioned my feelings for him a lot....I think he knew I liked him and even loved him, but maybe wasn't sure it was on the same level as he had for me.  

So I'd really love for my next relationship to just be all in.  To not worry so much, not guard my heart so much.  If I want to text or call early on, even when I was the last to do so, I want to just do it.  I want to be able to make my feelings known, without being so scared to do so.  Basically I want to be able to do things based on whether or not I want to do them....not based on ""will I be coming on too strong, what if I like him more than he likes me"", etc.  Of course this is way easier said than done, but I'd love it if I could accomplish this.  I guarded my heart very heavily this last time, and I was still so devastated and hurt when we broke up.  So being guarded really doesn't help anything, and maybe even hurts because it makes me seem less invested and not as into someone as I am.

My question is, has anyone successfully done this in a relationship, when they've been very guarded in the past.  How did you do it?  Any tips or things to think to keep myself in that mindset?",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/o5f61c/going_all_in_next_time/

When the kids were distanced learning, they brought back small groups of failing kids in ""cohorts."" A cohort is a class of 15 kids, and I had one for 6 months. I saw them every school day, and my job was to get them caught up for they pass. I was with the same group of 9th graders everyday.

I am now ""teaching"" summer school math. My district uses long term subs to teach summer school.

I am now in the credential program at Cal State which is 2 semesters long. First one is classes and the 2nd one is your internship. I am currently living at home with parents while I knock this out.

So here's the problem. For some reason my job appears to be a turn off for women. I don't really know why, but it is.

If I say:

1) I'm a substitute teacher. It's not really fair to me because I do SO much more than just sub.

2) If I say I'm a real teacher, I would be lying through my teeth since I don't have a credential.

3) If I list all of my job duties in detail, it just screams with insecurity / omission.

I used to give this 3 minute speech of ""I'm not a real teacher, but I'm a teacher."" Doing so never led to a 2nd date.

I don't really know how to word this at all. One girl I went out with, I just told her what I did, and she assumed I was a teacher nestled in a career when I'm not. When I later clarified, it painted me with ""ick.""

17,o62yab,1624413328,"My marriage recently ended... But I like someone, what should I do?","Hi! To provide some context and summarize, I decided to end my long-term marriage due to verbal and emotional abuse. I have a huge crush on a guy, who is divorced and has no SO. I'm currently suffering from depression and I have suicidal thoughts, unrelated to the crush. 

The guy gave me ""mixed signals"", told me lots of  very personal stuff and asked me about the end of my marriage, and wanted to know if I had an SO. I have him a small present in return for a favor (we're neighbors) and he was very pleased. But he didn't give me his number or ask for mine, neither did he ask me out, even when he got the opportunity. He said he had terrible experiences practically all along his life (being ill-treated and humiliated by spouse &amp; later SO), he's ok by himself but sometimes he'd like to have ""somebody who loves him"".

I don't love him or anything, I just have a big big big crush on him. I want to get to know him better, little by little. I'd like to ask him out (he's been asked out before and then ghosted!), so I assume he's comfortable with women asking him out. I'm not, but well... 

I'm depressed and the last thing I need at this moment is  rejection. But if I don't ask him out, may I miss my chance? 

Is it possible that he's into me but just scared of failure/rejection, or he's just some idiot who says random things to ladies? 

I'm 39, he's 50.

* Do people typically use a vaginal dam and condom for oral sex, to protect from STDs?
* Is Tinder the most common site for people looking for just sex?

Normally I wouldn’t date someone in this situation, but he was very intelligent, well-read, and we were into the same music and type of art.  As we continued talking, he seemed a little self absorbed but I dismissed it.  

Our relationship has ended as of three weeks ago.  Think I may have been dealing with a narc.  At the very least, I believe I was being gaslighted.  Here are few of the last texts I received:

“I know I go on and on about how my time is meaningless but this stretches the limits of even that assertion. Give me a fucking break already.
What the fuck fucking ever. Seriously, fuck this shit. If this is what it means to you why the fuck am I getting on a fucking bus in the first place” (side note - he has no car).

“You still don’t understand, do you. I work on the opposite side of the planet. Notice how I keep falling asleep when I come over to visit? That’s how I pay my rent. That’s how I eat. Any time I come to see you while you’re awake, it’s the equivalent of you staying up until three in the morning to sit around and chat with me. What about this still does not compute with you”

“You’re still not getting it.  And ultimately, I guess it doesn’t matter. I don’t know why I’m doing this. I made sacrifices to see you. To show you that it meant something to me. And you took them for granted. Good luck with that.”

This was over him coming to see me on Memorial Day.  He asked what time he should come over and I said 2.  I kept apologizing to him because he accused me of not valuing his time…

We are both single parents, I have every other weekend off from my kids, while she just about laways has her 13.y.o. daugther at home. The issue is, since mid-May I have not seen this woman. As Memorial Day weekend approached, I invited her to go with me on a date, as I had a kid-free weekend. Her initial answer was kind of wishy-wash, she'd have to get back to me. After two days,  she eventually texted me. During the exchange, I had to follow up on what was her final answer, and she declined. The reason was kind of weak, but not far-fetched. I did come realize I had been initiating the contact and the dates in the recent weeks, plus she seemed to have started to pull-away. Having realized this, my response to the decline was,""OK, you let me know the next time you'd like to get together."" To this she said,""OK"". 

It is now almost end of June, and it still hasn't happened. 

Don't get me wrong: I have not waited around. I've been connecting with various women from Match and eHarmony, been on dates with a couple that are heading toward 2nd dates, and have done my best to keep busy and not let her be too much of my focus. I've consciously cut back messaging. When she's contacted me, it's mostly pleasantries and jokes. She's reached out for support on some things, has asked me how my  son played in his baseball games, and we still send flirty/raunchy humor messages to each other. On Monday, I finally caved and asked her out for this Saturday night. I just felt the time had come to see whether this should continue, see if the in-person chemistry is still there. Her answer was ""Saturday is a possibility"". After that reply from her, I didn't bother responding. Well, she hit me up tonight, asked me how things were going, and I eventually cut the exchange short as I wanted to see if she'd bring up Saturday. She didn't. I do not plan on asking a follow up this time around. She's not airheaded, she knows the invite is out there.

All the dating coaches I follow say as the male, it's not the best idea to be the one to propose the ""What are we?"" conversation, and I can tell you as someone who's put himself in the lower hand of a relationship, I see their point. However,  I do have a genuine affection towards this woman as she has essentially become a close friend during this time we've been in each other's lives. She did tell me a few days ago she took a personality test and was disturbed it came up as Logican INTP-A, so her awkwardness and lack of initiating dates does make some sense to me now. Still, I don't want to be just friends, and I just can't have her in the back of my mind, to be fair to myself and any woman I start to date. 

At this point, because of the length of time we've been at this, I think it doesn't matter if a conversation about ""us"" happens.

32,o6us02,1624514162,Is OLD really worth the time and effort?,"Hi All. I (47M) am considering getting back into the dating world. It’s been 26 years since I last dated, and 4 years since I’ve been with anyone. My kids are all grown, and they tell me to get Tinder or whatever other apps are out there and get back to “life”. But I keep seeing all the stories of ghosting and how a bio should be set up “ just so” and yadeeyada… and I get flustered. What happened to the good old days when we just met people organically and shared an interest and gave them our numbers? Is that a thing anymore? Am I that out of the loop? I guess I am. Because I don’t even know the rules to approaching a woman nowadays… like, what is Snapchat( don’t have it), Insta?( don’t have it), fb?( don’t have it). Tik Tok? What’s that?

So, I guess the question is: since I’m so “ old fashion” and have none of the new social media stuff, is it worth the time and effort to get OLD? 

Another question: are there any ladies left that actually LIKE the old fashion approach? Or am I just stuck in the past?",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/o6us02/is_old_really_worth_the_time_and_effort/
33,o6wnki,1624523106,Slightly naive and confused novice,"Hi all, I’m a total novice to the dating scene after separating from my wife of 12 years just over  a year ago. I’m moving to a new city soon where I don’t know anyone, so put a post on a local social media group to ask whats to do, how to meet new people etc… (at this stage, dating hadn’t really crossed my mind).

A girl reached out to me, said we could meet up for dog walks and that she’d happily show me round and introduce me to a few people, which sounded great. From day one we were messaging a lot and seemed to click straightaway. I arranged to meet up with her a few days later for a stroll but again, nothing about a romantic interest was mentioned at this stage. However, when I got home she’d posted on her stories that she was heading out on a date! 

We got on great, she made me laugh, she was very open and we shared a lot of common interests. We met up again a few days later and spent the day together; we had a walk around the town, had a bit of lunch together and generally got on brilliantly. 

The messages definitely ramped up a bit after that and we were starting to express an interest in one another and were planning what we could do next and what other things we could look to do in the future. I explained to her that I felt a bit nervous as I wasn’t expecting to meet someone so soon.

We then met for the third and from the start it was clear of her intentions. She made a point of kissing me on the lips when we greeted eachother and was very tactile - lots of touches, leaning into me etc… We went back to her house and had a great talk and she really opened up about past relationships, her fears, hopes and said it was refreshing to be seeing someone kind and that she already felt safe around me. We ended the night with a kiss.

We kept chatting every day and one particular day she was hit with a migraine, so I sent her a little bunch of flowers to cheer her up.

Our forth meet was very different. As soon as she opened her door to me, I could tell she was different from her body language. She told me she felt nervous, but didnt know why. We went for lunch, spent some time at hers and then parted. There was no tactile touching and her body language was quite closed, but again, ending the date with a kiss. Since then, theres been a big shift. Her messages have dropped off, the tone has changed and they’re generally quite closed. Because of this, I’ve been holding back as, even though im new to this, im not an idiot. We are due to meet again this weekend, but nothings been set in stone yet. 

So, am I just overthinking this, or has it fizzled out already? I’d like to discuss it with her, but don’t want to come across as needy. I don’t enjoy how the uncertainty is making me feel, but can’t figure out whats caused the change. Maybe I’m naive, but its confusing how we can go from her sending lovely “I wish you were here” “I’m looking forward to lots of adventures with you” “I really do fancy you” messages to this in the space of a week.

If this is dating in your 40’s, then I think I'll remain single.

As you know it's hard to date with kids involved and he lives about 40 minutes away from me. We work different shifts and we try to see each other 1 a week and usually no intimacy maybe once a month.  We started dating about 7 months ago and I have yet to meet any of his friends (who are friends with his ex of 3 years that he has not mentioned to me, I seen it on social media ""pictures"") or any family. I have met his children and they are awesome. I have to tell you though this guy has a serious problem with his phone. He wears a smartwatch too. He always gets ""notifications"" and I have asked him on more than one occasion if we are exclusive. He told me we established this when we first started dating. 
He has paid for a vacation for all of us recently and a few times I woke up during the vacation and he's on the couch fully clothed sleeping with his phone that was going crazy with ""notifications"" all day. We are friends on social media but he isn't active on it and he has so many posts from his ex of 3 years before we were together on his feed. 
I don't know what to think, I have tried talking on the phone with him about ""us"" and meeting his friends and the only answer I received was "" I feel like your attacking me"" so it's like I can't even voice my feelings and wonder where this is going. I feel like I should dump him because I don't want to get my daughter to get attached to him and I don't want to get closer to his kids because that's not fair to anyone. Being single for 5 years puts you in a place where you can be none negotiable with feelings, used to being by yourself, only what's best for you and your kid. Does anyone catch my drift?

51,o7h1jc,1624598041,I'm finally owning what I want in a relationship.....and it kind of terrifies me,"I've been doing a lot of introspection of my own patterns/ beliefs around relationships and trying to get very honest w/myself as to what I want. After my last relationship failed and I realized that I was very comfortable being uncomfortable with a partner, I saw that it was time to do some digging into the depths of my psyche and belief system.

Over the past few weeks it's been glaringly obvious that I had been denying to myself what I truly wanted because I've felt like I didn't deserve it, or that what I want doesn't exist FOR ME.

Well, fuck it- this is what I really, deeply want.

I want a long term commitment with a loving partner who is also excited about having both me and my son in his life. I want to build a life w/someone.  Maybe we marry, maybe we don't, but the commitment to one another is there.  Ideally he's probably a father too, but it's not essential, but he has to want to be present in a child's life (again, this is LONG TERM, so I'm gonna take my time with integrating the kid). I want to have more good days than bad, I want a partner who can offer empathy, a partner that I can laugh with, one who can express affirmative/loving feelings toward me and others, one who can have mature conversations about difficult matters, and isn't going to gaslight/stonewall/deny facts/lie/turn the story around on me every time there is conflict (sadly this was a normative thing in my past 2 relationships). I want a guy who doesn't run when things  get hard or just shift blame onto me so we can never actually overcome a relationship challenge.

Here were all the excuses I have been making to deny what I really want:

* I'm divorced, why would I ever risk being that close/dedicated to someone again knowing how hurt I could get
* Nobody will want me AND my son (even though I have many examples of people in my life who found love and the person love their kids too)
* After the death of my sister and best friend w/in 2 years (both were under 40) after my divorce, I was scared to love, because love = loss
* Old childhood programming  had me believing that long term commitments meant sacrificing what I really needed to keep the relationship together. Happy relationships were for OTHER people, not for me
* What if it fails and then I'm hurt again  but now much older and my son is hurt again? The son part definitely has me planning to move SLOWLY with someone
* My role in a relationship has been to just accept what my partner throws my way, to ask the universe for a great love is selfish.
* I simply don't deserve it. Who am I to get my heart's desires fulfilled? 

Well I say bullshit to all my excuses.  
This is what I want and I felt some need to share it with you all as a way to own it and state it out loud, so to speak.

It sound silly, but it's a big deal to me to claim what I want and accept it within myself.  I think I'll have a lot better chance at attracting in without all the layers of BS and fear that I'd been covering it up with.

55,o7n1ca,1624625324,Is it really so bad just being alone,"I went through the last 25 years dating many, many people - sometimes long term, sometimes short term, sometimes dramatic and sometimes calm, tall, short, big, little, various backgrounds/educations/expectations and with different styles of showing love and affection. I can say with 100% clarity that not one of those people would have worked out. I spent my life thinking when it’s “the one” (the fabled one from story books - like my parents, my sibling and wife, others I know) that you just “know.” The only epiphanies I’ve had are the moments when I realize there is no gd way it will work. 

People ask me and my family members with concern about why I’m not married - am I not lonely (sometimes), don’t I want kids (if it happens it happens), who will take care of me (I suppose the state if it came to that?), don’t I want to be married (yes without a doubt but not just to be married). 

But I think it would be impossible at this point to find anyone I could pass for “the one.” It’s like I know too much now. I probably could have gotten away with it at 25, and ok maybe if I were love bombed and drunk today, but given a moment of thought I don’t think it would make sense. 

I think if I weigh the positives of good times in relationships against the negatives when things go south, that it doesn’t even equal out to 0, it’s a net loss. I do appreciate some memories but in general I look back and wonder what I was thinking. I feel like it’s likely I’m not compatible with anyone, like another post said if you are dating for 30 years how could you have just not settled down by now. Or like in some movie they said - at some point you just need to pick someone. I don’t think that can happen for me because I’m too concerned about the outcome. I know I will never have a fairytale wedding with a big white dress and being something i looked very forward to my whole life, that is a bummer. But I was never comfortable being the center of attention so maybe it’s for the best. Maybe I don’t really even want a relationship but have been conditioned to feel like I do.

I do want to spend time with someone who can see themselves in a LTR if it works. If they have no interest in that then I really shouldn’t be dating them if that’s what I am looking for.

My problem is trying to sort out what people mean. I am finding that many people who put relationship down aren’t necessarily thinking that way. I just saw a person for a few very casual dates and he talked about how I turned him on but when I said sex is awesome especially as you get to know each other he said no thanks (even though he had said a relationship is his goal and he talked to me about family and past relationships and outdoor activities that we could do together). So it seemed like he was really only down to have sex with me.

What should I be looking for on a dating profile or when I first meet so that I can tell that sex isn’t the only thing they are interested in? I am a 51 year old female who loves sex but want it as part of a relationship (or at least dating that involves other things than just sex). I feel like a fish out of water trying to figure this out.

My own profile is pretty clear about looking for a relationship and my own values. I don’t swipe on those who mention hook ups or nothing serious. What else can I do to screen out those who are just looking to have sex and move on? *I understand that many people want this but it’s just not for me.

Movies, TV, fairy tales, etc have been feeding us a line of bullshit about the “spark” or the “connection” that’ll tell you when you’ve found the one.  It’s already led to people being a bit too selective in finding a romantic partner.  That’s not necessarily a bad thing if it’s just turning down the dealbreakers, but combined with swipe culture making one believe that someone better might be just a swipe away, I think it’s led to a rise in depression and loneliness in modern society.

We find ourselves in positions where we meet people who check all the boxes, like the same things, and generally would be good matches, and then metaphorically (or literally) swipe left because we don’t feel this thing that Hollywood says should be there.  I know I’m guilty of it myself.  I’ve fallen prey to the grass being greener elsewhere mindset more times than I can count.

We've pretty much hung out or talked on the phone every day this week when we couldn't get together due to parenting schedules. We've had some deep conversations about relationships and life in general that I wouldn't typically have with people I date. We text all day long, and when we're with one another, the rest of the world doesn't exist ( her words, not mine). It's also rare for me to have so much in common with someone. While it's only a week, we both agree that we connect at a level that we both haven't associated with a budding romantic relationship. 

&amp;#x200B;

Last night when we were cuddling, she dropped a bomb on me. She's been in a long-distance relationship for about 4 months. I sort of sense that this was the case when she said she doesn't date multiple people early in our conversations.

Usually, I'd be cool with the situation since we just started seeing each other. Then, I found they're meeting up next week, and now I'm conflicted. I realize this trip was planned before we even met, but I also can't help but feel a little disappointed at its timing. 

&amp;#x200B;

After asking some clarifying questions, she expressed that she doesn't feel like her LDR will be permanent. Mainly because they both are geographically constrained by custody orders and co-parenting situations. She also told me that she feels genuinely conflicted about the situation and knows she'll have to make a choice at some point. 

&amp;#x200B;

I certainly don't envy her position. While she's expressed that she sees a possible future between us she feels like she knows the other guy better. 

&amp;#x200B;

We have a few more dates planned before she leaves and I'm starting to get a little insecure about her going away.  I was cheated on early in some relationship in my 20's and I think that that impacts some of the insecurities that I'm having about this situation.

&amp;#x200B;

We've talked a length about this, but wanted to get so other perspectives. How do you handle it when you're part of a multi-dating situation, especially in the early stages of a relationship?  I rarely date more than 1 woman at a time, mostly because I don't have the time or emotional bandwidth.  I'm trying to play it cool and not have it bother me, but the more I think about it, the more anxious I feel.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/o7rqnh/how_do_you_handle_multidating_at_the_beginning_of/

My story: separated in February 2020. Started OLD immediately. Me and my ex had been living our own lives for years by that time, I left specifically because I did not want to go looking something new while living together.

In total, went on 6 first dates over 4 months (I only had time for dating every other weekend (work + 50% kids) + California lockdowns). Had multiple dates with 2 women before meeting my GF (I never date several women at the same time).

Enjoyed meeting all those people. No horror stories. Was never disappointed with appearance (e.g. profile photos were true), they were interesting to spend time with. Don't know if I had been their first date horror story...

Biggest annoyance with OLD was how time consuming it was. I was trying to limit time I spent swiping and messaging (e.g. I would talk only with 5 women at a time, go back to swiping only after a conversation dies off).

During messaging I was mostly trying to filter out bored women who were there just to chat - willing to be entertained. I pushed very directly for an in-person meeting.

I was swiping in range 37-44 (being 40 myself at the time). Going through the divorce + having two kids 50% I did not think I would be able to move the relationship fast. One woman specifically ended our relationship because she wanted to get pregnant within 1 year and I said I would need a longer relationship to commit to another child (I really do not like living separately from my kids).",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/o7s9am/met_on_old_1_year_together_i_think_old_works/

Some people said it's not a big deal, others said they can't do it because feelings get in the way and one person said she gets a different type of feeling - that of cynicism and bitterness against men. 


I'm curious what you'll think about this? 



I had feelings of anger after going through my first and only fwb phase. What's really sad is that I really liked him, in spite of knowing from the start he wasn't available emotionally for me(he told me he just got out of a complicated long term relationship and doesn't want to fall in love anytime soon, he can't give me what i want but enjoyed my company). We both work in an isolated, rural area, but in a different departments of the hospital. I had a crush on him, and when he kissed me for the first time, he was so soft and so delicious... you know that kiss that's just perfect? His lips, tongue...body perfume. It was just wow! We have many things in common. He's inteligent, interesting, a bit sarcastic but also very kind, has so much sex appeal, hidden tats i was pleasantly surprised to discover, a bit dominant (unfortunately i learned later on was due to lots and lots of porn he was watching).  The more i continued seeing him the angrier i became and fought with him often. I was angry with me for letting someone use me as a piece of meat (because he wouldn't want to stay the night and cuddle, would text out of the blue wanting me to send him pictures of my private parts, or would spontaneously want to come over in 30 minutes for sex and then leave, super careful not to be recognized by anyone, asking me over and over to keep this between us). I became angrier and angrier for realizing that I'm letting him do all that because i was so lonely...the sex wasn't that great, he'd come really fast and not really trying to make me come. I then became angry with him because he would call me all the time and not taking no for an answer (after blocking his number and telling him i just can't do it) I really couldn't resist him...his voice.

Over the last couple of months the guy I was seeing before the pandemic (we ended up parting ways because it was hard to sustain at the time) reconnected over the past couple of months. There's a lot of friendship / warm vibes between us, which is nice. But one of the things that I've been reminded about is that we are pretty different in how we work with intimacy and affection.  

Me - I'd consider myself a sensual person who enjoys being spontaneous and going with the flow of energy. Holding hands, getting close in public with light kissing, cuddling, snuggling. If I'm into someone, I allow myself to express myself in this way. I also enjoy building chemistry. Kissing, making out, having sex, making love all come from that place of freedom and building chemistry. 

Him - He considers himself a sexual person. Which, is not surprising from a male perspective given the common driver of intimacy is sex. He has been open to me about having some rejection issues in the past (he's got ADHD and rejection sensitivity is a thing) and so I think he has a hard time going with the flow or allowing himself to let go. 

So here are some examples:

He came over to watch movies and he got cuddly and it was nice but then all of a sudden he just turns to me and says, ""I'm going to kiss you now."" I laughed like, okay? And we kissed but because he was so *prescriptive* about it, the chemistry moment was kind of lost in me. 

When we've held hands in public he's been shifty with holding my hand. So like if we aren't interlacing fingers he will readjust and make it a thing and I'm just like, dude... just let it be what it is. 

We went to have lunch together and we got in my car afterwards to talk and he (again) says, ""okay I'm going to kiss you now."" And this time I told him that when he does that it doesn't feel very spontaneous and makes me feel like, ""okay, I kiss you now"" (say it like a caveman). lol He made light of it, but he's told me that the way his brain works is says what he wants. Key phrase is: *what* ***he*** *wants and when* ***he*** *wants it* which I think is killing my vibe with being affectionate and initiating intimacy with him. 

The crazy thing is he makes such a big deal about seeing me when we can (we don't get a lot of time due to schedules) and that's sweet. But I find myself losing momentum.

75,o80ioi,1624668808,Three dates and a break up text. Can someone give me some feedback. It would be a blessing.,"I'm 32 years old, but I wanted to post here for feedback since you guys seem to offer much better advice than the other dating subs.  I just can't move tf on, and I don't know why.  This was two months ago now.

Note: Each date was exactly one week apart.  She only gets 1 day off a week.

I went on three dates with a 27 year old woman from Hinge.  She's very proud of where she is in life (resident doctor), and I'm very unproud of where I am in mine (substitute teacher living at home with parents).  

Date 1: We meet at a coffee shop and she's extremely talkative and nice.  During the start of the convo she asks me ""So what do you do for work?""

I tell her I work at the HS.  That I have a class of fifteen kids, and my job is to get them caught up since they were failing distanced learning.  I've been with them in person for a good 5 months now.  (This is totally true, but in her mind she probably thought I was a real teacher when I'm just on payroll as a long term substitute.)

We chat more, and she talks about her job A LOT.  Very proud.  She then talked about how her 22 year old engineer brother just bought a house.  Right afterwards she asks about my parents, and if we talk / are on good terms.  I omissively dodge the question and say ""yeah we're on good terms.  We talk!""  (In reality I effing live with them, but I didn't volunteer that info.  I just sat there holding my lemonade in a puddle of shame with a 100 yard stare).

During the convo I could tell she liked me a lot, or at least the person she thought I was.  You know when you can just tell when someone likes you.  I sideways hug her goodbye and left.  It looks like she wanted to stay longer.

Date 2: Before this date anxiety started pouring in like rain.  She thanks I'm established and nestled in a career when I'm the exact opposite.  I was so nervous about how I'm going to clarify where I'm at.

We meet at a mountain lake one hour away.  She looks super excited to see me, and started talking up a storm.  She talks more than any human I've ever met in my life.

We go to the lake for a bit, and when we drove back she asked again about my parents.  I then came clean about living at home and working as a sub.  She looked authentically hurt (eyes bloodshot).  Then she looked kinda mad.  I tried damage controlling it by saying I have 2 semesters left of the credential program and what not, but it fell on dead ears.  This was actually the only time of the date where she didn't talk for more than 10 seconds.

We later get dinner at this place.  Convo is whatever, but she's still being friendly.  Afterwards I hug her goodbye, and she burries her face downwards deep into me definitely not wanting to be kissed (I didn't try).

I told her I really, really want to see her again.  She said ""yeah okay sure!""

Date 3: I have no effing idea why she agreed for a 3rd date, but here we are.  We meet at a coffee shop downtown.  She's in a horrible mood and looks super tired.  She doesn't giggle at my dumb jokes anymore, and she now looks at me with ""ick.""  She's still overall friendly, just... something's significantly different now.

We walk around downtown, and I hold her hand (her body language on all 3 dates was 100 percent closed off.  This was the only move I've made so far).  We sit on this bench, and she starts talking more about her job.

She then nonchalantly asks me what religion am I.  I said ""honestly, I'm not really too religious.  I liked going to Church as a kid, but I'm really unsure at this time in my life.""

She then tells me she's a non denominational Christian.  And talks about going to a religious undergrad.  Shortly after she said she has to go.

I walk her back to her car, and I blindly just ask if I can kiss her.  She says ""no!""  ""Have a good night.""

I later text asking for clarification and she says:

""Our differences in religion is probably too much since it's a big deal to me, and our personalities don't mesh well.  I enjoyed spending time with you, and do wish you the best!""

I wrote her a nice goodbye too.

My questions:

1) Is there something specific I did wrong that crashed that date?  In my brain I think if I would have just been honest on date 1, then we would have clicked and lived happily ever after.

I was such a huge nervous wreck going into that 2nd date.

2) Why can't I move on?  It's been 2 months and I think of her every single day.  It's like her face is haunting my sleep.

I get so tempted to text her asking for a second chance, but I never do (obviously I have to respect boundary).  I just feel sick about it.  Like I blew it.

Can someone help decode what's going on?  Thank you.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/o80ioi/three_dates_and_a_break_up_text_can_someone_give/

81,o84019,1624682674,"First gen immigrant, M(43) asking other similar people how they handle OLD","Hi everyone,

Some historical context before I can seek advice.

**Background:** 

I am a first generation immigrant to a Western country and have been here almost a decade now. I consider myself to have 'integrated' well, my command of the English language being at par with any locally born and raised citizen.

Looking back, my life in the country of my birth was fairly conservative. Without getting into specifics, let's say it was a close-knit household but mainly conservative. Marriage was drilled into the psyche as something that should be coveted and a worthy goal to aim for. Dating and relationships were a frowned upon and if ever pursued were supposed to end in marriage fairly quickly. I spent my twenties pursuing higher education and up until my mid-thirties even if I gotten into a relationship I wouldn't have known the first thing to do. I was a virgin until my year 4 or 5 in my adoptive country (that means I was in my late 30s. I know how it sounds, but these are facts :-)). 

I'm not religious but I do think some 'excess baggage' from my earlier life dictates some conservative behaviour - for e.g. I would love children of my own but I am not mentally prepared to take on a prospective partner's children (sorry if this comes across as rude, I haven't been able to reason well with this point), and marriage. I am however of the belief that I should be spending long periods of time with a prospective partner - that involves staying together, physical intimacy, sex etc. before taking a bigger step. This is a departure from the conservative mindset.

I will preface anything that follows with the fact that I look middle-eastern (my ancestry goes way back) and my name will seem almost comically unpronounceable to a Western-bred individual :-)

**Relationships so far:**

My first real relationship was via OLD and lasted 9 months and after that a string of 3 short-lived relationships lasting 3-6 months again via OLD. The last one ended in mid-2019.

**Problems (as I see them):**

I started putting looking out more actively on OLD in late 2020 but haven't got much success. 

Some of the problematic aspects of being in my situation is (feel free to give advice on any):

1)  I get questions like ""Your profile says you want children. You're 43, what has stopped you?""

2)  Some OLD apps (locally) have canned rejection responses and I get them all the time, e.g.:

""I'm flattered, but you're not my type"".

   Replies like these are like a knife to the heart. I don't blame anyone for having preferences, but it makes me feel quite lost at sea. Obviously, I am not super young at this stage and my profile pics can be considered just about okay, but I don't see myself looking like anything other than what I am.

I can hear folks saying 'look for someone who is of your cultural background'. I get that, but that too, in my experience has proved to be tough. Many women who're themselves immigrants ask me (first thing in their chat - ""So, where are you from?"". The moment I say &lt;insert same country of origin here&gt;, I get instantly ghosted. It's almost like being radioactive enough to deserve no reply.

Please throw in any pointers/clues about this one!

3) My profile write-up may appear a bit 'serious'. For e.g. because of the fact that only drink seldomly (not for religious reasons, but because I have never been used to it), many 'fun' activities can be ruled out. I am more-or-less introverted, but can converse in social settings (quite well, I think). I have talked about stuff like this on my profile and I see that that can be boring for most people.

Regarding 2) - I agree in advance that pics can be improved with professional help

Regarding 3) - Write-up can be fixed, but how?

Anyone else, with similar life stories - I'd love to hear your approach.

Most of my friends are married or otherwise though still keep me in their loop as much as possible, I've got my hobbies, video games and books etc, so it's not that I'm lonely perse.. I just find myself missing the companionship, that reciprocity and all the goofy little things that come with being in love. Maybe it's the mortality of middle age kicking in changing the dynamic for a want of being single? Maybe I just need a change from my wash, rinse, repeat life at the moment and I feel like the universe is poking me with a stick saying "" come on, do something... "" Bleh!

87,o8cw20,1624721128,Why Dating is Harder,"I had a thought this morning.  If it helps you, great.  If not, just ignore as Reddit noise.

In our teenage years and early 20s, it was easier finding jobs.  Basically, if it paid minimum wage, that was fine.  And it didn't, for the most part, matter.  Between me and my friends, we had all kinds of odd jobs from fast food to working in banks.  I oversaw a parking lot for a day or two (and apparently did it badly according to a regular employee).  But now, in our forties, we won't just take any job.  We have (hopefully) certain expertise and skills and a certain pay range we're used to.  It can take time to find the next job.

With relationships, it's very similar.  20 years ago, I only cared if I found a woman attractive and if she was fun to hang out with.  I didn't know what my core beliefs were, didn't have specific life goals, didn't have kids or responsibilities (for the most part).  And just like finding a job can take time, it takes time to find a good relationship.

So all I'm trying to say is... give yourselves a break if you're not finding a good relationship quickly (I'm certainly not finding one yet).  Things are different now, but that's not necessarily bad.  We know who we are and what we want (hopefully, for the most part).  It takes time.

We did some stuff together, but always as ""friends"". She was always so keen, so responsive, not overtly leading me on, but I really thought we were building a closer connection. So today I plucked up the courage to tell her how I feel, and she did not reciprocate. Damn, I'm shattered. She did nothing wrong, I just interpreted her signals incorrectly (and I'm usually quite conservative with that).

93,o8g04o,1624731219,Why Dating Is Better,"I believe dating is better now than anytime before, even the vaunted 20's.  Back then you had to guess what people will become or how they'll turn out.  Now we know who the people are.... They have a career(or don't), they are great parents (or not), they haven't spent time in prison (or have).... We can see how they deal with real things and better predict how they will handle the future.   

Letting us see other people comes with the added bonus of knowing better who WE are.   This is the age when we are mostly past the point of figuring ourselves out.   We should be able to be ourselves and take pride in what we have accomplished or even what we are striving for.

One thing people talk about is ""baggage"", but I only see that as the stuff YOU CAN'T leave behind... Mentally/emotionally.   Kids or a former marriage aren't baggage, it's life.   I'd have more questions if I was dating someone who never married or never wanted kids.  

Vibrant stories come from experiences,  and something great I found when returning to the dating world is that people are more interesting (or you can tell fast if they just aren't interesting).  People have lived, good and bad, and you can learn and share more with people, even if it doesn't become anything.

Everything isn't perfect though.   The biggest problem I have is that people our age tend to have more commitments and be more rooted.    Being a parent takes work and careers/jobs can be more ingrained into our life.   I'm not going out at night, when I have to get to work the next day, and I will be attending my kid's events/games many nights, even on 50% I don't have them.

Also, there are likely a higher percentage of bad apples, overall.  There are plenty of good reasons to not be married, but also plenty of people who are not married for good reason.  This isn't to say ""all the good ones are married"".... Just that more really bad ones aren't.

Making one more positive point though....I think technology does make dating easier/better.  Even if you don't like OLD (i have had no major issues), it's possible to see people on social media and do a public background check, of sorts.  Even reading stuff on this subreddit has been very helpful to me... Having a forum like this.  Tech has its ups and downs, but overall I'd take it rather than leave it.

Yeah, there are pros and cons to everything, but I read a lot of negativity on here and wanted to talk about the positive aspects of dating over 40.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/o8g04o/why_dating_is_better/
94,o8goof,1624733441,"Low stakes question: when someone messages you on OLD and you're not interested, do you respond?","Curious to hear what other people do. Most of the time I just don't respond and figure my lack of response is indication that I'm not interested. From time to time I will respond, usually something short and straightforward like ""I don't think we're a match but I wish you good luck in finding your person!""

&amp;#x200B;

Background: I received two messages this week from two different guys who are on opposite ends of the religion spectrum. One talks a lot about Buddhism on his profile and then says ""If you are Christian, I  would  love a detailed explanation as to why "" The second guy is clearly VERY religious and his profile ends with the sentence  ""I intend to get to know the right woman in love with God for one year before our first kiss."" 

&amp;#x200B;

Is it even worthwhile to respond to the messages they sent and say ""hey thanks, but I suspect we are not a match"" or just don't respond and assume that's that? I do believe in God, have my own faith, but both of these people seem to be a poor match for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is not anything I'm ruminating on, more curious how you are approaching it and if you've had good luck or bad luck with either approach.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/o8goof/low_stakes_question_when_someone_messages_you_on/

97,o8jy9d,1624744613,Lying about age and old photos in profile.. I am frustrated!,"First time posting here. I am 47YF. I just had a 30-min ice cream date with a guy claiming 48yo who looked at least 10 years older than his profile pictures, looking like in his late 50s or early 60s. I usually stay for at least an hour even if I am not attracted to the person but I really didn’t want this time, meaninglessly making reluctant conversation. Since it was an impromptu meetup and I had my kids at home, he understood that I could leave whenever I needed. 
I don’t date people over 50s and dishonesty is no no for me. I met about 2-3 people who looked a few years older than his pictures but not this much discrepancy. 

I couldn’t confront him just in case… what if he’s really his claiming age and looks aged because of his rough life path?

98,o8mply,1624754510,"if you don't love me now, you might never love me","Hey, after some advice. I know the ""adult"" thing to do is just to have this conversation with my partner, and I fully intend to, but I guess I really need to sound this out before I take the plunge:

I've been seeing this amazing guy for nearly seven months. We have a great connection - emotionally &amp; psychically. We laugh a lot and have so much fun together. Even just sitting on the couch on a Saturday night is a blast. The sex is great. We've met each others friends, workmates, families. Spent weekends away together. There's even been a bit of talk about moving in together (he intimated that). He tells me that i'm beautiful; smart; funny; that he loves my company. We've yet to have an argument. I know, that sounds like a red flag, and we've had disagreements, but we just seem to work things out before things escalate. Basically everything is great except - no ""i love you"".

We're both a bit ""broken"". He has a string of failed relationships &amp; women walking out on him. My ex cheated. When we started dating, I made it clear that I wanted to take things slow. He's been so respectful of that &amp; I really feel like he's the first guy who has genuinely tried to get to know me. There was no pressure, the relationship just unfolded at a beautiful pace. We only see each other perhaps once or twice a week, but that's due to conflicting work schedules. 

I know that I love him and I guess that's why I've been feeling anxious lately. My ex never told me that he loved me. Not once in the 5 years that we were together. When I told him that I loved him, it was not reciprocated. In the end, i'm pretty sure he never really did love me. He just loved my company. So that's left me feeling really afraid of being vulnerable and letting this guy how I feel. 

There have been moments when I've felt the words have been on the tip of his tongue, when he's stared into my eyes, and smiled, just not saying a word. And he makes me FEEL loved all the time. But words mean so much to me and I can never be in a relationship again where I am not told that I am loved, so I need to hear it. I haven't told him the issues with my ex, so he has no idea of how much of a big deal it is for me to hear him tell me how he feels. 

My question is - do you think I should just ask him, straight up, if he loves me? Because I feel that if he doesn't love me now, he probably never will, and if that's the case, then I want to stop seeing him and save myself the pain. I can't go through that trauma again. 

How would you feel if a woman you had been dating for 7 months suddenly put you on the spot like that? We're coming up to our 7 month mark this weekend, so I was thinking of asking him how he felt about us; about me; and whether he sees me in his future or not.  I'm just not sure how to frame it, without putting him in a position where he feels obligated to say it, then not mean it, if that makes any sense? 

Any advice, insight, anecdotes would be appreciated. I'm tired of feeling anxious about this, so I want to have this conversation at the weekend. I'll update the post and let you know how it goes. 

Thanks in advance.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/o8mply/if_you_dont_love_me_now_you_might_never_love_me/
99,o8qc4a,1624769369,Venting....so irritated,"Bf and I are right at the 6 month mark. We have just recently said the 3 little words and things have gotten deeper overall.

My kids and I just got back from a week with my parents. My kids talked BF up the whole time. 

I have kept my mother at arms length with this relationship because she is frankly nosy. This guy felt different from the start and I didn't want her prying for info so it was kind of need to know basis. 

Anyway....she had the nerve to message my BF in FB and tell him that the kids like him and how he is good for me yadda yadda. Then-and this is what gets me-proceeds to tell him that my grandmother had a FWB/BF/'Travelling companion' for many years but she had her house and he had his. Its true but WTF? The more I think about it, it was a backhanded way of saying he can never move in with us. Not that we are even in that realm of discussion. 

He was a little confused,  but was polite to her. I said don't respond to her messages. 

My kids went through a horrible abuse situation with their father and I have custody.  I understand that they are protective of the kids, but BF is well aware of the situation and we have gone slow because of them. This just seems like a boundary that she should not have crossed.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/o8qc4a/ventingso_irritated/
