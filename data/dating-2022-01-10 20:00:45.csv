0,s11a0c,1641866603,Red flag?,So I’ve been dating this guys for a few months now we call and text maybe like every 2 or 3 days or so. We do Hang out so it seems like things are going well. But something that he does really bothers me it’s like whenever I call him he never answers but of course when he calls me I answer or call back. He doesn’t even try to call back so it’s like I can never reach him until he calls me back a few days later. Idk if I’m overthinking things. It’s just kind of weird to me. I can nit pick things because I’ve been in a bad relationship and just don’t want to get put through something that I could of prevented if I recognized the signs in the beginning. I did tell him how I felt about it but all he said was that he’s just tired and sleeps a lot.,dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s11a0c/red_flag/
1,s11a80,1641866621,Am I expecting too much in terms of physical intimacy?,"I like how I look a lot and don’t feel like I’m lacking anything until I’m in the bedroom and my date/boyfriend isn’t touching me so much. I garner these deep connections. When I date the person I’m with is just the most incredible to me inside and out. We always connect well in terms of conversation and I find who I’m with the most handsome. 

The thing I’ve never really had anyone be too enthusiastic about touching me. I’m a very skinny girl, I have small breasts/butt. I’m healthy, workout, I do care for my appearance like grooming and clothes etc.
I’ve dated a bit but usually they say they like me because I’m sweet, intelligent, pretty, and have a great personality and what I have to offer is more special like my career, hobbies, being family oriented, etc. I don’t really need someone to feel sexy, but I also don’t need someone to make me feel like I’m not if that makes sense. 

In the past I’ve tried to please my partners but they either make fun of my body (which I leave) or are just not interested in me sexually and say they don’t think of me that way. Me having to ask a guy to touch me and him saying he doesn’t think of looking at me topless but that I’m nice is embarrassing. Or not wanting to touch me and getting angry saying they can prefer different body types (which I agree with preferences are fine) They leave on my clothes, no one holds me so much, etc. 

I ask to be touched and held but they say it’s what’s inside that matters more, that I’m fishing for compliments since I know I’m pretty, etc. After these sorts of events I find it hard to be nude in front of my partner anymore. Maybe I’m just really sensitive and I know it’s kind of dumb, but I’d like the man I’m with to find me sexy too. I don’t expect him to be overly enthusiastic about taking off my shirt or anything, just to at least be….interested?

Maybe that’s just in movies or tv or something though, I’m not sure if this actually exists? So many women struggle with finding someone who values them for the inside so I guess it does, I’ve never had anyone want me more than just being “pretty with a great personality.” I don’t want to be liked just for my looks, but the insults and disinterest are making me feel a bit nervous about dating


I don’t know if I’m expecting too much, like maybe I’m silly for wanting someone to find me desirable too since what’s inside a person is what is the most beautiful and important. Any feedback would be great, thank you


Tdlr: basically never had a man be too interested in me physically, even when I ask for affection. I get told I’m beautiful, smart, and nice personality and what I have to offer is more special. I want more intimacy in a relationship, but it's starting to feel impossible with my ""sort of look” and ""personality.” I feel a bit superficial and dirty, but I just want to be able to be intimate with who I date",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s11a80/am_i_expecting_too_much_in_terms_of_physical/

5,s11nxc,1641867783,My boyfriend and I (25F) ended things today and I feel like I’m drowning.,"It really fucking hurts. I feel like I’ve lost my best friend, my life partner, my soulmate. It feels like I’m dying. 

We ended things because he wants to raise his future kids muslim and said I would need to convert to Islam before we got married. He’s been up front about this since the beginning. I’m the idiot-agnostic-ex-christian with a toxic relationship with religion who fell for him anyway and let things run for as long as it did. I realized that after all the work I’ve put into myself in therapy to unravel all the toxic christianity i grew up with, I could never bring myself to converting to any religion again. But, fucking hell. I feel like I played myself here. We had such a genuine connection on every single level except this one. At one point I was really considering it and thought I could convert and still be happy with him. This is my second serious relationship, but for some reason this one is hitting way harder. It just feels like my insides are being ripped into pieces.

On top of all this, I had Covid over New Year’s and just got out of quarantine yesterday. My body has been so out of whack as I’ve been recovering—I’ve had insane hives and a rash all over my body the last couple days. Yesterday, I cut out dairy and gluten from my diet and the hives/rash went away almost immediately. Not sure if it’s related to Covid, but it’s really the cherry on top to have a sudden severe allergy preventing me from eating my feelings away.

7,s11pqh,1641867927,(20f) Girl might have unmatched me (19m) on bumble and it’s driving me crazy,"I’ve known this girl for a few months, we finally matched on bumble last Wednesday and ever since I responded to her by responding to what she said and complementing her bio, on Wednesday I haven’t heard back from her. So today I sent her one more message saying I’ve experienced issues with the app and didn’t want to miss any of her messages and asked if we could text instead. I checked back a little bit later on bumble and it seems like she unmatched with me and have no explanation beforehand. I want to know so bad what happened but I have a real bad feeling that I did something wrong but I don’t know what. I genuinely liked the girl and I think she had some interest in me considering we were friendly in person, she matched me with on the app, and even sent me a funny first message that seemed like she was excited we matched. The idea I had was to dm her on Instagram in order to find out what happened (even if she suddenly lost all interest in me). But I don’t want to be rude and make her feel uncomfortable. I may see her again in person but that won’t be until next week and I would hate to have to wait that long to find out the truth. There’s a chance bumble glitched out. So I don’t know what I should do since I really like her. I just want to know what happened.

I have spent two full weekends with him which again have been amazing however I did notice after the first weekend he was a little quiet a few days after (I.e not texting as much) I did bring this up and he opened up to me and told me he suffers with depression so hasn’t really wanted to talk etc.

I have been extremely supportive to him and he knows that and appreciates it, however I still can’t help feeling unwanted and this is now making me anxious which results in me moaning at him. The thing I have noticed is sometimes he won’t read my message for hours but will be online which makes me feel like I am not important to him anymore. I’ve spoken very openly with him and he apologised and doesn’t want me to feel like this.

I spent the weekend just gone with him and it was great however I noticed he was fidgeting a lot which he never used to, we went bowling and had a laugh then went back to his. I woke up to a message off him today and we exchanged a few texts then he goes silent again! I tried calling him on my way to work, he didn’t answer, didn’t reply to my messages but has been online! He knows this makes me feel unwanted (I’ve had this before so he knows I’m insecure) but I’m still not noticing a change. 

A week ago I told him I can’t keep feeling like this and he thought I ended it and he was upset, couldn’t sleep and kept ringing me and was gutted I wouldn’t talk to him so I don’t get why he is letting a situation happen again! If he didn’t keep communication all the time previously I wouldn’t have a problem but he used to constantly be on the phone and now he isn’t so it’s made me freak out.

13,s11xuk,1641868600,Dating and Mental Illness,"So first off I’m not in a place to start dating at the current moment, I have a couple things I’m currently working through. That being said, I don’t know how I feel about getting into dating again even when I am ready.

I’ve been dating on and off for almost 4 years. I was in a long term relationship for several years before that with someone who thought they could “fix” me. There’s one thing I’ve learned in that time: nobody wants someone who struggles with mental illness as much as I do.

For me personally, I struggle with severe anxiety and moderate depression. These things affect my life in a variety of ways, and they can all be worked around and overcome with time but it’s just been a real struggle. For example, I don’t drive because of my random panic attacks, and that alone seems to be a big deal, which I get on some level.

I’m not perfect, who is? But I like to think I look ok and that I’m a decent, thoughtful guy. But it feels like my mental health and the struggles that come with them cancel everything out. I get it, nobody wants to be in a position where they have to take care of someone or whatever, but I don’t need that. I don’t need, or even want, someone to take care of me. 

I just want someone who can accept these things, and support me when I need it, in the same way I’d accept and support them. But it feels like that person doesn’t exist. It feels like everyone either wants nothing to do with me, or feels like they have to fix me. 

So when I get over this little slump and I’m ready to get back into the dating world, why should I even bother? I just want someone to prove me wrong, to make me feel wanted, but the more I look the more convinced I am that I will never find that person.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s11xuk/dating_and_mental_illness/

I’ve tried dating over the past year or so, but I’ve gotten absolutely nowhere,and after asking a couple of friends, it’s apparently because many of them think I am only interested in men. Many people assume this because I am heavily involved with the arts and English, and, again ADHD, tend to be pretty high energy at times (additionally, I am built very thinly, am 5’9”, and have never managed to weigh more than 145 pounds, even with muscle). (Also, I’m aware that these are stupid and inaccurate stereotypes, which is why I’m looking for a little help.)


This doesn’t necessarily bother me, as I wouldn’t be entirely opposed to having a relationship with a man; it’s just that I wouldn’t necessarily actively pursue a relationship with a man, as I consider myself primarily straight for the most part. 


Even though it sounds pretty superficial, I was wondering if anyone here has had any similar experiences, and if so, had any advice on how to have a bit more of a presence with women past just being a friend or acquaintance?

Hi \_\_\_\_\_\_,

Happy Thursday :) I hope your day is going alright. 

I just wanted to say, like I said earlier this week, I had a great time getting to know you. You seem like a nice guy, and I hope I showed you everywhere you were hoping to see in the city of Nashville. Although I had a great time with you, I think we’re just incompatible in terms of what we’re both looking for. I was using Tinder in hopes of finding a long-term relationship, and that’s still what I’m looking for. I’m not exactly sure what you’re looking for. I’m sure you’re open to one, just not with me. And that’s okay. What we did on Saturday (\*\*oral, even though it was my first time doing it\*\*) probably sent the message that I was looking for a hookup anyway, so I’m sorry if I made you think that. I don’t want to force you to be interested in me. And I feel like I was doing that when I asked you to hang out this Friday, and messaging you. Your interest in me has seemed to wane a little bit, so I think we should just part ways. I wish you good luck in Nashville, and I hope you’re able to find what you’re looking for :)

Best,

""If you change your mind and want to hang out again, just let me know (upside-down smiley face).""

At first, I was happy to receive this text. But the ""if you change your mind"" part has me confused. If I change my mind about wanting to do hookups? Why would he think I would change my mind about maybe doing casual sex with him? Or does he mean if I change my mind about parting ways?

For context, I am a 27 year old man who has had a relatively successful dating career with two long-term, serious relationships. I am lucky to have a close group of friends in the city where I live, and feel valued by them.  I am enrolled in a fairly prestigious graduate program that occupies most of my time. 

I initiated the breakups with the two women I seriously dated (for different reasons). I’ve been single for over a year now, and haven’t been looking. My rationale for doing so is because I feel as though I am not the best version of myself yet. While on paper I have experienced academic, professional, and social success, there are many things about myself I dislike and am working on improving. 

For example, I have been working to stop relying upon substances (like alcohol and nicotine) as a crutch when feeling anxious. I am also not confident about my body image and have been working to improve this.

While several people who I find attractive have shown interest in me, I haven’t pursued any of them because I am afraid I will emotionally hurt them because I’m so in my head about self improvement and on some level I dislike myself. 

Is my desire to improve my faults a good reason to not date anyone at all? I am afraid that I will let someone amazing pass me by. Any advice is appreciated — thanks",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s12rab/i_27m_havent_been_dating_because_i_am_afraid_i_am/

I was about to say I wouldn't mind that but she quickly said JK before I could get a word out. We are meeting up to watch a specific movie and drink wine and have some homemade food I wiped up. I don't want to make a move and be wrong and mess up this friendship as it is the best new one I had in well over a decade.,dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s12tqj/i_am_unsure_if_this_woman_is_interested_in_me/

28,s12zje,1641871670,My dog keeps barking at the guy I'm talking to,"Som this is about more then just how my dog feels about him. 

So some backstory, im 25 tfm tans. He is 19 cis male. He is pretty mature for his age but is still has his moments of immaturity. We've only been talking for two days and yeah I kind of met him on grindr. And. He may be my baby mommas younger brothers best friend. And I may still live with my baby mammas family where her brother also lives. Its complicated. 

So every time my dog sees him, hears him, or smells him instantly the barking starts. It takes him about 15 to 20 minutes so settle down. I dont know if its because he's a new person or if its because of my bigger concern. Which is. Why I won't be dating this guy. He confenced he does meth. And I'm a no go. He's sitting on my bed rn. And he's tweeking I can see it. Its worrying because I did catch some sort or feelings. Or maybe he made me feel safe at first. Maybe he's going through withdrawals? I dont know. I'm going to speak to him about it but I had to get this out and ask how some others would deal with the situation or what you think I should do?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s12zje/my_dog_keeps_barking_at_the_guy_im_talking_to/
29,s12zp3,1641871682,What to make of this? Overly eager upcoming date.,"TL;DR- Overly flirty girl I matched with online, should I be worried or ecstatic? Catfish potential?

So I (age 30m) matched with (27f) on a dating app. 
I've never really dated in my life, so of course I'm fairly excited/naive/nervous in general.
Got her phone number and texted her, letting her know I'd ""give her a call sometime."" Trying to play it cool ya know.
I have a general idea of what to do to go on dates with dating app matches because of online research, but research is much different than IRL experience.

So the next night rolls around and I'm about to contact her, but she beats me to it &amp; texts me right before I could.
We begin chatting (via text) and she seems....oddly/intensely into me. I mean, we hit it off pretty good on the dating app, but phone texts were more intense.

She's responding with 😘 emojis/😍emojis and using exclamation points excessively. 
So I'm pretty happy with that, but I'm also somewhat....confused/concerned?
I know that may sound petty, but I've never had a total stranger act like that through texts.

Like, should I be concerned? 
I mean what are the odds she has delusional thoughts about me or she's catfishing?
Anyone else experience excessive flirting with someone they haven't met yet prior to meeting?

I decided to give her the benefit of the doubt and set up a date with her in a few days, but I can't shake the feeling something is up. It sounds too good to be true. She sounds real/authentic, but I'm still concerned that she's going to either look different from her pics or she has strange plans with me.

Maybe it's innocent, maybe she's just trying to seal the deal?

I have some anxiety issues (not on the level of panic attacks) and I think I should probably just work through stuff so I don't dump baggage on someone else. 

Thing is...I've been saying that to myself for years. Where is the line that lets me know I'm clear to have a relationship?

I'm pretty sure I'm extremely lonely, though I have trouble reading my own emotions sometimes. A part of me believes my last issue just stems from that loneliness. I try not to put romance on a weird pedestal, but the idea of being touched through hugs or just being close to someone makes me feel good in a way nothing else does. Maybe I'm just being ridiculous. Then again, I heard that psychology guy Jordan Peterson say that sensitive people need to be in intimate relationships or they ""die"". 

I know some people will just tell me I should focus on myself more and once I'm over being lonely then I'm mature enough to date. But how do I know that's the right advice for me?

44,s14djt,1641875997,Dating for the first time in 15 years,"Hey everyone


As the title states I (34f) am dating for the first time I'm 15 years. I left an emotionally and physically abusive marriage. I loved him so very deeply, so much so I didn't realize what was actually happening. We sign papers in a few months and its done. We separated April 2020. 

Since then I had like a little fling with a guy and it was just fun no strings attached company for us both. I would also like to point out I married the first man I dated. So my experience is only him. 

Last week I went into a pub to get a drink as my kids were with my ex. I sat down at the bar and I saw him. He smiled said hello, asked whst brought me in I said awful baby daddy. He said he had an awful baby mama, asked if I wanted to come sit with him. So I first was going to say I'm good but he was so cute and I thought why not engage in some flirting I'm not married anymore. He was sweet, kind, and respectful. Asked if I wanted his number I said yeah and he filled it in and sent a text. 

That night he messaged saying it was great meeting me. He asked if he could take me out. I said sure and we went out like 2 days later, we text the entire time. 

We went out, drank laughed talked got to know each other. He asked if I wanted to watch a movie at his place. I said I would love to. He was respectful we made out lol I felt like a teenager and it also kind of freaked me out. He's the complete opposite of what my ex was, he is someone who would be great to date, great to be around but like I'm not ready for that yet. 

Now since then we have seen each other again. Didn't sleep together, made out again. He just kept complimenting me and he was so gentle and kind. It also turns out he works with my friend. So I asked her if he's someone who sleeps around. I was also convinced he couldn't genuinely be that nice. 

I'm feeling overwhelmed. From his feelings and how into me he is (which is insane to me anyways) and now my feelings that are being formed around him. It's tripping me out and makes me want to pull completely back.

I don’t want him to label himself as something else just because he wants to be with me, but also the fact that he’s considered himself straight his whole life and still might consider himself straight makes me constantly invalidate our relationship in my mind.

53,s155uo,1641878566,(19f) I have finally deleted my dating apps after almost two years,"I’m 19 years old I never been in a relationship before i always been quiet and not outgoing. I decided to give dating apps such as bumble ,tinder and hinge a go in the hopes I can find someone I can connect with. I went out on multiple first dates that led to no where. I’m just going to list my experiences with these men to make it easier to understand.
1. First person I met on tinder I had zero experience around dating or even speaking to guys in general. At the start it was normal we were just getting to know each other after a few days he started being very sexual through text which I didn’t like I told him that but he ignored me. He started to call me while his wanking off and he started to beg me for nudes like none stop. When I said I won’t sent him nudes he hanged up the phone on me and I remember crying thinking to myself why was he treating me like that that I thought I’m not worthy enough to date. He said if I send him naked pics that he will be happy and pressured me into sending him nudes. I felt so disgusted in myself. Please keep in mind I don’t have any friends that I would tell this too and with that no prior experience with men I didn’t know any better I was stupid. He took me out on a drive at night and he parked in McDonald’s parking lot where he went on top of me and kissed me. That was my first kiss I regret it deeply I thought he cared about me. He kept pushing my boundaries and I thought because he wants to date me and I quite liked the guy. At the time he used to message me saying things like “things are not going to workout because you are not sending me nudes or doing anything sexual with me” which made feel like I’m not normal back then I didn’t know any better. On the second meeting he forced me to give him oral sex he finished in my mouth I wanted to pull away but he pushed my head down. That night I went home feeling worthless and I self harmed for the first time after being clean for 5 years I felt guilty for what has happened. He could constantly message me playing with my feelings promising me false hope. After months I blocked him after understood what’s going on. 
2.second guy I met on tinder was a complete weirdo. On the first date he put romantic Music and was kissing my hand the whole car ride on the first date. We had a coffee date and at the end in the parking lot he went on one knee and proposed to me to become his girlfriend. He gave me flowers and chocolate. For the first date he was a walking red flag. I went home and messaged him saying that I’m not interested he got pissed off and started insulting me calling me fat and brought up my childhood trauma saying I deserve everything that happened to me. He didn’t understand how strong he came on me it creeped me out. I blocked him straight away.
3.Third guy I met was a very quiet person and we got along really well. He was very respectful of my boundaries and was a pretty chill guy. We went out on three dates after that he started to be distanced and I started to feel suspicious. I confronted him and he made up excuses that his busy that’s why he wouldn’t call or FaceTime. He started acting very unusual from calling four times a day to nothing. Two months of arguing,crying and blaming myself for not being good enough. I made a fake Insta account and searched up his name. Turns out he been in a relationship for three years I knew from his bio. 
I confronted him and all he has to say is “I don’t even know you”.  All those emotions and wasted nights talking to him went down the drain I meant nothing to him. 
4.Fourth guy I met on hinge we got along so well we shared many interests and he was so fun to be around. I liked him actually but he wasn’t ready for a relationship after dragging me for months. He was still not over his ex of six years. He was emotionally unavailable. He would not talk to me for days and when I spoke up about it he said that I’m clingy. I stopped talking to him because he doesn’t put effort. 5.Fifth guy was from tinder we spoke for like a week. I told him that I don’t want to rush in getting physically intimate and I told him I’m waiting until marriage to have vaginal sex which he didn’t have a problem with. The topic came up and I wanted to let him know just in case that doesn’t suit him so he would stop talking to me. He I was supportive my Discission over the phone but when we met he wasn’t too happy when I didn’t want to take thing further. He messaged me saying he can’t be with someone who doesn’t give him sex. I told him before we even met in real life but I guess he thought that he will change my mind. I stopped talking to him straight away.

57,s15yrd,1641881272,Why would a guy I am dating stop flirting over text all of a sudden?,"I have noticed within the past few days, the guy I’m dating hasn’t been reciprocative when I flirt with him over text message. He also has been taking a very long time to respond which is not like him. He’s always on his phone. He used to always be the one to flirt, complement, send pictures and come up with witty remarks. And of course I would respond positively. But now as of the last few days, it’s super dry and he takes hours to respond. He says he doesn’t feel well and has been busy with work. 

We recently agreed to be exclusive, which I think could be the reasoning for him pulling back… Also we’re now in different cities as I went back to school, so we’re not going to be seeing each other in person soon or else I’d bring it up in person. But we had agreed to continue to date long distance. Do you think the change in his texting habits is worth bringing up?

The week before Christmas, I went out to a bar with some friends. We ended up meeting with some of my friends’ friends that I haven’t met before. I started talking to this guy in that group and we really hit it off. When it started to get later in the night, we broke away from everyone and spent hours talking just the two of us. We left at the same time, made out in his car, and went back to his place to have sex. I spent the night. He took me back to my car the next morning. We didn’t exchange numbers, but we followed each other on IG. I haven’t heard much from him since, but we’ve responded to each other’s IG stories a few times (I reached out first after the night we spent together). So nothing beyond light chatting. He always looks at my IG stories whenever I post one. 

I really have no expectations of this going anywhere serious, but I thought he was really cool and I’d definitely like to hang out with him again. I kind of get the feeling like he may not be interested in me or that he views it as just a one night thing. Should I try to make plans with him?

  I’ve been talking to someone for a few weeks and he invited me to play video games. I counter offered with meeting at an arcade and he agreed. 

  The day before, he checked in to see if we were still good for meeting up and I said yes. Well, on the day of our meetup, he messaged me saying something came up and he couldn’t make it. He said he was sorry and maybe we could try another day. 

  I think he could have punked out and had anxiety about meeting up with someone new. I get that. But I am getting really f*cking sick and tired of being disappointed. 

  I used to be the type of person to give someone a benefit of a doubt and give them another chance. Unfortunately, I learned that only gives someone the opportunity to make you regret that choice. I’m tired of being a nice guy. 

  I was a nice guy my whole life and been the type to take action and put my heart on the line over and over again. Well, you know what? I want to be an asshole now and not give a damn about anyone else’s feeling because there is no room in this world for a nice guy to be. Im done.

Dating apps are not designed merely for finding something serious. If you don’t state in your profile clearly what you are looking for, don’t get mad when you match with people who are not looking for the same thing as you.

I know it may sound like intimidating to be straightforward ‘looking for something serious’ but trust me, there are so many people who are frustrated by now to not find anything serious on dating apps who are going to be excited to see that text in your bio.

76,s17o9x,1641887598,I (M22) feel really hard for a new friend (F23) who then proceeded to come out to me unexpectedly,"
I (M22) recently met someone (F23) in my building while grabbing our bikes to go on separate rides. I casually asked where she rode, she suggested a few trails, and we hit it off.  A few weeks later, after asking her to go on a ride, I learned that we have a lot in common. We both recently graduated college and moved to a new city. In our conversations, it became we both like a lot of the same things (music genres, art, cycling, etc.), share many of the same values, and recently left long-term relationships due to long distance. We started hanging out more often and texting regularly, and I slowly started to fall for her and it was clear she enjoyed chatting with me too. 

A few days later, I invited her to pregame with my friends at my apt. Later that night, we go out to a new club with the other pregame attendees and have a wonderful time — buying drinks for each other, dancing like no one was watching (but not suggestively with each other), and generally enjoying each other's company. We interacted as if there was no one else was around and it was just us getting lost in each other. 

Then, all of a sudden, she turns to me and says she wants to tell me something. She tells me that she recently realized that she’s a lesbian but previously considered herself bi. Prior to this moment, we hadn’t really talked about our sexuality outside of mentioning our past partners of the opposite sex. This came as a shock to me, but it felt really special that she felt comfortable enough to share a new and personal revelation like that with me, and I told her that. We continued dancing and enjoying ourselves. We later left the group and went to a small dive bar for drinks and shared more conversation. We eventually got back to our apartment complex where she invites me up to her place to smoke. We smoke and chat until the early morning when I eventually leave. It was an incredibly memorable night. The next morning we exchange texts about how much we enjoyed the night and already started making plans to spend more time 1on1. Although I’m incredibly happy to have a wonderful new friend in a new city, I can’t help but find it difficult to let go of the strong feelings I had been developing for her. It has only been a few days so we haven’t talked more about her sexuality or why she decided to come out to me in that moment. I respect her sexuality and adore her friendship, but I’m friend-crushing (and generally crushing) really hard and I don’t know how to make sense out of my feelings or hers for that matter.

I am very attracted to this person and I think he is as well to me :)

I looked online but it did only made me worry about things I didn't even think of before: mainly, if they are in a dedicated relationship they might miss being intimate with the other sex, so they often want an open relationship. Isn't this a stupid generalization? I found it on so many forums it kind of shocked me.

Open relationships are a big no for me anyway.

This guy told me right away he was bi which I really appreciate. If he didn't tell me I wouldn't have known, he is quite masculine and does not have any of those gay-ish sterotypes, like being feminine (sorry if that sounds insensitive or stupid).

I think most of his friends and some of his family know as well. I believe his last relationship was with a man and I am not sure if he ever had a relationship with a woman.

We went for what I remember as being one of the longest first dates, 9 hours straight. It felt so good.

Next day, not so...

So next date I went to see her again, and we started talking and I started joking. I started talking about my friendship of 10 years with a female friend, and that she has issues being attracted for/dating guys that are out of law.

That's the moment when she said something like ""Are you afraid for yourself and your son because of that"". I was like seriously. I am not dating these guys, she is. In 10 years of friendship with my friend, I never ever had even one single contact with any of her guys. I was just trying to support her to move away from emotionally unavailable people.

And then she said ""**These kind of friendships are unacceptable for me that you have**"" is the sentence where I really lost interest. It broke all in just one sentence, I lost any interest in dating her and felt so sad.

Idk, where she got an idea that you should investigate every single person I have befriended with, and decide whether you are gonna date me, based on my friends personal lives. But she indeed confirmed to me that she would not be friend to someone who has friends of that kind. And it was just a casual talk, nothing that I expected to be something serious.

I am feeling confused, sad, disappointed... I really don't have an idea whether I am overreacting, but for me this really seems like a red flag.

84,s1938s,1641893447,"Boyfriend (22M) developed feelings for another girl while we were ""on break"". Now he wants to get back together","We've been dating for 3 years, and went on a break a month ago. We never discussed any rules or whatsoever, such as agreeing not to see other people - but I knew I wasn't going to anyway. He initiated the break because we weren't spending enough time together, and I wasn't doing enough for the relationship. I admit now that I wasn't there to support him through tough times and when he had his anxieties - even though he was there to support me through all of mine. We've only met up a few times in the past 6 months and I started texting him less frequently because I had my own issues to work on, and didnt want to go out so often because of covid. I admit that I definitely should have put more effort into our relationship, I didnt even show up for his 21st birthday, and there's plenty more that I should've done to be a better girlfriend overall.

Just few days ago, he came clean and confessed that he caught feelings for a coworker that just joined his workplace, 2 weeks after we went on break. He felt really guilty about it and wanted to make things right. They've gone out for after-work drinks almost every day and date-like activities (movie, art exhibition, brunches) all while we were taking a break. He's kissed her a few times, they made out and he's confessed his feelings towards her. He even got her a film camera and brought her to some fancy cinema for Christmas. He told me he would fetch her home, get her snacks at work and even give her his favorite hoodies. All in a matter of 3 weeks.

Thing is, I know he wouldn't just fuck around with any girl without actually having feelings for them. He's a virgin (if that matters) and doesn't have much experience in relationships, so I know it was more than just sex. They don't even work in the same department, which meant he went out of his way to talk to her and show interest. Also she's moving abroad in two months for uni.. so Im wondering if this is one of the reasons why he's coming back now too.

Before confessing all of this to me, he texted me regarding the issues in our relationship and I told him I was willing to fix things and spend more time together. But after hearing all of this, I don't know how to feel anymore. He wants to give me a second chance and make our relationship work this time, but after everything that's happened with him and this co-worker, I don't know how to feel anymore. Yes I realize that we never agreed upon not seeing other people during the break, but it still hurts.

I'm not sure where to go from here - should I continue working on our relationship or should I just let him go at this point? I guess someone can have feelings for two people at one time.. but if he fell for her, does he really still have feelings for me.. or am I just being delusional? I know it's my mistake for not putting in enough effort into our relationship, and not being there at times when he needed me the most. And since their relationship only lasted for 3 weeks, should I just forgive him for this?

TLDR; Boyfriend (22M) developed feelings for another girl while we were ""on break"". Now he wants to get back together. While we didn't agree to not see other people, I'm not sure if he can still have feelings for me after developing feelings for someone else..",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s1938s/boyfriend_22m_developed_feelings_for_another_girl/

We live in the same college town and we're both students. She asked me to pick her up and we go back to my place. We start watching a movie but ended up having sex after about 5/10 mins, initiated by her. She then starts cuddling with me, which was very nice and intimate, and go to sleep. Throughout the night we wake up and have sex three other times. The morning after we talked a little, and I asked some questions about her and she was always engaged in the conversation. I assess whether she might be interested in seeing me again by asking her if she wanted to get something to drink or eat. She nicely refused, and so I tried to keep my distance a little. I then drove her back home. When she got out of the car, her demeanor changed, and she looked at me in the eyes in silence for about 5 seconds -a long time!- with a confused/surprised expression, while I was still sitting in my car. I did not know what to do, so I stared back until I thanked her and she went back to her place. I then texted her on Tinder thanking her again and I gave her my snap. She liked my message and added me on snap.

However after this, she ghosted me, and she never responded to my texts -my follow up message was ""what are you up to?""-, or talked to me when I saw her around my college town. So I just would like to ask whether this might have to do with her just wanting a one night stand, or me being cold and distant when I dropped her off at her place, therefore the surprised expression she had when she got out of the car? If it's the latter, I would feel really bad, because I actually liked that girl and tried to keep distance only to not make her uncomfortable. Not knowing what happened made me very sad, as I wish I could have been more engaged and attentive with her. If it's the former, I might just be overthinking this. Please let me know your thoughts, thanks! ps hook up culture is common in my college town.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s197qx/tinder_meet_up_did_i_do_something_wrong/
86,s19bnr,1641894478,Dating is 10x harder for those of us who may not be as sexual as most people.,"I’m 22 F and I’m ready to quit honestly. Nothing seems to work for the majority of us. I don’t feel comfortable experimenting sexually too early because I’ve been used several times, but that can happen after several months as well. I want to be able to enjoy sex with a partner but not be pressured to do things on their timing. I never liked sex in the past and I believe an emotional connection would change my attitude towards it, but I can’t get that. It’s like everyone expects you to be super sexual automatically and if you’re not then bye. I’m very curious as to where people find caring partners because I don’t run into that.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s19bnr/dating_is_10x_harder_for_those_of_us_who_may_not/

However, at work, some girl had started flirting with me, but she already has a boyfriend. Today she had just told me she still loves me as not even just a friend, but she wants to be shared and her boyfriend is accepting of such. This really had me thinking...

""what in the actual \*\*\*\* is wrong with our generation...:

Are you telling me now that sharing partners is okay? Sharing someone that is to have children with ONLY YOU is ok? Sharing someone that will be on your side and does personal things is ok? Are you telling me that any of this is okay?? You know, before hand I was so desperate to date someone but now as I think of it, this really hit the bottom of the barrel for me, I do not even know if I even want to date anyone anymore. This is very strange that there are couples out there where one of them is actually okay with being shared, and the other is accepting. This person is likely to be with you for the end of your life, help you forever, you help them forever, you have a personal family with them, and now it is okay to share them.

88,s1a0x4,1641897361,Is it common for women to approach men on dating apps?,"I (26F) decided to join dating apps after a friend convinced me that with a hectic work life, that might be the only way to meet new people. However, as someone who doesn’t even use social media (except for Reddit), the idea of putting myself out there scares me. 

Anyway, after more convincing I decided to take the plunge. I get some matches but hardly any texts. A friend told me that that quite a lot of guys just swipe right on most profiles and only if there’s a match, they may text the other person.

I know I’m no oil painting. My looks have been the subject of school yard jokes in the past so I’m quite self-conscious. Perhaps that’s why I don’t get many texts.

I am contemplating to be the one who initiates texts but I’m afraid that it come off as desperate",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s1a0x4/is_it_common_for_women_to_approach_men_on_dating/
89,s1a23q,1641897504,I love you but i just feel better not being in a relationship,"So im (15M) and i was dating this girl in my class (15 F) for about 2 months then once she talked about how her life is entirely fucked and that she wants to start a new page and cut out everyone from her life, i told her to take her time and think about it.
Then i catched a cold and couldn't go to highschool 
A day later she said she decided to keep me cause she still loves me even tho relationships make her 
Kinda weak and insecure , however i told her to take more time and think of it but she said it was her desicion she aint gonna change it , about 4 days she was comlaining about bois in the class bullying her so i decided to go to school even tho i was still very sick , so i went there sat next to her but it was silent 
We were both shy ig not knowing how its gonna go now, at some point thoes bois started bullying her again and throwing school furnitures at her so i called one of them to give him a pen he just threw , then grabed him arm pulled him and slapped him... twice.
But she was like no just stop you dont have to.
Then after that clasa ended there was a 15 mim break where she pulled me away from the croud and said : 
So first of all im sorry, for hurting you , for breaking your heart ( since she always use to prank me saying she got raped or kidnapped or sick or dying etc...)

No its nothing , i replyed.
Then she said  we gotta take differents paths we gotta end this.
I replyed huh what no you said you wont cut me off 
She said i tough it trough and its the best option for both of us.
I slowely asked : so is this it ? Your leaving me now?

Yes, she relpyed.

I asked : what happend to i will love you for ever and till eternity.
She replyed : i didn't think i would fall out of love, are you gonna be fine tho im really sorry.

Couldn't speak and trying to hide tears: no its fine im gonna be just fine you can go, be happy.

i turned around to look the opposite direction, wheni felt her hand on my shoulder , she said sorry then she went back to class. 
After that day we spoke on whatsapp where i was doing all i could to just prevent that but it was usless.

At the end i told her i would change entirely since i tought it was probably my fault. 

So i changed everything ive done and reseted my phone and everything. 

After 2 weeks of not seeing her at all cuz  just stayed home i reinstalled whatsapp and when i open it seconds later she send me:
Hi 
:/
She didnt knew i still had whatsapp and she tough i blocked her , i replyed saying that i miss her , then she asker to be friends again like way before so i accepted , then we kept talking everyday as friends but yesterday she asked if i was still gonna buy her ""Pringles"" and i said yes adding that i keep promises 
A few minutes of silence after that she send me;

""Just so you yk ( even tho i didn't wanna tell you this)
I still love you , i just feel better not being in arelationship.

Now im still confused and i have no idea what to do i really love this girl and it was the best time with her and i could never find anyone better than her.

Instead of seeing me when I got back he went out partying u til 7 am. He has apologised but my gut is telling me that if this is happening during the early stages of dating then it will only become worse later down the line?

Hope you all are doing good in dating life 🤷‍♂️💪
So I was wondering to hear your opinions- maybe from your own experience. I am M30 and living with flat mates. In total there are 4 rooms where somebody is living and we share one kitchen and bathroom.
I was thinking about downloading dating app but the fact I live in shared flat keeps me changing my mind. I dont think I would like to take girl back to “my” place. What would potential female friend think if a guy in his 30s lives in shared flat? At some point I will change the place to my own but in the mean time- should I really stop thinking about dating life?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s1b374/dating_when_living_with_flatmates/

She agreed and we were supposed to meet earlier today but she texted me about an hour before we had to meet, saying she had a meeting she had to attend and wouldn't be able to make it for dinner. I told her it wasn't a big deal and that she could just let me know when she's free next for dinner. So far I have yet to receive a reply. I had an inkling that she was not interested in me at all in the first place (because of the super slow text responses) but I totally did not expect her to be the type of person to flake.
I know I should at least give her the benefit of the doubt but I just feel really shitty like I am not worth any person's time. I am a very perssimistic guy especially when it comes to dating. I would have really preferred if she just straight up told me that she wasn't interested so that I could begin the healing process early.
