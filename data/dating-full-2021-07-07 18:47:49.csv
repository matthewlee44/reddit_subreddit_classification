I'm confused about a guy (M24).

Met on an app. He's charming as hell. We had an INCREDIBLE first date. It was spontaneous, fun, and he's easy to talk to. The way he flirts, how masculine he is..everything about him is honestly fkn lovely. 

With the exception of an impromptu dare from my end - amost immediately for the following two dates (each Friday or Saturday) he would ask me almost right after for my availability for the following thing.

Then he shifted into a new job, and he's full time in school. I know he's super disciplined (which I heavily admire). His weeks are pretty busy - for the impromptu thing he came to see me after working 17 hours straight.

Then things felt dwindling a bit, we still had wonderful dates but I barely heard from him. I began needing to be the one to confirm things that we had discussed. I began to get left on read and forgotten to responded to. Sometimes we've preplanned that we will do things in the next week but idk. Mind you though whenever we meet our physical chemistry is off the charts. We are both incredibly affectionate. The sex is the best I've ever had.

Over the course of 6 weeks, we have had 7 dates and have spent roughly 70 hours together (including 3 sleepovers). I'm not sure how much I'm supposed to chase or take initiative. I don't want him to think that since he sees me falling for him that he gets to stop. We will talk about doing things like beach camping, and baking bread and how we will just ""add it to the list"".

My brain is jumbled. Last weekend I saw he recently changed his Tinder bio and I felt bummed even though I know logically he doesn't owe me anything. I know logically that he isn't mine, we aren't exclusive. It still hurt though. I just began enjoying his company so much that all the other guys slipped away.

Getting replies is nice, and I deserve to feel prioritized (not necessarily #1 but up there). At the same time, I am not someone who will settle for less than the effort she deserves. With the minimal replies and stuff it doesn't always feel 50/50. However when we are together we have oxytocin screaming through our veins.

- keep it to an hour, 1:15 max.  You can’t dump 50 songs in- that’s not a list but a library. And this is what makes it hard. Tapes often were 90 minutes but that was when it was easier to stay in someone’s player over time.
- song titles &amp; lyrics matter, but one song about a breakup doesn’t buzzkill if it works for other reasons
- but segue and tempo evolution matter too - the thing should take you somewhere and that only happens with the mix
- the songs might be almost comprise some movie soundtrack, depicting story from end to beginning
- on Spotify you can customize the playlist square art image - do it!
- don’t jump the gun just because you visualize a world you want to be

I really need some help on this situation. (But please only if you have real advice on what else to do, not “let her go and move on”. We hear that enough. So please don’t even bother. Also, going no contact and pulling away only works if the girl is already moderate to high interest in you). I might post this a few times if I can so more people can see it, especially if someone is in a similar situation and needs help too. 

I’ve been watching so many dating advice videos to help me as well but wanted to talk to some people in the real world too. 

Here’s my situation 
- I’m 21, she’s 21
- I have an anxious attachment style, which is the worst style for a guy to have. I have the worst personality traits for a guy - insecurity, neediness, jealousy and responsiveness. Although dating videos have helped me realize I need to cut that out
- I try talking to other girls, but there’s this girl I really like. She was my first kiss and  everything so I’m clearly very attached to her
-  We spent a summer together 2 years ago. Things were going great. She was really into me. I got insecure and said and did things I shouldn’t have. Turned her off and I later recovered a bit, but it had been off and on until early 2020 when I REALLY turned her off.
- My anxiety kicked in to overdrive and I opened up to her emotionally about my anxiety, hoping she would understand why I did what I did. That was a huge mistake. She said she needed space for a while
- We talked a little last summer, but she started to ghost me and we were in no contact for almost a year. I reached out twice and she ignored both times.
- I reached out early June and we started talking again. To my surprise she was much more receptive. Using lots of emojis, replying within hours rather than days, longer texts, questions and those things. 
- I asked her to meet up and she said yes she would, BUT - she’s in another country and doesn’t know when she’s coming back. 
- This makes my situation difficult. I can’t text just to set up dates and see her in person. 

That’s where I’m at now. We banter and tease when we talk, but she hasn’t flirted back the way I want her to. So I’m very disappointed and feeling friend-zoned. She’s also starting to take longer to reply to my texts. She’s flat out ignoring me. I pray that it’s just her testing me to see if I’m more confident now, but afraid it really just means no more interest. She’s done this in the past and things turned out fine but I’m just afraid it’s different this time.

He messages me everyday and while some people love that, I dont. I dont even message my friends every other day. I've expressed this to him  but he'll still message me, I just end up ignoring it but then he'll ask if I was upset and what not

I really connected with him at the beginning, even now we share alot of similarities.  I dont want to just cut him off but also it's getting really annoying how insecure he's being, he doesnt have a back bone. 
I tried to bring it up in a nice way but he thinks he doesnt do it very often and it's something he's working on. 
He's expressed he hasn't been in a relationship in a very long time and I'm pretty sure the reason why 

I dont know, I've also dealt with being insecure myself but obviously everyone expresses themselves differently.  I feel like I deal with it in a more appropriate way, like if I unsure about something I'll ask someone once and then drop it , theres no need to keep asking.

So I’m a 25M, who recently got set up with 26F by a mutual friend. My friend suggested we would be a good match, so she chatted to her friend and asked if she would be keen - she said yes. I got her number and we organised to grab a drink after work.

Date 1 (Thursday)- we had a drink, then another. The conversation and banter was flowing perfectly, and we both seemed to be enjoying each other’s company. We then had dinner, then headed off - we held hands as we walked, hugged it out, and I told her I had a great time and that I’d like
to see her again - she said she felt the same. We pencilled in Sunday evening, as she hadn’t solidified plans with her brother/parents visiting on the weekend. I texted her when I got home that I had a good time and she texted the same.

The next day (Friday), I texted her at around 4pm to see how her day was going, and that I had a fun idea for Sunay evening. She responded and said that her family hadn’t finalised organising their plans but will let me know as soon as she hears, but otherwise offered to see me early in the week. I responded by saying thats fine and to let
me know.

The next night (Saturday), she reached out and apologised for getting to me late, and offered Tuesday/Wednesday to see me. I went with Wednesday, and we shared a few small messages to confirm the time. We briefly talked about our weekend the next day/Monday (literally 3-4 messages between us). 

I texted her Tuesday night to confirm our date - she confirmed and asked what we should do. I said lets have a go at mini golf and grab dinner after. She said she recently went mini golf, but was happy to do just a dinner. We settled on a place and that was that.

Date 2 (Wednesday)

We met at the restaurant and got right into it. The conversation picked up, we bantered and teased each other. We joked about not overordering food as we did last time. But I was excessively tired, and started feeling that with her texting patterns and general behaviours, maybe she’s not the right fit? This worked in my favour as I lost the nerves and behaved how I normally would. I teased her a bit more, asked great questions and she was digging it. I then suggested going for a walk, although it was super cold outside, so she lazily said we shouldn’t. That become a joke and we started teasing each other over it. 2 hours in, she said she should head home - we both work similar jobs and needed to prep for the next day. We joked about me wanting to go for a walk, and her wanting to be warm a bit more, and she just became super giggly and shy. I then thought I might as well try, and asked whether she could sneak away some time to come hang with me and meet my dog over the weekend, as she owes me a walk, and we could grab a bite. She immediately said yes she would love to. We began discussing when, and she said she will message me to confirm. We then joked about how when girls say ‘I’ll let you know’ and never text, and how I was surprised she did message me on the weekend - we both laughed and she said she would definitely message me. We then walked out, she was again very awkward and giggly, we hugged it out and went on our ways. 

I got home and again messaged her to say I had fun, called her a weirdo but was looking forward to seeing her again. She responded simply with an enthusiastic ‘Yeah I had fun too’, and I left it there.

I’m so confused at the moment because when in person, we have a great time and I see her opening up more over time (granted I’m a direct/forward person which she seemed to appreciate). But the whole ‘I’ll message you’ thing leaves me on edge, and her texting style also seems to suggest a lack of interest. At the same time, she’s mature and easygoing - my
friend said she’s not the type to ghost or waste time, and would have told me if she wasn’t
feeling it by now (keep in mind she drove into the city for 30 mins to see me).

Any advice on how to navigate this? I don’t plan on messaging her again maybe until Saturday (unless I hear from her). Thoughts?

A girl I'm romantically interested in but also good friends with said yes to me asking her out only to come up with an excuse later on to not go. I thought she brought up her work schedule to find possible dates in which we could go out. I mentioned possible dates that work based on my work schedule and was waiting for her to do the same. But even after we ran into each other in person and she said her work schedule for next week was out, she didn't say anything about possible days that work for her even though she said she would update me.

After that, I kind of came to the conclusion that she never wanted to go out and said yes only to be nice and only mentioned her work schedule as a method of avoiding the date even though she initially framed it as something to find possible free days.

Look, I get it, if you're friends with a guy but you suspect he might be interested in you, you don't want to hurt him. So you say yes just to prevent hurting him and would later come up with an excuse to find possible times to get together only to never get back to him about it. But in my opinion, it would hurt him so much more to do that, than to just say no from the start. Because he'll interpret that yes answer to mean that you are interested in him, he'll adjust his plans accordingly, and then have it all crashing down once he realizes that you never wanted to go out with him but said yes just to avoid hurting him. 

So don't be afraid to say no if you're not interested in going out with him. Even if you think he would be hurt emotionally.

I'm in my hometown. I'm finally going to move just one more time in a couple months and will stay put to continue my education. Here's my question.

Is it advisable to indulge in online dating (say, bumble) for a short/casual relationship before moving, or should I just wait until I move and meet new people there?

We have hung out five times in the span of two weeks, hooking up the last two times (we did not have sex).

I would like to preface this post by mentioning at the time, I did not have any dating experience. I had never even kissed a girl before and I am still a virgin. I have worked hard in the past few years to improve my looks and present myself for the better (consistent haircuts, better fashion, fitness, taking on leadership positions in school/work). There have been girls in the past that have hit on me and have complimented my looks, but I never followed through because I did not feel ready for any kind of relationship (which I feel stemmed from the fact I had no dating experience, and was scared of being judged for that at my age).

The girl asked me to hang out the first four times (we knew each other from a class we had). To describe her, she likes to drink and party a lot (opposite of what I do) and is very extroverted and puts herself out there in the best way possible. She suffers from anxiety and takes medication for it. I have minor anxiety too so I understand how she may feel at times. Overall, it felt amazing having someone help me get out of my comfort zone.

The third time we hung out, she asked if I was a virgin. She had a feeling I was and I think its because I was being somewhat introverted/nervous, since I rarely hang out with a girl one-on-one. I told her I have zero experience dating and being intimate and she thought that was special and nice? I even told her I liked another girl but didn't mind hanging out with her at all. I only said that in the hopes I could slow down anything I guess (I don't really know how to describe my goal with telling her that)? Even then, she gave me so much advice on how to ""go for this girl"". She's one of the only person who knows about my (lack of) dating/sexual history. After we hung out, she texted me saying she wanted to kiss me.

The fourth time we hung out, she initiated everything by putting her head on my shoulder, so I held her hand. At this point, I was scared and kind of felt my legs getting jittery. I even told her I wanted to kiss her but didn't know how to. She went in for it and within an hour, we got as far as having oral sex. During this time, I always asked her if she was comfortable and ok with doing things, and she would consistently ask me the same thing to make sure she wasn't moving too quickly or overwhelming me. Should I have asked her to slow things down? We both felt comfortable but I hope she didn't feel ""dirty"" in some way. I texted her after we hung out and told her how much fun I had (and even made plans to hang out again) since I've seen stories in the past of the guy hooking up with a girl and just cutting her off after + on top of how much I like her.

The fifth time we hung out, we did the same thing again. She asked if she could take my virginity within ""the next few weeks"" and I said yes. I'm incredibly attracted to her and enjoy talking to her. I felt like she was so respectful and non-judgmental about my dating experience (unlike my few VERY close friends who know).

Over the past three weeks, I've been asking to hang out with her. Due to extenuating circumstances (which I believe were real), she said she couldn't hang out with me yet. A week later, she was leaving me on read. When I asked why she was, she says it was because her anxiety was effecting her and that she needed time to herself. I want to believe that's the reason, but in her snap story, she posted her hanging out with her friends at a bar or partying around three times these past three weeks. Yesterday, I texted her after a week of giving her some space. She hasn't opened my message yet.

I've conveyed in the past that we can slow down if she wants and that we don't have to be intimate every time we hang out. I genuinely enjoy talking to her and she made me feel so much more secure in myself. I feel so stupid and I'm worried I said something that may have made her anxiety worse in some way, like me having no dating experience is overwhelming her. I just want to know why she won't talk to me anymore (at the same time, it could be anxiety so I don't want to ask and have her feel worse). I'm hoping she responds to me but its been 24 hours. I'm terrified she used me and thought me having no sexual experience was ""wholesome"" or something. I just miss her so much and I don't know what to do anymore.

I'm sorry if I'm coming off as desperate for help, I just have no one else to go to and she's all I think about. I just wish she could communicate with me at the bare minimum.

**TL;DR**: I (M23) who hadn't even had my first kiss yet was with a girl (F23). We hung out a few times and later hooked up twice. Now she won't talk to me which could be attributed to extenuating circumstances/her having anxiety (but I see her hanging out with people and partying in her snap story)? We get along super well and talked all the time which is why I don't want to think its just a ""friends with benefits"" thing.

I  still feel like I can talk with him about anything and doesn't ever really feel like there is much a gap in that respect. I also think people say I'm still immature, but I feel mature for my age as it's  harder to have deep conversations with people my age.

When parents and friends disapprove of such a relationship is it because they see things someone my age wouldn't? Or they don't want to deal being around someone that age? Or they don't want their child to be seen as someone marrying for money?

I'll try to keep this as brief as I can. 

I (24M) am more or less content being alone. I'd rather have a girlfriend, but I'd also rather be an NBA star. It is what it is. I have a relatively good life, and don't have any major complaints about loneliness. If I go out to bars or clubs with friends, I can usually get a decent amount of interest from girls and can often hook up if I want to (I don't really like hookups but sometimes girls are persistent). 

But none of these girls ever express the slightest bit of interest in a relationship. You all know how it goes. If you tell them you're looking for something serious, they're repulsed. If you wait for them to bring up commitment, it never happens. The whole thing makes me want to just completely check out of dating if it's never gonna lead to anything. It's weird because I have lots of female friends, so I can't be that boring, and girls throw themselves at me in clubs frequently enough that I can't be that hideous. (Just to be clear, this isn't happening every night or anything, more like once a month or so). 

The fact that I don't have and have never had a real relationship is just destroying my mental health. It's all I think about. In high school and early college, when lots of people had relationships, I was fat and awkward. I worked on myself and now I can get some interest from women, but it seems like nobody wants to actually date. Or the few that do have been in relationships for years and it isn't changing anytime soon. I don't even know if I want a relationship so much as I want to have had one. I just can't understand why this thing that almost everyone in my life has had is just impossible for me to get. I know this is stupid and I want to stop feeling this way but it's destroying my life. 

All I can think about is all the couple things I've never been able to do. All the dates I've never been able to plan, all the creative presents I've never been able to buy, being able to introduce a girlfriend to my friends/family/hobbies. I technically had one girlfriend for a few months in college but she was so emotionally abusive to me that I had a breakdown and spent all of 2020 going to 4 hours of therapy a week. So not sure that really counts lmao. 

More than anything, I'm just upset that nobody has ever valued me enough to want me to be more than a passing figure in their life. I know this way of thinking is defeatist and stupid and a complete waste of time. I can feel how much it screws up the vibes I give off in social situations. I just don't know how to stop. 

The funniest part is that my life really doesn't have a lot of room for a relationship right now. I have a job that keeps me traveling a lot. When I'm home I go out all the time. I work in the music industry so I'm usually at 1 or 2 concerts a week, I like to go dancing at clubs, I'm in a couple of social groups, and I work out every day. My schedule is pretty full most nights a week. Not to say that a potential GF couldn't come to a bunch of this stuff with me, or that I wouldn't be open to drop some commitments to do things she likes, but it's not like I have tons of time to stay home playing board games or whatever couples do. 

I feel like I've done what everyone says to do, and built a life that I can enjoy by myself. But I'm miserable, and it's all because I've turned having had a girlfriend into this mystical perfect thing that everyone else has been able to do in their life except me. Sorry for the rant, but if anyone has advice on how to stop feeling this way, I'd really appreciate it. Not even looking for advice on how to get a girlfriend right now. I just want to stop feeling like everything I am and have ever been is completely worthless because nobody has ever wanted to commit to me.

A few days after messaging each other, we set up a date. On that first date, we already had established that we would date each other exclusively. I was over the moon about it because I've never felt this way for a person before. I think it's pretty rare to find someone you have an instant connection with, it kind of felt like we've known each other long before we started talking. Maybe it's naive to think that way, but we both felt it. I asked him if he wanted something casual or serious, and he said that he'll go along with whatever I like. I told him I wanted a serious relationship, he said that's cool with him and that he'll pursue me.

But then fast forward a couple days after, he invited me over to his place. Initially, I didn't want to have sex until it was established that we were in a relationship, but it happened anyway \*shrugs\*. I slept over at his place and at the moment, it all just felt right. I felt safe around him.

The next day, he became super busy. There were a lot of things going on at work and at home, so I was the one who had to hold up our conversations. At first I didn't mind because it was completely understandable, but I have this huge anxiety over guys heading for the door after they get into my pants, and it slowly started to creep in. As the days passed by, I felt sadder because the guy would be online and not even try talking to me.

I tried bringing this up, and he reasoned out that he doesn't really check his phone all the time. I kept trying to shrug it off until I just felt jaded. We had an argument about it because I told him that it didn't seem like he was even serious. He got annoyed at me for thinking of him as *that kind of person.* So now, it felt like he started becoming more distant. We stopped flirting and he'd just kind of talk to me whenever he's not doing anything.

My friends told me to just start giving him less attention and expect the worst, but I feel so sad over it because I've never felt this way for a person before :( Was I in the wrong for asking him to start initiating conversations more, and being bothered that he started talking to me less? As much as I didn't want to look needy this early, I just felt like I had to have some reassurance after we slept with each other.

In fact, this observation has been confirmed in studies:

Google: *""Title of study: men take breakups harder than women, the washington post""*

The main reason is because men in general have less social connections than women, and also it takes longer on average for men to meet a new girl than it is for a broken up girl to meet a new guy. Oftentimes, we can be observe this even in our circle of friends, the guys who get dumped stay single for months or even years, sometimes drinking themselves into a stupor all alone in the room, while the girls already have a new guy on their instagram pic a few days after breakup. As a result, the emotional turmoil and loneliness for a dumped man is many times greater. It is just not worth the risk. In the words of one poster here on this sub, breakup for a man without a social circle to absorb his fall is HELL ON EARTH.

so my advice to men is, take an honest look at your situation, and assess yourself.

We met twice, held hands, and kissed...I told him that I won't have sex with him (due to religious reasons).

I was worried about getting COVID since he had Tinder. We had an argument about it and he deleted it. We agreed to see each other about twice a month.

However, we didn't. He said that his sister gave birth which changed his perspective on going out (due to COVID). After that, he started being distant and rarely texts me. When I asked him, he said he's busy with the baby. 

During that time we had many arguments- mostly me expressing to him I don't like feeling like an object and forcing him to ""label"" us and him saying that ""if we decide to date it will be way into the future..you're too young..I don't want to take away from your life."" I do take responsibility and feel guilty for continually arguing with him although we had met only twice. Some of his comments during arguments:

* ""it was like easy with her"" (his other fwb)
* ""Let me know if you wanna be my main (person to make him cum)"" (apparently this was a joke but still disrespectful)
* ""I'm not good at texting""
* “I’d marry you” “I’m crazy about you” “I’m attached to you that’s why I’m telling you about her instead of lying”

Anyways, one time we had a big fight that ended in him saying “We met twice. Live your life. I’m not it.”

We stopped talking for a month, and he started texting again, and we decided to meet up.

The night before, he asked ""Why do you want to see me? Do you think we'll get married one day or do you just want to try out things (sexual reference). I replied with ""there's no way in hell I'm marrying anyone, especially you, just no."" (my ego was hurt from him saying ""live your life"" a few months earlier so I obviously lied.)

After that, he cancelled a few times due to being busy. We finally met about a week ago. He was different. No hand holding, we just made out and didn't even talk. Unlike the other times we met, he never asked when to see me again, we just hugged at the end. He did mention that he hadn’t seen anyone in the past 7 months due to being busy. He said things like “you’re mysterious, weird, don’t let people know what you think.” (which is ironic after this many arguments). He suggested we go to a restaurant and I said “we both don’t want to be seen with each other in public”, which he replied to by saying “that’s rude...and proceeded by listing the places that he doesn’t want to be seen with me.”

A few days later, I felt bad for saying that so I suggested going to a hotel to watch a movie and talk..he said “I can’t justify that”…whatever that means (this was the same day I ended things bc I felt like I was the only one putting in effort).

I tried to pretend that I’m fine without a label and  asked him how often he thinks we should see each other, and he said ""I don't know, I'm not looking for hookups right now."" So I asked if he thinks we should stop seeing each other and he replied with ""No, just, what then after seeing each other?."" I asked what do you think and he replied with ""nothing good"" so I replied with ""we should stop then if you don't see something good coming out of it"" and he replied with:

“I don’t know what you expect.” “I’m busy right now, not thinking about this.” ""don't be dramatic.""

A few days later,

Me: “I don’t wanna see you anymore. I know you don’t like labels, but I like knowing everything. And I know you don’t know and are busy, but you can always text me when you figure it out.”

Him: “ ;( Ok, sorry”

Me: “I just think you’re at the point of actually wanting to date someone and we know it can’t be me bc of age and all of these things. So it’s ok. Take care.”

Him: *sends 2 goodnight stickers* …….

At this point I just feel guilty for no reason. I feel as if I didn't make it clear enough that I see a possible serious relationship with him. I just can't find closure and I don't know if I should text him again. Someone told me that when he said ""nothing good"" he means that it's going to get complicated and that he's scared of asking me out. Now I can't stop feeling guilty and obsessing over it.

I've been trying to get out there and meet people and make friends and really buckle down on being serious and focusing on the things I want and need from someone else. I made some great new friends and I've been hanging out with them at a local country bar, I'm by no means country at all but they're great friends and I just enjoy being there. They've really helped me expand myself and I recently picked up 2 step because I've been going and since then I've been loving it. It's really opened the door for actually meeting new girls and breaking the ice. This past Saturday I met my friends as usual and they were all hanging around the dance floor drinking like always and this super cute girl and her friend were drinking there too and I told my chick friend that I was gonna try and dance with that girl. I waited a couple songs and asked her, she had barely started dancing that night and so we hit things off being mutually new to it. We made some small talk and exchanged names while dancing and afterwards her friend made a point to appoint me the watcher of their drinks and seats when they needed to get up which I happily obliged because that shows they clearly trust me enough. We kept talking and getting to know each other all night, found out we both dislike country music and just have country friends 😂 we danced terribly laughing the whole time several more times that night and while we were sitting I went in for a kiss and she reciprocated. After more dancing and drinks they were headed home not long before close and I walked her to her car and it had started raining and we made out and danced in the rain just enjoying the energy. She said I was adorable several times and was cutesy denying it when I gave her the same compliment back. The next day for the 4th of July those friends invited us both out to their BBQ and she showed up after work. We had drinks and talked and laughed with each other and my friends, she sat on my lap most of the time and we were just really close and comfortable with each other like instantly. She had told me she regretted not bringing me back to her place the night before in a flirty way. We have great flirty banter and get along so well already, she's busy and on call all the time for the hospital she works at and has 2 kids which you'd think I was lying if you met her. She's just over 4 years older than myself I'll be 29 in a couple months and she just turned 33. I think things are going well and we've been getting better at dancing since we've been more intimate. She's just not super responsive because of her responsibilities I'm assuming and I've been trying to take that into account and not text her too much or too often throughout the day even if she reads a text and doesn't reply. The few texts she does reply to though are usually cute and still have cute emojis attached which makes me think I haven't annoyed her. Hopefully this weekend we'll be back out dancing and having more fun in person.

I just wanted to share this and confirm that I'm doing the right thing with the time between seeing each other, she's wonderful and the most fun person I've been this close to in a long time. Not fake or takes things too literal or anything, she brings out the best fun parts of me and when we've been together I literally don't care about what anyone else thinks even if we're fucking up laughing while dancing. I'm trying not to fall too hard too fast but also not trying to scare her off because I can be a bit too quick to conclusions. I told her after the 2nd night that I didn't know what she was looking for but that I'm enjoying what we've got going right now and wanna just see where it goes and she agreed.

At first I didn’t really find him attractive but then after seeing him almost everyday and I’ve taken interest. 

The first time I saw him, he seemed to look at me a lottttt more than I did to him. It felt like eyes were always on me. I then stopped going to the gym but than started again after a month and saw him again. 

We both seemed to make lots of eyes contact but then it felt like I was looking at me a lot more. However, I once brought my mom to the gym and she asked me if I knew him because he had been staring at me but I didn’t even notice. The only times I feel like he’s looking at me now is when I’m farther away. 

Another time I was waiting for an older man on a machine (he’s very friendly and we chatted about his grandkids) and the guy I’m attracted to comes and was about to take the machine. There’s no way he didn’t see me waiting right by it. If he didn’t see me than idek 

He’s either looking at whatever’s near me or at me. The last time I saw him he was definitely more interested to this one particular women and they spoke A LOT. 

I also wanted to add that he seems older than me so I’m not really sure what to do. He also seemed to take an interest in another women so I gave up. At first I thought he was just shy but I see him speaking to everyone there so idk.

I didn't make too much out of it. I know his salary is as much as mine. When I went to his place, it seemed too simple, very few old furniture, most of which was from his parents old house. later on, I came to know that he comes from a very wealthy family, his house, car, internet, phone everything is paid by family trust, also he earns a decent amount from it. Interestingly, he uses his dads amazon and Netflix account. So only thing he pays for is his grocery. I honestly didn't think too much of it. He never offers me any food or drink at his place. We went on a trip, he got the hotel. I paid for all the meals and later on offered half of hotel and gas pay, he gladly accepted, fine by me. I took him to his favorite Italian restaurant on his birthday. Last weekend he came over to my place where I just moved in a day ago. I wanted to grab dinner as I have nothing at that new place. We went out, all restaurants were closed due to July 4th. So he mentioned ordering from uber eats, as he a 8$ off coupon. After trying for a while, it showed insufficient fund in his card. Apparently he was using a special card that had low balance. He kept playing with it for a while, at this point I got frustrated and ordered dinner from my account. Next morning, I asked him if he wants me to bring stuff like toothbrush from nearby shop, he gladly agreed. Once I was there, he asked me to bring some breakfast and dog food for his dog too.

I \[25F\] met this guy \[30M\] in a country town airport a couple of months ago. We were both there for work and I didn't have a hire car lol so he offered to take me to my motel. That night we hung out for drinks and he organised for a local to take me to work the next day and take me to the airport, I knew on the night he wanted to hook up because he invited me for drinks in his motel room, however I wasn't really interested so he didn't persist, he was really nice though and we had a lot in common. 

After that trip we kept talking, and we have been about everyday. I was planning to visit him a week after but all our internal borders shut due to COVID so we are finally getting to meet again next week. He was married before but they divorced last year and he has two kids who are like 10 but he gets on with his ex and it's all amicable which is cool. However, having kids was a bit of a put off so I did put my guard up a little bit.

He calls me a few times a week, it's always him calling me because the camp he works at has really bad reception so there's no point me initiating. He's based at a rural camp 700 miles from any shop for 2 weeks and then he's off for a week. There's a spot he can drive out to which is about 1 hour out of way during his working day where he gets really good reception, he always drives there when he cans to call me and usually we don't talk about much it's like he just wants to hear my voice. When we do on the phone sometimes we can be on it for like 4 hours, and while it does often get a bit sexual, it's definitely not all sexual. 

He also told me he got a vasectomy but assured me that if he met someone that wanted kids he would get a reversal while also 'jokingly' telling me he loves me a lot. I'm not put off by it, he's nice I just want to test the water a bit more before letting my guard down and becoming more vulnerable, I don't have trust issues I just don't want to get too deep so soon when I'm not 100% sure what his intentions are. He also tells me that he can transfer with work so he can be closer to where I live and he said that he would like to introduce me to his friends but not the first time we hang out, which I'm completely fine with. 

He tells me how his day goes and all the work stuff that's happened and he's opened up  a lot about his past, more than I did which is different.

One positive is that he hangs out with his kids a lot on his week off and I work a really busy job and do acting so I feel like that balance works really well.

I was on a girls trip about 4 hours away from where I live a few weeks ago  and I decided to get on tinder to see if i would match with anyone who would want to get drinks. I made some matches but didn’t really talk to anyone. A few days later, one of the guys (32M) messaged me. We exchanged numbers and text all day. I told him that i live about 4 hours up north from where he lives, and he said that was was okay with him and he invited me to come visit. I booked a hotel room and a flight. We made plans for what to do and up until today, things were fine. We texted each other good night and since I sent him a “good morning” text i haven’t heard from him once. He never unmatched me on tinder so now I’m confused. Normally i would hear something by now.

I’m supposed to see him at the end of the month and now i don’t know if i should give it a few days or just cancel trip.

I shot my shot, and completely air balled. Actually, I don’t know what happened. You tell me.

We get into work, normal day, but I didn’t see her for the first hour, so I’m thinking she bailed on her last day, I did that once so I wouldn’t even blame her. Turns out they just had her in a different area at the beginning of our shift.

So we don’t get to talk until later, it was pretty busy, but I’m like once I get my chance I’m pulling up for the shot. So after an hour of a rush of work it’s finally just us 2 and I go for it.  My exact words, “wassup, how you feeling today.” She says with a smile “I’m good, hbu.” I said “same, this your last day right?” She says “yeeeeaaa.” Held that yea for a second too. So I say, “well if I don’t get a chance to talk to you before you leave, just know I’m wishing you the best of luck on whatever you do after this, and I’m kinda upset we didn’t get a chance to really get to know each other, but I’m rooting for you nonetheless.” She didn’t respond to any of that, like completely went in one ear and out the other. I even used my deep voice I use when I’m talking to women I’m interested in. 

But get this, if you read the first post, I speak about this little eye tag game we played, she tried to continue it. Like huh? I was so upset I couldn’t even look at her, cuz it felt like I was left on read, or ghosted after talking for a week or 2. Now she doesn’t owe me anything or whatever, I was just really sick because I was expecting a response of some kind, just not a no response at all. 

So later that day it was so awkward, because I was helping out in her area and she didn’t know what to do with herself when I was there. Like she was pacing back and forth, looking at her phone, but every time I walked away I could see her out the corner of my eye looking at me. 

I don’t know, I don’t think I could’ve did anything different. Maybe I read our situation wrong, and she wasn’t interested at all. Or maybe she got something complicated going on who knows, certainly not me. I’m kind of bummed though because I was truly interested in this girl, but hey. I do wish her the best though.

OKAY, so a couple months ago I downloaded Bumble, since one of my female friends convinced me too.  A couple days later, I ended up matching with a previous co-worker of mine (20M) :)) What a weird coincidence?! I found it absolutely hilarious, and so did he when I messaged him. Plus, I wasn’t looking for anything serious. 

Oddly enough we didn’t talk much when we were working together, but I always found him cute when he would come by where I was working at. After matching, we switched numbers and started talking everyday for a month. Then, we finally decided to get food and hang out. Whoa, instant chemistry. It felt like I’d been his best friend for years because of how calming his presence was. I found out we have similar hobbies, we both love nature, watched the same stuff, music taste, moral opinions, etc- you name it, we more or less have it in common. Out of all the people I’ve talked to before, I’ve never connected with someone so fast. 

A couple more weeks went by and we went out on an official date, and had our first kiss!! We were watching the sunset in a field. It was so pretty, and he looked extremely handsome at golden hour LOL. Then, he turned to me and asked me to be his girlfriend. I was shocked at first, but gladly accepted :)) At this point, we had been talking for two-ish months, so I wondered if maybe we were going too fast…. but any doubts I had before are gone now lol. Because i realized if it didn’t happen in that moment, it would’ve happened sometime shortly after, only because of how wonderful he is to be around. Even our love languages are the same?! we’re both pretty physical people (holding hands, cuddles, forehead kisses) but we both don’t like PDA. And best of all, being around him doesn’t make me second guess myself or my feelings, or whether or not he thinks I’m attractive- It’s not nervous butterflies or anxiety inducing either. It’s straight peace, and a deep contentment- like soft sun on your face. 

I’ve been his girlfriend for three weeks now :))) And what I thought was gonna be a quick fling, is definitely looking more long-term. He made his intentions really clear, and changed my mind too. I really admire his personality, and how big his heart is- and let him know that all the time. Def too soon to be love (I’m not trying to rush everything lol), but I’m the happiest I’ve been in a long time. 

So, if your wondering when you’ll find someone to care about, just know it can literally be where you least expect it. There’s hope. Six months ago, I was crying myself to sleep over not being wanted by someone. But finding my boyfriend made me realize that I’m wanted by my friends and family, too. :))
