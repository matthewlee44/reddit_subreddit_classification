Hit it off, our dates lasted for two days at a time, couldn’t get enough of each other etc. 

On our first date, I let him know that I’m leaving the country for 5 weeks at the end of January and will be back end of February. From the first date he told me he’d miss me when I go. Later dates told me that he has genuinely never felt like this about anybody, spent NYE together, yadda yadda. 

The other day in bed, we were talking about the trip. I thought he was concerned, so I told him “I’ve been having a really nice time with you, and I’d like to see where this goes and continue when I come back.”

Yikes. I think that froze him up and he went on about how he doesn’t know what he wants, doesn’t know if he wants a relationship, doesn’t know if he can meet me emotionally there, etc.

I tried to reassure him that I’m not asking to immediately jump into a relationship, I just have a good time with him and want to see where this goes when I come back.

We kept talking in circles, and ended up deciding to take a break. Told me that he still has never felt this way about somebody and that he “doesn’t want to never see me again.” Confusion.

Now I can’t tell if I just scared him off by that statement or he’s non committal. He’s 30 and has only been in one relationship that lasted a year and a half and ended 2 years ago. He told me that he thought he was going to die from the stress she caused him (although in my opinion, it often takes two to tango). He’s also admitted that he’s an over-thinker and has OCD, which I don’t know if that clouded his judgement of what I said.

My mind believes that a statement such as that shouldn’t scare somebody who wants commitment and wants to be with me.

I regret not learning German and/or Russian


I’m a native English speaker who can speak Spanish, Portuguese and Italian fluently (relatively).

It’s not that I can’t speak the languages well. I can speak, write and read well enough (not perfect, but good enough.) Work was never the motivation because I was already learning them long ago. I started learning them for the sake of learning, though I must mention that I’m interested in Italian and Brazilian cultures. 

I also speak intermediate French. I’m currently a beginner learning Modern Greek.

The problem is that after reaching an advanced level I realised that I regret learning Russian (tried for a while but failed) or German, because these languages are so damn important due to their cultural, economic and political significance, and here’s me learning Modern Greek.

I’m so lost, helpless and disoriented right now. I just screwed up my life.

What do I do?

Also idk if this is stupid but I feel like I’m stupid if I don’t learn every single major language in the world because everytime I hear a cultural reference eg a German song in an American movie I get sad that I don’t know German because I cannot experience Germany.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1148653,public,self,I regret not learning German and/or Russian,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rwllxz/i_regret_not_learning_german_andor_russian/,no_ads,0.0,dating,,,,

He wants marriage in the future and with my history of shit relationships and a very unhealthy marriage when I was much younger, I’m unsure if that’s in the cards for me).

So here’s my question/issue(?):
When it’s just us, things feel like a genuine relationship. Considerate and caring actions, cuddling, texting/occasional sexting, endless support, mind blowing sex, and more open communication than I’ve ever had. We’re both exceptionally fucked up, but it somehow works for us. When we’re apart things seem almost professional. I know we agreed to keep things under the radar, but it seems even more disconnected than what I expected. 

I’ve been out of the dating game for a VERY long time, and I’m not sure what this is (since it’s still relatively new). Is this normal for a FWB situation, or is this an actual relationship? I don’t know the “rules”. I don’t want to seem needy (or ruin what we’ve got going on), and have no idea how often to text/call and what to expect out of something like this. I’m planning on talking to him and more clearly defining things, but what are some things I need to mention?

He left the country but still texts me everyday (once a day) and we talk about stuff. 

Not sure if the convo is too deep tho I feel like he’s talking to others but he said he felt chemistry when we were together and he said the physical stuff was amazing. 

Not sure if he’s looking for a relationship either I haven’t asked. 

Apart from this we have nice text convos and have even spoke  on phone twice. He said he usually comes back to my country for work every 1-2 months. He said he’s considering moving to here as he is unhappy with where he’s at. 

Yet he unmatched me in the app so I know he’s looking  or talking to other girls. I don’t know what to expect from him - on one hand I do like this guy a bit but i don’t fully know him. We met two months ago. 

Also on the other hand I don’t think he’s just talking to me? Not sure if we have built much of an emotional connection through text as he only texts me once a day.

I’m not sure what I want and am not rushing into anything. We get on well. I’m sad there’s no easy way to develop this relationship further as he’s not even living in the same country.

The relationship has been great so far and I like this girl.

However, she has a guy friend (28M) she considers one of her best friends that I personally don’t like. She has known this guy since college about 5 years.

The issue with her guy friend isn’t the fact that he’s a guy but he’s repeatedly had bad behavior.

My girlfriend seems to brush off or forgive this behavior and chalk it up to him being drunk or “he’s not typically like this”. My girlfriend has also only told me negative stories about him which has lead me to question why they are still friends.

I’m starting to see her forgiving the behavior as a red flag. I’m considering breaking up with her because I can see this repeatedly causing fights in the future.

I have not met this guy friend yet but here are a few of the stories my girlfriend has told me about him:

- In college when they would drink he would get mean/aggressive when she didn’t want to kiss him to the point where he would make her cry

- He tries to constantly sleep with her friend group &amp; their friends

-rubs in my GF’s face the options of girls he has

-My GF has had to friendzone him on multiple occasions 

-Recently, caused drama with wanting to get 2 tables for a nye party because he didn’t like 1 person at the table when there was no need to pay for 2 tables

Got hammered drunk at New Year’s Eve party which led to the following:

- he was being a dick to her friends at the New Year’s Eve party

-Harassing one of her friends/another girl he wanted to kiss at midnight at the New Year’s Eve party that didn’t want to kiss him

-kicked out of bar by bouncer 

-GF and her friend had to pay for his Uber home

-also, he Has never had a GF in the 5 years my girlfriend has known him 

I see this behavior as immature and creepy for a 28 year old male and it makes me uncomfortable she’s continued to befriends with someone who behaves this way. Especially since I don’t act like this and neither do my own friends.

After the events on New Year’s Eve, my girlfriend is pretty fed up with this guy friends behavior. 

However, she has a birthday coming up and will be going out with all her girl friends. I decided not to go out because I didn’t want to be the only guy and crash girls get together. I am taking her out separately just the 2 of us to celebrate on our own.

I recently found out that one of her friends may have invited the guy friend to the all girls party that I decided not to attend. My girlfriend wasn’t exactly thrilled about it because of his recent behavior at the New Year’s Eve party.

If this guy attends the party I view it as her brushing off/forgiving the bad behavior again and am considering breaking up with her about it. The reason is she won’t set boundaries and cut off this person even though she constantly complains about him.

I’m in no position to tell her who she can be friends with and will not give an ultimatum since I am the one uncomfortable.

Is this a justified reason to end the relationship?

Tl;dr: new GF is friends with a guy who in my opinion acts like an immature creep.

I'm 19 year old male, who is currently studying electrical engineering at an university. I just want to get this off my chest.

So basicly there is one girl (18f), that I've known for about 4 years now. I got to know her, because our fathers are friends. We also live closeby. I enjoy walking with my dog at lonely roads between fields and forests, when it's about to go dark. She enjoys going for a walk at the night too, so we sometimes randomly see each other. We always have long conversations and she is always happy to see me. We also had some planned hangouts too, like working together etc.
I just can't understand if she likes me or not. She clearly enjoys talking with me and sometimes I feel she is into me, but I'm not 100% sure. I'm afraid getting it awkward between us by asking her to a date.

The problem is that I keep thinking about her and even seeing her in my dreams. I feel nothing towards other girls, they all look and seem to be the same. 2 weeks ago at a party I was dancing with other girls and felt little bit better. I still didn't feel anything towards that girl who started to kiss me, but it got this girl out of my mind for a little bit. BUT then next day I met her again while walking with my dog. We walked together and talked for about a hour, even though it was cold, dark and foggy. We talked about books and she randomly mentions love genre, which is kinda odd. When I'm about getting little bit over her, she randomly appears again and it drives me crazy. I'm otherwise rational man, but she is the only girl that managed to dig her way deep into my heart. Never felt anything like this towards other person before and it's exhausting.

I feel like I have no choice anymore - I just have to risk it and ask her to a actual date. I have never asked a girl to a date before, because I have never actually cared about love or girls before. Hopefuly I manage to ask her to something romantic date-like thing next time we randomly meet at lonely forest roads...

Now we are in our mid twenties living in two different states. When I first met him, he was really only looking for a hookup. We would text a lot when we first met and we hooked up a few times but never had sex. I was a virgin and wanted to wait until I was in a relationship with someone (not a virgin anymore). We would drift on and off from being away, but he would always text me to see how I was doing. 

Pre pandemic, we went on a date after not seeing each other in like five years. I did not think it was going to be date but immediately when he saw me, he picked me up and kissed me. He held the door for me and paid for our bill and the conversation flowed nicely. We then went on a second date and he picked me up. We went for a walk. I was a little taken back because he didn’t expect anything after the dates and never thought he would take me out ever. 

He then moved to another state and he invited me more than several times to see him. When he came back home, he would invite me to see him. I said no because I didn’t feel comfortable with Covid and told him that. He was understanding but said he couldn’t wait forever for me. Which I understand. We then eventually went out separate ways and he ended up dating someone else. They then broke up a couple of months ago and he reached out to me again. We then have been talking ever since. 

He still invites me to see him. And when he came back home I asked if we could hangout, but she didn’t have enough time in his short weekend to see me. I am fully vaccinated and not as scared as Covid as I was when Covid first started. He said that he thinks I’m scared to see him. I then asked him what he is looking for and what he thinks of me. He didn’t answer about what he thinks of me, but said once he finds the right person, he will look for a relationship. I told him I am looking for a relationship and he responded, “when you find the right person, yeah?”. I felt confused because I thought he liked me. He has told me in the past that he would treat me good when I go see him, he’s invited me to meet his friends and family, invited me to thanksgiving dinner, invited me to his family members service, and even joked saying that we should get married and have children. After that conversation, he said he would take me out to see many places and told me he would give me lingerie as a gift and i think he assumed we are going to hook up. I told him that I enjoy talking to him and he said I am sweet.

1. Would you be put off by a mid-20’s girl who is still a virgin? Would that be intimidating, or an obstacle to dating her? I’ve never gone past making out with a guy, so he’d have to take the lead at first. 

2. Would you think something was off if the girl claimed to be a virgin but had a high sex-drive? I survived all these years by watching porn and reading some pretty filthy erotica, so I’m into dirty talk and other things that guys might not expect from virgins (like toys). I know that as soon as I find a guy I really like, I’m probably going to lose it within a month or two,  but I don’t want him to be alarmed if I’m saying things like “I want you to finger fuck me until I cum” or “I want your cock in my mouth…will you teach me how to suck you off?” while we’re working our way up to P-in-V, and he was expecting a “good girl.”

I (21F) have a crush on a guy (20M) at my college. We have taken a few classes together and have similar hobbies/clubs, and we have a group of mutual friends. He’s very shy and has major depression, ADHD, and Aspergers, and I don’t know if these are affecting the way he’s communicating with me. I want to ask him out, but I’m not sure if he’s into me.

We have palpable in-person chemistry, with tons of banter and joking, even though we are both quite introverted and shy. At our club meetings, he’s always either glued to my side (and has initiated slight physical contact) or is glancing at me/directly staring. He’s walked me home long ways out of his way after meetings, given me advice, and shared with me some of his deepest passions and secrets. If I’m talking with others, he will sometimes insert himself into our conversation only to briefly laugh at a joke I made or make a small comment about something I said.

The one big issue with our interactions is that, unlike when I message him for advice, when I message him about hanging out physically, he ghosts me. It’s not even completely - I will ask him either in person or over text to hang out, he will agree and/or ask me to message him to set up a time, and when I do, I get radio silence. He is known by our mutual friend group to completely ghost everyone, from professors to his stepmom, so I know for sure this isn’t behavior that’s only directed at me. He’s never been into small talk, so admittedly I’ve never tried to start much, but when I have he does not try to continue or create new lines of conversation like he does in person. This means that we go very long stretches without talking to each other sometimes (online classes, breaks, etc.) but we pick up where we leave off pretty easily usually.

He’s a very disorganized person (re: ADHD), and through my friends I’ve learned even though he acts super confident normally, he has some hang ups about his appearance, though he’s quite adorable. He’s sheepishly mentioned that his family is well-off to me before, and my friends believe it may be because he feels it could be an attraction factor, event though I don’t care. 

So, is he interested in me or does he see me as a friend?

I’ve been enjoying being single since I got out of my 4 year relationship 7months ago meeting all sorts of people and having casual relationships. But I’m 28F and am marriage minded so I’m starting to feel tired of the casual flings and want to grow with one person. Now there’s two men that I see myself being happy with but I can’t bring myself to choose yet because I don’t feel confident that I know which would be a happier healthier choice, potentially leading to marriage. One (30M, we will call him A) is very enthusiastic about me from the beginning, very upfront about liking me and that he wants to be serious right away. This was very surprising to hear right off the bat with a guy, A could be mild love bombing but is a welcome change from the guys who string me along pretending to offer a relationship until after they get sex. He’s successful, he opens all doors for me, he’s thoughtful, calls me every day, he previously got me a present on my birthday despite never having gone on a date w me yet. After talking two months, and sex, he’s still just as chivalrous. My mind is seeing Lots of green flags but my heart is still guarded against his enthusiasm. Then there’s the other guy (28M, we will call him B). My heart longs for B. We’ve been casual since September and at first that was all I wanted. But as we got to know each other we found a lot of commonalities and I caught INTENSE feelings three months in. Cheesing from ear to ear when receiving a text, heart racing when I see him, doing human tippy taps when we make plans, the whole nine yards. He never fails to make me laugh, he’s smart, witty, endlessly interesting, I like who I am when I’m around him. But He’s not the best listener, and hes suffers from mental health issues. We’ve met each other’s friend groups now and it’s starting to evolve into something more. My heart says these are all green flags, but my mind is still guarded because I still have doubts about how serious his intentions are, after all, both of us only went into this for fun at first. We both still have dating apps downloaded.. how should I tell B about A and vice versa? Should I even tell them about each other?

A few weeks later he followed up wth me with info about the job but mentioned how much he enjoyed talking with me and I told him I felt similarly. He was only in town for that week so I told him if he ever came back to hmu. He said he would and that he was looking forward to it.

It's kind of late to start having kids. But my dad didn't have me until he was 35. I also always envisioned having my own kids. I then thought about it for a minute and was about to just move on. But every time she commets or likes my post I get excited. This is all new for me. I've never got this far in online dating or dating in general.Mostly due to the fact that I have high social anxiety and I'm very introverted. I really like her and I think she likes me too. So I really want to get to know her better. So not sure how to approach this. Especially knowing that she doesn't want to move nor do I. Her introduction did say she would be willing to do a long distance relationship. Problem is I live in Washington she lives in Nevada. So I don't know how long I could keep that relationship going with the distance.But I really like this girl and know I can't be just friends with her. So as a socially awkward introvert any advice would be helpful. TL;DR joined a Facebook dating group. Found out the girl I've been talking to doesn't want to move nor do I.

He runs his own company &amp; is quite a busy guy. He definitely seems legit as we talked about his work during our date, &amp;  I did the obvious Google searches about him. 

He texted back saying ‘let me check how my first week back at work looks &amp; we can get a meal in’

We’ve been texting back and forth still, but he hasn’t mentioned anything about dates. As I’ve said i’m available most of the week, so kind of left up to him to decide. 

He hasn’t said no, but I don’t want to come across as desperate either. Which is why I haven’t mentioned another date when texting him. He said he would see how his first week looks like!

I went to a bar alone almost a week ago and hit it off with the bartender. We hung out all night and went out to another bar together after the bar she worked at closed, then went over to her friends and kept partying, eventually we went back to her place. We had been making out throughout the night and by the time we got back to her place it was like 8am. Anyway at some point she asked me to leave but told me to keep kissing her until my Uber arrived and that she wanted to see me on Monday. Anyway, we couldn’t find my pullover, so she gave me one of hers. I texted her the next day and she never responded. So obviously, she’s not interested and I haven’t reached out since. My problem is that pullover I left over was my cousin’s who recently passed away a couple of months ago so it means something to me. Should I reach out and ask if we can meet up to exchange our stuff? My concern is that she will think it is some lame attempt to try and talk to her something, but I clearly got the message when she never responded and I haven’t reached out since.

He’s 32 and I’m 28. During the relationship we had ups and downs, but I would say more downs and this was mainly on his part. He was not stable emotionally and financially and he lied to me a handful of times. Financially he had terrible debt and bad credit that he did not tell me about til much later and it was getting in the way of us progressing. I was on a completely different level with savings, assets great credit etc. Emotionally he was too involved in family drama as he came from a broken family, rather than just focusing on bettering himself. I didn’t feel like I was being treated or appreciated the way that I should and for good reasons I broke things off with him.

A month after I broke things off he contacted me and expressed how much he valued me and how I’ve pushed him to be a better person and wanted to remain friends in each other’s lives. He paid off his debts, was working on fixing his credit, moved away from his toxic family and was actually focusing on himself. I agreed to it. Since then our relationship as friends has been better than it ever was before. I see a change in him completely and he has been respecting and treating me so much better. This “friendship” has been going on for about 6 months now and I am completely ok with it - there really is no official commitment and I’ve been able to also focus on myself without relationship headache.

Yesterday he confronted me and told me that he wants to pursue a real future with me and he doesn’t wanna keep doing the casual friends things. He wants to get us a house start a family etc. He really is my best friend makes me laugh and has been a solid rock lately whenever something is wrong but for some reason I couldn’t come to terms with being in a relationship again and asked for a few days to think. A part of me has ptsd from how he treated me in the past and as much as I see a completely different person I just don’t know. He really has been amazing lately though.

Recently I (MTF nonbinary, 21) had an extremely lovely date / hookup with a mostly *straight*, recently more out queer guy (M, 23). I must admit we met through Grindr. He was hot, my age and told me that he was exploring his sexuality further (he has slept with trans women and cis men in the past) and that he had just gotten out of a relationship with a cis-girl. I REALLY REALLY did not think it would be anything more than sex / a one off thing. In fact he asked me to come over mid-day and I kept putting it off until it was late night (I kind of made it more booty-callish.

When I finally arrived at his place we were both nervous. He was much cuter and taller IRL. We ended up chatting a bit to break the ice, we study the same thing at university and the conversation flowed really easy. We ended up back in his bedroom and had a wonderful time (will spare the explicit details). After we were both errr satisfied I began quickly putting my clothes on/grabbed my stuff (he had to be up early to travel back home for the weekend). As I was rushing out he said, ""wait, I mean you don't have to leave I'm not in a rush or anything you can stay if you'd like."" I thought his was odd but very sweet (maybe he's just lonely though idk).

We ended up chatting for a couple hours, smoked a bit and learned we had a lot in common. Way more than either of us excepted I think. We chatted about the current state of the world, school, growing up, queer identity/coming out, a little bit about his relationship, where we both saw ourselves living in the future, music/movie tastes, hobbies, our social lives, etc. and laughed very easily with each other. We also had similar flaws / shortcomings another thing that made me feel more comfortable. It felt like a first date conversation but at booty call hours... weird. There was obviously an emotional attraction forming. He also kept inching his foot (politely) closer to mine (it was very cute, sweet, respectful and flirty). And he kept gazing into my eyes and then quickly looking away (and I'd feel his gaze whenever I wasn't looking directly at him). We even made a few inside jokes and kept cracking them at each other. It definitely felt more romantic, I couldn't believe.

After awhile we sat on his sofa and spooned/cuddled very closely and continued to talk. He told me how much it threw him for a loop when I asked if he was bi/pansexual. I realized how much of a privilege it was to be mostly comfortable with myself and sexuality at this point. Both of us were surprised and neither of us wanted the moment/night to end it seemed. After awhile we were rubbing up against each other a bit. He looked at me and I looked at him and we began to kiss. It was 10x better than before we'd chatted/ gotten a bit more intimate. We were actually in rhythm and we both felt it. He picked me up and carried me back to his room and we had sex again and it was wonderful. Both of us were smiling and giggling the whole time.

By the time we had both been satisfied it was almost 7am (for reference I got there around midnight). He asked if we could do so again and I said I'd give him my number and he said he'd like that very much/ that was his preferred method of contact. I told him over text later that I'd really enjoyed myself and that I'd be down to do non-sex things as well together out and about (implying date). He said he'd really like that too and thought we really clicked and asked for my number again so he could save. The thing is he never texted me even to just say ""hi.""

He has not been on Grindr since we hooked up (I check his profile, hopeless romantic I know....) / blocked my profile or anything, or unadded me on snapchat. I've told myself ""maybe he was too into it and that scared him because he's never been out with anyone who wasn't a cis-woman"", ""maybe he's just trying to not get hurt again"", ""maybe he's waiting till he gets back to where we both are to hit me up so we're not just mindlessly talking"", etc. But I've also just told myself maybe he wanted to experiment and got scared off by me asking for more.....

I feel like the last thing I should do is contact him and ask for clarity, the lack of action is my answer but still I know there was more there than meets the eye. Should I just cut my losses and move on, is he a chaser, shouldI just wait because good things happen to those that do, should I snapchat him? ughhhh....",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1148831,public,self,Late night hookup turned into potential blossoming romance?

Sup guys. 

So usually I’ve always been good with girls but recently I’ve been seeing this girl who I’ve known for nearly a decade and we’ve been on and off for years.

Sometimes she’s constantly messaging me being really nice and having good conversations then next it’s like a dry dinner.

We met up last week (NYE kissing under the fireworks) and we were kissing loads and talking about our lives and just getting on really well.

Since then we haven’t even really spoke and she hasn’t even mentioned about that night or plays it off to not speak about it.

Bottom line is, is she just playing me along? I’ve never met such a person to be difficult to read. Any advice would be great.

I’ve only had to disclose once before and it was via text to a guy who I’ve been sleeping with casually for about four years at the time. This instance didn’t really bother me because the relationship between us was a FWB without the friends part.

I like this guy and do want to sleep with him eventually so I know I’ll need to tell him but I’m wondering if I’ve just left it too long now.

He’s 26M and seems really sincere in person but he also plays football with some cousins of mine so I unfortunately have heard countless stories of his immaturity - but then again it sort of seems like locker room talk at the same time.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1148852,public,self,When do I disclose?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rww30b/when_do_i_disclose/,no_ads,0.0,dating,,,,
