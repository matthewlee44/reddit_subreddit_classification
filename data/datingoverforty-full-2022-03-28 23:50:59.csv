So, we saw each other and had sex again. This was totally different. He was able to get an erection and maintain it. However, there’s a whole new set of issues now. He was very, very rough with me. And I’m uncomfortable about it because I never agreed to any of it. At the same time, I went along with it because I felt very uncomfortable in the situation and I just wanted it to be over. So, I’m not blaming him particularly. I just don’t understand.
 
It was like something out of a porn. He kept saying really dirty things and then telling me to repeat them, pulling my hair in a way that was way past anything that could possibly feel good, slapping me. At one point I was laying down and he tried to deep throat me without my permission and I pushed him off. I told him that that was uncomfortable and later on he made a joke that we have to work on that.
 
After, he was teasing me. That’s normal because we tease each other a lot. But I asked him to please lay off and just give me a few minutes of being kind and sweet. And, he didn’t. He kept up with it. Then, when it was time to go, he made a joke kind of throwing my clothes at me and giving me a high five. He saw the look on my face because I was really upset by this point. He tried to give me a hug and a kiss but I just kissed him quickly and walked out. A few minutes later he texted me that he had a wonderful time with me and that he hoped that I wasn’t upset by the high five joke at the end. He referred to me as a great potential girlfriend. This has more to do with the fact that he has asked me to be his girlfriend and I have not agreed, yet.
 
Also, i’m not against a lot of the things that we were doing today. But, I tend to do them in a relationship where intimacy and consent has already been built and given, and my comfort is prioritized
 
So I guess my question is, what the hell was that? I think there’s an argument to made that he thought I was enjoying myself. But until this point he’s been nothing but kind and sweet and respectful. Is it an issue with porn? Is he a secret asshole? Did I fuck it up by not being clearer?

Was widowed 3 years ago, grieved and lost almost 30 pounds after one year. Met a guy on OLD and entered into a 18 month situation-ship. The early days of dating this guy was the only days I experienced happiness again after a long long time. Unfortunately I later found out I was the rebound interim relationship for him and also found out he was multi dating and full of red flags ( eg cheating on his gf , impregnating another woman) . As much as I liked his company , I knew he was toxic for me. I was one of the few girls he was multi dating and I was also eventually  obviously affected by how he treated me in comparison to the others. Like a drug addict and alcoholic I knew he was the distraction and the crutch I used to get out of the grief I was previously feeling. I know this because when I was with him I was happy and when I wasn’t , I was experiencing other emotions other than grief even if it wasn’t happiness. I think perhaps it might be avoidance but I just rather be feeling other emotions than to go back to feeling depressed again. 
Like a alcoholic trying to sober up, I knew the problem so I eventually succeeded distancing myself from him. I told him that I didn’t think I should keep this going and him not responding to that text gave me the response I needed ( that he didn’t care whether I left or didn’t) so I went no contact ( by not initiating contact) for almost 35 days now. I know I read everywhere that time heals all wounds but I found myself going back to being depressed again and the last 35 days had been difficult and every day I craved being in contact again. 

I am confused why the 30+ days of no contact isn’t helping in my case especially when I was never in an actual relationship with this guy and neither do I understand why I am obsessed with texting a guy whom I know is toxic for me. 

I am considering seeing a psychiatrist to get on anti depressants so I am not looking for responses for me to go for therapy or to get psychiatric help. 

I need some positive stories, words of encouragement or even just ideas on why I might be so hung up.

To start off with I'm a straight guy, I don't have kids, I'm quite settled in my career, I enjoy what I do for a living so I can't complain too much, my life is okay. Like most people here, I'd like to fall in love and build something meaningful, maybe start a family.... however I'm finding that dating , especially over the last 5 years has become a little difficult.

A bit of background, in my 20s I actually had a fantastic relationship, I was in love with a girl and life was good, I honestly thought we'd get married. But I'm also someone who has suffered from depression so it's basically my fault that the relationship fell apart, as I became someone who was hard to communicate with and began to shut myself off.  I did date a litle in my 20s but maybe not as much as I should have done after that relationship ended

Early 30s was my ""bad phase"" , I did sleep around, I think I drank and partied too much and I didn't make any serious attempts to actually date and settle down. But after a while,  I got my head down , I was promoted at work, I became a homeowner and I started putting some serious thought into dating. I've always looked after my physical health, so even on my worst days I'll still try and do something physical and finding a woman to date has never been a problem in the past.  I had 2 fairly good relationships with women I met on Tinder, the first woman was in her mid 20s , she wasn't planning on getting married or having kids , but she wanted something to last for a year or two and that's what happened.  I then dated someone a little older in her early 40s, she was fascinating, a lot of fun, however her job involved her having to go away to France for long spells, which did make things difficult  and eventually we broke up

I took a break and then dated some more but by my late 30s I was finding it increasingly hard to meet anyone I would click with, I'd date but there would be zero connection. Basically as the title suggests, I don't live in London, LA or New York, it's basically a crap town in Northern England with high unemployment etc and a limited dating pool. My last date was with a woman who had 3 teenagers and she was basically asking me to move in with her by the 2nd date.... nope.  I don't mind kids, my niece and nephew love me, I have good relationships with my friends kids but the more I think about it, I just can't see myself sharing my house with someone who has multiple children, I'd be fine if someone had one child though. My date before that was 32 and had been unemployed for 5 years, again I know a lot of guys would want to ""smash"" (thank Trevor Noah for teaching me that word) but for me it's just a massive turn off.    We've had the pandemic and that's taken 2 years away from me where dating became near impossible and that makes me a little sad

It does feel like I've had a period of ""mourning"" in a strange way, and lately I'm finding I might well be okay if I never settled down now. As a kid I also wanted to be a superstar rapper but that was a dream that died so I know we can't have everything :) Obviously if I click with someone , I will make the effort, but I haven't been on Tinder or other apps in quite some time, as it feels soul crushing these days as I find it hard to get excited or attracted to any of my ""matches"". Maybe my standards are too high and I should lower them? I'm not someone who's expecting an Amal Clooney to pop up but it would be nice to date someone who's doing something interesting with her life and either has no kids or just 1. Also someone age appropriate, I had a disastrous date with a 23 year old where she invited me back to her house but it was so messy and dusty that it triggered an allergic reaction in me and I had to bail lol. I'm not even that worried about sex, at this point in life I'd like it to be meaningful with someone I'm really into, and I think the 2 years of staying in has changed a lot of men and women in that way

I also don't have many good guy friends, the guys who were my friends a few years back are asses ,my two best friends these days are wonderul women in settled relationships so I don't really have wing men to go out for drinks with etc, but I can always  have some company for a meal,  movies,  shopping or when I walk my dog so it's hard to meet anyone in the old fashioned way.

We are very amicable and get along fine for the sake of our daughter. Her (46) divorced 4 years after a 19 year marriage, 3 kids. We have known each other socially for about 12 years. We were together professionally 3 years ago at an event. I thought then that she was great to be around, stable and we share a lot of the same interests, but I was married. 

We went to lunch, professionally 5 months ago. Over the last 3 months we have gone to lunch several times. Last week I asked if she wanted to go to lunch and she suggested dinner. I always ask if she wants me to pick the spot or if she wants to and she asked that I do it. I picked one of the nicest places in town. We enjoyed drinks and a great dinner, the 3 hours flew by.

We have a ton in common. I feel like the signs are there, she is always really complimentary about my style and looks, wants me to teach her how to cook and wants to workout together. It feels like the interest is there, she has asked to go out to lunch a few times, so it isn't always me asking. I guess my question is should I just ask her what her thoughts are about dating? I haven't done this for 25
years, so I have no clue. Anyway, sorry for the long rant, just looking for some advice.
