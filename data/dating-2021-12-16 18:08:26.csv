0,ri4fzu,1639701006,Is it just too late for me?,"Hello (25/f) here,

I’m at an age where most of my friends are long term relationships, newly weds or married with children. The older I’m getting the less likely finding someone is looking for me.

I’m decent looking but extremely shy. My personality isn’t too bad either, just takes a minute for me to get comfortable. When I was younger Instagram and Twitter mutuals were the only *”sources”* of meeting guys but I’ve grown out of social media now. I think a lot has changed from 2016 social media and now.

At first I was waiting loose my virginity to someone I loved and would end up marrying but I think I’ve steer so far away from it maybe I’ll never be able to do it now. 

I don’t know any men irl and I’m extremely shy. Any time I get compliments I don’t know what to do other than smile like a giddy school girl. I’m worried that my time has past. Most people my age have experience and would see my lack of as a red flag. Like what’s wrong with me. Why hasn’t anyone ever tried to pursue me sort of thing. 

I’ve tried online dating (apps) but I’m not looking for a purely sexual relationship. Sure it’ll come along but to sign up to something with the expectation of it doesn’t really sound appealing to me. 

I have no one to talk to. I want someone to share my feelings and thoughts with. This might sound sad but I feel so lonely. I was okay when I was younger because I was surrounded but family and friends in similar life stages, now I have no one. 

Even my parents have gone off to travel the world now that my siblings have grown up too. I can’t make plans with anyone because it’s my husband this, my boyfriend that or I can’t we’re staying in with the kids tonight. The other half of my friends are pregnant. 

Sounds like a pity party but I want some advice. I want to find someone too. It’s getting so lonely as I get older.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ri4fzu/is_it_just_too_late_for_me/

There was a guy with his daughter &amp; the kid was kinda in the way, so my husband saw her &amp; stopped the cart to let the little girl pass, the dad looked at my husband &amp; didn’t say anything, no “thank you” or “sorry about that”. My husband kept going &amp; looked at me &amp; jokingly said “okay we’ll next time I’ll just run ya kid over” &amp; shook his head. Of course with my OCD, this triggered me &amp; made me be like “what if he really would”. I told him about it in the car &amp; he apologized &amp; said “I’d never do that, it was a bad joke.

8,ri5fx8,1639704017,A vent,"I know logically I need to move on. I just.....

I (35F) met a guy (38M) on tinder in July. He has a lot of baggage, but honestly the sweetest guy I've ever met. First date was fantastic, like 5 hours long, and only ended because we both had a drive and needed to get home. Then both of our lives blew up, and it took a month before date 2, but we talked most days in between. Date 2 was great too, again ended because it was getting late. 

Then our lives blew up again, him slightly more than me. Conversations became less frequent, he would go days, a week+, even the entire month of October before responding. Things seemed better through thanksgiving, with only a few days MIA (which is totally fine, we both have lives).

It's been another two weeks of silence. Which bothered me, but I justified. Until I glanced at his tinder profile to show a friend a picture, and realized it had been updated slightly. So obviously he has some level of free time on his phone.

I honestly don't think he's the type to consciously ghost, and every other time he's gone silent we would pick things up and be just as flirty as before. I don't mind playing the long game given his history, but not knowing where we stand (at least explicitly) is driving me insane.

Given the season, I've decided to give him a last ""Merry Christmas"" text next week, and if I hear nothing by new years it'll be a Dear John situation. I'm probably wasting my time, but....idk, from the first conversation there was just something different and it's harder than general for me to walk away.

9,ri5iob,1639704251,"For those of you in relationships, how do you maintain your friendships with friends that are always single?","Ive been in 2 LTR and I'm currently in one now.  I'm probably going to propose within the next month (she's now really on my case about it). During these times, I've struggled to make time for my single friends. With my friends that are in relationships, it's easy to plan double dates and vacations together. It's great when you have friends on the same page as you in life that are on the way to getting married and hopefully having kids in the near future. 

I feel like I have less in common with my 2-3 good friends that are just always single. I don't have interest in going to bars and drinking.  I don't enjoy talking about pursing romantic partners and dating drama. This was cool in my 20s, but I'm 36 now. These friends that stay single want to be in relationships, but they just make poor decisions on the people that they go out on dates with (female friends just swiping on hot guys while passing over good quality guys) or they refuse to put themselves out there to find a partner. 

Once I'm married and living together with my future wife, I just see the struggle increasing in maintaining these friendships. These friends mean a lot to me and they were there for me during a bad breakup 2 years ago, so I feel really selfish by not being there to give them my full attention.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ri5iob/for_those_of_you_in_relationships_how_do_you/

He's a great guy and I really like spending time with him. A few days ago, he told me that he was getting me a Christmas gift. Money has been extremely tight for me lately, so I told him he didn't have to since I wouldn't be able to get him anything and I would feel bad, but he assured me that it didn't matter and he didn't care, he just wanted to get me a little something. I let it go, assuming that it would be something really small, and went on with my life. 

Today we were texting and he said he got me 3 things... 3 THINGS. I immediately felt awful. I started running around my apartment trying to find something he might like, but I don't think he would really like anything I own. I tried to see if I had any ingredients to bake him something but every recipe I find I'm missing things. As a very broke college student, I literally don't have any money to spend and I just feel bad that he got me so many things and I got him nothing. I know he already said that it was ok and he didn't care, but the guilt isn't going away.

We're going on a date tomorrow and he said he's giving me my presents then, so I don't even have time to pull together some cash to get him something. I know I need to just calm down and let it go, but man it's tough.

15,ri5wej,1639705467,I'm really struggling.,"Hi im a (f25)I was in a toxic 4 year relationship with my ex and he seriously fucked me up emotionally/mentally with his lies. He would lie abt everything especially the number of people he's dated/slept with, what they looked like, what they did together, etc. Basically trying to tell me how wild his life was before he met me. His lies made me feel very insecure abt myself physically and sexually (as I would compare his stories with our relationship), they created doubt in every truth he told. I would find many discrepancies in his stories - they wouldn't make sense and it would drive me crazy because I didn't know what was a lie and what was the truth. This created fights every single day. Eventually he admitted everything was a lie and that he was sexually insecure. It was an extremely toxic relationship.. it took me a long time to get out of it. 

I am now dating someone new, we have been together for a year, this new relationship is the complete opposite of my previous one. My boyfriend is extremely loving and caring. We handle conflict in a very healthy way and do not fight at all. I recently caught him in a lie, I confronted him and he came clean. Ever since he lied I started to go back and realized there are discrepancies in his other stories specifically abt the last person he was with. I've been going down these rabbit holes wanting to ask him abt everything that isn't adding up. His dishonesty has me feeling very insecure again, just like in my previous relationship.

Tldr- I feel myself pulling away in my very loving relationship, help! 

I (20f) have been dating my boyfriend (21) for about three months now. Our relationship moved incredibly quickly. We met at a party, slept together that night, then thereafter were inseparable because we hit it off so well. Two weeks in he asked me to be his girlfriend and about a week following he said “I love you”, and I reciprocated. This little blurb is already probably setting off red flags to anyone reading but it felt so right in the moment. But now three months in it’s all catching up to me and just last week I hit a major wall in terms “how did I get here??”, and began feeling very stressed out about being so close/ having an obligation to this person. When we met I was not in a place to start a serious relationship, (but I liked him a lot, I didn’t want to turn him down and things just felt fun and light. Whereas now it’s setting in that this is a serious, emotionally invested relationship). He makes it clear to me daily how invested he is and treats me incredibly, he is so loving. Yet I still find myself with these dilemmas: 
Where I am now is: 
I just can’t make myself be intimate/ physical with him. I am very attracted to him but I feel this internal “no” That just won’t let me and leaves me feeling tense when it’s just he and I alone. And I’m torturing myself over this situation day in and day out. I feel awful that I can’t stop pulling away from him because he deserves his care to be reciprocated. 

He wants me  to meet his family over Christmas when we’re both traveling back to our shared hometown. There’s a part of me that wants to tell him I need space over the holiday to just focus on myself and my family so I can figure out what the hell is going on inside my head and my heart.

please don’t be mean. i’m not okay at all. 


he’s been emotionally abusive for months and months but i never thought he was capable of something like this. he was driving and we were having a normal argument. i was sitting behind him on his moving bike and he pushed me on the highway and i fell on top of a car. there was a loud thud, he didn’t even look back once and drove home. 
one of my leg was bleeding and the other felt..broken. i got to the side of the road and the owner of the car on top of whom i fell came and asked me if i was okay. the car owner thought that my bf ran away because he hit his car but he didn’t know that his bike didn’t hit the car, it was me. 
it felt so humiliating, cheap and small when i sat on the side of the road, crying. i felt like…i’m nothing . i’m worthless. i wish no one has to ever experience this feeling. people were looking at me cheaply..i was so scared. he car guy had other guys in his car too and he offered to take me home but since there were many guys, i refused because i felt unsafe and scared. 
i just couldn’t believe my bf did this. i could never do this to someone…especially if i claim to love them more than anything. i would never throw anyone from a moving bike and then not even look back..
i had to call him because i had no money…and i was 50 mins away from home. after an hour of begging, he returned. things only got worse from here. he started hitting me. he hit me with his bare hands, his helmet, his keys and even beat my neck with his phone. after finding out my leg was broken, he stepped on my leg and kicked it. he spat on my face…called me cheap names, abused my family, i just can’t say it all even here…i feel so humiliated and ashamed and small…i just felt like i was..nothing. i am nothing. 
he also told me to sell my body to get home. he said i deserved to get raped by those guys in the car and he told me i’m good for nothing but sex. he just said really cheap things..i cant even say them. 
he then threw me on the road again and went home…

i cant talk about this to anyone that’s why i’m sharing it here. i’m 20 years old but i still live with my parents and where i live, if my parents find out, they’ll never let me leave the house. all my freedom will be taken away. 

i also recorded all of this on audio. maybe someday, i’ll be strong enough to do something. 

i’m just so…scared. how could he do this to me? all i ever did was..love him..i could never do this to him or anyone. i feel humiliated, belittled. i don’t even feel like a human. i feel like i’m nothing. i feel so scared. i went to the doctor and my leg was broken…i keep having panic attacks. i kept having dreams all night where i was trying to just love him and he kept hitting me..i am so scared..all i wanted was for someone to hold me and make everything okay. i even begged him to hug me even after all this because i felt so scared. i just wanted someone, anyone to hold me and just make me feel safe. 

i have an important exam in 4 months. i couldn’t clear it this year because of something he did..i don’t want to get into it rn. i am just scared. if i don’t pass now, my life will be over. my parents already hate me. i feel like i can’t do this anymore…i’m just so scared and i feel worthless..


it’s 5 am. i just woke up and had a panic attack…im really scared. i talked to my best friend last night and she started crying and said that she is scared that i’ll do something to myself. i don’t know what to do…i just want to feel safe..",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ri61h2/i_just_got_physically_assaulted_by_my_bf/

So as the title suggests, I have unfortunately never dated anyone and I am a 30-Year-Old virgin (Only 10 more years until I get my own movie haha), and I do not have any friendships, which you may have guessed, has been pretty difficult for me.

I wouldn’t consider myself bad looking, my job is decent and I do financially fairly well, and have a handful of hobbies and interests I’m passionate about (playing/watching basketball being my absolute biggest interest). I’ve tried to put myself out there, but I have had serious issues with rejection in both women and friendships. It has been really hard on me and I am actively in therapy trying to mitigate that sadness and working on myself.

Are there many of you out there that are or were previously in a situation as me? Maybe some of you understand the juxtaposition of knowing you want to be a happy person people actually enjoy being around to not being able to make it happen. If so, we’re you able to get some opportunities at friendship and romance? I’d love to hear how you did it and see if your approach could help me.

Entering my 30s, I’d love to finally go on a fun date, have close friends and a sex life, but if that can’t happen I’d love to mentally give that up and put my eggs in another basket - love and friends might not be for everyone but I’d like to try!

We have made out but no sex. During the 3rd date we both said that we enjoy each other company, we both feel good about our dates and would like to keep seeing each other. I ask for his opinion regarding multi-dating vs dating one person at a time, he said that he thinks it’s respectful to only date one person at a time. I said I agree with him. Together we then made plan for our 4th date a week later. We send several texts to each other every day during the week.

The morning of the day that we were supposed to have our 4th date, he texted me saying that he was not feeling well so we would have to reschedule the date next week. I asked him whether he is still interested in dating each other exclusively. Normally this guy replies to texts within 30 minutes at most, this time he took over 2 hours to reply to my text with a “yes, I do.” Later that evening, he texted me asking if I can do a phone or video call, I agreed to a video call. He was in his bed and appeared to be sick, nothing too out of the ordinary from the video call but he seems to be a bit weird (he kept asking me why I was shouting, I told him I was not it’s just my normal voice). After that video call I did not get another text from him, which is out of the ordinary as he would normally reach out to me during the day.

The following evening (almost 24 hours after the video call) I sent him a text asking if he was feeling better, no reply from him. 3 days later (yesterday) I sent him another text asking if he is still interested in seeing each other, and that I would appreciate if he could let me know either way. No reply from him so I believed he ghosted me and ready to move on. Today (over 24 hours from my last text) he just sent me a text that says “Hey I am really sorry I was dealing with something really personal. It’s no excuse.

But once it closed and the auto work was completed on my car, I made this new gym my go to spot despite the local one now being open.

We have good chemistry, things in common, and were both pretty well put together as adults. Seems great for a potential partner.

Thing is that we discussed our 5 year plans and mine was basically career and dream oriented (save money, advance my career, pursue making music more) hers was literally just be married and have a kid at 32. This kinda gave me great pause. I do enjoy this lady and though weve only had two dates i do feel like we have good chemistry. Part of me wants to keep seeing her. However another part of me is completely terrified of having kids. Housing, education, general life costs seem to constantly go up without wages ever increasing. On one hand i think having a family could be rewarding but on the other hand ending my family cycle of being poor while focusing on my dreams sounds amazing too. 32 seems so young to me to be a father but its actually totally the norm and more and more women will bring this up on dates around my age now.

Thoughts? Im pretty lonely sometimes and it seems like most people want kids so if i make this a dealbreaker i might just be single indefinitely. At the same time though I really cannot imagine being a dad within 5 years right now and dont know if id end up resenting starting a family.

I started dating a cute girl, much better looking than me at least, and immediately people who were before neutral towards me started being hostile, they would start to be prickly to me at work, especially when she would come and visit me at work, and sometimes they would actively seek to make me look bad in front of her..... like once my manager specifically waited for her to come in to rage at me over something.... and other times they tried to out alpha me around her, as in they would deliberately bring up embarrassing moments from my past or take a passive aggressive or snark tone in response to me.

I think regardless of their intentions,  when a guy sees another guy with a pretty girl , it can sometimes trigger a response in him that makes them combative ,like ""he must think he's much better than me"", similar to someone having a high position at work or having big muscles.

First, I quit almost every vice I had, most importantly alcohol. I no longer got hangovers, mood swings, no black-out drunken texting etc. Next I focused on diet and exercise, had to get my brain right. Alternating days with cardio and weight lifting, while eating a diet of mostly vegetables with some fish and occasional chicken did wonders for me. After that I stopped procrastinating, I deactivated all my social networking apps, I put aside my phone for hours at a time to focus at work, I became an important asset at work which solidified my role and now I have a job for the foreseeable future. I saved up money, which I would of spent on booze, it led me to upgrading my apartment. I went from a studio shack to a sweet loft. Now that my finances and shelter were set, I learned to love spending time with myself, being alone. I got back into gaming, reading, and picked up a guitar. I believe if you’re happy alone, it takes a lot of the pressure to be with someone off. When I went on dates I didn’t care if they liked me, because I liked myself. I knew I would be fine with or without them. Every few months I tested the waters from time to time on dating apps, went on a few dates, but I never felt a connection. I stayed patient, continued everything above, and then one random day a year later, I matched with her. She’s perfect. She’s quickly becoming my best friend, I love our stupid inside jokes, I love that she also loves gaming, reading, and all the stupid shows I love. I knew it the moment I met her. It was like coming home, only to no home I’ve ever known. Thanks for reading, I’m hoping this helps someone thinking about becoming their best self.

Now it’s December, and I have made close to no efforts to meet women. I’ve made and/or improved dating profiles on Facebook Dating &amp; Bumble recently, but I haven’t spent any money on anything other than Bumble because I don’t want to become addicted to dating apps like I did last time (part of the reason I settled is because I was losing so much money on dating apps). But other than that, I stopped putting myself out there because there’s basically no point if nobody I find attractive will give me attention. I also find it incredibly stupid to have to put dating apps on my monthly expenses, especially if I have no idea when it will end, and because of the fact that I will be living on my own soon and have a lot more financial responsibility. I’ll either have to settle for unattractive people or stay single forever.

I then gave her my number and told her we should chat and I'm sure we'd be laughing the whole time, but she just kind of ignored it and talked about something else.

I'm confused as to why she's so interested in me but won't so much as talk on the phone. Hell today she was telling me how pretty my eyes were and she thought my name was really pretty, mixed signals much? I'm really just wondering what I can do to take this from just text chatting to at least a phone call to get things moving.

We are in an LDR and hence, usually when I hit my periods, he is far away from me. But this time, we were together when I was in my days.

I never had a boyfriend who bought sanitary pads for me(I always felt awkward about it). But, with him, I just casually told him on the way back from my work to get a packet of sanitary pads for me. He exactly knows how moody I get though, and as I walked in the room, I find my sanitary pads and a bouquet of flowers and some chocolates laid on the bed.

He welcomed me with the biggest smile and the brightest eyes. Massaged my shoulders and ran a bath for me. I never felt so pampered like this ever before. Took me out to my favorite restaurant and even entertained me for the night with his silly little happy dance and singing his heart out.

He never sang in front of me, nor danced, but, that night, he didn't care. He knew I would never judge him. And that too, made me feel that, even when I am bleeding and in pain, he wouldn't judge me too. He made me feel so comfortable and special.

He is a very sweet guy and he always takes care of every little thing of mine. But, this time, he won it.

Went on a date with a girl last Sat. justa lunch date, a get-to-know you type thing. I thought it went well. But I have fucked this up before and showed all my cards within about 15 minutes. Well, things have changed a little bit. I know now that isn't the way to play the game. So after the date I labeled her name as ""Don't Do It"" in my phone. That way whenever I felt a little insecure and wanted that validation that makes me so high on life. I would remember. Now is not the time to show your cards.

For real, it SUCKED, I wanted to remind her that I am around. But whenever I thought of texting her I saw the message. ""Don't Do It"" It worked, it made me realize that she isn't the only one out there. I went to work, earned my money and didn''t succumb to that pathetic text asking ""How did your day go?"" 

Though she didn't reach out for a few days, I stood my ground. I am what I am, take it or leave it. Truth is I have other options, just like she does. So I am playing RDR2 on a Thursday night and guess who got a text from one of the most beautiful brunettes in the area? 

My friends. My brothers. You are worth more, just like everyone says. You gotta believe in yourself. It doesn't really matter if she texts you or not. It is more about who you think you are. So my advice is, that when you feel you aren't nothing but a bucket of shit just give yourself a little extra credit. You are what you are and as long as you're ok with that; the rest is just getting others to follow suit. Now, get out there, find someone you like and believe in yourself. Best of luck! Wish me luck!

Asked her out in Sep. 2019 since I saw her on Tinder. Got a ""not interested"" back, life went on.

Candidate we both worked for filed for a 2022 rematch back in the spring, so since this past June we've once again been spending most of our weekends together working on campaign stuff.

Not until after the campaign ends in March/May since I don't want to once again shit where I eat, but definitely after that ends.

Of course, all my friends that I've asked have told me to not push this further - that she knows my intentions and would make a move if she's interested - and I don't want to revert back to the pushy creep that I was back in high school. 

Should I continue dwelling on this? Or heed my friends' advice, and move along? Is 2.5 years enough of a gap in this regard?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ri9zzq/when_if_ever_is_it_okay_to_ask_someone_out_for_a/
59,ria1qe,1639718850,Would you dismiss someone for his height when he’s great in every other aspect?,"I recently started dating this guy. He’s a businessman in mid 30s. And I am in my late 20s. We have quite a lot to talk about. He knows so much and I learn so much from talking to him. I admire his brain. He had a very successful business which he sold a few years ago. I knew he was some sort of entrepreuner but I didn’t know he was quite wealthy until we went out a few times. He is also very confident, funny, extremely hardworking and has a big heart, always full of energy. He never brags about his wealth(maybe only slightly to impress me lol) I find all these qualities attractive. Oh, one last thing, he is caring, and very respectful of me and appreciates me for who I am. 

But he is short. He said in his dating profile that he’s 5’9, but he’s probably 5’7. Also got a bit of a chubby belly.  I am 5’2, fit and attractive. In the past, all my ex-es were over 6 feet, I guess subconsciously to compensate the fact that I am short(as I was teased at school for being small) I also want my future kids to be at least decent height, especially if it is a boy. 

So I am a bit torn…I don’t want to miss out on a great man but at the same time physically he isn’t the type that I usually go for or find attractive. Any thoughts?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ria1qe/would_you_dismiss_someone_for_his_height_when_hes/

61,ria99k,1639719600,Just met the most wonderful woman... But...,"24M. I was in a really toxic 3year relationship. I broke up with my ex almost 2 years ago. Since then, i decided to be a fuckboy. I have been with 25 girls in dates, honestly just trying to have sex. 

Two months ago, at an arcade place I go often to pick up chicks, I approached this girl. She was pretty to my eyes, took my breath away. She seemed really interested. I asked for her snapchat, and then later left the place. 

She reached out to me first, we talked for 4 days and then went on our first date. The date was the most incredible date ive been in all of my life. No kidding, amusement park, beach, alcohol, the fucking best. We kissed and had sex that same night. The problem here is that she told me she was married, but that her husband and her were sleeping on a different room, that they were no longer together. That the love was over, and that she stayed because of their kid and because he is going to help her become a US resident.

After that, the next night, I brought her to my house and she spent the night, then the next day we chilled all day in my room, she spent the night again and then I dropped her off. No calls from her husband at all. 

We have been doing this weekly, and I really feel like she is so special. Like Ive said, ive been a fuck boy. I have slept with 15 girls this past year, even slept over. But I havent had this romantic feeling towards them, the time together is wonderful. I never want her to leave, Im never bored of her and the thing here is, that she feels the same about me.

I know its fast, but I have some really deep feelings for her already, and she tells me she does too. She has a lot of great things. She is not looking for money, Ive been unemployed since I met her, and she has paid for a lot of my shit without asking anything in return. Her sex is amazing, she is a fucking nympho and pleases me in every sexual way. She is romantic, we talk all day everyday. Our chemistry is through the roofs, honestly, since my ex, i haven't felt anything like this. I just feel like I can't lose her, like maybe, even if I sound crazy as fuck... Maybe she is the love of my life...

She left her husband's house a month ago. She went back to her mom's. Weve been seeing each other at least 2-3 times a week. Almost always ending on a sleepover. She brought up the ""exclusivity talk"" because she probably sensed that I was a ho, and I asked her to be my girl

A week ago, she asked me If I could help her move her stuff from her old apartment. The now ""ex"" wasn't there. That day I asked her, because I had my suspicions, that if she and her ex were really sleeping in different rooms like she told me 2 to 3 times when we werent official... She said that they were sleeping together.

That shit broke my heart to be honest. Since then I feel less trust for her. Now I'm not going to act like a Saint, when we weren't official I had 5 sex partners including her. But I have dropped them for her now. And I lied to her about that too when she asked me. She said that she lied to me because she did not want to lose me, I did the same.

That shit has been drilling my fucking mind, I dont wanna fuck shit up, because as crazy as it sounds, she is my baby and i feel a lot for her, but it just hurts me to think that the ""relationship"" wasn't over over. That she lied to me. Now I know its unfair, because is not like I wasn't fucking nobody since i met her. In fact, after I dropped her off when she first came to sleep in my house, I went to a party and met this girl, which I had sex with the same night and we had sex after that many times. 

Is this something bad? I don't think Ill leave her to be honest, I wanna squeeze every single moment I have with her because she is so special. Am I self sabotaging myself?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ria99k/just_met_the_most_wonderful_woman_but/

74,rica4a,1639727066,I have liked this girl for years and now I think I have a chance but I don’t want to blow it," I first met her in on our senior year of high school in math class. She was the pretty and nice girl that sat next to me for some reason considering I used to be pretty skinny, tall, awkward and shy guy. She was completely different from me. She was talkative, sweet, nice, bubbly so it was a surprise to me when she asked me what I was reading. I used to read comics, manga, etc, so I was shocked she was engaging and asked me questions, listened to me with interest when she admitted she had no clue how to even read comics. 

I ended up offering her some of mine to read and taught her how to read them. At that point I had a small crush on her but she was dating this soccer player and we lost touch after graduation. Which was a bummer because I always had her in the back of my mind but life went on, got into tech so I make pretty great money and working out so girls like me more now but I still think in the back of my head if they really like me or just think I’m well off and attractive? So dating in the city is just depressing and then by some stroke of luck or twisted fate, my older sister told me a few weeks before thanksgiving that she had made a new co-worker friend. 

She tells me she invited her to come have lunch with us and it’s her. My old high school crush. She’s now (F29) and I am (M29) I instantly knew who she was and she was so surprised to see me again and mentioned “I always remembered you! You taught me how to read comics and always shared yours with me.” we ended up taking for a while and she asked why I didn’t keep in touch? I didn’t want to mention that I liked her but after a bit more talking she tells me “you know what’s funny? I broke up with (ex) after I found out he was cheating but I was hoping you’d go to prom but I didn’t see you.”

Everything was going amazingly, and that was the only deal breaker, which does not make any sense at all. We met here on Reddit a month ago and it was going so well. We seemed to click, have a lot in common, and could easily talk to each other; we used to tell eachother that we liked each other a lot, how glad we were to have met one another, and how we wanted to be in eachother's life for a while. That obviously didn't last long. Lol.

I didn't like that we just had to be friends over that one insignificant thing and I ended up pulling away, even though we enjoyed talking to eachother and hanging out (online). I made new posts to meet people, and he followed suit and did the same. I asked him about something he said to me during that day and he told me that he didn't say what he did, even though he did. I asked something else, and he stopped responding as quickly as he usually did. I saw that he unfriended me on and was separating from me, even though I began to do it first. I got upset and sent him a goodbye message, and we definitely can't make up and be friends even after what I said.

Main part: He was a cool guy, and seemed decent for the most part, and was Christian, so I was told. I feel like my chances of meeting a decent partner would be higher if he's Christian. I'm spiritual myself and want a partner who is at least spiritual or believes in something. H also didn't care about my religion and just wanted to be with me, and I'm hoping to find someone who feels the same way, or is like him, to be honest.

I (M17) was an entertainer at a summer camp for kids, as many other teenagers. There was this girl (15) who I was getting along pretty well, and since i liked her, I thought to try actually flirt for the first time. Two weeks later, after a little success (but not really) we go with the kids to an aquapark. There she flirts back, and we spend a wonderful day together (while keeping an eye on the kids so they didn't drown themselves, and protecting a child from a group of perverts, ugh). On the way back, on the bus (so other people were around) we cuddle together as expected. Then, she guides my hand on her boobs, and I didn't know what to do, so after a while I just move it back and start petting her again. Then, she does the same thing. Now, I was down for a little playing, but not in a bus full of people (and kids). After that we texted a bit since I was in other location for the same job, and she was coming the after. I did a bit of flirting but she wasn't responding. Until the day she came, she told me that ""sadly for you, I have my period now""... And then proceeded to fall for an older (and more handsome) guy, which I was cool with since she was acting so strangely.

So I (20 sth. M) am an oversea scientific researcher in Aus, and two months or so after my journey started here COVID came, and then lockdown and lockdown again, which might literally ruin everything. So really not much chance to get into real friendship, relationship etc. even though I really hoped to and tried... 

I won't say I am a handsome guy like David Beckham, but at least would say it's a ""decent"" outlook I suppose ? also enjoy a wide range of hobbies from outside (sports) to inside (art). 

From others' point of view, I am bloody reliable and considerate and organized (acknowledged by whoever works with me, even just briefly interact with me for this and that...) and maybe a bit romantic or at least artistic (as one of my friends told me another one considered me like that lol). Plus, most people I am acquintance with would feel more than safe when I have their back, which I understand might be a great compliment as friends .... (but not sure, and please see below...

As for myself, I sometime would doubt whether I might be too good to be friend or too good to date lol, like a text I received before Xmas is like, ""could not ask for a better lab mate/collaborator, sth. like that...""; yeh so not sure maybe I am more suitable to work with instead of hanging out together, who knows... On the other hand, I also find myself difficult to adapt to my peers or generations, like I don't drink, I can hardly hold a casual conversation or chit chat (maybe bc I work with science and am more solution-orientated lol), I never play PC game, don't watch Netflix or whatever series etc. etc.; I usually could hold the talk better when it comes to my research or my hobbies, which are unfortunately quite specific and though might be interested but won't really last in a dating or hanging out scenario.  

So after spending my birthday alone again recently, and likely alone as well for the coming Xmas and new year, I really hope something could change in the new year, even though I also understand I might just be who I am LOL...

That's completely fine and we moved to messaging on a social media app that doesn't have people's full names.

We've been messaging each other for almost 3 weeks now, almost every day. We've covered the usual small talk topics, and she's been replying quickly and asks me questions back.

Today I asked her if she would be down to play an online game and have a voice only call. She declined the voice call but said yes to the game. This surprised me, I understand not wanting to meet IRL at first, but to also decline a voice call seems a bit too far. (maybe this is the part where I'm over reacting)

The reason I want to push beyond just texting is because I think it's much easier to determine if there's chemistry through voice/IRL and could avoid wasting each other's time if there isn't any chemistry.

Not sure what I should do. Is she just shy or am I being too pushy? How can I make her trust me as I feel like there's only so much you can do over text? Should I even keep messaging her or just move on?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ridaog/girl_from_old_only_wants_to_text_no_call/

88,ridp5z,1639733125,I (37M) had an insane encounter tonight with a girl I have been dating (37F). What do I do?,"TL;DR: Didn't sleep with a girl. Left. She flipped out.

So this girl I have been dating for 2 weeks (we've been out 3 times) sent me a late night booty call text: ""come fuck me.""

I figure, ok, we'll hook up again, but I wasn't ready for sex just yet. I like to build an emotional connection first. I told her ok, and I'm on my way. That's my bad. I did just say ok.

I go over, and she immediately jumps my bones. I take care of her, and she starts taking care of me. She stops and wants me to fuck her. I say I'm not ready yet. She gives me a handjob. She stops halfway through and saying nothing, rolls over and goes to sleep.

Ok, now I'm a bit frustrated, but I'm a big boy, I promised her a fuck I didn't deliver, and I am big on active and ongoing consent, so I just hold her.

30 minutes later, she starts falling asleep, so I hug her goodnight and whisper goodnight in her ear. She says it back.

I start pulling me arm away and get up to leave, and she FLIPS out on me. She says ""WHERE ARE YOU GOING!?""

I told her that I have an early morning and don't want to hit traffic.

""FINE. JUST LEAVE!?""

I then say we should slow down and offer to lay back down and hold her.

She then starts SCREAMING at me to get the fuck out over and over again.

I of course do and text her that I'm seriously concerned for her mental health. She blocks me.

92,rie4yw,1639735088,PUTTING HER ON ICE,"What’s you guys, I’ve been talking to this girl for about 1 month now and we have been seeing each other on the weekends throughout the month. Last weekend I ended up going to her house and we had sex. Days later I didn’t hit her up after that night and so did she. I thought I had made the mistake of not reaching back out and that she felt some type of way about it. So I called her and we talked for about 20 minutes of how our week has been and she didn’t ask why I did not reach out, so I ended asking if she felt some type of way about it , and she replied NO and I simply said ok good and switched the topic. She was doing things through the days before the call to try and make me jealous and “chase her”. So after the call she gave me the closure that she was running her manipulative mind games on me and now Im putting her on ICE. I stopped reaching out and flaked on group setting hangouts and put the stories on mute. Now I can tell she wants my attention even more by sending more snaps, posting more stories than usual, &amp; and trying to get my attention. I wanted to have some self respect for myself and now my worth. I want to show her that I won’t put up with the bullshit and I’ll leave if she doesn’t work for me back.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rie4yw/putting_her_on_ice/

We've had very intimate conversations about his father passing at a young age, divorce, etcetera, yesterday evening. We laugh a lot, as well. I actually had to stay over at his last night because I missed my bus, and we stayed up talking until 4 AM. But we barely touched each other all night, didn't kiss, whatsoever.

96,rif3rh,1639739196,I don’t know what to do and i need advice really bad please take time to read for sm1 with no friends,"So my ex from last year texted me about 2 weeks ago saying that he missed me and that he never actually got over me and he wanted to text me a lot during our 1yr breakup but was always nervous to do so cause i showed that i moved on and didnt care about him (which i did). The reason of our breakup wasnt because of a fight we have the healthiest relationship that anyone could ask for and hes loyal faithful and loving to me. The reason we broke up was cause my conservative muslim parents knew that i was dating him and i was physically involved with him, i had to cut him off and stop talking to him as my parents confiscated all my stuff (laptop,phone) and going out was extremely hard as my mom always has to know exactly who im going with and where and all of that, that all happened because of him, now things got better and i gained their trust back and even more. Im an 2004 girl and he’s an 2002 guy so im a senior in hs and he’s a 2nd yr college student. I don’t think the age gap is that much of a difference since i knew him before he got into college and other than that i’ll be turning 18 in 2022 and i’ll be in the same university. The problem here is that we’re texting everyday now and talking yet i dont think i’ll be able to see him much, and when i do i’ll always be paranoid and anxious to get caught by my parents and my life goes back to hell again. My thing is, i dont want to be texting him everyday and not being able to be around him as that makes me go thru double the pain than not texting him at all, however next year when i get into uni my life would be easier and i would be around him much more often. So is it alright if i open this topic with him? That i dont want to talk to him while im not able to be around him as much? In addition to that, he dated a very toxic girl in our yr break up and told me he had to go thru a lot of ppl to get over me, and the last girl he dated he had sex with (which isnt something common usually the extreme is just making out) and he used to spend 24/7 with her cause she ranaway from her house for 50days, he told me he nevwr actually liked her and never saw anyth long term with her due to her unstableness and how she used to threaten him that she’ll ruin her life, tell her parebts that he had sex with her so that her parents kill him (honour killing in arab countries read abt it) and her for committing such a sin. However she didnt do that and she’s in the same uni and gym as him and she did that on purpose to be around him more often sonce she’s severely attached and has BPD, he says he wants nothing to do with her since shes toxic and unstable and he says he wants to be around me for comfort. I don’t know what to do. Should i stop talking to him till i graduate (in june) and make sure my life is stable and my parents trust me and stop myself from gettibg hirt emotionally from missing him too much, or should i just keep on texting him and meeing up with him like once a month when i get the chance ? Then make things official again when i can be around him very more often when i get into university? What do u guys think about this whole situation i would really love some advice.
