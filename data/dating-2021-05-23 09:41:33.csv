3,nj9hzc,1621782118,Genuine interest VS mild interest,"Random thoughts.

Once you get used to someone showing genuine interest in getting to know you, it’s really hard to go back to people who are like “meh” about you. 

I met a guy while working who found out I was into jazz, so for the first date he surprised me with tickets to an outdoor jazz and dinner event near me. He drove 1.5 hours (he lives a state away) and offered me fare for an Uber there and back so I wouldn’t have to worry about driving home after drinking. 

Yesterday, another guy I met at work (new coworker) messaged me on social media. He asked when I’d be in *his* city and that we should “chill” when I do. I responded to be polite, and 10 hours later I got a too-cool-for-school response. Which I promptly left on read. 

Genuine interest is such a turn on. The mild interest of the second guy only made me appreciate the first guy that much more.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nj9hzc/genuine_interest_vs_mild_interest/
4,nj9kp8,1621782360,Should I meet up w/girl for 3rd time/“date”? How would you proceed in my situation?," Background: I met this girl twice back in October while she was visiting her friends in my city. It all happened in the same week. I met her online and we both have the same ethnicity. I was excited about her at first but must say was left disappointed after two dates. She also gave me vibes that she wanted to be just friends. Within two dates, I would have definitely had a kiss if not a lot more w/any other girl. I didn’t even try on her b/c I wasn’t getting that vibe. She didn’t live in my city but she planned to move here. Knowing that, I told myself, I would not press the issue with her (not try to kiss) and see what would happen in between the time she left and moved here (6 months).

In that time, she actually texted me a couple times (I never did any initiating) asking me how I was and what not. Then a couple weeks ago, I got a random text saying she moved here and she wants to meet up. I was out of town and said we could go out when I get back (still skeptical of her in the back of my mind). She texted again a week later asking if I was back in town. I had been for days but just never told her.  

If I am being honest, the only reason why I wouldn’t go out with her is b/c I really don’t want to pay for this dinner date we have lined up. I live in an expensive city and it could be well over $100 USD. My gut feeling is she just moved to a new city and wants to see a familiar face.  

My question is, should I just ask her if this is a date or does she want to be just friends first? It will obviously be weird and awkward but again, I don’t want to pay for an expensive dinner date if she wants to be just friends. I would actually be ok with being friends and going out if I didn’t have to pay for this date which I guess I kind of feel obliged to since I initiated it.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nj9kp8/should_i_meet_up_wgirl_for_3rd_timedate_how_would/

So a month ago I met this girl and I really like her! We have been meeting each other for a month (being sexually active) and she gives out clear signals that she like me too.

A thing i struggle a bit with now is to talk about ""us together"" in a meta-perspective. I dont wanna call us a couple, but I have a crush on her! I have been poly for a long time, but with this girl i feel something more special with, and when girls I have been poly with before hit me up now I feel unsure if i still wanna sleep with them.

I practice radical honesty and belive in telling the truth! The whole situation is slightly confusing to me and I feel like i should talk with her about it and hear what she thinks about the term dating etc, but I just dont know how. Just having talked about it would make me feel more relaxed with her.

Any tips for how to go about it and what to avoid? I clearly dont wanna ask her to be my girlfriend, I just wanna talk about the concept dating, our relationship and hear what her thoughts and feelings are.

Over the past few days since about Friday she has started sending messages way less frequently and seemingly will not go out of her way to further the conversation at all; barely asking any questions or bringing up any new points but just affirming what I say essentially. Today she cancelled the date tonight because she's hungover and suggested we have it another day. This all makes me think she's not really that interested, and if she isn't I'd like to stop wasting my time and emotions getting strung along because she's not wanting to hurt me by telling me how it is.

To be honest I forgot how to talk to a guy. If I'm in a social setting and I see a guy I think is cute then I approach them and try to talk to them. We usually end up making small talk. I'm not that confident to be straight up with a guy and say ""Hi, I think you're attractive and I'd like to get to know you more."" Going back into dating after a while is so scary lol. I also don't like the whole social media dating thing where you follow a guy's Instagram and they follow you, and then you like each other's photos, and then one of you proceeds to slide into the DMs of the other. That's so tedious to me. I'd rather meet guys in real life first.

Any advice/tips?","I already have anxiety and texting very much feels like a double-edged sword. It’s convenient, quick, and widely-used but there’s so much room for misinterpretation and miscommunication.. not to mention how agonizing it is when you’re waiting for a reply. 

My biggest source of anxiety is waiting for people to respond, especially someone I am really actively interested in and seeing. I don’t experience this with other people i.e. family/friends/neighbors/whoever. Or during the “get to know you” stage, I’m not that worried since I barely know them anyway. 

*It’s once I realize I like them and have some feelings that I send myself into a spiral of anxiety and mindfuckery* 

This is happening to me right now. He is a self-labeled extrovert and it definitely showed for the first 3 weeks. I had a genuinely good time, felt great being with him, and sometimes we didn’t even have to be doing anything to enjoy each other’s company and spend hours together. Now that it’s been almost a month, he says he’s just been feeling really introverted and doesn’t want to talk much. This is anxiety inducing because part of me thinks he’s flaking while the other part that’s understanding believes that a combination of things including illness, work, class, pets, life, etc as he became more introverted around the same time he got sick/things got stressful (side note: I’m more of an introvert so I don’t know if this is common for extroverts, it’s just my best guess if what’s happening)

I don’t want to be a pain to him and know I should probably reciprocate and talk less too just to match his energy. When I saw him this weekend, I brought a small thing of flowers and wine (nothing fancy) to cheer him up after a rough week. I stayed for 5 hours and we had more of a chill date just lying on the couch watching TV. I definitely noticed that he was more quiet and not as touchy. I really hope he’s able to be back to himself soon but in the mean time, how do I stop fucking my mind over? Or if any extroverts out there go through the same thing and can shed some light?

27,njb0k3,1621786614,Realisation rant - I like to play with fire!,"I've come to realise I like to play with fire - I go for men that I either 1) chase because they don't reciprocate my feelings, want what I want or actually even care about getting to know me or 2) choose men that I am completely incompatible with, often with drug/drink problems, misaligned social/political views or just straight up insecure that they act like mad men. 

It's not their fault. It's me. In every other aspect of my life I have my shit together - I have great relationships with friends &amp; family, I love my work, I'm actively involved with community, I'm intelligent, funny and I got a banging body. I'm interested in different pursuits and for the most part I'm open minded to improving myself. 

But when it comes to dating....train wreck. I recently messaged a guy that I've known for over a year...we reconnect every few months (I instigate) and usually hang out a few times before it goes south again and he becomes disinterested and ghosts me...yet I still chase. I joked to my mates that I was just bored and wouldn't mind a bang. After a week of speaking, he suggested to meet up...followed by his usual ghosting on the day, I still come out shocked and hurt...even though I know full well if you play with fire, you will get burned. 

So what's going on here? Well, I haven't actually dated properly or with intention in years....I'm not on dating apps...I'll occasionally redownload tinder for a shag, which most recently ended with a guy getting obsessed with me after a month and waking up to 13 notifications - essay and voicenote style, asking why I was online in the middle of the night and telling me how happy he was to finally sleep with a woman of colour...genuinely. 

I know I can do better and I know I deserve better than these rollercoaster relationships. But, I'm scared. I'm scared of actually trying to find someone on my level. What if they don't want me? What if we date and it ends? What if I fuck it up? So it's been easier not to try and not to have to deal with these potential outcomes. 

I'm not sure how to solve this as yet, but honestly this realisation alone is a big milestone.

So the issue i would face is they would do something that bothers me and i will just accept it and let it slowly pick at me before i finally cannot take it and let them know. For the times that i did tell them what was bothering me they either a) shrug it aside and disregard it or b) tell me that they are who they are and it is what it is so they cant possibly change. Because of these reactions i get its been instilled in my mind that whenever i would try to let my partner know how i am feeling it would go either a or b. Now i am in a very healthy and serious relationship with this guy who i really consider to be my life partner. Even though he assured me 1626373 times that he isnt like that and how he would actually go about if we were to come about any issues i just dont feel secure confiding in him.

I was hoping i would be able to help her feel comfortable but i am not sure how?

We text and talk all the time and i asked her if she has any feedback or if anything i do bothers her? Is there anything i can do differently? She says no, so i am at a loss. 

Based off this limited info... does anyone have any guidance? Has anyone been in a similar situation? Anything i could do to help bring us closer? Where do i draw the line? She is a great woman we are in contact everyday talking and texting. She is tough to make plans with a lot of the time. It's been starting to affect me personally.

I just don't want to disrespect her or miss out on a wonderful woman. I can't help but feel a bit down with the way things have been going lately....idk i am at a loss. Any help is greatly appreciated.

Any advice or perspective would be amazing. I don't know if i can do this much longer?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/njc95l/chick_doesnt_care_to_share/

39,njcegu,1621790615,Lack of success after getting matches and girls' numbers. What am I doing wrong?,"I've noticed that I seem to be getting quite a few matches on online dating apps such as Tinder, and in quite a few cases we end up taking the conversation over to WhatsApp, which involves getting their numbers. However, I'm too often finding that the text conversations appear to reach a dead end despite me trying to include things like jokes, icebreakers and asking them questions about themselves to show a genuine interest. I've even matched with a couple of people who seemed very keen to do lewd things or exchange nudes, but then their interest evaporates and everything falls through.

It's making me feel like I'm just not interesting enough to women, or that my texting technique leaves a lot to be desired and doesn't spark enough joy with them to think, ""right, let's meet up ASAP"". I feel like I am a genuinely interesting person but obviously limiting conversations to text hold this back a lot. Having dealt with a lack of interest from women for most of my life and especially during lockdown, a part of me wonders why I don't just pay for a hooker instead of a Tinder Gold membership 😂

It would at least be nice to get feedback from women as to why things don't progress.

That day he said, he is kinda loosing interest in me and I didn't know how to react.
He said he isn't sure that's why he called
I didn't react anything at all

I'm on dating apps but I haven't found a single person I'm remotely interested in in the past 6 months, except for this one guy I've been seeing since March. Our relationship started out super strong and he put in a lot of effort to get to know me, but we still haven't had the chance to go on a proper date because of lockdown. Every time I see him, we just go to his house and hang out with his roommates or watch movies. Our relationship just doesn't feel like it's progressing and we don't have the chance to really connect one-on-one.

I want something serious, and I don't think this relationship is heading that way. We have fun together and I like spending time with him, but we just don't see each other frequently enough to form a deeper relationship. I'm not feeling emotionally fulfilled in this relationship, and under normal circumstances I would never put up with it for this long and I would just move on to the next. However, I don't have any other options right now. He's fulfilling other needs of mine which is why I like seeing him and I like getting to know him, but I just don't know what to do.

59,njekrs,1621796618,[27M] Lack of romantic relationships and hearing about friends getting married,"I apologize in advance if I am not allowed to post this here, just wanted to vent as something has been bothering me since last night. 

I'm a South Asian-born raised in Canada since the age of 13. Due to my upbringing, being in a new culture, and getting bullied in school for my skin color (didn't learn about colorism till later on)...I didn't grow up with healthy self-esteem and confidence. Being born in a lower-middle-class family (parents only ever worked), education and career have been the only main focus in life; I grew up sheltered as a result and didn't develop healthy social skills. Despite having few friends at school, it was only a surface-level friendship. My interactions with girls were very limited to non-existent. 

Since high school, I started working during my spare time to save up for university. I've developed lots of crushes on girls but never acted on them. I was always ashamed of those feelings. I read early on that non-attractive people can come off as creepy, especially being my race and skin tone. With that in mind, I only ever interacted with them when required on a friendly basis. I guess looking back...I internalized shame by growing up in a conservative culture where the topic is sex isn't discussed and/or is taboo. Being an obedient kid, I just focused on school and moved onto university. Moving out and being on my own boosted my confidence but it wasn't enough to form a deep social circle as I was busy working to pay for my apartment. I missed out on all the social activities, parties, hangouts, etc. It was depressing to hear about people's stories of last night's parties and the girls they hooked up with, etc. It used to bother me but I became numb to those conversations eventually; I never had anything to contribute. I knew such a life for me isn't possible and I need to focus on my career and reason such as this isn't valid enough to be depressed over. Moved back after graduation and helped my parents get their first house as their combined income isn't nearly enough for a mortgage.

It's been 2.5 years since I graduated and I can count on the handful of times I've interacted with women, all on a friendly level. All my previous work environments were male dominant, even my university degree...so I never had a chance to brush up on social skills with the opposite sex. I spend my days very busy between work (permanent WFM, 70-90 hours) and hobbies, it keeps me busy and preoccupied. Since the pandemic hit, I've been focusing on my mental and physical health...lost ~90 lbs, started to practice self-love, and am beginning to love my company. Despite all this work, there is an empty feeling that I couldn't explain. I met few friends yesterday after 16 months while maintaining the social distancing rules (still in lockdown) because they wanted to announce the wedding of 3 of the people in our group and plan a combined bachelor's trip later this year. Then it hit me, the emptiness is the lack of romantic relationships that I've always convinced myself is not possible for me. I felt happiness and a little envy at the same time when I heard the news. 

I'm already 27 with zero experience when it comes to women, no girl friends, no women besides my mom that I grew around. I lack everything that makes a man attractive, fit physique, charismatic vibes, great conversationalist, sexual experience, great sense of humor, being an interesting person. The concept of flirting, escalation, physical touch is all an alien concept to me. After reading a bunch of posts about how hard it is to find someone these days, I'm sure I don't stand a chance with the state I am in. I know I'm a lost cause in this department. I know you don't need romantic relationships to live life, that happiness comes from self and I've been telling myself this for a long time but some of the thoughts I buried deep have emerged again during my meditation today. I don't bring much value to the table, don't have my own place yet, not as successful in my career, don't own a car, awkward in conversations; pretty much all the qualities that make me undatable/not a high-value person. I know no one will ever be sexually attracted to me, having a family isn't in my cards. I am aware of this state being entirely my fault and that my mindset is toxic...I realized it too late. I did start to look around for therapists to address these problems. I just want to suppress my desire for romantic relationships and continue on with life; I'd rather be living my life alone than being labeled a creep. I am practicing self-improvement in order to further my professional life, hoping to boost my esteem/confidence in the future. Not sure what I wanted to get out of this post, just wanted to vent as I don't usually share my feelings with others or at all.

TLDR: 27M spent entire life on education/career, lack experience with women. Felt sad and depressed this morning due to friends announcing their wedding date, reminding me of my lack of romantic relationships. Thank you for taking your time to read my post and sorry for the self-pity/pessimistic post...I am working on being more optimistic.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/njekrs/27m_lack_of_romantic_relationships_and_hearing/

She just sent me a voice note asking if we can reschedule this week’s date as yesterday she “found out some things about her breakup that she needs to deal with”. I appreciate her letting me know 3 days before the date and being honest about the situation, however what would the best next steps be to not lose the momentum in this situation?

I take it that she will be seeing her ex to discuss the breakup or something as she did tell me about that this needed to be done eventually. 

She said that she feels that she needs to deal with this first before our date, however didn’t offer a new day for it. As it’s surely a tough situation for her, I don’t want to be too pushy for a new date or put too much pressure on her.

The date was set as essentially a meet and get to know each other deal at a public park on a saturday afternoon.  Both of us showed up on time, and things went well, for about 10 minutes, when M showed up, unexpected by both of us.  M immediately situated herself between K and I, and started dominating the entire conversation unless K was responding to something she said.  It was so bad that if I wanted to get a word in I would have to talk over her and look like an asshole.

I tried sending her a message asking her to maybe back off a bit as I really wanted to talk to K, which she read, then mad.  Her response was to start dishing every hurtful thing she could throw out about me to K, telling her about everything from intimate details of health problems I'd had in the last few years to painting me as a workaholic who wouldn't have time for her (I'm not a workaholic).  

So I excused myself, said goodbye, and went home.  Then I get a call from my best friend who was telling me that M was PISSED because I ""Didn't really try"" on the date, so I told my best friend what happened.  He talked to M, and now M doesn't want me going to the wedding because I blamed her for turning that into a shitshow.  Which I did.  That's accurate.

I listened to my sibling and asked to meet earlier and the earliest time he gave was 8-9pm which is still late but not so late. 

I didn't listen to my sibling and still proceeded. I left earlier without any suspicions, hung out by myself for 6 hours and then, waited for the guy. I had rising suspicions that he was going to flake on me. I texted him at 7 where my location was and he never responded. I texted again around 8 with, ""are we still pulling through with the plans or should i just go home?"". I was responded with ""tmr?"" I guess it's his way of trying again to meet tomorrow. I declined because, I was already putting high expectations on someone who i haven't met or known at all and that i was super disappointed he didn't show. I knew I was going to get stood up if i didn't say anything from my gut. 

He then responded back with ""oh"" and i never responded back. 

I'm feeling like I'm regreting my decision and blaming it on myself even though that may not be the case. Is it alright that I declined for a reschedule? Is it okay that i felt sad for being stood up, not given a reason or apology, and not giving him a second chance to hurt me even though I don't f***ing know him? He was super cute and my type but do you agree that i was just super infatuated by his looks and I'm looking past all the cons to what alternative what ifs could've happened in this situation? 

I'm okay with harsh criticism, give me all that you got . It's like I know but im not confident about it and need assurance from a third person perspective. I'm a delinquent daughter and the possibilities of getting kidnapped or murdered just went past my head.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/njer6c/help_with_reevaluating_the_situation/
66,njev0k,1621797408,"When people say things like, “sex isn’t all that” or “there’s more to life than dating” in response to people struggling with sex and dating, it’s very patronizing and makes you sound like an asshole.","I appreciate when people try their best to give advice but those two statements and things like that it’s so patronizing and really doesn’t help. In fact I’d venture to say it makes people feel worse. 

In my case, I’m a 20 year old who’s never even had his first kiss and struggling a lot with dating. When I see the advice that sex isn’t everything I feel like shit for 2 reasons. Because if it isn’t a big deal and I’m struggling so much to do it, then I’m a huge loser I am unable to something that most people don’t even see as a big deal. And two, because it’s not even the sex I want (it’s more someone that wants to have sex with me. Which is why “just pay for it if it’s that big of a deal” is bad advice), being told that this isn’t a big deal is just hurtful because again, that makes me the loser that can’t get one girl to be attracted to him even though it’s nothing to everyone else.

I also feel like this advice really only comes from people that have had sex. People that either lost their virginities at a normal age, or if they did lose it at an older age, and are so far removed from it they don’t remember the relief they felt when they finally did it. I know for a fact once I’m able to lose it, it’ll be a huge weight lifted of me because it proves that at least one person alive wants to have sex with me.

All of this prettt much applies to a relationship too. But it also adds insult to injury when people say that I’ll miss being single. I cannot for the life of me see any reason why I’d miss this. First of all, it’s a lot easier to enjoy being single when your single by choice. Maybe people would miss that, but when you want to be in a relationship with someone and can’t even get a single date, it’s hard to enjoy it.

Sorry if I rambled but I just wanted to put m thoughts on this out there and see if anyone else can agree or relate to how I feel on this.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/njev0k/when_people_say_things_like_sex_isnt_all_that_or/

I have started with dating apps as it’s easy to meet people that way. I am open about the fact that I don’t drink alcohol. I just don’t enjoy it and got alcohol poisoning once in college and decided to stop then. I enjoy going to grab dinner or maybe a coffee, I don’t mind if other people drink around me at all. However, I only get asked out to a bar to “grab a drink.” As soon as I say I don’t drink it seems like they think I’m weird or don’t want to go out. Like getting dinner is scary or a commitment? I don’t get it. I used to go on dates to bars but never enjoyed it and always got a look from my date when I didn’t order a drink. I’m allowed to not enjoy alcohol at 24. I broke up with an alcoholic almost a year ago so I also am allowed to not want my relationship to be centered around drinking as we used to go to a bar every weekend.

71,njfa91,1621798588,I left her on read,"I just didn't know what to do. 

I dated this girl like three times in two months and in the end, after I tried so many times to grasp something out of her personality, I realized she's not just shy, she's a bit shallow and I didn't get enough stimulation. 

Our texts were nothing but provocative jokes, sometimes a bit forced, with me trying to say something about my daily life just to spark interest in some topic, only to not succeed. I tried countless things. We exchanged some kinky texts here and there but nothing extreme. I didn't enjoy hanging out either, we only met on Sundays.
Last Sunday we were supposed to meet, I had a distant colleague who I've never seen in person coming to my town that asked me if I was willing to meet him. I told her that my friend and his girl could join us and she was OK with it, but told me that since she had her period and the aches were strong she would have been glad to reschedule to also give me time to hang with my colleague. 

That would have been the forth time in three months, and I felt like I was glad we didn't meet. I just kept texting her during the next day and as soon as the sluggish text game started over I tried to reply shortly and I ultimately left her on read.

I was at a point where it just felt mentally draining to reply just out of politeness while try to maintain the conversation until the next time we would meet. Now I'm relieved.

I know it's something coward, but I didn't feel like there was enough commitment to justify a text explaining that I wanted to ""part ways"". We were nothing more than friends who flirted and made out from time to time.


Was there a better way? How I deal with this situation? I feel bad for doing it but I really couldn't see any alternative. I don't think she was that interested either to be honest, I don't know her but I think that there are countless ways to covertly show some interest. The other theory is that she just wanted to have sex and was dragging until the right time (empty house for either of us)",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/njfa91/i_left_her_on_read/
72,njfdlr,1621798839,First time approaching a woman. (19M),"
Hey guys I think this is my first time posting here but I wanted to share my first time approaching a girl at 19 years old. 

Before I commence I just want to say that whenever I am out with my friends they are always telling me ""that girl was checking you out."" They tell me this a lot and I honestly never noticed women looking at me because I am usually in my own world and having fun with my homies.

After joining this subreddit I was actually reading some posts about women staring and how it's a good indicator she has some interest or is attracted, blah blah blah. So after some posts that I have read, I started to actually take notice of women staring or glancing every time I am at a store. 

One time I was at Target and I saw this girl staring while walking past and I glanced again and she kept looking so I just said a simple ""Hello"" and she reciprocated. I should have conversed but oh well that's the past. After her, I started to see more women stare, and honestly, I get really nervous to approach only because cute girls are always intimidating. Keep in mind that I am actually an extroverted person and I am easy to talk to but damn I don't know why I get intimidated. 

Anyways today I was with some friends and I saw this really cute girl looking at me and I said: ""f\*ck it ima talk to her."" I said ""Wassup, how's it going?"" My friends gave me my space and she was with her friends and they gave her space for us to talk. We chatted a bit and asked for her number because I didn't want to keep my and her friends waiting. Don't think they would mind but oh well. Anyways, I wanted to say hi to her friends and introduce myself but I didn't want to keep my friends waiting. 

It honestly felt really good but here's a little downside. I texted her like 2-3 hours later because I was with friends and I am NEVER on my phone when I am out with friends or in general. I texted her with a ""Hey it's Nic from the pier"" I don't even f\*cking know if that was a lame-ass opening but who cares I did it anyway. She never replied, but I don't know why but my gut tells me she gave me a fake number. Even if that's true I don't care It feels cool that I actually approached and got ""a"" number.

Well, that is my story. Any advice on how I can cold approach or maybe any openings when I text a girl. OR just any important things. I am tired of getting at girls online. It is so annoying but ever since COVID, that was the alternative. Now that things are going back to normal again I want to get out there and just meet new people, seducing, and having fun while doing it.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/njfdlr/first_time_approaching_a_woman_19m/
73,njfe2i,1621798875,Did he lose interest or am I overthinking,"I met this guy who I work with and he was clearly very interested in me. Over the course of the last couple of weeks his interest became more and more clear. The other day he tells me he thinks I’m really pretty and asks about my weekend plans and then asks if I want to do something with him. Keep in mind, I’m not interested in anything serious right now just a summer fling situation since I’m just out of a relationship. 



Anyway, we made plans for the next day. The day of our plans (yesterday) in the morning he messages me on Instagram (doesn’t have my number) apologizing and that he has to reschedule because of a “family matter” and the convo sort of just ended there. He hasn’t made any plans yet or followed up. We also don’t normally message, we just talk at work which I am ok with. I’m not a big texter. I won’t be seeing him at work for another week but am I overthinking this? Did he lose interest already? I think he’s attractive and I enjoy spending time with him at work and having this crush but I’m a little surprised he canceled since he is the one who made the first move.

79,njflv8,1621799483,One who got away- Move for him or move on?,"TL;DR: reconnected with ex after breaking up due to poor mental health. We’re both in a better place, but he’s moving away soon. I feel conflicted about whether I should move with him after graduation 

TW/CW: sexual assault and IPV

I’m currently a college student entering their final year in a 5 year program. I met Peter (not his real name for privacy reasons) when I was a first year and he was a sophomore in the same program. We really hit it off and we started dating. For some background, I’m a survivor of rape and intimate partner violence and I have a lot of sex and relationship related PTSD as a result of it. I knew going into this relationship that there were gonna be issues with sex, and there were, but nothing major. I just didn’t know that I would have so many triggers related to conflicts, communicating emotions, or receiving affection. I had so many trauma responses that I didn’t know how to handle, and I ended things very abruptly. That sent Peter down a pretty bad depressive spiral (his mental health wasn’t great while we were dating). It’s always been something I’ve felt a lot of regret about, but I didn’t know how else to handle my trauma at the time.

Fast forward, I’ve been in therapy for 4 years now, and I have little to no triggers during sex anymore. All my relationships, not just sexual or romantic ones, have greatly improved, and I’m much better at resolving conflict and communicating my feelings. I saw Peter on a dating app, and we both matched. We reconnected and, since we last saw each other, he’s been taking his meds regularly and making more of an effort to take care of himself. We both are fully vaccinated, so we decided to meet up. We both unpacked the breakup and we now have a sense of closure about what happened. We’ve spent the past week exploring our college town’s hidden gems, hooking up, and just spending time together, and it feels like the relationship we could’ve had if we both were doing better. 

He ended up telling me he got a job offer on the West Coast (we’re in the Midwest). He said he didn’t want to do a LDR, since the last one he was in was hard to manage and they broke up because of it. He also said that while it’s likely I’ll end up on the West Coast post-undergrad (our undergrad program is a tech program), he didn’t want me to move there just to be with him.

Now, I have been more strongly considering moving to the West Coast recently. I have friends and family out there, I want to go to grad school and most of the programs I want to do are on the West Coast so I’ll probably have to move out there anyways, and there’s a large community of my ethnic group on the West Coast and I want to be around my culture. At the same time, I also want to see where the last year of undergrad takes me and I don’t want to limit any of my potential opportunities or experiences. Sorry for the long post, I just had to get this all out",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/njflv8/one_who_got_away_move_for_him_or_move_on/

86,njggof,1621801828,"Texting stresses me the fuck out and is mindfuckery, especially when an extrovert gets quiet. Any advice/tips?","I already have anxiety and texting very much feels like a double-edged sword. It’s convenient, quick, and widely-used but there’s so much room for misinterpretation and miscommunication.. not to mention how agonizing it is when you’re waiting for a reply. 

My biggest source of anxiety is waiting for people to respond, especially someone I am really actively interested in and seeing. I don’t experience this with other people i.e. family/friends/neighbors/whoever. Or during the “get to know you” stage, I’m not that worried since I barely know them anyway. 

*It’s once I realize I like them and have some feelings that I send myself into a spiral of anxiety and mindfuckery* 

This is happening to me right now. He is a self-labeled extrovert and it definitely showed for the first 3 weeks. I had a genuinely good time, felt great being with him, would text constantly, and sometimes we didn’t even have to be doing anything in person to enjoy each other’s company and spend hours together. Now that it’s been almost a month, he says he’s just been feeling really introverted and doesn’t want to talk much. This is anxiety inducing because part of me thinks he’s flaking while the other part that’s understanding believes that it’s a combination of things including illness, work, class, pets, life, etc as he became more introverted around the same time he got sick/things got stressful (side note: I’m more of an introvert so I don’t know if this is common for extroverts, it’s just my best guess if what’s happening)

I don’t want to be a pain to him and know I should probably reciprocate and talk less too just to match his energy. When I saw him this weekend, I brought a small thing of flowers and wine (nothing fancy) to cheer him up after a rough week and he thought it was really sweet. I stayed for 5 hours and we had more of a chill date just laying on the couch watching a movie. I definitely noticed that he was more quiet and not as touchy. I really hope he’s able to be back to himself soon but in the mean time, how do I stop fucking my mind over? Or if any extroverts out there go through the same thing and can shed some light? I really don’t want to lose his interest or deter him :(",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/njggof/texting_stresses_me_the_fuck_out_and_is/

I guess going back over all of it is therapeutic in a way for me, so my apologies.  


So, I meet this girl on OKCupid June 2020. We hit it off immediately and talk via the app for prob 2 weeks. I finally get her number. I am covid paranoid, so not sure where to meet. It's 105 degrees in Dallas, so no way to meet outside comfortably. We talk on the phone 40+ hours over a period of 6 days. A few different times, she tells me she is not sure how religious I am. I tell her I am a Christian and from what she has shared of her values, I share them. She had an ex who pretended for 4 yrs to be a Christian. So, that comes up several times- and a few times she is like- I cannot be with you. You are not godly enough for me. No idea how she knows how godly I am, we haven't even met yet! She basically says bye, have a nice life 3 times, then ends up apologizing and sending me 20 text messages as if she's freaking out bc I did not reply right away. (I was taking a nap). One day, she finally says she cannot be with me, insists I find God. I keep trying to explain to her, I have been saved since I was 14. I am now 42. She is 26. I think her 4 yr bf was her only other real rship. She says have a good life then won't reply to me anymore. A week or 2 later, I am super sad over this, so I send her a plant to her work as a gift. She contacts me to thank me. We talk that day for a while via text. I do not message her the next day bc I don't want to seem too eager. She does not message me. The next day, I do not message her. She messages me. We talk. I tell her I miss her. She agrees. In the middle of a text conversation about jazz, she just poof disappears. Ghosts me. This is July 2020, I believe.   


Fast forward, Feb 27 2021. I message her on instagram. I have messaged her numerous times over the ensuing months. We just fell hard for each other, and it was magical. I miss the hell out of her. She replies. She is tipsy in a hotel room on vacation in Miami, We talk on the phone that night. She sends me probably 30 voice messages saying she missed me and thought a lot about me all this time. I tell her the same. The next day, she tells me she cannot be with me, I had my chance and I did not want to get to truly know her (what?????). I am not Christian enough for her. I am tho! I say forget it and say goodbye. She texts me to call her ASAP on video chat. I need to talk to you ASAP. We talk via video chat. We are going to do this it seems. We are going to meet in a few days on Friday. I rent a theater at AMC for us alone. No covid risk. Privacy. She tells me we are totally going to make out in the theater. Then a few days later she says that is not a good idea, and a theater is a bad idea. Too private for a first date. I confusingly cancel the $120 rental fee. Thankfully they allow it. She then says we cannot kiss. It's not right. She is constantly all over the place and confusing as hell. We get into some argument, I forget, but we finally decide late Friday to meet when she calls and apologizes. We meet. It's natural, I feel like I have known her forerver. We hold hands at dinner. We go to my car. I kiss her. She jumps into my lap and straddles me, we make out for hours in my car in this parking lot. We talk for hours. We finally part ways around 2AM.   


Saturday, I am still covid paranoid. We basically drive around. I go to pick her up. We park and make out some more. It's very passionate between us. It feels natural as hell. Like we have been dating for a year. We talk for hours. I take her home maybe 4am. 

Sunday, my schedule is messed up. I fall asleep maybe 1PM. She calls me a million times, txting a ton, etc. She is freaking out, not sure where I am. So she comes over. I wake up and she is driving here with dinner. She comes and she has a bag. She is spending the night. We make out, we kiss, we talk, we eat dinner, we go to my bed...she tells me she loves me. I tell her I love her too. We go to sleep. We do more making out...no intercourse but, well, everything else basically. Next morning she has to go home to work from home. It's awesome. We both agree basically we have never felt this way about anyone before.   


She asks me a lot of religious questions. I am not used to being open about this and have never dated a girl who cared. I think she is trying to trick me based on the past year. I am a Christian, but she keeps saying I am not spiritually mature. I am. She will not believe me. After 4 weeks, we have intercourse. She decides, religiously, we cannot do that. It seemed OK before but not now. We have to pull back. We have talked about marriage. She says she needs a godly husband. I am onboard. She tells me I have 12 months to propose or lose my chance. She does not have time to waste dating for years. Okay, fine.   


We date. It's magical. She will sometimes show up Thurs and stay that night, then stay Fri, Sat, and Sunday. I tell her I honestly do not want her to leave ever. She agrees. We go out to dinner, to a park, go for walks, etc.

5 or 6 weeks in, she dumps me via text on a Friday. I see them all when I wake up. She cannot be with me. I am not Christian enough. She blocks me on all fronts. I finally get to her via facebook which I forgot we both had and friended each other. She refuses to let me call her. It's over. I try to delete her contact later that night and accidentally call her. I text and apologize. She says she misses me so much, has been crying all day, cannot stop thinking about me. Can we be friends, she asks. Yes. I love you, she tells me. I love you too. She apparently drives to my apt as we talk via text but does not get out of her car. She tells me this a week or so later.  


We talk like normal the next day. I want to see her. This is in April. Not a good idea, she says. It will confuse things. Maybe end of May when her semester is over. I am sad. We talk on the phone. We still say I love you. That Friday she goes to pick up her groceries but then shows up to my apartment. it's weird after breaking up. I kiss her. I hold her in my arms. It's magical again. She coyly says it's not safe for her to drive home. She wants to stay over. I say Ok. She says no touching her boobs (religious reasons as before). I jokingly honk her boob when kissing her. I think she is being coy. I am not fully getting all her mixed signals straight. She is sort of upset. I sleep on the couch so she's more comfortable. No risk of making out- temptation. I do not sleep at all really. 7AM, she is coming out of the bedroom, clothed, hurrying to leave. I am like what is wrong, she will not tell me. I walk her to her car. She won't even kiss me. I walk back inside. 20 mins later I text her. I am sorry? She says I do not respect her boundaries. I apologized. I thought she was being coy! It's all very confusing, esp since we have literally had sex twice at this point.  


We have this long text argument. ""You do not want to understand me!"" I tell her she is confusing, but she's insistent she is very clear, but no one wants to fully know her, so they say they do not understand her (I guess her siblings tell her this as well). I am exhausted, fall asleep, because she basically says we cannot be together, have a good life. She will miss me. I wake up at 8pm and I have 15 missed calls and 13 voicemails from her. Numerous texts. In one VM she says she is so sorry for being all over the place, it's been very unfair to me and that she has not dated much so she is never sure what to do. As I slept and she made these calls, she had come to my apt, knocked on the door but I did not hear her. She wanted to talk this over and go for a walk and discuss it. She says to come over so she can fall asleep in my arms. I drive over. She wants me to massage her back. Asks me to get lotion from the bathroom. I massage her back and her legs and butt basically. Weird since she was so insistent about boundaries and how it meant we had to part ways again. She says if I tighten the screws on her new desk she will let me lotion her breasts when I jokingly ask to do that. I am not sure if it's a joke or not on her end. She falls asleep.   


Sunday morning we are in her bed sitting there. She takes my hands and puts them on her breasts and squeezes them. So confused now. We make out. I take care of her with my mouth (cough). I am now very confused after Friday night. Anyhow, we part ways after a couple hours, as she has to meet her brother for brunch. She calls me around 3, she sounds drunk, she needs to use my bathroom. She comes in, she is clearly intoxicated. I hide her keys and tell her she has to stay for at least 90 mins,. She strips down and puts a shirt on from my closet. She is basically dancing in my face, and she is spreading her lady parts in my face and telling me to put it in her. We end up having sex. My willpower with her is poor. We are both super attracted to each other. I walk her to her car after 90 mins or so. We say I love you, kiss good bye. All is well.  


Monday and this week we talk but she is less close, more distant as the week goes on. Not sure why. We do not see each other. She has school stuff and is busy. Saturday of that week she calls me over and over, has me on the phone 5 hours total. She says I love you, I miss you, invites herself to the movies with me when I mention wanting to go. Mentions she should have taken my offer for help with her homework...I assume she will come over. She says nah probably not a good idea, I have my own stuff I have to do, she doesn't want to burden me with her homework. Anyway. she is SUPER clingy this day. I try to get off the phone, and when I do she's like, ""noooo, don't go \[insert pet name here\]!"" ""Why am I so attached to you?"" she asks. She refers to me as her boyfriend which wasn't totally clear before. I fall asleep early, she invited me to come to her apt to workout with her at 5AM Sunday before she goes to her old friend's catholic church. She sweetly texts me pet names and all lovingly is like, I am just now going to sleep, I do not think I will be awake at 5AM.   


Sunday I do not hear from her as of noon. I message her and ask how the church was. She replies a couple of hours later and says it was ok. It was good. She isn't saying much. Seems distant. No longer clingy at all. We do not talk much this day. I do not think we talk on the phone. Same for Monday. She is distant, somewhat cold. I tell her I am sorry if I did something. She says nothing to be sorry for. I text her when she is asleep and tell her I can still help with her homework. I miss her. It's been over a week since I saw her last. She clicks in Instagram the icon of a laughing crying face to my help with her homework message but does not reply. I am like wtf? Seems rude. She finally replies and says ""that is not a boundary I want to cross with you."" I am so confused by that. I say ""what does that mean?"" She says, ""Thanks, but no thanks."" That seems shitty to me. I ask my friend what this means, and my friend is like- she sounds like an asshole.   


Wednesday, I message her and I am like I am sorry for whatever I did, as she's cold and distant now. She says, ""You did not do anything. I am just done. This is not for me."" Basically, I tell her she's nuts and peace out that she cannot say I am not Christian enough for her when she comes over drunk and is spreading her lady parts in my face. I usually hold back, but this back and forth for 6 weeks is killing me. She says I may never understand but it's OK if I don't. Have a good life and she will miss me. I tell her again, you're nuts but Ok. I go to bed. I post to twitter a screenshot where she said ""not a boundary I want to cross"" and ""thanks but no thanks."" I note ""cold"" on my tweet. My twitter is a fake name, I have never mentioned her name, no pics of her, nothing but her sentence to me. I just wanted confirmation it was cold and I was not losing my mind. I wake up to her texting me to leave her alone, she needs space. Then she sees my tweet and says she is sorry for ever giving this a chance. Sorry she was ever vulnerable and sorry she was ever with me and that this absolutely sucks. Says I do not have basic respect for her by posting her message like that. Says it feels like I am out for revenge for posting that and it makes her feel unsafe (?!) Leave me alone. I wake up and see this and try to talk to her. I am blocked via phone and all social media. I try to tweet to her I have deleted the tweet, and I am sorry. I merely wanted advice and was confused as hell. She blocks that acct. I finally connect with her via instagram on a project acct I have and tell her I am sorry and mention I joined a men's group at a church locally. She says I need to respect her decision and she does not want to be with me, she does not want to be looped into what I am doing, she does not care. Have a good life. Blocks me. Then unblocks me and says LEAVE ME ALONE. That is the last I have talked to her.   


So, after my novella here...I just cannot imagine loving someone then dropping them via text 4 or 5 times over 6 weeks then refusing to talk to them. She told me she was done to me and would then show up to my apt uninvited! I never closed off communication to her even after all of that craziness. I understand a person can choose not to talk to you. But I could not do this. She knows I am devastated over this, and I know because of the way she reacted and panicked when I was merely asleep and she thought I was ignoring her. Why did once sentence she sent me posted to twitter without her name or any info about her make her feel unsafe?! Why do I not get any grace for admittedly being mean when I said she was nuts the night before after all she put me through? Why dump me via text? I would, if in her position, let her call me right now just to be like wtf is going on bro? I could never cut off things like this. A couple days ago, I see she posts to a subreddit a tweet I made where she liked the tweets of a white nationalist and I was basically, in my tweet, like ""thank god I am away from that craziness!"" I was mostly trying just to find a reason why I would not be sad to lose her. She is going 3 weeks back in my twitter timeline to screenshot my tweet to post it to reddit and call me a clown in her own reddit post, but she won't talk to me at all? I dunno. It just seems really mean. Like I said, I could not be like this to someone I loved. I don't get it at all. I am still super confused and pretty heartbroken. I wonder, everyday, what on earth I did to make her go from super loving and downright clingy Saturday to super cold and distant Sunday and have a good life on Tues or Wed.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/njglqn/am_i_too_nice_isnt_this_a_terrible_way_to_handle/

89,njgra0,1621802603,How much of a requirement is being fit for dating as a guy?,"How much of a requirement is being fit for dating as a guy?

I’m almost 25 and let’s just say my dating life hasn’t been great. Other than my social anxiety and struggles of not being awkward, I sometimes wonder if my body is a major reason why. I’m 5’8 and definitely on the chubbier side. Almost every piece of dating advice I see for men includes being fit, as though it’s a requirement. 

Now, I’m not saying I *don’t* want to get fit. I do. I just need to find a way to overcome my lack of discipline. But sometimes I feel like I don’t want to wait until I have a rockin’ bod to be able to be attractive to women and date. I sometimes feel like getting fit might actually be easier for me if I did have a girlfriend now, since I won’t have the internal pressure of getting in shape for women anymore, but rather simply doing it for myself. 

I also don’t really agree with the advice of “go for a fat girl” because just because a girl is fat or on my level of looks or whatever doesn’t mean she’ll find me any more attractive than a conventionally attractive and fit girl would. I actually want a girl to find me attractive, not settle for me because she couldn’t get any better. Plus, if a fat girl can date guys who are fitter than me and more socially adept, then why would she ever choose me? And while I don’t think my standards are too high (I don’t need a model or anything and I like anything from fit to skinny to curvy to soft/slightly chubby, just as long as it isn’t extreme thinness or obesity), I would like to have a partner of which we have a mutual attraction towards each other. Me going for a girl I’m not attracted to because I’m desperate just seems like a dick move, and doesn’t sound like a recipe for success for either of us. Any girl I would hypothetically date deserves someone who finds her attractive. I would like to make it clear that I am not trying to offend any girl that might be bigger by saying this, so please don’t take this the wrong way. 

So basically, can I still possibly try to date and find success before I lose the weight and get fit? Or should I not focus on girls at all until my body is right?

Also, if I did get lucky and found a girl that *did* find guys with my looks attractive, her being a feeder would be a dealbreaker, as I don’t want to stay like this forever.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/njgra0/how_much_of_a_requirement_is_being_fit_for_dating/
90,njgt11,1621802733,Ghosted by a guy I've been talking/seeing for ~2 yrs.,"[24M] Depressed, mad, frustrated, disappointed... I have so many feelings going through me right now. 

So, this guy (I'll call C) and I have been talking/seeing each other on and off for a long time. He recently moved to a different state, and he was telling me how great his new area is. Over a couple of months, we started talking/Facetiming more than usual and even began flirting/sexting. We already had feelings for each other in the past, but we never moved past friends cause our lives got in the way. But talking to him again after his move really brought our interests for each other to light again. Like we both told each other that we liked each other. He even said he loved me. 

C told me how awesome it would be if I could visit him, joking that I'll like the area so much I might even move over there myself. I said that I would be down to fly over. I really needed to get out, and we were both vaccinated. So why not? C and I were super stoked and started to plan in April. We set a date for the first weekend of June, I booked my flight, and he took care of housing. Everything is good to go. 

Well, immediately after we planned the trip. He started to become unresponsive. Two weeks after planning, C messaged back saying that he got super busy and has been working 14 hrs shifts. I told him it was okay and that I understood. I messaged him again about the trip cause it was getting closer. He stopped texting again for another two weeks.

I started to get worried but just reasoned that he'll come around. He's probably just busy. Nothing. During the period of waiting for his reply, C's FB profile popped up under ""people I might know"" on my FB feed. Apparently, he made a new account. I was excited cause he never had a FB. I sent a friend request and checked out his profile. This was when everything went downhill for me. 

C changed his status to ""In a Relationship"". Everything clicked.

I'm honestly so broken from it. Like okay, he found someone else. It happened and I can't do anything about it. But, I'm so frustrated and sad over him ghosting me when we actively made plans and involved a significant amount of money. I didn't want to bombard him, so I've been sending him messages a couple of days apart to talk about the trip, but nothing. The trip is in 2 weeks and idk what's going on. 

It hurts so much to be brushed off so easily like this, especially when we expressed our feelings for each other not so long before.

I've been beating myself up over this whole situation. I feel foolish and ashamed of myself, asking why I got myself into this mess. I feel used, pathetic, and unimportant. I know I should move on, but I'm struggling so much cause even though C and I never was in a serious relationship, I've still invested so much of my time, energy, and emotion into him. 

I'm still trying to reach him and waiting to see if he'll reply. But nada. T_T",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/njgt11/ghosted_by_a_guy_ive_been_talkingseeing_for_2_yrs/

96,njh94e,1621803912,Why would she text me months later and then stop replying?,"I (mid-twenties) met this girl (mid-twenties) a few years ago and we started off as casual friends even though we live in different states. As the years went by, we started becoming sexual with each other via text, and she would drunk text me very sexual things and I would usually go along with it. I have done it to her a couple times too (without being drunk).

We made plans for me to visit her, but she kept putting off what dates she was free.  She was very on and off about replying, even with conversations that she would initiate. 

I got annoyed by the game, and decided to just cut it off and step away. I removed her from my social media and stopped talking to her. 

About 7 months go by, and she messages me all of a sudden saying that she wanted to ""check-in"" but didn't realize that I stopped following her.  I told her that I did it because she seemed busy, and so I let her do her thing. 

She claimed she wasn't ""busy"" when she clearly was at the time. 

Fine. I'll go along with it. SHE is the initiator of this conversation. She asks me how things have been. I reply and then ask her. Then she stops replying, and it's been a few days.

I really don't care if she's not interested in me, because I find this to be stupid and a waste of time.

1. What is the purpose of this?
2. Should I straight up ask her what her intentions are?

I feel so guilty for this and I know it was wrong, its just that in the moment I wasnt thinking about the consequences and I dont know how to cope with the sadness and guilt I feel rn. Its mainly coming from knowing that I hurt someone I loved and I dont know what to do.

She was my first girlfriend and my best friend. I had dated her best friend before but it didnt lead to anything and I started developing feelings for her. We got together after 2 months and everything was going well until her best friend started showing more interest in me. I promised myself I wouldn't do anything but be friends wither her, but then things started getting more flirtatious.

I dont know how to explain it, but while flirting with her best friend, in the moment, at the back of my mind I knew it was wrong, and I didnt want to be doing it, but it just felt good knowing that this girl wanted me sexually. My ex-girlfriend wasnt as sexual and didnt really show that much sexual interest in me as her best friend and I just felt like I wanted more sexual attention. This went on for a couple of days, until my ex girlfriend found out.

I was honest with her and took responsibility for my actions, obviously it didnt make it any better but I wasnt going to lie about anything. She ended it with me today and I feel so fucking guilty over hurting her like that. I dont know how to deal with the guilt and its messing with my focus on school and other things.
