We met on Instagram where I noticed she had a mutual friend of mine follow her, and I ended up following her and she followed me. I DMd her and from there we decided to go on a date. At first, I thought that she jokingly agreed  to going on a date, considering that she doesn't even know me, and she lives in a different city around 2 hours away. But just recently she told me she's visiting my city and asked me and told me she still wants to go on that date. 

So at this point I knew it was actually gonna happen, and we decided to go on a fun and cute little date. I don't go on dates often, and recently I just haven't really been going on any dates because I was taking a break from dating. 

Usually on first dates I take the girl out to go get something to eat (or drink - like coffee or something) and  then we go walk around if the weather is fine and just have a nice conversation or we both listen to music at a park etc.. So I basically like to do things that are inexpensive and where she doesn't feel like it will have to be a big commitment (meaning I don't go on expensive dates where it might feel overwhelming).

Anyways, after talking to this girl on Instagram, I found out that she's actually pretty cool and genuinely seems like a really fun person to hangout with. I know that we're talking online, but she really seems interested in me and has a nice sense of humor. I don't expect this to go anywhere, and my intentions arent to hookup with her, I just want her to enjoy the time with me. At this point, I'm pretty sure both of us are going into this date with the same mindset. A good thing about it is that I'm not really nervous as usual due to this date being super casual and meant to be fun. Because of this, I wanted to try something different for this date. I thought to myself ""why not do the date based on how you want to and not care about if it's too weird"". Basically I want to go on a cute date, and instead of the usually coffee shop date, I want to take her to an arcade or something fun, then we could go get our favorite food, go to a thrift store and she can pick my outfit, and listen to music where we collectively make the playlist. I also wanted to get her flowers, not like a big bundle but maybe just a small amount. I'm just throwing around date ideas, but a part of me actually want to get her these flowers, because why not?

We hit it off pretty fast considering we have some fundamental interest differences, yet both also enjoy exploring the other's interests. We complement each other in many ways and often connect on a mental level, knowing what the other is going to say before they say it. I would say that intellectually, emotionally, mentally, and as far as hobbies and interests we absolutely are hitting it off. She is amazing in so many ways and extremely sweet. She's strong, capable, and despite some health troubles on my end that make a relationship a bit more complex at times, she is patient and understanding.

In other words, I really like her a ton from a personality and intellectual perspective.

There is just 1 slight problem on my part. I struggle to be physically attracted to her consistently. I feel terrible about it. She is a tad overweight with a slightly unusual body style (bulky) and a very angular face. She is not remotely what I have been physically attracted to for all my life (Skinny petite bookish types).

I feel as if I am a terrible person for feeling this way and that maybe my mindset of physical attraction is corrupted by society, past relationships, and other such things. But I can't help what I find physically attractive (or at least it feels this way). I also feel like I am not anything ""special"" myself in the looks department and me being picky here seems unfair to her.

I am agonizing about what to do. I want to see her. I miss her when she's not around. I want to hang out and cuddle with her. But when I think about being intimate, I struggle to feel any excitement. This isn't to say we have not had sex, as we have, but they were not the best experiences and I think we both know it (although I doubt she is aware of why on my end).

I’m now 32.

I spent the first year doing the normal stuff. I worked on myself, developed my hobbies, strengthened my friendships, learned to love myself.

I’m active, fit, enjoy lots of activities: reading, hiking, camping, climbing, water sports, snow sports…etc. I go out on the town occasionally, see movies, go to concerts.

Stable job, home, investments, I don’t have children. I consider myself agnostic. 

Year two I really put myself out there. I’ve tried the apps, tried the hobbies, tried mutual friends. Im just not having any luck.

What can I do to improve myself? I know to be patient, let things happen naturally. In my 20s it was just so much easier? Is dating in the 30’s just incredibly different?

Im short brown and overweight. Now don’t worry I’m not gonna stay fat I’m lifting hard and dieting as much as possible w my college schedule. It’s slow journey but I’m seeing more toning and muscle. Like I said along with the gym I’m in grad school and therapy.

How much does settling mean? So my dream expectations once I get more in shape is someone decent in shape(not a model or anything but likes the gym and active life),someone cute, sweet and supportive. That’s it

Anyway, after a few months, I asked her out to coffee (but not a date) and she was very excited, at this point I believed she felt the same way for this reason and the way we would flirt in person. The coffee hang went really well, and at the end I told her ‘I like you’ and she cut me off saying thank you and that she wasn’t ready for a relationship (as she got out of a toxic one a few months prior).

She pretty much always responds to texts within 5-10 minutes. However, when I texted her yesterday, she took two hours to respond and had a one word response of “sure” (she is typically pretty enthusiastic, e.g. emojis, exclamation marks). Then, I later got a the response “K” (which can be considered rude). Then, I got another two hour response time with another lukewarm response. These texts are a break in pattern, she usually makes an effort to keep the conversation moving, with nothing that could be misinterpreted. 

Later that night, I got a more normal text from her, a few lines and an emoji, and pretty socially aware. Pretty much normal.

Today, I saw her in person. In the past, we’ve never had a bad conversation. Today, we had a couple good interactions, and a couple lukewarm interactions. 

The weird thing is the nights before things started to be weird (including the night before!), she seemed perfectly normal. 

I guess what I don’t know is if she’s mad at me for something, just not interested, or on period. Other reasons she might be on period are she went to the bathroom twice in one hour (unusual for her), and a few other times besides that. Also, she was sitting down on the job (again, unusual).

Let's say I get a girls number.

Her:

1. Needs to feel comfortable and or connected before going on a date in person.

Me:

1. I like my space, am introverted and busy so don't like text convos
2. I can't develop any feelings (even liking a person) via text. I have to interact live or at least follow them on social media so I can see their persona.

If I could do anything, after I get a number, I'd interact with her like I do with my friends, which is very sporadic texting and maybe get to know each other over a long period of time. But without that 'live connection' I lose interest pretty quickly as there are no memories to hold on to so at some point I just don't feel like texting anymore. But people tend to think of sporadic texting as disinterested and uncaring, which is partly true since I don't know you, but also untrue as that's just who I am.

So I tend to overcompensate and be very forward in asking them out in hopes of helping me build interest in the other person, so I actually have some memories to build off of like (oh yeah, I liked the way the person laughed or I liked the way she interacts with others, etc...) But I get the sense they want to build a rapport first before meeting up.

**So how do we compromise?** I'm not sure what to do. I absolutely hate text convos. I need to see someone's persona to develop feelings or be genuinely interested. I'm also very introverted when we are not in person and am very selective on who I let into my life. In person, however, I am talkative.

At first he was caught off guard I think but he agreed. We met friday night, drank, and talked. then the next day he stopped talking to me.


I got a few things in my mind as to why, first is that I stole a photo of him like just a quick shot and he noticed and asked not to shot it so i didnt and deleted the photo. next while we were drinking, I kept asking him to open up, i guess he got frustrated and got mad, not super but i can sense he was a little but annoyed at me for forcing him to open up, he did but just very vague. And last is that when we were sleeping.. it was very cold, I forgot how but I ended up hugging him with his back facing me, he didnt say no but then later on I thought that maybe this was uncomfortable for him so I rolled to the other side of the bed. the next day I got up and prepped myself for work. He told me that night I need to go first and he'd be fine being left aloneSo I did but before I left, I left some money to pay for half of the room for the night and woke him up just to say goodbye.

 “I don’t think we’re compatible, but I really hope the best for you- I’m rooting for you” 

But it’s actually painful to get a message like this. 

It’s entirely different if someone specifies that they’re looking for X kind of person, and you don’t meet what they’re looking for. So, “I’m outside your age range, but you’re lovely and I hope you find what you’re looking for.” Or something along those lines is fine.

We haven’t spoke in a few years but he hit me up out of the blue. We are in our mid to late twenties now. Pre pandemic was the last time I seen him. We went on a few dates and they were great!

We have fairly good trust and I do not doubt anything she does or spy on her but recently I decided to log in to pof to see her profile and it was “looking for men”. I then checked it other times when normally I would be sleeping and it was always “looking for men” but when I am awake she is always “looking for women”. Yes I already know we trust is fading if I am doing this.

I gave her the benefit of the doubt and didn’t worry but after weeks of this happening I finally brought it up. She thinks it is ok if she just talks to men on dating sites as long as that’s all it is is talking. I find this as emotional cheating and we got into an argument. 

To be clear I am not against her talking to male friends from her past or even exes who have also moved on but they were close in the past.

It is literally the only thing she does that makes me doubt her. I feel like I am totally reasonable by asking her to not talk to men on dating sites because we are in a committed relationship where we live together and have often discussed marriage and the future. So my question is, am I out of line to ask her not to speak to men on dating sites? And if there anyway to rebuild trust after I’ve seen this and she feels violated because I snooped and saw it?

We met up 3 times so far but text everyday for like two weeks at this point. I like him and we have had sex all the three times we met (it was probably not the best idea but we were drunk and it happened). Other than sex we get along well and have fun hanging out. I did ask him if he saw me as a friend with benefits or if he only wanted me for sex, and he said no so I thought we were both pursuing the idea of a romantic relationship. He sends me random pictures or videos of him which is really cute and some random videos he finds on the internet. It feels like he is comfortable with me and is open with me.

The problem is that when we text it’s like 5+ blocks of text then the other person takes hours (4-8 hours) to reply. At first it didn’t bother me, I thought it was like our thing or that he’s busy and I’m busy so we respond when we have time. Because he has work and other life activities too which I get. But now it is annoying me a bit because he’s literally playing games (he sends me pictures of him playing games after work) and doesn’t respond to me for hours. And I feel like he is reading my messages and ignoring me before replying to me after waiting a few hours. I tried responding right away because I thought maybe I take too long to reply, so he is doing the same, but no he still takes a few hours to reply. Like I know he reads it because I reply in the middle of the blocks of texts he’s sending… but he still takes hours to reply and just ignores the ones I just sent until his later block of messages. Honestly I am getting sick of it when I see how other people reply within an hour or at least try to but it seems he makes no effort to do that. I also thought maybe it was because there were too many blocks of text so it is tiring to reply at once, so I shortened it from like 6 blocks to 4 blocks of shorter paragraphs (sometimes just one sentence) and requiring very simple answers and he still takes hours but usually adds something to make the blocks of texts longer. 

Is he just not interested and should I move on? I’ll be honest, I also take a while to reply because when I reply right away he takes hours regardless and I didn’t want to seem desperate, and sometimes I really am busy. Also, I got mad so half the times I’m doing it out of spite but I don’t think he minds so it’s futile. I tried making plans and he seems to be interested in meeting up and he still sends me random things and sounding happy in messages. I just don’t know if he’s actually busy or if he just keeps me as a “backup” or something. Also I don’t know if it’s related but lately he has been having typos in his messages like he puts less effort into them and I don’t know if that’s a good or bad thing. I just wish he would tell me that he wasn’t interested so I don’t have to get annoyed when I open my messages to text other friends and see that he hasn’t replied in hours. 
I do like him though so if possible I would like to keep seeing him. His texts sound like he’s interested but why does he take so long to reply? I swear we text like 3x a day because he replies once in the middle of the night, once in the morning-noon and once in the evening. It’s driving me fucking crazy. I feel like if this keeps up I will just lose all interest I have in him even though I like spending time with him and enjoy his personality. What does this mean? And should I bring up this problem to him, maybe in person or through text? I am worried that I will just sound desperate or clingy or negative and we generally are very positive towards each other.

There’s more info that I’m not including because I don’t think it’s relevant and also I don’t want to expose myself in case he reads this, but feel free to ask questions.

We met each other on new year eve, where she ended up at my apartment with the best sex i've had in a long time. We kept seeing each other casually, however after 4 weeks she mentioned that she is not looking for something serious due to a painfull break-up she had. I was totally fine with that since I was just getting back into dating after some time wherein I focused on myself. Her actions however suggested much more and I had the feeling she was more into me than I was into her. She called me several times in the middle of the night (she knew I was out for drinks and was still up since I replied to her texts). She was also really cuddly when I saw her and couldn't get her hands off me.

After that conversation I decided to also date another girl, which I'm still currently dating. She is seriously hot however my connection with the first girl feels way more organic. I've seen the girl from new years eve last Friday for the last time, where she initiated a date and really insisted on seeing me. I got a text this morning that she thinks she feels more comfortable to keep our relationship on a friendly basis. To be honest, I didn't expect that it would sting like it does. I replied with thanking her for the good time, I told her I felt comfortable from the first moment with her and gave her kudos for that. I also mentioned that I'm not interested in keeping a friendly relationship and if she changes her mind that she could hit me up.

It is all fine and part of the game but the blow was unexpectedly hard on me. The problem is that I don't feel like dating the other girl because of this.

It’s a bit long, so if you don’t have the time please skip ahead.

This girl and I dated for probably 3 years and a bit more. She was my dream crush all through middle school, and I was just some ugly kid. Never seemed like I had a chance until everything started falling in place like it was gods gift. Fast forward, We eventually were each other’s first love and had great chemistry for a long time. Maybe it was teenage love but we dated for a while, waited around 6-7 months before we kissed and another 4-5 months to say we loved each other, and it happened naturally. For a year or two we never fought, always saw each other, talked etc. And also a year in she was already talking about marriage and while it seemed crazy, both of us couldn’t imagine being away from each other.

It was just amazing until the problems I was going through at home, I eventually took out on her. I became a terrible person and mentally abused her. I was in a tough situation where I told her nothing because my family situation was very rough, while being in a suburban area. It was because my mom worked as a maid. For example, I would lie to her and say the persons house my mom was working at, was my house, just so she wouldn’t think of me different (and looking back I know she wouldn’t.) We had many financial problems, and deaths in the family. Lots of arguing and fighting in the family as well. It came to a point when the anger and sadness that came from my family problems reached her, and when she was only trying to help I couldn’t tell her anything since I basically lived a lie with her. 

She stayed for so long until she rightfully 
left, and she would always try to give another chance but I was too stubborn. My world completely changed. I went to the doctor a year after that and found out I was diagnosed with Bipolar disorder, and I’ve worked to better myself every single day since. 

We are both now 19, and sophomores in college. She’s states away and I think in a relationship, and she may not even think about us at all anymore. But I don’t think I can live my life knowing we never ended on a good note, and that she’s never had an answer for my behavior. I just know she genuinely thinks I faked my love, but I think about her everyday, and it sounds bad. We were so perfect but the immature version of me ruined it. I just wish I never met her so young, because we almost were so perfect.

I DONT want to get back with her. I DONT want to try to be friends again. I want her to enjoy her life, but I want to end on good terms with someone who’s changed my life tremendously and doesn’t even know it. Or is this all pointless?

So i've been seeing this guy since around september. We're having a great time but yesterday evening he called me by his ex's name, while we were with his friends. They all obv made fun of him about it while i didnt really say a lot. He later apologized by text. 

We started seeing eachother quite shortly after we both had a breakup, bit more than a month. Kinda a FWB situation i suppose. I broke up with my ex and was enitrely over him, while he got dumped by his and was obviously having a hard time. I knew i was a rebound when we started seeing eachother but i didnt mind as i wasnt looking for something official either, we still havent had a talk about 'what we are'. Now several months later, we've grown very close. We talk everyday, game everynight together, see eachother quite a lot, his mom really likes me, his friends do aswell and he even asked me to go on vacation together. I've kinda been letting the rebound thing go and started to be open about this maybe becoming more. I'm starting to catch feelings for him. But i was kinda taken aback by him calling me his ex's name yesterday. 

I know its a hard habit to break after being with someone for several years, but so was i and i would never call him that. To me it really means he's still got her on his mind. So i've been wondering, do y'all think its harmless? Should i just keep having a good time and see where it goes even tho im starting to get feelings and might get hurt since i might just be a rebound to him or should i just take a step back now?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1160934,public,self,"Guy i'm seeing called me by his ex's name, should i stop seeing him?",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sze94t/guy_im_seeing_called_me_by_his_exs_name_should_i/,no_ads,0,dating,,,,,

We said our thank you’s right before I left. We hugged goodbye (I regret not going for a kiss, but that’s another story), and when I got back home, I sent him the two songs he asked me to send. He said ‘Thank you! I’ll listen to them in a bit’ and that was it.

So to be clear here, when I say not attracted, I am not repulsed by her, she is very hygienic, goes to the gym, eats healthy, I have no aversion towards lying next to her naked, but yet also I don't feel THAT pull of an attraction towards her.

We do however have a really strong emotional connection, this is what first brought us together, we met due to similar interests offline, not on a dating app, so our connection is really strong emotionally.

We have been on 5 dates now, we have met each other's friends, I have been to her place and had stayed there one night.

Early on, after our first date, I asked her if we can workout a casual relationship, for which she said, she need to think and during our second date, she told me that she doesn't want to label it as 'casual' which will make us artificially follow the boundaries of a casual relationship and doesn't grow naturally to see where it will go. I thought about it and it made sense, so I agreed to it.

We chat everyday, we talk over phone occassionally. She tells me what is going on in her life and we even discuss some heavy topics easily. She too feel comfortable with me, which I can say and have noticed. Our 5th date was super casual, like I bought food and drinks, called her and said let's wine and dine together, I'll be there in an hour and she said ok, changed her plans.

After 5 dates, I feel that I am super comfortable and natural with her and I don't feel like I have to act in a certain way and I can be the real me without any thoughts. 

So,  I realised I like her more than I used to like her when we first met and I actually am falling for her. And I know that open communication is very important in any relationship and I need to tell her how I feel. So, I kinda dropped sent 2 messages which read - ""Someone out there is feeling very special because you exist"". For which she replied ""That's sweet"". And another message read - ""When I listen to some songs, it immediately reminds me of you, which I never have experienced before"". For which she replied ""what's going on with you? 😅😅"".

I sent these messages to test the waters on how she might respond when I say that I have developed feelings for her, which I am planning to say it on our next date. 

Just to know, I am really confused on what she might be thinking. I know I should think overthink but I have already am dwelling on that territory and I need fresh set of eyes to help me here. Also, I am aware there will never be a right time for anything in life but I really do like this girl and I don't wanna mess things.

We met back in college and he stills hits me up out of the blue to see how I’m doing. We went to two different colleges in the beginning and hooked up a few times. I was a virgin at the time and wanted to wait until I was in a relationship with someone. We never had sex before. He initially just wanted to hook up with me but we would text often. 

We haven’t spoke in a few years but he hit me up out of the blue. We are in our mid to late twenties now. Pre pandemic was the last time I seen him. We went on a few dates and they were great! He didn’t expect anything after them. He then ended up moving to a different state. And we would still keep in touch. He invited me to see him probably a 100 times but due to the pandemic, I didn’t feel comfortable. He understood. He would visit my state to see friends and family and invite me but again, covid. 

Now it’s 2022 and I’m much more comfortable. Last year he found someone and we went our separate ways. I regretted not seeing him. After they broke up, he reached out to me again. He invited me but I haven’t found the right weekend to come down. He came up to my state twice and he had a lot of plans so we weren’t able to see each other. We still text often. I did offer to have him FaceTime me but he never followed through with them so I stopped asking. I asked him what his intentions are and he told me that he has done distance twice and it was hard and expensive for him. He told me if I was in his state, he would definitely try to date me. But he told me that once I am done with my graduate degree in the spring, I should be with him and be in his state. He hasn’t ever made an effort to make a trip up to see me. I live with my mom so I can see how it could be a bit awkward. Tonight I noticed his ex commented on his Instagram photo and now I am having regrets that I should go and see him again.

But I just can't for the life of me get myself to feel that spark of attraction them and to see them as anything more than a friend.

I used to just giving up after one date if I felt like that, but I realised that was unfair so decided to employ a ""three-date rule"" instead if I do quite like the person and have no real complaints but am not particularly attracted to them.

But is that just wasting everyone's time when I feel deep down it won't go anywhere? Should I actually wait longer and try a bit harder than three dates before giving up? Should I force myself to be a bit more flirtatious and steal a kiss just on the off chance that's the thing that sparks the flame?

I'm getting frustrated with myself because it just feels totally illogical and i feel bad for the people im seeing. I seem to remember having that spark when I first met the exes that I eventually had a serious relationship with, but could be misremembering.

I'm not sure when it happened or why. I don't know how to fix it. I've been trying to improve on our communication, but everything we agree on never becomes a reality.

I feel so alone. I haven't even told my best friend about this because I don't know what to say. I don't know what to do. Part of me wants to just leave, but I'm also completely financial dependent on him for health reasons... I've finally reached a point where I feel like I'd be able to take on a job, but I'm struggling to find one. And I feel like he's judging me about it. I feel like he's been judging me about it the entire time even though he's been telling me that he understands why I can't work.

I don't trust anything he says anymore. He doesn't help with household chores, and I don't ask much of him... I know that I'm at home all day every day, but I struggle to keep up with things because of the bad days with the health issues, and even on the good days his lack of participation in the few things I ask gives me such a lack of motivation. I express this to him, and point out that every time he starts participating (which usually lasts a day or two), I pick up the pace on my end as well because I start feeling better and like we're a team... but then he stops.

We don't have sex nearly as often as we should. Sometimes I'll go through several period cycles before he instigates. When we moved in together, I was *always* the one who instigated sex. It's been going like this for years and I'm just so tired of being neglected in every way possible... he won't talk to me about anything meaningful, he has no plans for the future, and he won't fucking touch me sexually without me having to almost *beg for it*. 

He occasionally makes these small, seemingly insignificant comments that make me feel like garbage. The most recent one was that I've gained weight since being at home, which he followed with ""but that's bound to happen in this situation"", which he's not wrong about... but like, he doesn't ever compliment me or try to uplift me with kind words. I've talked a lot about my ""love languages"" and how I feel most loved with time spent and words of affirmation, that gestures of love don't have to be expensive or involve money at all... he claims he understands, but he doesn't act on these things.

I feel like he isn't attracted to me physically or emotionally. I feel like we're incompatible and have both been lying to each other for years. I feel stuck and trapped and stranded. I feel alone, even in a room full of people. I don't have anyone I feel comfortable leaning on with this issue. I don't have anyone's house to crash at if I were to leave (I would confide in my best friend, but her house is already overpopulated)... I don't know what to do. I don't know how to live without him, but I'm so tired of this nowhere life we've built together. It's so lonely and we're both so miserable, whether or not he's willing to admit that.

I've threatened to leave many times, and did leave once for a week. I know the idle threats are a bad thing, but I've meant it every time. The reason I've stayed regardless is because (a) nowhere to go and (b) leaving is the last thing I actually want to do. But I've been crying all morning, because it hit me today that he's emotionally unavailable. I've been trying to get him to go to counselling to help him work through some things that are probably hurting our relationship (I'm currently in counselling for different reasons, but still have mending our relationship in mind), but he still hasn't used the resources I've looked up for his sake.

I don't think he wants us to get better. I think he's just too much of a coward to leave or kick me out.

I don't know what to do. How do you leave someone when you have nowhere to go and are completely financially dependent? 

I want to feel loved again. I want someone to want to hold me. I want someone to want to make love to me. I want someone who wants to make me smile and go the extra mile to get that. And I want all of that to be mutual, but at this point it just feels so one-sided... I feel lost. I feel sick to my stomach and broken.
