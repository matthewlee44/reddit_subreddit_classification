0,nafk6w,1620790707,Should I (M/26) pay or split on first hangout (F/22)?,"I (M/26) usually split the bill when I ask girls out, but a part of me feels like I should offer to pay with this girl (F/22) I'm seeing for the first time. She also snoozed her bumble account after we matched and made plans to meet up this coming Thursday. 

I learned during my early 20s to not go all out and pay/spoil someone which is why a part of me hesitates to pay for the whole bill unless we're exclusive/dating/relationship as I don't want to be taken advantage of even though I have the funds to pay. But I also don't want to assume that's always going to happen with every girl and can read the vibes and their intentions.

So do you offer to pay or ask to split the bill? Thanks in advance for any tips or advice!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nafk6w/should_i_m26_pay_or_split_on_first_hangout_f22/

2,nafutr,1620791770,Never been in a relationship,"So I’m a 26 F and I’ve never been in a relationship before. I’ve gone on casual dates and had a couple of almost relationships, but it didn’t really click. I grew up in a really conservative family and was always encouraged to wait until marriage to have sex. Consequently, I’m still a virgin and am a bit nervous about sex in general because it’s so new. I’ve been working through these feelings in therapy, but I sort of wonder how guys would perceive this in dating and relationships? Is it something that would make them uncomfortable with, or not mind?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nafutr/never_been_in_a_relationship/

Through out the relationship, he has always been hiding things and lies a lot. In the end he ended up catching feelings with another girl but he doesnt want a relationship with her. He broke up with me because he felt bad, and came back 3 weeks later saying that he wanted to work things out. It has now been about 4 months but sometimes he still lies about little things and it gave me so much anxiety about trusting him. Then a new guy came along whos been flirting with me and just want casual sex. I told my ex about this new guy and then my bf just came clean about everything and ask me to be his gf again the week after. I love my bf, but i really want to sleep with this new guy because he make me feel wanted, and for a revenge of all the things that my bf did in the past and possibly in the future.

I’m kind of at a point where I feel burned out from it. I don’t really want any romantic or sexual contact with anyone and I’m at a point where I just want to focus on work and finishing school.

6,nagk6z,1620794412,Unsure what my ex-boyfriend intention of saying he (35M) misses me (26F) is. Advice?," I’ve been dating this guy for about 8/9 months. We’re 9 years apart and I don’t notice the age difference. 34m, 25f. We get along like a house on fire, always laughing together. He tells me regularly ‘I laugh so much with you’, I know his friends, his family know about me but we haven’t been able to meet due to Covid. He used to call his parents every Sunday but since we’ve been dating, it’s become less and less. We normally see each other a few times a week, sometimes less or more depending on our schedule. He invites me to all the 'big' things in his life, for example, we were going to go to his medical ball together (he would've been seen with me in front of other girls if there is anything nefarious). When we drive or hangout in different areas together, he likes to look up the prices of houses. He's also said in front of me how cute kids are and that he can't wait to do that one day. Signs to me he's testing my reaction and seeing if I want that as well.

A few months into dating, he asked to make sure that we’re not seeing other people. He isn’t into casual sex and I think exclusivity is important to him. A few months ago I was anxious about what we were - he hadn’t asked me to be his girlfriend and I thought this is something that he would’ve wanted to do. He’s traditional, wanting something serious such as marriage/family. We had a few talks about the direction of our relationship, he said there were a few things he was a bit concerned about, a few things we maybe didn’t have in common (he’s very risk-averse and overthinks everything).

He’s studying so after that conversation he said he would decide at the end of his exams, his exams have finished now. He went away recently with some of his University friends, he was unsure of whether to go (seemed like he wanted to be with me, haha) and wanted to see me before he left. I’ve felt good about everything between us post-exams as I had a feeling he was going to slowly contact me less and less and try and see me less - due to his uncertainty.

One night on the phone, I told him that I wasn’t quite sure whether continuing to have sex with him was a wise idea as we aren’t boyfriend/girlfriend. He was confused that I said it was casual. I said ‘well, we aren’t in a relationship’ and he said ‘you are my girlfriend’ I’m certain he went onto say ’I thought we’ve known this since we started dating’ so I then asked him ‘well if I was to meet a new friend of yours that I haven’t met, would you introduce me as your girlfriend? And he said yes. Unfortunately, he has to repeat his exams so I may not be able to see him for a while, I do need to clarify that he actually meant this.I just wonder why he had this hesitancy a few times when we had the discussion a few months back though? There was even a point where I suggested we should end things because he wasn't so sure and he agreed. Maybe this is natural though and a reflection of his risk-averse attitude about things. There were just some uncertainties on his part. He said he could've been overthinking it. As a result, it sort of made me more anxious and I suggested we should end it.

He said it’ll be good to have a proper chat about things as we’ve both been putting things off, as so he said.

I got to his house, he said yes I have been his girlfriend all along and he doesn't know why I would think otherwise. He said that he feels it’s not going to work because of our age gap and he claims we're very different people. I personally do not see this as I feel like we share the same values, we're compatible in a lot of areas etc. He told me that he finds me beautiful, loves my sense of humour and that we get along and have fun together. I did mention that we handle conflict differently but our only arguments have been over text/call and since that's such a poor form of communication - it's hard to tell.

He started to cry (this is the most emotion I've seen from him), saying he won't be able to cook me any more dinners and our memories shared together. He then went back and forth and said he doesn't know if he's making the right decision, that he will never find someone like me, I am out of his league etc. He said maybe he's just one big idiot after all and he's made a stupid decision. I was calm in my response and he said ""why don't you get angry? this is making it more difficult"" in a somewhat cute way. He just kept saying that lately everything has been solidified in his brain that it's probably the most responsible decision. He asked me if I thought he was being unreasonable.

Now I feel like since we've been arguing quite a bit the past few weeks and he's been stressed, possibly his decision is skewed. I hadn't seen him in 2 or 3 weeks due to exams and I asked whether maybe we just got cold feet because of us not seeing each other. I remember months ago he said he sometimes questions us in absence.

We spent over 4 hours talking and it was like he didn't want me to leave nor did I. He then asked if we should go to dinner together. He finally walked me to my car and he couldn't stop crying.

Something in me decided to message him the other morning after I left:Me - Morning 📷 I don’t know if messaging you is the best idea, but I hope you haven’t woken up too sad. If you ever want to catch up on neutral grounds, a coffee or lunch, don’t hesitate - I still consider you a friend. Even under these circumstances, it was nice to see you last night and I am saddened I won’t be able to have more of them with you. That’s all 📷Him - Morning! I was in two minds as to whether to message you with the same sentiment 📷 I feel very much the same. Like you say it’s always nice seeing you, and it’s hard for me to think we won’t be sharing more moments together. I really hope you’re feeling ok today 📷 Enjoy the rest of your weekend 📷Me - Aw, well if you’re keen to catch up in a week to come or a few months, let me know. I’m trying to not make this any harder for us but it is difficult. I didn’t react with anger because that’s genuinely not how I feel about us. I miss you, enjoy your morning eggs 📷Him - Will do 📷 miss you too, at least you can have your eggs with olive oil today 📷Me - These thoughts are best discussed in person but I’m not sure if that can happen and they’re weighing heavy on me. I do think we could work through the issues as I feel there are more positives than negatives. I am aware that the past few weeks have been pretty nasty for the both of us but I’ve been particularly harsh on you. If I don’t hear back from you, I will, of course, assume you do not feel the same way and will accept your decision.Him - I thought I did explain that although the last month or so has been really difficult, it hasn’t been the main reason why I reached the decision I did. Of course I’m always really happy to talk to you about anything though, so if you still want to talk things through naturally I’m happy to do that 📷He went onto say that he hates that he's upset me and that it's all really difficult for him but he **thinks** it's all for the best.

We caught up and went to the beach together. We had a good time, he just feels at the moment he thinks it’s the best decision, although he isn’t fully confident he’s doing the right thing. He said maybe in a year it’ll make more sense and we realise we’re fit for each other. He said that he told his mother we broke up and she got really angry. Something was quite odd, he told me his friend (who I know) broke up with his girlfriend but they’re back together. We then went back to his for a cup of tea and we talked a bit more. He admitted that he does get in his head a lot and could be overthinking things. Said again that he's scared he's going to lose someone amazing but feels it's the right decision **right now**. Again, I feel because I've been arguing with him over text lately and he feels overwhelmed. When I left, he said he wants to see me again in a week or 2.

We spoke on the phone and I told him it’s really painful catching up with him and I don’t want to feel like an option to him or being left on the back burner, he said that wasn’t his intention and he would never do that as he has too much respect for me. He said it was hard catching up with me recently as well. He said he agreed to catching up because he felt like it was something I wanted. We spoke a bit more and he said that if he has a change of heart in the future, he won’t just sit on it. He’ll tell me. He told me he hopes I know how beautiful I actually am.

He ended up calling/messaging me over Christmas and NYE. I do feel like I am the one who predominately initiates contact with him first, I’ve been sending him sort of lengthy messages and he claims he’s overwhelmed by it. Recently we’ve been having an hour or so conversations when we usually would never have that as he was never one to speak on the phone. He expressed doubts about our break up as per usual and said he’s probably one big idiot after all. He told me he’s been on 2 dates with 2 girls as I asked, said he’s sort of interested but it hasn’t gone anywhere. I was quite upset and he assured me he wants to stay single for a while, he also said it’s not like he even wants a relationship with them. He said to give me some context that there were girls before we met that he was interested but it didn’t go anywhere. I was quite offended because he went on dates with girls that he basically broke up with me for. He broke up with me over an age gap but then went on dates with girls my age? Makes no sense. He said it’s all really regrettable and then told me that it's not that he wants a relationship with these people and said they’re just friends he wanted to get to know better. He said he wishes I could see his phone. Near the end of the phone call, he got teary about the fact he thinks I'm so sweet and don't deserve this.

He said over a month ago that a catch up would be good to clear the air. He also wouldn’t directly answer the question when I asked if he just sees me as a friend. I’ve decided to pull back, but it seems like he wants to catch up. At the start of this month, he offered to call about something, I think he was sort of surprised by that as I usually am jumping at any chance for us to speak on the phone. He sent me a message about the date/time tba (which I didn't respond to) and then he sent me a follow up message about a week later saying “Morning, when works this week for you?” with a smiley face. He then said whenever is fine, to choose a day/evening and let him know. He then said he hopes my mother is doing okay. This was 2 weeks ago and I didn't responded. He sent me another message 2 weeks later saying he hadn’t heard from me in a while, was wondering how I am and asked if my mother is okay. I replied and I was friendly, but brief. He replied and said a few things and then said ‘we never caught up in the end, let me know if you would still like to’ we talked a bit more and then I told him that I feel he just wants to catch up to free himself from guilt and that we can only catch up if we both feel it’s best for us to be together. He responded with saying that he understands and he didn’t think it would still be really difficult but he understands and there is a bit of truth in wanting to free himself but he thought it would be healthy in general. Apologised for the pain he’s caused me and wished me all the best. I told him that I just felt him talking about clearing the air was ominous and I just wanted to have dinner with him and not talk about us. He said that he understands how that could have caused it and apologies and said it’s the furthest from how he wanted to make me feel. I didn't respond and almost 2/3 months later, I sent him a message telling him what I wanted to tell him if we had cleared the air. He positively responded to it, told me things have been really difficult on his end, he still thinks and misses me all the time. That he basically feels the same, it’s just really hard and he doesn’t know what to do and doesn’t want to mess with my head so he tries to leave me alone. He also said he misses laughing at dumb things with me/times we shared.

Advice? What do you think he would benefit from telling me he still thinks about me all the time/misses me.

\*\*TL;DR\*\* ex-boyfriend broke up with me in November 2020. He cried a lot that day. He's expressed doubt and says he's probably one big idiot regarding his decision.

7,nagr6l,1620795185,Maybe this would make sense of a lot of what we see on here?,"So I’ve hung around this sub for a while. Some trends include:

1) Lots of guys complaining about having a hard time with dating and feeling like they have little to no control at all over the outcomes. As in the system may never work for them.

2) Guys and women respond in various ways. Many well-intentioned. Some blatantly toxic. Many of the well-intentioned ones have some stink to them or basically are giving advice without giving advice.

3) Some of these guys get buried in negativity at times and start theorizing on why they are struggling so much or taking ugly objective truths about dating apps for example and treating them like they explain their entire dating experience. Basically women get generalized.

4) Lots of men and women tear all of that to shreds. None of that is happening at all. Dating apps are 100% fair, nothing is more difficult for men. Basically everyone says those guys have no validity to their argument at all to any extent.

5) Everyone leaves really pissed off and more polarized than they were at the beginning. This happens again and again and again. It’s a thing.

Maybe instead of picking a side we can try to put it all together to make sense of all of it?

Which would look something like:

1) A lot of guys are actually having a really hard time dating. It’s not just in their heads. It’s real.

2) Most individual women aren’t unreasonable by themselves in what they are looking for. They know what they want but they are plenty flexible on their end.

3) When you put all women together it happens to work out that it comes together in a way where a significant number of men are having a really hard time in a real way. And no one’s advice is working. Plenty of ways this could happen without women necessarily being to blame or something. It’s just complicated.

4) These frustrated guys are simply trying to make sense of what is actually a very complicated situation that really sucks. They make some simple assumptions and exaggerate the meaning of objective trends in Tinder etc to try to explain it. This leaves a bad taste in a lot of people’s mouths because it runs counter to their own experiences and seems like a personal attack.

5) Everyone gets pissed off and more divided.

Not saying this is the way it is. But maybe this could make sense of everyone’s experiences if it was actually something like this.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nagr6l/maybe_this_would_make_sense_of_a_lot_of_what_we/

She   hasn’t mentioned her account yet but I just wanted to check that the   pictures at her Hinge profile actually matched. (Something I do after being catfished once)

Anyway...   She has her account public so I had the chance to take a look at her posts, nothing weird there... but all of a sudden she made her profile private. I thought it was something normal though.

Literally the next day her profile was public again, I could see this because  her  stories were open for all to see, I didn’t watch them.  I found  this  kind of weird because my ex used to do this to increase her  followers  (not a social media expert) but this girl has no more than  600  followers, so I am pretty sure she is not doing it for that reason.   So i  decided to check on her account later in the day and she was  private  again. She does this every day multiple times a day, which  makes me  believe she is somewhat insecure.

Before anything, just a little bit about me... 

I'm 26, I'm from colombia and live there and still single. 

I have dated some girls through my life always looking to have a serious relationship, but they were always just looking to take advantage of me or they never were looking to get a serious relationship.

The thing is that I really - I mean REALLY - suck on dating or even worse when it comes to ask to a lady for her number.

I think I'm really outgoing, confident and extremely honest/straight in almost every single aspect of my life, but when is about woman I find attractive - thin with a cute face - I'm awkward and shy AF, and if we have a good connection, maybe the most sweet, lovely and trustworthy man you'll ever met. 

Still hope to find that girl who also is looking for a serious thing, but seems really hard to find, and even harder on my city, where seems that everyone just want hook ups, take advantage of the other and even, not respecting other's time or their feelings, and of course never looking for something serious.

I'll really appreciate any advice that you can give to me, fro dating or life, I still hope that I'll be able to find my soul mate, but at this time, I'm starting to lose all hope.

I’ve also forced myself to be social over that time and I have been talking many girls over the last 4-5 months. But even with all that I’m still a virgin who’s never been in a relationship. I consider myself relatively social (I’m no professional cold approached but if I see a cute girl when I’m out, I can go talk to her and eventually get her number). I also know that it can’t be that I’m ugly since I’ve had girls compliment me and approach and sometimes ask to hang out with me. But at the same time nothing ever lasts more than a week with any of these girls that I talk to. Online dating has been a complete shit show, I get lots of matches but whenever I get there number and eventually try to set something up they just go ghost (or they go on one date with me and go ghost). I’m still gonna keep making strides to be more social and bettering my physique in the meantime but I feel like I’m ready to be in a relationship and I’m kinda tired of always being single and a virgin. Hoping some day things will change but I guess I’m getting a little impatient.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/naiizh/i_feel_like_im_always_going_to_be_alone_and_i/

I feel like some important background info is that he’s in the military and is leaving the country for 2 years. I don’t want to call it the stereotypical dating a military guy situation, but it’s definitely different... he’s not a bad guy. He says what he thinks and doesn’t hesitate to answer my questions about our relationship. He says he has a gut feeling about me, which I feel is a totally valid reason to propose/express that he wants to marry me. I’m not sure if I’m crazy for understanding where he’s coming from and not wanting him to leave. I told him that marriage is serious and that it can’t just be thrown out there. He completely understood and just explained that he’s a “one and done” kind of guy so he takes it seriously too. So, some thoughts on this would be very helpful.

I'm a 5'4 man and in my 8 years of having apps, I haven't matched with a single woman that was shorter than me. I did try but it never happened and it never will for some reason idk. In that time span, 100% of the women that I did match with were taller than me which is ironic or at least same height. A few of them were tall. I've also noticed that a lot of guys on [r/short](https://www.reddit.com/r/short/) are also with tall women as well. Its interesting because usually short women go after tall men so I think that this ruins the chances of tall women going for tall guys or tall women dont care and genuinely like short guys.

I really don't want to be known just as a classmate that plays games with her. I want to be more, I want to support her when she needs someone, I want to be there for her... I'm not ready to confess and there are 2 reasons for that:

1. even though ive dated previously (1-2 times), ive never actually confessed to anyone before, ive been confessed to by others countless of times and I never knew how they mustered their courage.

2. I'm not ready to risk our friendship over something stupid, I still have another 1.5 years of being in the same class as her I think and I really don't want to make things awkward for her, she's really socially awkward and I would say that I'm one of the 2-3 people in class that she can talk to with ease.

37,najmle,1620807406,Cockblocked by Covid,"All my life I haven't had much luck with dating, being a wlw with less than average looks and living in a third-world country with most of the people here still believing that the LGBT community is a sin and an illness. But this time, I was the closest to having a connection with someone, only to be blocked by quarantine announcements.

So we met on a dating app, and turns out she's my junior in college. We hit off pretty well at the start but similar to my previous matches, when we move our conversation to another social media everything just turns dry. And in the end, I'm usually the one getting ghosted. But months after that, we kinda talked again a lot. Everytime we reply to each other's ig stories the conversation seem to flow smoothly and it was really enjoyable to talk to her, although we we're just talking about basic stuffs like school.

One day, she approached me first (she rarely does that) and asked me if we could hang out irl and have a boba date. I said okay, and we already agreed on the time &amp; date. But on the day of the date, I was already on my way when she suddenly messaged me saying that she was sick. Of course, I felt really sad but I understood that it's because she had been awake until late for a couple of nights trying to catch up with deadlines. And being sick in the middle of a pandemic isn't a good situation to be in.

It got dry again, but we managed to get back to talking like normal, and somehow we even had a discord call together and it was genuinely fun. We scheduled on a date again, this time on a karaoke date because we discovered we both love karaoke. Unfortunately, her area suddenly had a case so close to her house and she had a grandma to take care of so her family warned her to not go outside. Again, I was sad but I understood it was for the best.

Surprisingly she asked again for a third time, this time she was sure it's gonna be alright because she needed to go to our college physically to deal with some stuff and she was sure this time it wouldn't go wrong. But lo and behold, it was like the universe doesn't want me to date, the government announced another quarantine order because my area was marked as a red zone.

Will I ever get to properly date someone someday? We'll see.. maybe just not in this pandemic.

43,nakpjb,1620812263,"Someone lovely, but the physical attraction is definitely not there...","Hi everyone,

40m, Europe. Somehow or another I'm trying to pick myself up and venture into dating (OLD, inevitably), in spite of everything that's going on. I am getting  results, although it's far too soon to be able to say if anything will lead anywhere. I have already one difficult situation, which I want to ask about...

I started chatting with someone on Hinge a while ago. Chat was \_really\_ great, and was happy to meet her. We met up and spent some time in the park. Problem is, the second she arrived I could tell immediately that I had little physical attraction for her... But I was there and she'd seemed nice, so I was certainly happy to spend some time with her.

She was, however, really lovely! We enjoyed a great few hours sitting in the park and getting to know each other. Vibe was really good, etc. etc. Last night we did a similar plan, and again it was all great, and have been enjoying some positive text chat in the meantime...

*However, I am not physically attracted to her...*

To clarify: I'm *absolutely not* looking for a relationship that's based on sex. Been there, done that, no thank you. In terms of the physical side, I'm always looking for someone who is just at least over the bar where I can see myself with her in that way. That bar is also not *very high!* But hopefully you can understand what I mean...

So the problem is, without some initial physical connection, I know it will be very hard for me to move onto an emotional connection. And even worse than that, because I have been in this situation before, I fear that trying to force something has a huge danger of hurting her, and making me also feel like dirt...

But on the other hand, I don't want to reject her as an option, when that's perhaps something that could be worked on? As I said, she seems to be a rather lovely person, who may well tick many many of my other boxes... It seems that other people make this work, could/should I do this too?

There is someone else also who I have a more balanced interest in, but it is too soon to say about that. That one is currently feeling like it's at the make-or-break fizzle or continue stage, even though things have been going well.

So what the hell to do?

Thanks, everyone",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nakpjb/someone_lovely_but_the_physical_attraction_is/
44,naktbn,1620812682,"Does anyone still communicate with people over texting someone's phone numbers, or is social media like (fb,snap, insta) the preffered option.","So in general i've noticed that if your interested in someone and there interested in you back; the platform you use to communicate with them via text isn't that big of a deal. However, i've noticed that a lot of girls I've spoken to prefer to text a guy over a phone number as it feels a lot more personal and direct than messaging over social media.  Whenever I'm talking to someone in a bar/party or on a dating app, If I'm having a good conversation with someone I would usually ask someone if its cool to get there FB/Insta. I think its general the best option because it gives both you and the other person(as well as their friends) to suss each other out. I personally hate using snapchat to talk to people even if there friends(i havent used it since my teens); I find it pretty impersonal and I hate the entire messaging system.    


However, the more advice I've heard is that I should ask for someone's number if I really like them. I just feel however thats a lot more forward and full on than asking for someones FB for instance. I met a really awesome girl a few days ago, and we already had each others FB and insta details but than she asked for my number and told me to text it instead. We are  havinga great convo now, but I just find texting on a number to be a bit harder in the age of SM. For me I feel texting on a number is very logistical and is used to really organise a date maybe. Its very hard to have a proper conversation over it because there is no read receipts and you can't see someone active status.   


So i guess my question does anyone still use numbers to text. I'm not just talking in the dating sense. Like do people still text their friends over phone numbers.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/naktbn/does_anyone_still_communicate_with_people_over/

47,nal2t5,1620813769,he made fun of me for being transgender after 8 months,"hi, i’m 24f. he was 18m. we were together for 8 months, prior to that i was single for about 4 and a half years or so. i’m very choosy when it comes to who i want to be with, but it feels like every time i ever find myself in a relationship, it’s really bad. 
we met towards the end of summer last year, long distance by the way. i had a lot of experience being on dates, intimacy, i had fallen out of love before. he had not much experience except for mostly long distance sexual talking. 
i’m transgender, and had started taking estrogen more recently. i’m very happy about it, and i feel great. me being a trans girl had never really seemed to be an issue, i did have to explain a lot of things, and guide him on what it’s like, what my experience is like, and such. he already had an attraction to that type of woman, he had just never spoken to someone who is. 
i quickly fell for him, he was very sweet, charming, good looking, and had all of the same goals for a long term relationship that i have. 
sadly, my idiocy would bring up insecurity a lot in the beginning stage, and it got to a point where we would argue it because i consistently thought he was lying to me. this was a major issue in the first few months. he apologized for the things that made me insecure, and we kept going. 
since about january things were going really well, except for me constantly questioning wether or not i wanted to be with him anymore, because we fought so heavily for months. i had tried to leave him on a number of occasions, but he would calm me down and convince me to stay. 
we were basically having issues that people shouldn’t be having so early on and it really killed me mentally. i use to have really awful self harm issues years ago that i had relapsed on once while i was with him because i was so stressed out. 
my friends were very iffy on him, but i always stuck up for him because a lot of the times it felt like they didn’t like him because i was with him. our arguments would start in front of my friends and then continue on for hours. although i’ll admit sometimes that was my fault. 
but one thing that started to bother me is that i hardly ever had the chance to miss him. we were constantly talking to each other and sleep on calls together. i luv a clingy guy, i think it’s amazing, but sometimes i wish i would have had the chance to actually miss him there. sadly when he found friends to be with, i almost felt relieved because i didn’t have to worry about fighting. 
another issue for me was his tone of voice, i’m super sensitive on tone, my parents are very verbally abusive and yell a lot so i get anxiety really easily when i think people are angry. that never got better with us. 
there were a lot of times where i felt like he only cared about me because i was the most intimacy he had experienced. 
so the breakup… i had already told him two days prior that i couldn’t keep hanging on. i let crying the whole time because i really wish i had a reason to stay but i felt really hopeless. the same night he had begged me to stay for just another day. i did, and i didn’t really have a regret from staying. 
another day passes and then we get into an argument, because he had wanted to fool around with me, which is fine, i always oblige because when i’m in a relationship i become an insanely super sexual person, but taking estrogen has slowed that down a bit, i still crave it and it’s easy to get me aroused with some flirting and sweet talking, but he has a tendency of just flatly telling me he was in the mood and expecting me to get right to it. i asked him if he could wait, he said he’d just go take care of himself, and that kind of hurt my feelings because he’s always open with me when he was in the mood and vice versa. 
i had told him to leave me alone for a moment, and then the argument started in front of my friends. then, he made fun of me for being on estrogen, and that really hurt my feelings. i refuse to stay with somebody who thinks it’s ok to just mock me for being trans. you can mock my hair color, my pastel clothing, my music taste, and video game skill but when it comes to who i am, that took it too far for me. that was unforgivable, so i had told him to leave. 
he never once apologized, he just asked if we’re actually through and went along with his day as if nothing happened. a piece of me feels relieved, like there’s a huge burden lifted off my shoulders, but the other part of me really misses him. i know he won’t apologize though, and i don’t know if that’s something i want to look past given everything else we had been through in 8 months. 
i can’t help but feel like it was self sabotage, but i also feel like if he really loved me like he said, he would have known to never insult me being trans.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nal2t5/he_made_fun_of_me_for_being_transgender_after_8/

I feel like I always see ugly girls going after guys that are completely out of their league. I(20) myself am an ugly guy and when I try to go after other ugly women, they all think they’re out of my League. Like I was told that I’m the ugly friend and that she was only talking to me so her friends can talk to my friends. This girl was obese and very unattractive in the face but still thought I was beneath her.

I know everyone talks about how ugly guys are with good looking girls but I don’t think I’ve ever once seen that. I see good looking and average guys with below average woman daily.

It’s just frustrating. I can’t go after a woman out of my league but all the women in my league want men outside of their league.

If I had gotten to know her in any other circumstance, I would probably ask her out in a heart beat and this is coming from a guy who is the opposite of confident.

I think I have a decent chance of her saying yes if I did ask but I'm very concerned about being rejected, not because it would hurt my pride or anything but the fact it could effect my job by looking unprofessional especially if I'm reading into something that isnt there.

70,naoke5,1620825821,What's the line between empathy for the other person vs not being overly accommodating?,"When thinking about this generally, it seems fairly straightforward - a healthy dose of empathy/consideration/tolerance for the other person's likes/dislikes, behaviours etc, balanced with your own identity and not being overly accommodating to the point where it doesn't align with your likes/dislikes, and comes off as unattractive

However as a 30M who avoids conflict/has a fear of relationships ending and the woman leaving, I find myself getting caught in between empathy and being overly accommodating in the actual moment itself. I want to be empathetic as it is important, but at the same time I get conscious of the potentially 'needy' vibe that gets given off if I am overly accommodating. Then I get into a tangle of worrying that if I'm not accommodating enough, I will come off as inconsiderate and they will leave

We found that we had pretty much exactly same outlook on almost all things we talked about, we even had similar experiences. We became good friends soon enough. There were times when we had mental breakdowns, we came to each other's aid during those days. She told me about her dating life, that she had a really bad experience with her ex. She committed self-harm because of him (which I scolded her for). During all this time I grew attached to her, I didn't wanted this. I'm still trying to hold myself back (telling myself, We both are not ready for another relationship. she's having her competitive exams soon you'll just distract her. She's not even pretty).

I dmed her a day later asking if she enjoyed the meeting.
She said yes,and then she sent clear signs she was interested like: answering quickly,asking questions,lots of emojis,sharing thoughts,and the ratio was for every 2 messages i sent she replied with(not exagerating)10-12 or more:)so she was really engaged.(should have asked her out...but i hesitated)

We wished happy new year and in februrary,after like 5 months(dont go that long like i did)i asked her out,and she said she ll be at one of the girls for a sleepover that day and that was that.

We greet eachother on the hallway and wave to one another.
She seems a little shy.I still think she's interested,but doesnt want to do the first move and potentially get rejected.

We always had a jokey relationship, we teased each other playfully, even before we started dating. Then just tonight, she said she doesn't want to date anymore. I asked if she was angry with me, did I offend her or something, she said that A MONTH AGO I SAID SOMETHING THAT WAS A MAJOR TURN OFF. A freaking month ago. She never mentioned what was it that turned her off. She never mentioned why. We continued dating FOR A MONTH, even after that event that turned her off. All I know is that time we were joking around, and she suddenly said she was irritated.

It fucking sucks. I'd be okay with it IF I KNEW what was my fault. If I knew that I screwed up. But to continue dating and not mention that there was something wrong, is just plain fucked up. I don't know if I'm just being overly emotional here. But I feel like she was being mature. We always teased each other and joked around, I didn't say anything racist or sexist towards her, I didn't insult her hobbies. Yet something I said must have triggered her or something.

I guess my point is, besides the needed rant. To tell your partner if something is wrong. We're not freaking mind readers, our brains aren't in sync with each other 100% if you were turned off or offended by something your partners does that isn't obvious to him/her, fucking tell them.

It's only early days but certain things don't feel right, I'm considering pulling away before I truly invest as I value honesty above all else.

Seeking advice but would love to hear any 'Red Flags' you have experienced! 

1.  Stating she's over sex and looking for something serious, deleting tinder (no longer on my account, which I then deleted) - a week later a friend sent me a screenshot of her on his. 

*Don't mind her dating multiple people, moreso vetting her honesty here.

2. Rescheduling dates, but mixing up the days (I.e. - Cancelling Wednesday, when we were catching up Tuesday) Then being OK for the original day. 

3. Stating she wanted to reduce phone time, yet regularly adding dozens of people on Instagram. In addition to leaving her phone on silent in another room when we are together.

4. Active on Instagram unless she's seeing ""X family member / friend she hasn't seen for a while"". Yet posts family and friends up the majority of other times.

5. No contact, or a single message saying she's heading to bed very early on nights when she's had visits from these ""friends / family members"". Unsual, considering we are up chatting / together very late; all other work nights.

There are more to list, but yeah, these are the most recent and obvious.

I definitely called it off with them since I don't want to string them along just to get sex but at the same time I don't know if I did something wrong or if a lot of girls are just like that.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nasp3b/potential_fwb_catching_feelings_almost_right_away/
90,naspwu,1620836558,I don't know if this girl has friend zoned me or wants me to be her boyfriend,"I've been talking to this girl from my class for about 5 months now. A week ago she told me that she wants me to do something to her but she won't tell me until I do it. So when we went out after that I ask her what is the thing she wants me to do while we we're sitting on a bench just the two of us. She looked at me, smiled and said you have to find out. While we were walking her friend calls her and asks what we're we doing ( we were just drinking orange juice) and kept asking her if its the only thing we did.

After that we went to a more secluded place and she laid on my shoulder. We sat there for about an hour just talking and kidding around. The whole time she was cuddled up in me.

When we got home I asked her what the thing is again. She asked me what it was and I said ""I think that it was to kiss but I don't think its that"". She said that the thing is way out of the friend zone and that I shouldn't do it but just forget about it. Half an hour later she tells me that she's depressing herself. Told me gn and that she will be hearing songs till she falls asleep.

The next day she sends a picture of her in the group chat and a friend says why do your eyes look like you've been crying the whole night. 

When we go out she's always right next to me when we walk or if we're sitting she's cuddled in me most of the time.

Does she want us to go out or does she wants us to become bf and gf?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/naspwu/i_dont_know_if_this_girl_has_friend_zoned_me_or/
91,nasq2b,1620836570,How to be less invisible?,"I’m basically invisible to guys, and I’m wondering if its something I can change.

I don’t think I’m markedly unattractive. I’m not overweight and I always make sure I look presentable. It doesn’t seem to help though. Is there a certain look guys look for?? Could it be the impression I make?? I have no idea lol.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nasq2b/how_to_be_less_invisible/
92,nast0e,1620836771,Did I get played or did I screw up?,"Would love to hear what y’all think cuz I’m not sure what to make of it myself. 

Met this girl on a dating app a while ago and started hanging out with her. We went on some some cool dates around town and got to know eachother all the while. We had some really good times together and things were going really good it seemed until a couple weeks ago when she started to seem uninterested. 

Fast forward a bit, I ask her about that and she replied she’d rather be just friends, without citing any specific reason why. I don’t really buy that she’d been just looking to make a friend that whole time, I mean we met on a dating app. Also at many times she put out some strong signals that she was just as into me as I was into her. I don’t think I said or did anything along the line that would have turned her off to me? 

I don’t know if she genuinely just doesn’t feel the same, she found another guy she’s more interested in, or I messed up. I feel pretty bummed about it, I had really started to like this girl and was excited to keep spending time with her. So to start getting to know someone as more than a friend and invest time into building that, only to end up here feels like I just got played. I just can’t help but feel like I screwed up somewhere along the line too and I’m stuck here thinking about what it might have been. 

Either way I’m happy I got to have what I did with this girl, it was nice while it lasted. I just wish it could have been more. It’s all just very confusing to me.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nast0e/did_i_get_played_or_did_i_screw_up/

94,nata16,1620837927,Is this gross?,"I apologize if this is totally the wrong place to post this it just wouldn’t let me anywhere else!

Okay so I’m kind of embarrassed about this and it was only my third time doing anal. I don’t know who else to talk about this with so here I am! I am a 22F and the guy I was with was a 27M. We have hung out before a few times and done anal once and it was good. It had been a few months since we had hung out and we got food and were hanging and things were going super well so we fell back into our usual ways of not being able to keep our hands off each other. 

He asked if we could do anal and I was a little hesitant but said yes. It hurt a bit but he was considerate and gentle and caring. We did it for a while switching positions until he said he was close to cuming. He was taking a video on my phone, I was in doggy. He came inside me and when he pulled out there was a medium sized drop of dark stuff and a little fleck of dark stuff that dropped out (poop and maybe a little blood-gross I know!).. he wiped it off quickly and got a towel. so he didn’t say anything was sweet and gave me a towel but I kinda worried about it anyways cuz it’s anal. When he was setting alarms and stuff I watched the video and saw it and was mortified. He was sweet and we cuddled and fell asleep and the next morning we had vaginal sex and it was great. 

We never addressed the gross dripping that  accompanied his cum. I am still so embarrassed though! Is this normal? Am I super gross or something? I guess if he was gonna cum in me and I hadn’t cleaned out earlier (I didn’t know we were gonna do anal) then something would’ve come out. Do you think he was disgusted though? I feel bad and gross kind of but I really wanted to please him and it was mostly enjoyable. 

If you have anything thoughts about my silly and embarrassing experience please share your honest thoughts but also please be kind if possible-I have ocd and anxiety so you better believe it’s going to be driving me nuts for weeks anyways lol",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nata16/is_this_gross/

Are you on the left or...? Seriously I’ve had some where there’s either no clear photo of them on their own where their face is recognisable, they look too similar to their friends to the point you can’t tell them apart, or there’s literally no lone photo of them whatsoever. It doesn’t make you look cool or sociable, it’s just annoying and I end up swiping left. Do any men on here get the same thing with women?

97,natoue,1620838946,"How do I ""progress"" with a girl I met and want to date? Should we talk over text first?","I met a girl last week while attending a lesson. I struck conversation with her over the breaks we had and I think I'd like to know her better. I found her to be quite pretty and fun to talk with, we had things in common

I forgot to ask her number but I decided to follow her on instagram and shoot her a message saying who I was and how she was doing. She followed me back and said she was good and asked me back. She also used those blushing smiley's in her text which is a good thing, right?

I then asked her some questions what she was currently doing which thinking back is probably a bad idea since she's already told me these things about her and they're not really that interesting to talk about. I asked her what she was up to this week and tried to steer the conversation into something we might have in common hoping to ask her if she wants to meet up. Or is that too soon? I think she's also a bit busy since she has exams coming up

Do people like to text a bit before meeting in person? I always feel like texting is very boring especially if it's with someone I barely know. Should I just ask her if she's free and wants to go out some day?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/natoue/how_do_i_progress_with_a_girl_i_met_and_want_to/
