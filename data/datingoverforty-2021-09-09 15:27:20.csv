I was in therapy, I think I became much more self-aware, I came to the point of being able to hear from others if I am being an a**hole and apologize, to apologize first etc etc. And 3 months ago I met him. Nice, kind, and‚Ä¶different. He was not the typical guy I used to be attracted to. I was happy. It meant I‚Äôve changed. My choices have changed. I was ready to give love, to be honest and vulnerable. He was very excited about me and our future. At least in the beginning. Told me he didn‚Äôt want to rush things (intimacy) and wanted to make everything right. Well, 2 months later I started getting a vibe that he was not interested anymore. I asked him directly and he assured me I was wrong. Then things repeated and I brought the topic again. Well, he supposedly took it as if I was breaking up with him (over the text, facepalm) and literally ghosted me for 4 days. When I texted him again asking for clarity it turned out I never broke up with him but he did break up with me. Just like that, I literally am that idiot that didn‚Äôt read between lines. It hurts so bad. All I am doing is crying and drinking. He apologized for appearing to lead me on but it looks like this is exactly what he did.

My single, male, 44  of 2 years gave me (F, 43, married, ENM) a heads up he's going to see this girl he's been in touch with. We talked about her briefly and he didn't seem too uncomfy to talk about.  He's briefly mentioned her a month or so ago as well.

 I was really happy for him, and encouraging, and told him I think it's great he's doing this and to have fun (since he seemed unsure).  We then have amazing sex afterwards 

He was silent after his date night, but when we started texting, I lightheartedly asked how it went and hoped things flowed naturally and that he had fun.

He says: ü§î üßê ü§® ...then later: I'll give my uncomfortable answer ü§ñ 

Then even later: It went well. I was pleasantly surprised as my expectations weren't high. 

I excitingly (maybe too happily) told him I was glad it went well and  always good to keep expectations low 

 I now realize I stepped over his boundaries as his texts are short and kinda cold. 

1.  what the heck do those expressions interpret 

2. Should I bring this uncomfy topic up and apologize 

3. Do I continue communicating with him   flirtatiously like we usually do? Or just match his low energy?

We see each other just about every weekend, and now I feel odd asking about this weekend. 

 I thought it was OK to generally ask how it went the fact he mentioned about this girl a few times in the past.

 He's not non monogamous but tells me it turns him on that he is with me, married woman, and jokes about him effing me if he gets married one day!  (Yet prob post-nut talk there)

Just unsure what to do or think.  

 Part of me wants to just act like nothing has happened, and part of me wants to apologize if I stepped over  his boundaries that we never discussed.

And it does bother me if I hurt him in any way.

I fear apologizing will make me even look more nosey and I don't want to pry.

My bf and I have been together for about 16 months now. It's been great. I love him. He loves me. I don't doubt either of those things. But... and there's always a but, right?... I need more. I want more. I don't mean an engagement or living together. I mean, more time together. I'm starting to feel like an every other weekend girlfriend. And dinner on Sundays. 

I've already established that he's secure and I'm more anxious leaning. He's content with the pace of the relationship. I'd like it to move a little faster. He said something last weekend that was like a punch in the gut. I'm sure he's completely oblivious to the impact it had on me. His divorce was supposed to be final in February. It's still not final. And he hasn't been very aggressive in making sure it gets that way. There's one signature (his ex's), on one document standing in the way of his freedom. When I asked him for an update on how its progressing, he said something to the effect of, the fact that it's not over doesn't stress him out like it did earlier in the year. 

He has tied me meeting his 12yo son w/ his divorce being finalized. I agreed it's probably best. But it's starting to hurt our relationship. It impacts the amount of time we can spend together. If he met me then I could start making more appearances on my off weekend, for example, going over to watch a movie, or meeting for ice cream. 

Am I an asshole for wanting to spend more time together? In the beginning we would get together during the week. Then my schedule went sideways and that was impossible. Now I have a better schedule and he never initiates getting together during the week. If I didn't suggest it, we probably wouldn't. We have managed to have two weekday sleepovers in the past 5 weeks. 

I don't feel like a priority. I've told him I don't feel like a priority. And then... the comment about no rush on the divorce just gutted me.

I'm very new to dating having ended an abusive relationship two years ago. So I just don't know what's typical and accepted and what's frankly not OK.

So this guy ive been seeing basically turns up at my house last night. I've been having issues with WhatsApp and messages and also wasn't feeling my best yesterday, which he knows.

At no point had we arranged a time, or anything and he didn't knock my door to even let me know he was around.
His messages finally came through about 9.05pm,by which point he'd blocked me on WhatsApp.
So I text trying to explain and apologise for what I hold my hands up to as an oversight on my part. He explained he felt angry and I think let down, I tried further to explain the issues I'd been having, and my health issues leading me to actually forget what day it even was(brain fog).

He's angry because he assumed I was with another man. Not was I ill, or dealing with anything, just straight up, has to be another fella. When I pointed out that when I don't get any response from him, or he's quiet for a day my thoughts turn to him being busy or not feeling great, he told me I turned it around on him and that's not OK because he's the 'victim here'.

Then I got a long lecture about how I disregarded his time and disrespected him. His energy and his time. I between this lecture id sent a text saying my kiddos are in bed if you want to have a chat. But he must have been too angry to take that in as I got a text saying I need a few days to think about your 'absurd behaviour'.

Admittedly that touched a nerve so I basically told him nothing to think about and if I've not apologised twenty times at least and that still wasn't enough then I don't need days to be told I'm not good enough.
Backtracked here and said but I thought I was still coming.
I basically said, nope. It's not wise. And I'm not putting myself in that position.
To which apparently you can be really mad at someone and then switch to being happy with them and if I want to grasp onto one thing he said that's in the past (?) then that's on me.
I've not responded because wtf?

I feel like my past makes me increasingly unreasonable because this exchange, it just felt off. I was saying sorry in every message. And because I felt sad he thought off the bat, I had another guy that I made him the bad guy.

47,pmajzo,1631377900,Am I being ridiculous? Need some honest feedback...,"So, I am out of a long marriage some 3 years ago and met someone 6 months ago. We took it slowly at the start, but since 4 months, we meet every second week (both have kids) and it feels really good when we are together. We have fun, there's a lot of attraction, talking, and shared values.

The thing that bothers me is a complete lack of verbally expressed affection or intentions from his side. It creeps up on me and makes me think that I am letting my emotions build up too quickly. 

He is also not taking any initiatives at all for me to meet his friends or family. He is not telling his kids that he met someone.  

A couple of weeks ago, I took him to my childhood country house. Showed him where we used to swim, walk in the forest, and go to a cafe that my mom's friend still has. This weekend he decided to go there with his kids. He mentioned it casually to me a couple of days ago and said that he had considered not to tell me..?! I joked about showing him my secret hidaways and him immediately stealing them. He did NOT ask if it was ok. On the other hand I didn't say it wasn't.

But... he went there today. Talked to my mom's friend for a long time, but didn't mention me at all. It feels so strange. And at the same time it makes me feel soooo ridiculous and childish. I obviously don't own the forest, beach, caf√©... 

I realize this is not really about the cafe or talking to a woman he knows I know well since childhood, but about the whole situation. I am transparent to my friends and kids, I invite him to my life. I say that I miss him when we're not together. I've sent him a couple of hearts. He does not reciprocate. On the other hand, he is active with texting, planning to meet, he drives to see me even if only for a short moment sometimes, he is very sweet and physically close to me when we are together. 

We haven't met for a very long time and I should probably just sit back, relax, and let the relationship evolve... Or?

49,pmbuu1,1631382116,Wanting to try again but also equally afraid.,"I've (41F) been divorced for 4yrs. Met a couple of guys in between but never materialized. I have 2 children under 13, shared custody. 

At this point I'm trying to think how to write what I'm feeling and it feels quite difficult but I'd like to hear your thoughts on this. 

I signed up for OLD and although I was optimistic about meeting someone I also have the fear that I'm just wasting my time and it will never work out. I matched with a few guys and sadly, they either didn't match up with the conversations  ( I prefer communicating this way as I express myself best - Introvert here) or they ghost or there will be an issue with the distance. 

As much as I like the idea of meeting someone local, my history of dating and relationships are all LDR. And with my present situation, I prefer it LDR to avoid any local gossips as the country I'm living now has a small population and the last thing I want is for my ex's family and him to cause any issues that might jeopardize my current living conditions.

After a week of OLD, I cancelled it mainly I think it's just useless and I'll just end up with the same results. I don't see myself as desperately wanting a relationship but having someone special who I can share my world would be really nice. I think deep down inside we all want companionship, knowing that we are not alone and that we are special, loved, valued and accepted. 

I can't remember how it is like to kiss someone or to hold their hand or to go out on a date. When I see pictures of couples or reading about their lovey dovey stories, I just look away and think to myself, ""maybe that could be my story too again one day""

I had a guy on OLD asked me if I would like to be married again. Somehow I cried so much before answering it. I do belief in marriage, just that the wrong people made the experience unpleasant. It is something that I like to try again if there is a chance but it isn't something that I'm ready for right now. 

Answering that question made me think a lot about what I really want. Something that I was quite afraid to admit to myself. Answering it also took a lot of courage to truly speak from the heart at the same time also acknowledging the amount of fear that I have from failing at it again or even being able to find it again. 

There is this feeling of hope and want that is trying to emerge and there is also the feeling of being hopelessness. 

I spend my time illustrating all of my feelings and 'telling' them on social media without fully exposing that that is what I'm really feeling. It's like an outlet for me to cry openly without showing any physical tears. 

A friend of mine once told me, ""to love again is to be dare to feel hurt again"". She meant well but I did felt my heart beat faster and my arms pulled a little closer to myself. Hurt can really help you build the Great Wall of China around your heart. 

Have you ever felt this way before when it comes to dating again/opening yourself to the possibility of a new relationship?

He texted me yesterday asking for suggestions of places that is between us. I gave him a few suggestions that was halfway point between us. We had not discussed/or agreed on a time to meet yet. His last text was in the afternoon telling me he will get back to me later that night to let me know what places he had decided and coordinate time.

My kids both in sports so a lot of running around for pick up, drop off, games. I have them every other week and on my off week I get them on Wednesday. ( I love that I get to see them on my off week. )   Her daughter stays at her dad's whenever she decides. So she comes and goes. Our kids went to school together so they know each other and know some of their friends. They seem to get along. 
 I have been looking for a house but the market is so overinflated that I would rather wait. Also the town I live in is very expensive. It scares me to buy a house here because 1 I won't be able to get what I want &amp; 2 one dip in the market I might not be able to afford it. 
 It will be a burden on the kids to get to school ,sports ,work. I will have 1 year where I will have to somehow get my daughter to school if we move in. 
 
So the big question is do I move? I can save some rent money for a bigger down payment and who knows maybe we would sell her place and buy one together someday.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/pmtv1m/should_i_move_in_with_her_54m_both_of_have_kids/
79,pmtybg,1631457870,How to date better,"TLDR: How can I as a woman who recently turned 40  date better? Do I ask deeper questions sooner like by date 2 just hit all the kids, marriage, life questions? Do I relocate to a place where I know dating will be more fruitful for me? Do I just stop OLDing and do IRL?

As the title says I'm trying to find a way to date better. I can only control my own actions and my own response to guys. There's a lot thats out of my hands.

Yesterday on date #4 with a guy he was acting weird and saying he was so tired. We know how this goes. I asked him if he wanted me to leave so he could sleep. I knew he wasn't interested in me with his behaviour that evening and he should have cancelled in advanceif he wasn't interested. He really wasted my time yesterdaywhen I could have been doing an evening hike instead. Got the text an hour later, no spark, not feeling the chemistry he was hoping for.

Okay cool. But it has left me thinking. Other than focusing on dating only IRL from now on what else can I do.

(I also don't have sex until date 6 to 8 when me and a guy have been std tested. This helps me weed out guys.)

I try to ask questions and vet guys in advance. I'll now be adding in a phone call before even meeting. I ask them what they're looking for but should I ask deeper questions before meeting or on the 2nd or 3rd date? I think I will ask if they want a relationship or if they want kids. But I don't want to put thr cart before the horse with strangers.

I'm not sure why this guy saying there's no spark/chemistry hit different but this time it did. 

I'm 40 and take responsibility for my own actions or inaction while OLDing but I can't shake the fact that OLDing worked better for me in my old province and now in Vancouver BC its been awful.

I'm actually planning to relocate again but I don't want to bring bad dating habits. I'll chat with my counselor about this. We haven't covered the issue of dating yet. 

I'm interested in your guys experience of dating better.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/pmtybg/how_to_date_better/

81,pmwwb8,1631467207,WTF - part 2,"I posted yesterday asking for advice on why I \[M47\] keep having issues meeting a woman in person.  I keep getting ghosted or stuck on pen pal with endless messaging.  I appreciate the feedback that I'm a creep 47 year old man bc of my Reddit comments on posts of 20-something's girls.  I didn't have the post up for very long (maybe an hour or two) bc it seemed most women said the same thing with the comments.  Valid points and I appreciated the feedback.

Which leads me to my next question... and I realize that I'm opening myself to being called every name in the book and I'm okay with that.  I've tried dating women my age (40's) but it seems I keep picking women that never want to meet up.  Yes, everyone has busy lives, especially single moms trying to raise 2-3 kids while trying to balance her career, friends, family, relationship with the ex-husband, and trying to squeeze in time for herself.  So meeting in person is going to take patience and advanced planning.  However, there's a pattern of planning something 1-2 weeks in advance and then having her cancel at the last minute.  This has been happening to me for 1-2 years before the pandemic and has picked right back up again.  It's disappointing and frustrating. And yes, I realize that 99% of the time, the cancellation has absolutely nothing to do with me.  But the pattern over a few years is demoralizing... once that occurs, it's much easier to date a younger woman (20-30's).  But if that makes me a creep, then what am I suppose to do???  Be content being alone???  I'm not perfect.  I'm a real and flawed human being.  I continue to use talk therapy to become more self aware.  

So my question is not what's wrong with me, but rather how do I meet a woman that is age appropriate that actually has time and wants to take a chance to meet in person?  Throw it at me Reddit...",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/pmwwb8/wtf_part_2/
82,pmwyfb,1631467390,Is there a way of getting over this?,"I met a man via OLD but due to schedules, we couldn't meet for a week out. We ended up talking a lot in between that time, something I normally don't do for the standard reasons, and totally hit it off. I'm quite picky and very rarely meet someone that I vibe with so well. Just everything about him is so great. 

In passing during one of our conversations, he mentions how much he weighs and it gave me pause. His pictures show some extra weight, but it looks like the typical covid and mid-life weight gain. I figured he must hide it well or I am out of touch with how much a guy his size actually weighs. In hindsight, I think he was warning me maybe(?). I gained covid weight myself, but I've dropped 15 of the 20 pounds I gained. I get that weight can fluctuate at our age.

Fast forward to our date night. We finally meet and his weight is more than I was expecting. We still had a great conversation though and I'm otherwise attracted to him. I was acting a bit more reserved and not as flirtatious, which he picked up on, but I did not want to lead him on and needed time to process this. I really, really want to be able to overlook this, but I don't know if I can and I'd hate to lead him on further trying to find out. I also worry it comes down to a lifestyle mismatch. I generally eat healthy and exercise regularly. But like I said, I rarely find someone I connect with so well on every other level. 

Has anyone been in this situation before? Is it salvageable? I also don't know what to say to him. There is no kind way of saying something like this to a person. On the other hand, if this is a temporary problem on his end and he is wanting to lose the weight, I'd be on board. However, he hasn't mentioned anything of the such. I'd just hate to throw something away that can be fixed, but I also know I can't enter into a relationship wanting to change someone.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/pmwyfb/is_there_a_way_of_getting_over_this/

I met someone. We immediately hit it off, like crazy omg I need you now fireworks for both of us. Had sex on 2nd date (it was freaking amazing). Met for 3rd date and started to get into it, but then it got real. He got very upset I did not let him finish in my mouth and it went into an explanation of history of feeling rejection and a full stop to any more intimacy.

I said I understand where he's coming from, and I didn't realize he took it that way (he didn't the first time). But today I'm wondering how we got here so quickly and perhaps this ""let's just have fun"" thing is going to be more than I can handle right now. I wasn't expecting to trigger rejection (I guess you never are).

I like him. We talk well and physically connect, but he's really still a stranger. I can see this going somewhere, and I don't regret hooking up immediately at all. I wanted to. I'm just wondering how much I can really handle. I need light and easy right now.

What I've taken from most last two postings is I'm just an awful human being that is a creep who doesn't know what he's want.  And definitely isn't serious about dating.  I'm immature, impatient, and prey on young women.  And based upon my comment history, and ONLY based on my comment history, I can see how many of you have come to that assessment.  My assessment of myself... I act in desperation when extremely lonely.  That desperation and being impulsive are two red flags.

As a human being, I need connections with other human.  For many different reasons, I've isolated myself after a bad break-up devastated me.  I found out at the end that she cheated the entire 5-year relationship.  I was in therapy in my 30's unpacking and trying to heal from childhood neglect and abandonment issues (which many people have).  Although finding out she cheated the entire relationship, triggered my childhood issues and simply broke me.  I just broke.  And although, unhealthy, I completed isolated myself from everyone (including family and friends).

So yes, I'm struggling to find my place in the dating world.  And maybe some of you are right, I'm not suitable to date  I need to work more on myself and not on dating.

Yes, I know that‚Äôs an extremely short period of time, but Jack has already indicated that he‚Äôs ready to be exclusive with me. In this case, exclusive would mean not dating or sleeping with anyone else, deactivating our dating apps, and not searching for other potential partners.

Here‚Äôs a whole bunch of background info that you might find relevant. We have not had sex yet. I am having sex with another guy I‚Äôve been casually dating (non-exclusively) for a month but I am willing to not have sex again with that other guy until Jack and I come to a decision about exclusivity (I do not like being sexually active with more than one man at a time). Jack is not seeing anyone else right now. He is divorced (2 years ago) and has 2 young kids in a 50/50 custody arrangement, and he describes his relationship with his ex as amicable. He has been through two rebound relationships since the divorce, the last one of which ended about 8 months ago. He has been going to therapy since the last rebound ended and says it has helped tremendously and that he now knows what he wants in a long term partner.

We have a tremendous amount of chemistry: sexual, emotional and mental. However, it‚Äôs only been 9 days and I‚Äôm still worried about lovebombing. I brought this up with him, and he says our connection doesn‚Äôt feel like lovebombing or trauma bonding to him, but I‚Äôm not so sure. Obviously, the best strategy would be to wait a while to see how things develop, but there‚Äôs one slight complication in this case: I‚Äôll be leaving town in less than 2 weeks on a business trip that will last two months. Neither of us wants to leave the other hanging when that happens, so I‚Äôm feeling that we should make a decision before then.  He really wants to declare things exclusive right now, but I would rather wait the two weeks. Then again, 3 weeks isn‚Äôt such a long time either so maybe the extra two weeks isn‚Äôt such a big deal? And if something comes up over those next two weeks we could always simply call it off.

Sorry this is long and rambling, I guess I‚Äôm just looking for advice and insight into how I should continue this conversation with Jack. I haven‚Äôt been at the point where I wanted to be exclusive with someone for several years, and I was a different person then so that experience doesn‚Äôt seem like such a great guide here.

I had an ex who dumped me and it made me feel like dirt. So I decided to improve myself. I got in shape physically, changed my look, quit bad habits, changed my outlook on life. 

I also knew my self worth and knew there was plenty of other wonderful women to love,. 

A few months later, my ex saw all the attractive women who wanted to be with me, that drove her mad with jealousy. She dumped her boyfriend twice to be with me, but I turned her down. Did I enjoy it? Yes.

However my goal was not to make her regret dumping me, my goal was to meet someone better.

I had another wonderful girl who put an end to our relationship because she was coming out of a separation. 

I practiced the rule of no contact, not to get her back but to move on. It is surprising when somebody knows you are happy without them, they want you back because they are scared to lose you.
Though I do not encourage you to do this for the sake of making her regret dumping you, I encourage you to do the following things for your own good:

1 Cut contact for good, do not stalk her Facebook profile, pretend she no longer exists.
2 Get yourself in shape, not just for the sake of looking good. But feeling good as well
3 Read as many books that will make you a better person and give you a better outlook on life.
4 Have goals in life, short term and long term , daily goals, weekly goals, monthly goals and yearly goals as well.
5 Instead of brooding about your ex dumping you, look at the advantages of her no longer being in your life and the freedom you gain.
6 Practice a hobby that gives you joy and makes you feel great.
7 Have an abundance mentality. There are millions wonderful women to love and many will be probably better than your ex. Probably, more like definitely
8 Do all these 7 things not to make your ex girlfriend regret dumping you but instead of you not regretting she dumping you . You become the best version of yourself not for the sake of getting someone else's attention, but for yourself. However she might regret dumping you, but it won't matter to you anymore

Why would you want to get an ex back , the same things that turned you off will still be there , pissed , head scratching , burping , put weight on , teeth , drinking , didn‚Äôt go halves , Leighton , freeloader
