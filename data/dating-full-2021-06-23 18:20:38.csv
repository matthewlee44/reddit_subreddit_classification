I had asked him to leave it somewhere or meet me somewhere or drop it off so I could get it. He ghosted me again and I wanted to be done with him. I went to his house to get it and saw him driving away as I was driving towards his home. I was hoping not to deal with him and just ask him family for it. I don’t know his family like that but I know he dad. I really didn’t want to show up unannounced but I had been asking nicely and wanted it to be over. He started calling me crazy for showing and up blew my phone up yelling at me. Unfortunately I lost my temper and yelled back and then as embarrassed that I stooped to his level and left after his whole neighborhood heard me yelling. My friend took my phone and ensured that he would drop off my belongings. He continued to text me thatvi was crazy for showing up and I kept asking him for another way that I could have gone about it and he had no answer bc he himself said that he was ignoring me and being a coward. I asked home to drop it off at 7 and he came at 4 when he know I have class first thing in the morning and started yelling at me again and I lost my temper again. I told him I would be blocking him and he said he doesn’t feel the need t block me. I feel good that I got everything off my chest and told him off but. Idk I don’t think I should have picked up the phone when he called and should have just gone to speak with his family even is he didn’t want me to. I feel ashamed that I was provoked and responded in such a volitile way but I have never been disrespected like this or have ever had to yell at an ex like this. I want to apologize to his family but we are over and I told him now this is even more reason for him to never reach out to me again. I’m still confused and disappointed in the way both of us handled the situation. The last time we hung out we had so much fun and then he kept canceleing and then just ghosted me. I don’t eat why he said he doesn’t feel like he need to block me . If I really thought someone was crazy I would block him which I did and he called  me from a no caller ID number.

Things seemed great, she hinted for me to ask her out a couple of times, and we made plans to see each other. Unfortunately, things went downhill from there.

&amp;#x200B;

At one point, we started talking about movies, and she asked me about my favorite movie genres. After telling her that I liked comedies and asking her about her favorite genres, she ghosted me.

I gave her the benefit of the doubt and messaged her roughly two weeks later, saying something about how covid potentially affected our plans and that we could still walk in a park if she's interested or that we could wait until it was safe to meet up.

She then gave me a big apology for accidentally ghosting me, answered my last question, and said that she would definitely like to meet up and walk in a park or some other activity. After that, we started talking again, and we chatted about what we've been doing lately. That's when I told her about how I've been getting into chess. She started acting a bit weird and soon ghosted me again.

&amp;#x200B;

I decided to leave her alone, and we haven't talked since then. It's now been a few months since I last heard from her. Although, I did catch her looking at my LinkedIn profile a couple of weeks ago.

What's even weirder is that while we were messaging each other (including her also ghosting me), she kept posting Facebook stories. And after she ghosted me the second time, she posted one more story. I didn't look at the last one because I was bummed out at the time; however, what's strange is that, to this day, she hasn't posted anything else (that I'm aware of).

Honestly speaking, I find it a bit suspicious that she ghosted me at the exact times she found out I had different interests from her. That being that she likes thrillers more than comedies and that she's not really into chess.

&amp;#x200B;

That said, the main reason I'm posting this is that I feel a bit confused about why she's been looking at my LinkedIn and why she stopped posting Facebook stories at the exact same time I stopped looking at them. I know it probably means nothing at the end of the day, but some insight might be intriguing.

Other than that, I think the biggest lesson to learn from this experience is to not put too many expectations when it comes to asking people out. The person you like is human, and they'll have flaws that they may or may not want to address. Time spent waiting to build up the courage to ask them out or waiting for them to improve on their flaws is time that could be spent on people that actually care about you.

That’s my main fear too. I think being in a relationship is something EVERYONE should experience at least once. I think nobody can say “relationships are not worth it” to a single guy/girl… simply because the person itself has got to find it out on its own. It’s plenty of insecure people that live in very happy relationships nowadays… the “love yourself” way doesn’t work that well.

I think being single and not wanting it is the worst feeling on earth. I personally feel like trash, like a waste… seeing all other guys dating and having happy relationships with girls. It’s painful.

2 weeks ago i met a girl really randomly. She was with a classmate of mine, so it was easier for me to get to know her. We could only see each others with masks, but she followed me on instagram later ( i have no photos there ). In the next days, we chatted a bit, i asked her out and she accepted. 

We had a very nice evening. We went to a restaurant, had dinner, drank something, and then i brought her back home. Everything was great, we even planned for another date. She then ghosted me and blocked me, but everything was alright during the date, and we laughed a lot.

I’m now in a depressive state. I’ve NEVER been good at socializing and getting to know new people. I wanted to commit suicide cause i never had a relationship and now that i had a good chance, she didn’t like me back. I don’t know how to go on, also because i don’t know how to meet new girls/people ( meetup is full of people in their 40s and nothing else is available cause dating apps are full of superficial people)

I was discarded by a man I was dating for 2 years pretty abruptly.

He literally changed overnight and what he told me about why he wanted to end things , to ME makes no sense.

Things were great, we had a few minor hiccups, things that were quickly smoothed over.

Great communication, chemistry, compatibility (or so I thought), humor, the major things, ect. 

This makes me think he'd alraady been wanting to end it and finally got the courage to do so.

I understand, that happens sometimes.

The thing I'm having a hard time getting over is why.

He told me he's not ready for a relationship or to stop being selfish.

He wants to do what he wants to do without having to answer to anyone. ⬅ I never yelled at him, cursed at him, demanded to know why this and that. I allowed him the freedom to be himself, while still communicating my boundaries. 

He said he told me he prayed for me and I showed up, and he doesn't know how to handle it because he's never experienced a person like me.

He told me our sex gets better and better every time, and it's intense and intimate.


He told me he thinks I'm amazing and I'm a huge blessing to him. 

He told me he wants to tell me he loves me, but he stops himself.


To me, it seems if he felt these things, he'd want them?

Of course these things baffle me, because it seems if I were these things, he'd want it?

He does fit the description of being having an avoidant attachment nearly to a T. 

I'm not going to beg him to be with me. 

We had a calm conversation about it ending and I still can't wrap my mind around it. 

It's been a month. 

I just really feel hurt and alone right now. 

I would appreciate anyone who has something kind to say to me.

I've been using online dating on and off ever since I was in college, whether it be Tinder, Bumble, OKCupid or Hinge. To say that I've been pretty unsuccessful is an understatement even though I met my ex girlfriend (who is also African American) via Bumble. I seldom get likes and matches. I usually get ghosted whenever I do get a match despite me trying to not creep anyone out. The icing on the cake is that I've been self conscious about my looks since high school and I've been trying to improve them (ex: working out, hygiene, choice of clothing, etc). Older women such as my female relatives think I'm handsome, but I feel as if women my age don't. 

It's gotten to the point where I just wanna focus on myself. So far, I've been trying my best to do so. However, I'm kinda worried about being single forever even though I wanna start a family in the future. My self esteem has been pretty shaky for the past number of years and reading/listening to Reddit stories about how women are reluctant to men they don't know approaching them combined with my self consciousness about my looks were the nails on the coffin. I'm pretty introverted and shy as well. I've been mulling over just ditching online dating, and dating, as a whole. What do you guys think? Do POCs, regardless of gender, actually have it rough on the OLD scene?

I'm 30F who has recently started being more active on Tinder. Basically, I have no clue how to date and I'm absolutely terrified.

I'm not the kind of person who makes friends easily. I'm never the prettiest girl in the room and I'm socially awkward. I've never really stressed about dating or sex and I've gone years without as much as a kiss. Every guy I have been involved with (romantically or sexually) has already been a friend of mine and I have never gone on a date where I did not already know the person. It has been nine years since I was even in a relationship, though I have had a few flings. (I also definitely have self-esteem issues as well as a history of lying/manipulative partners but that's another story.)

Recently, I've become much more aware of the fact that time is passing and my life is very solitary. I've tried to step out of my comfort zone and start living my life instead of hiding away. It's very difficult to come across people I want to match with because I'm first and foremost attracted to people based on their vibe which doesn't really transfer through Tinder; looks and likes have nothing on it. I have even harder time chatting with the ones I match with. Usually I just end up ignoring their opening lines for days or forever out of anxiety. It doesn't help that I'm from a different country and the locals just have a very different way of chatting than I do. (Small talk is not a thing where I'm from so I'm terrible at it.) Recently, there have been a few guys I have been replying to and I feel so out of my depth. One of them has suggested meeting up, but he is so out of my league that I feel like a catfish or that he will stand me up if I do agree to meet him.

All of this just makes me so anxious. I'm afraid it goes badly. I'm terrified it goes well. I never thought I would be this frightened and I'm finding myself reverting back to not replying, which is just self-sabotage.

We would always talk and text but about 1 year in I started to just not text as much because I didn't feel like there was anything to talk about beside me sending memes to joke and start a conversation. When I tried to start conversations I got dry responses so we just texted less but we did spend time together still. About 5 months into the first year I told her seeing each other everyday wasn't good for the relationship ship so I told her that I'll go to her house every other day when we're not busy and we both agreed. I'm generally a quiet person in public and home and I like the quietness and just being with her was more than enough for me. We didn't go out a lot since I dont drive but we did go out once in a while with friends to the arcades, mall and trips with hers and my family. I'm a avid gamer and so I would sometimes forget to respond immediately to her texts, and when she needs help with school work I would tell her I'll help if I can but if I don't know about the subject then I can't. And sometimes I don't want to help her because I tell her to ask friends for help and I have given her so many resources for help such as school tutor sessions I attend and online help from college students yet she never utilized them.
 Come around our 2nd year we barely text anymore because she runs a small nail business and im starting to work but I would still see her on my off days but after when I got into a argument with my dad I spent about 4 days at her house and after that she just became super needy would always want me to go over but I would tell her I can't because no one would be home to watch me elementary school little brother and my grandma who doesn't understand English. Then one night when I was feeling down I decided to go sleep over and she had to do a drop off for a client and I told her that is she went im just gonna head home because I wanted to be with her. So she didn't do the drop off that night but she kept complaining about stuff in the past and it was starting to irritate me and I told her to shut it and be glad that I was there and if she kept complaining im gonna leave. She then proceeds to say if I was gonna be like that then just leave and so I left and ever since that we took a break for about 2 weeks then got back together. But ever since we got back she's been acting cold and giving me dry texts when I'm actively texting her ""oh ok""  to jokes unless its something pertaining to me getting her something she needs or don't need. Everytime I would text it feels likes she's annoyed at me and I understand how she feels because I wasn't the best bf in the past but im actively trying to be better for her and us but im having trouble right now if she's not even acknowledging the fact that im trying to be better.

I haven't seriously dated in a couple of years, so I dealt with a man just because. I've known from the beginning that we could never be in a serious relationship, just based off of how I allowed him to continuously disrespect me. Did it matter in the end? No. Was I a fool? Sure. He was a secret. No one in my life knew of his existence. Only me. Not one thing I allowed him to do was shared with anyone. I just wanted to see how far it would go. How many signs regarding his respect for me, and my respect for myself did I need for me to walk away from it all?

YEAR 1:
- Had sex on the first night. No date. No sweet nothings. No condom. He's an old friend it's cool. He wouldn't hurt me, he said so himself. I just laid there and allowed him have sex with me. 20 minutes.
- We wouldn't talk unless I called first. Then attempted to keep me on the phone for hours talking about his childhood tramas and things that happened to him until we reached current time. I would sit and listen, but as soon as I was ready to share something, the interest was not reciprocated.
- I would ask him out. He would be hesitant, then agree. Sometimes he would pay, but most of the time I was showing him how I would like to be treated when I would pay.
- His birthday came. I chose to spend over $200.00 for his gifts.
- I planned our date to the movies, paid, he showed up late, in sweatpants. I stayed and waited, then had sex with him in my car. I didn't want to have sex that night. He was musty that night. I didn't address it. No condom. I allowed him to have sex with me the way he wanted I said nothing.
- We saw each other around 7 times total this year.
I thought about leaving him alone, but I didn't care. I was aware of everything, and continued.

YEAR 2:
- My birthday came. He offer to get me a gift. I accepted and told him what I wanted. Never received  it. I told him to never offer anything if he would not follow though (big mistake).
- We conversed on the phone for months without seeing one another. Our first date this year was in July. I hadn't seen him since we went on a lunch date in December. He expressed that he wanted to try dating me seriously. The ""I have a lot going on"" speech. Which I continuously rolled my eyes as it was told. I went on the date. We enjoyed each other's company. On the ride home, he looked at me with lust on his eyes. I was turned off. Told him I was on my cycle and went in my home alone. I did not see him for the remainder of the year, but I continued to call him just to talk.

YEAR 3:
-Continued to speak on the phone periodically. I was calling first. We haven't seen each other since last July. It's June. I initiated a date to get together and have sex. At first, he thought I wanted to go out on a date. He was hesitant. When he realized I ment for sex, he was all for it. I planned the entire thing myself. I had great sex. For me. No holding back. He was surprised as 90% of the acts I've never done before with him. 

What did this do? Benefit him. He never cared. I was aware of all of the signs and consequences behind them. I didn't care about myself and allowed all of this go on just to have any type of connection because I wasn't dating seriously or respecting myself. I think I have emotions behind this, but my body won't allow me to show it. Did I occupy my time? Or just traumatized myself until I was ready for someone I actually wanted to date?

I’m trying to not read into the situation but obviously I am, and would like to get some other perspectives on what happened.

The date lasted almost 3 hours, involving a walk and then he extended the date to get drinks and food. I thought it was overall going well or at least a lot better than expected considering I was dragging my feet going there and almost bailed last min.

There was good conversation, shared interests, laughs, etc. I was pretty iffy about him until I had more drinks in my system but then I started having a good time and I thought he did too. He shared some stories about bad dates he’d been on and then wanted to clarify that I thought this was going well, and another time wanted to clarify that I was having fun. He offered to pay at the end too.

Anyway he texted me a few hours after saying something like “I think you’ll agree but we didn’t vibe! It was nice to meet you etc.” This kinda threw me for a loop because I thought it started going well and I was almost 100% sure he’d ask for a second date. I’m kinda put off if it was something I did? Honestly to me, all seemed well until I didn’t want him to pay for the date and split the bill - then his body language got really standoffish. Maybe I totally misread the whole thing too as i was getting a bit tipsy. I’m also trying to think if I said anything very red flag like. I do have an offbeat sense of humour and did bring up my ex once which got awkward. I also have ADHD which I didn’t tell him, which makes focusing on conversations hard - so I was definitely glancing around a bit (no phone though), which might have come off as disinterested.

He’d also said that he had some self doubt about dating etc. so I honestly thought that maybe he thought i for sure wouldn’t want to see him again so he rejected me before I could reject him haha. Is that even something guys do? It sort of seemed like me not wanting him to pay was a big deal, cause his whole demeanour changed - as if me splitting meant I didn’t want to see him again? Or was it more likely something I did? Or I totally misread the situation (I’m usually really good with this stuff though)?

I was kinda iffy about it at first since I knew he was a lot younger than me (in my mind, at least), and I generally have been interested in guys closer to my age and older. My general limit for younger guys is 4 years (and that's even pushing it a bit - 2 years younger is comfort lvl). 

So, for some reason, I thought this guy was 5 years younger than me. Since we had mutual interest, our interactions were nice, and because I caught myself subconsciously looking for him at work, I decided 5 years wasn't too bad. We could at least get to know each other and see what happens. So, I finally asked him out instead of waiting, and he agreed. 

During this first date, I discovered that he - in fact - is not 5 years younger than me. Ladies... Guys.... He's 8 years younger. He's 19.

We seem to be similar, have a lot in common, and I'm already comfortable around him even during ""awkward"" silences... I want to get to know him, yeah, but the age thing is making me a bit anxious and insecure (I do have diagnosed anxiety, so maybe this isn't really something I should worry about?? I don't know). And we've just started to get to know each other, so idk if we'll lose interest, be friends, or eventually be a couple. I'm just anxious, not sure how to respond to the age thing (so I'm not currently responding to it), and I don't have too much experience with relationships either. A little, but not very much. I also get confused thinking about how I'd be totally fine dating a guy 8 years older than me, and if this situation is the same or different. 

I am going to continue to get to know him, but I really would like some advice and/or second opinions on the situation. And, yes, he already knew how old I am and was planning on eventually asking me out. I guess I'm just anxious. Anything you all have to say is welcome; positive or negative or anything in between.

That means that I have spent seven years of my life wanting something that has never happened for me.

At this point I feel like I am doing something wrong. Not to toot my own horn or anything, but I have several things going for me that I feel would help me with women. I am over 6ft tall, I have a deep voice, and a beard.

I honestly feel like I should be physically attractive to women. I have received some female attention in the past, and even experienced a gay guy being attracted to me. I have gotten compliments on my hair from different people lately. So I feel like I am not ugly at least.

Still, looks can only help you so much I think. I struggle with social anxiety, and I think I tend to make things awkward with people.

This has been my strategy to get a girlfriend (please don't laugh, I know it will sound dumb but hear me out). It might be the bare minimum, but what I have tried to do lately is be out and about where women are. At the moment, my only social outlet is going to the gym and walking around the mall next to the gym a few times after I get done.

There is no shortage of attractive women around my age in these places. Every time I go out I see women that I am physically attracted to. 

The only thing I can do is make eye contact with these women when I pass them... That's it. I cannot go any further than that. I try to get a read on their body language when I lock eyes and it seems to always feel cold. Every now and then I will see a girl out and about that will have warm, receptive body language towards me, but that doesn't happen with any regularity. I feel there’s no way I could approach a woman whose body language feels distant.

It just doesn't feel natural to me. I feel like a creep for even looking at a woman. I feel like they can sense that I am sexually attracted to them, and that that creeps them out. 

Even though it makes me feel like I’m being creepy, I am not a creepy guy. I would never be gross towards a woman, make catcalls, etc.

At the moment, I don't have the balls to do anything more than making eye contact. Even cracking a smile feels icky to me. I certainly cannot say hello.

Do most guys who have girlfriends make the first move, or is it the girl? How do most people I see get girlfriends with relative ease while I struggle so bad? I knew a guy who had several girls messaging him after he broke up with his girlfriend. Not having a girlfriend feels hellish at this point. I am afraid more and more years will pass and I’ll still be daydreaming while growing older.

Can I get some feedback on a flirting/dating situation via PM? I would love some perspectives. It’s just a weird thing that recently happened to me and I feel a little confused about it to be honest 🥲

Things had been going really well, but we had a big argument a few weeks ago, and things have been a bit rocky since. We both said some hurtful things to one another during our fight. We forgave each other afterwards, but I'm not sure that she actually forgave me because it feels like the argument sent our relationship into a bit of a dark age and we're both reeling from it. After reflecting, I've realized that I've been really struggling with anxiety and depression recently. I told her about it, and we've been trying to work through it. 

She has been acting increasingly cold/distant recently, and last weekend she told me that she feels like we don't have as much physical chemistry as we used to. She told me that she needed some space to think about our relationship, so I gave her space. Yesterday, she asked me to meet her after she finishes work this weekend. We never meet directly after work, its always for dinner or some other time in the evening. I feel like she has decided that she doesn't see a future between the two of us. 

I completely disagree with her. I've never been so interested in a woman in my entire life. I really want this relationship to work, and I feel it could. So if she tells me that she doesn't want to be with me, what should I do to get her back? I know that all relationships are different, I'm just wondering if anyone else has had an experience like this and I would love to hear how your story went (good or bad).
