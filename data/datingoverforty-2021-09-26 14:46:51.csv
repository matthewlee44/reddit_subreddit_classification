1,pw1jks,1632687697,"Found GF, boundaries with other females? Should I help a platonic female friend with suicidal daughter?","46/m
From OLD, found a great gf 3 months ago.
Have a (platonic) female friend- who I also met from OLD- who admires me, but insists she wants to only be friends.

Without meaning to sound arrogant, I have shied away from staying friends with other women who previously said they could be platonic, as some became emotionally caught up with me despite me communicating my boundaries. (Please, no negative comments- this is not the point of my post)

This female friend has a 13 yo daughter who felt comfortable with me on a couple outings.

I have offered to have a family day (board games) and connect with her family again (mom and 3 daughters, heavy duty mechanic ex hubby with less than avg EQ), play basketball, make myself available as a mature male.

I will be nothing but professional- having this trust is a huge honour and privilege.

I like to help people, but how would my gf feel? Should she respect or be ok with my desire to help, despite it being a platonic female friend from OLD's daughter?
*I intend to have a discussion with my gf, but would like to hear what ladies, and others with similar experience advise?*

I am not a counsellor, but I am a (good) communicator and it seems that trust and communication can help many or most challenges.

I am looking for friends 
Internet or Real Life 
44m Never married, No kids
And no friends at the moment. 
A few have died; more have drifted away. Life happens. I should make more efforts both in meeting new people and catching up with the old. 
I imagine this is fairly common.
I'm clever, fit, creative, extremely easy going and open minded. 
I moved to a beautiful new area, but I'm having trouble connecting with people here. Ever since I stopped drinking, my ability to socialize has regressed. Social anxiety and acute panic attacks are frequent. Don't feel right at bars. 
Every human interaction I have is awkward. I feel out of place, like I don't really belong anywhere. 
And so I've become a little bit introverted. I talk myself out of going out in public because I feel very weird going places by myself.
I'm pretty good at entertaining myself. I smoke weed like it's an Olympic sport that I'm training for.. 
I work out, do yoga, spin records, make intricate beats, and create delicious thc desert recipes. I collect crystals, adidas, and rare vinyl. I'm heavy into psychology, neurology, and philosophy. 
I've been getting into digital art and video.

I have been single now for *gasp* almost a year (I say gasp because time has FLOWN) and during that time I have been on 4 first dates, only one of which was with a really nice guy (but no sparks.)

This weekend I went on a date with guy I have been chatting with a while. I am pretty cautious about meeting up due to covid, I‚Äôd probably say more so than most other folks. It takes a little patience but I will eventually meet up and/or chat on the phone. I also *thought* it helped me weed out any potential creepers. Guess I was wrong! 

After about a month of chatting and texting with a guy, we decided to meet up this past weekend. In the beginning, the conversation was good and we were laughing and having a good time. I started to really enjoy myself when things took a really odd turn. He asked if I‚Äôd like to see a video of his daughter playing the piano as she is a small kid and apparently he believes her to be quite talented. Sure, I say. He then proceeds to unlock his phone and press the photos icon only to reveal about 30 or so pictures of genitals (lots of flesh and vaginas) on his phone. He immediately became flustered and was trying to swipe out of the imagines only to make it worse as I was able to see the amount of pics that were housed in his little hub of hand held technology. I mean come the fuck on! üòíüòíüòí

I get that some men need to rub one out prior to a date but really???? He looks fondly at these on his phone RIGHT before meeting up w a girl he‚Äôs never seen? I was so grossed out and immediately regretted the date. He then proceeded to eventually find the video of his daughter, shoved the video in my face and kept asking me for confirmation that in fact he had a child prodigy. Obviously that was NOT what I was focused on. We finished the walk, I came home deflated and feeling bummed. 

Before you ask, yes he apologized and I understand people have pasts, it‚Äôs just not something I care to see during a FIRST DATE. He actually unmatched me so thankfully i didnt to even have to decline any further contact.

We have been seeing each other 3-4 times a week and for the past couple weeks we essentially had ""standing dates"" based on his off-custody days. Everything has been flowing so well and just plain effortlessly. We enjoy each other's company, have a similar sense of humor, a broad range of activities and things we both enjoy, we share a lot of similar values, and have great chemistry (the kissing is downright addictive and the sex keeps getting better and better the more we learn each other's bodies). 

Last week I started thinking I should bring up the idea of getting off the apps - I mean I know he is not seeing anyone else because frankly, unless he can be in two places at once, he has no time to entertain other ladies. Being child free, I would have the time but haven't had the inclination of swiping (let alone texting or setting up dates) for weeks. Low and behold on Saturday night, as we are sitting drinking a beer in front of the fire in his backyard, he asks me to be his girlfriend! I immediately say yes of course lol.

Then on Sunday he throws me a real curveball - would I want to meet his kids? The blood must have drained from my face because he tells me he didn't mean right away; maybe over the course of the next month or so? And sure, I tell him, of course I would love to meet his kids, but yeah a few more weeks might be good. 

I must confess the prospect kind of terrifies me. And I am good with kids! I like kids, I'm an awesome aunt, and have been a scout leader for many years. But it hit like a train just how much I want these two kids to like me. So now I'm scavenging the interwebs for any and all advice on ""meeting the kids"" I can find. I will be introduced as ""dad's friend"" but kids are not dumb and their mom has already remarried. After this lady comes around a couple times, they are gonna know what's up!

So if anyone here has any advice to give that would be awesome! In particular, I'm looking for ideas of activities we could go do - I really don't want to just go over for dinner, because then all the focus will be on this new random person who just showed up for dinner lol. No, I think an activity would be best so they can be entertained. But also something that would allow for some time for me to interact with them? Man, I don't know!

Have you been introduced to your significant other's kids (or have you introduced your kids to them)? How did you navigate that? What activity did you do? They are 6 and 8 btw.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/pwsnuz/i_was_not_expecting_this_so_soon/

I know it‚Äôs going to vary based on every situation but curious what the general consensus here is. Is this typical FWB behavior or more so behavior for early dating?",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/px82np/fwb_and_affection/

I dated a great guy for 4 months (I was divorced for 8 years). I'm not gonna bore you because he's fucking amazing. My problem was not knowing how to overcome the barrier of trusting me not to get hurt. (Yes, we are exclusive and have clear communication within 1 month). How do I make myself vulnerable without over-analyzing what he's doing relative to how he feels about me? I just saw the White lotus flower (great show!) And Jennifer Coolidge said she wanted to get down to business to speed up all the layers of coy games and show the ""onion core of her"" scenes early on to see if they ""I still like her.. B: I see. I don't play games, but I'm involved with emotions that just want to know; Don't waste time and invest too much and then get deeply hurt after going deep. I showed him how vulnerable I was, and it was scary. How do you both go through the early stages of the relationship and you want to avoid getting hurt?

TL;DR: fell for a guy I met online right away. Neither one of us was ready but it was a rare, amazing connection. I broke it off, took it back, then he broke it off and now I'm heartbroken.

So I updated on the original post, because inept. But here it is. Please be gentle. 

Update: I changed my mind and decided to try to be patient, after reading some of the comments. Was afraid that I wouldn't find another connection like that. I have only felt that kind of connection once, with someone I dated for 5+ years, and it took me a decade to get over that person. 

After I took it back, he agreed we should date and try to take it slowly. We had a great date last Friday and I asked for more time a couple days after that, and he broke it off, saying that it had been great but his feeling of ""hot and cold"" made him realize he wasn't ready. Probably I just pushed too much, and too much happened between us for that short of a time dating.

I'm really sad (I feel heartbroken), but I understand. I need to take some ""me time,"" clearly. There are some deep seated issues this brought up for me that I'm not addressing with a professional. The thing I can't get past is the connection. Friends tell me I'll find another person I connect with as much when it's right, but I feel like they're just telling me that to make me feel better. All the horror stories about online dating or dating when you're older/divorced say the opposite, and I'm afraid I'll never find something like this again.

We spend the majority of our nights together and get along well. Enthusiastically introduces me to everyone as his GF.  He lives in a very nice house ‚Äî where we spend a lot of time because our social activities are mostly in his community (nearly an hour from my house) and so I stay with him a lot.  He uses lots of we / us language in referring to his house (telling friends ‚Äúwe‚Äù are redoing his back patio, ‚Äúwe‚Äù are throwing a party, etc.).  I own my own home (brand new),  and there‚Äôs been no talk of moving in together (way too early for that).  

So what‚Äôs the problem?  Well maybe minor but it still dings me‚Ä¶
Although he has a great house, he plans to sell it in the next few years and build his ‚Äúretirement house.‚Äù   He brings this up often ‚Äî to me (‚ÄúI need to add that idea to my retirement house list‚Äù) or to friends in front of me (where he plans to live, what kind of house, etc). But he doesn‚Äôt do this in an inclusive way (‚ÄúWhat do you think of that idea?‚Äù).  So I usually say little; if it sounds like a good idea, I will volunteer that feeling.   But otherwise I mostly smile and nod.  

Of course it‚Äôs waaaayyyy too early to talk about building a house together.   We don‚Äôt live together now and haven‚Äôt even said ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù (well he did a month ago but was pretty drunk at the time so I let it pass by).  It still just feels a little dismissive to talk so often in front of me about definite plans that don‚Äôt seem to leave room for partner input IF / when that would be appropriate.   

So for now I say nothing bc it isn‚Äôt my business yet.  But I cringe every time and it pushes me away a little because it feels like he‚Äôs planning a future without me and I don‚Äôt want to get too attached.  On the other hand, he treats me in the present like I‚Äôm at the center of his world.  

Should I just tell him I feel awkward and why?   I don‚Äôt want the message to be that he should include me now in his future plans, but I haven‚Äôt figured out how to raise this without it sounding like that.  This comes up 2-3 times per week so it‚Äôs not rare.  

TL/DR:  BF of 3 months talks often about future retirement plans and making decisions without any partner input, and I feel awkward, even though it‚Äôs way too soon for us to make future plans together.

98,pzls9f,1633138553,How OLD has helped me,"Sorry so long. 
OLD has helped me figure out what I want and do not want in a LTR. I have been married twice. My first marriage was at 19 and lasted 12 years. I didn't have any established boundaries to weed someone outout. I met him. We both liked sex. We fell in love, and figured we would figure out the rest as we went. Well obviously since it ended in divorce there were lots of incompatibilities. Second marriage  I looked for same interests. I forgot to check his closet though, and 4 years later he told me he had been hiding in it. So, that ended in divorce. 
I have been doing OLD for about 5 months now and have gone on 7 first dates. 3 turned into second dates. 1 turned into 4, no longer seeing eachother. The other 1 we have plans for a third date. 
How OLD has helped me? 
I learned to look at the actions of a guy not his words. Lovebombing it's real, lol. 
I learned that if I vibed well enough to go on a date with someone and then they show up not being what they were representing. I don't get upset. They could be my next friend. 
I learned I have boundaries. I can't stand smoking. I don't date smokers. I can weed those individuals out immediately.  I have other boundaries but I'm not going to go into all those, lol.
So I just wanted to say that even though OLD can suck, and instead of looking at all the negatives we should acknowledge some of its positives.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/pzls9f/how_old_has_helped_me/
