0,pq4ac2,1631898539,Is it ever better to ghost?,"A couple of days ago I (32M) had a really great date with a women (28F) I just can't see myself with longer term. As good as that first date was, I know that this person is not really what i am looking for in a partner.

She messaged me immediately after the date saying what a good time she had and I echoed that sentiment back (it was a fun night). Now she is asking about my plans for the weekend and as I see it I have 3 options.

1. Ghost and just not respond
2. Respond, but don't follow up with my own questions and hope the conversation dies out
3. Tell her that it was a wonderful night, but that I don't think we are good match long term

7,pq50dh,1631900816,"Is he (M30) actually busy, or is he ghosting me (F28)?","I met this guy online about a month ago. We texted pretty consistently daily (always initiated by him). There were times where I wouldn't respond and he would message me again, and one time he even said ""you don't talk much"". After that I assumed he wanted to keep in regular communication.

We've hung out twice since, and both went well. We mutually agreed we want a casual thing. For both hang outs (and in between) he has been so persistent on wanting to get together and wanting me to sleep over, etc. I have always said no to sleep overs for convenience reasons.

He told me after our last hang out (which was Sept 3rd) that he is busy for the next 2 weeks for work and will be traveling. He said he is not free until week of Sept 20 to hangout - which is no problem. 

However, I didn't think this meant that our texting communication would change drastically. He started responding a lot later than normal, and very dry conversation. It started making me wonder if he was losing interest, so to test it out I messaged him this past Monday asking how his trip is, and then I didn't hear from him all day so later that evening I said ""so remind me when you are back again? I'd love to plan a hangout when you are back!"" and he did not reply as of today (so it's been 5 days). 

I don't know how to take his silence, I'm wondering if he is going to reply at this point? I know he already said he was busy with work but who is really THAT busy to not take 30 seconds to respond? Especially after expressing so much interest in me. I don't need constant texting, in fact, I don't even like texting but I was following his lead from before. Plus, I asked specifically abut hanging out, not about something random/boring like the weather.

I am trying to keep my cool and I have not messaged him again since I already double texted. But I am so confused! Could he genuinely be busy? or is this an obvious hint?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pq50dh/is_he_m30_actually_busy_or_is_he_ghosting_me_f28/

9,pq52vo,1631901042,Am I really asking too much?,"I think I know the answer, but just for confirmation on what I already know to be true.

I am a single woman who recently moved to a huge city by herself. Never really lived alone, and I don't have any family or friends here. I jumped on a dating app a couple of weeks before arriving in order to meet people and get a sense of comfort with someone before moving.

I've met a few guys, but nothing has come of it. My mom found out I was on the app, and warned me that I need to be extra careful dating in a city I did not know. I already kind of knew that, but had not really thought of it until she mentioned it.

So I made a guideline for myself. Make sure to meet up with a guy in-person during the day in public at least once before hooking up, going out at night with them, or even thinking about going to their place. Just because I tend to have good senses about people after meeting them and talking a little, and if it's in public, if I need to skedaddle, I can lol.

This seems to be an issue for some guys and I am like...wtf? Why? Like, I've had a guy invite me to his place. When I asked if he was looking for a hook-up, he said he just wanted to hang and be ""friends"" before doing anything intimate, but when I mentioned meeting in public first, he unmatched me the next morning.

Another guy, pretty much asked me to let him know when I got in town because he wanted to be the first one to show me around, and he randomly messaged me to go out at night on a weekday during my first week of work. I explained to him I was tired from getting settled in, but I was open to meet in public during the weekend. I thought he understood, but then when I texted him to set something up for Saturday, he tried to get me to go out that night again and even said he was buying us wine and he would pick me up.

I had to explain again that I wanted to meet somewhere in-public first before making any plans to go back to his place for wine, and he jokingly said I could bring my ""gun"" if I felt unsafe? What...I?

And now, I think he may have ghosted me. He said he is going out of town for a couple weeks and we could try to link up during the weekend when he gets back (this was before I insisted we meet in public), and when I sent him a message to tell him to have a nice trip, no response. We'll see if he reaches out in a couple of weeks, but I literally don't understand what the big deal is.

You're willing to pick me up, buy wine, but not meet me somewhere literally like 10 minutes away from both of us?

What's the REAL issue here? I know that these guys probably just want easy hookups, but it would take just as much time for you to pick me up from my house as it would for you to meet me somewhere and THEN (possibly) go to your place?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pq52vo/am_i_really_asking_too_much/

Advice please,"I (f28) have been in a relationship with a woman a fair bit older than me for the last 3 months. She asked for exclusivity, she asked me to be her girlfriend and I delivered. She‚Äôs been hurt in the past and I wanted to be the one who treated her right and so I did. I have accommodated her busy schedule, worked around her children, showered her in support and did my best to remind her of how special she is every day. I‚Äôm a fairly decent looking girl (so I‚Äôve been told) and she always referred to me as her ‚Äútrophy gf‚Äù. We‚Äôve been inseparable for 3 months. Talking for hours on the phone on the days we couldn‚Äôt see eachother in person. There were a few occasions where we had such minor disagreements or a little comment was made and she‚Äôd completely fly off of the handle, become incredibly defensive and I‚Äôd have to remind her that it‚Äôs important to communicate calmly and respectfully and fighting with me like this over such trivial matters was unnecessary and damaging. Each time she‚Äôd come back saying she‚Äôd ‚Äúgive me another chance‚Äù. 

She refused to add me on Facebook but would post selfies of us. In hindsight I believe they were to get at the ex that hurt her, as she made a point of telling me that this other lady had ‚Äúliked‚Äù our photo. The other day we were walking to dinner and she told me to hold her hand quickly and so I did. I felt very special. And then she said the stranger coming toward us was someone who rejected her at the start of the year and when she passed us, my gf let go of my hand. 

Two nights ago I was staying at hers, I had dinner and fresh flowers ready for when she got back from work. In the evening I went to kiss her and I sensed she was a little off so I stopped and went quiet for about 10 minutes. I guess I felt a little insecure. She noticed this and again, absolutely blew up. The next morning she dumped me and has since told me she‚Äôs ‚Äúrelieved‚Äù and ‚Äúsadly over me‚Äù. That I was emotionally immature, that she didn‚Äôt need to validate me because I‚Äôm insecure and that I was always too far ahead. 

I feel heartbroken. She has gone completely cold. Just emotionless. 0 compassion. Talking to me as though I‚Äôm a complete stranger. I am so confused, so sad and anxious. I really cared for her.

When I was talking to her on the dating site she gave me her number and we spoke on WhatsApp video chat, she spoke for 4 hours with me and was bright red in the face the whole time, I knew her face was red by me just being with her on video chat. I asked if I could come see her round her place, and she agreed with no hesitation. When I arrived at her place she was very well dressed and make up on etc (she later confessed that she deeply cleaned her place before I came), we talked, she told me my name often popped in her head over the years, and that I had broken her heart, and when I said 'im surprised you remembered my face still' she laughed and said ',your face is not a face I'd ever forget'. We kissed but It didn't go further.

I (18M) have been trying to get into the dating world. I just started college a month or so ago now, and I feel like I am settled enough myself to start caring for another. However, with everything I have tried, I have had zero success. 

Maybe a little background would be good. I'm definitely not the most attractive person to walk the earth, but I feel like I could be a solid 5-7/10. I'm a music major and I love being athletic. I enjoy hobbies like music (obviously), any sport, and astrophotography (taking pictures of space). I try my very best to treat everyone around me with love and respect, and from what friends have told me, I am one of the most selfless and caring people they ever met. I feel like I am such a unique, creative, and caring person, and someone that will treat a woman like the daughter of God that she is.

I have gone to every event my school has hosted including football games, and even though I'm introverted usually, I have put myself out there trying to meet new people. I go to church for classes no less than 4 times a week and I'm trying my best to surround myself with the best people I can, but I have zero results. I haven't even made a friend let alone a strong connection with anyone. 

I have tried several dating apps as a lastish resort, but they're all filled with bots and fake accounts, or I don't get any matches. 

I have tried using every avenue I know of ( I'm also not experienced so there is definitely a thousand other ways to find people that I don't know about), and I have thrown myself way out of my comfort zone to find that special someone but I'm coming up empty handed. I know this will very from person to person and is very broad, but how/where can I find these connections and the love that I am looking for? 



P.S.
I know that isn't a simple question, but I don't really know how to get into the dating scene/what a relationship starting up typically looks like in college, so I just want some info and opinions/advice on what I am doing wrong and what I should try to do to start this process.

37,pq7b0p,1631908068,"I just had the MOST bizarre situation with a girl, need some SERIOUS advice","I feel sick right now that I was completely played and used by this girl. Three months ago I matched with this girl on a dating app who lived within driving distance. I was a little surprised we matched because she seemed a bit out of my league but either way we messaged each other for weeks (she liked to send voice messages) before finally meeting in person. In person she seemed nice enough, stable job, good family. A little vague with some questions I asked her but otherwise everything was fine.  We messaged either other for another few weeks when I hit her up again to meet up and we did.  I wasn't really feeling like we connected so we stopped messaging again.   
Then this week she reaches out again wanting to hang out again. Being the nice guy I am, I say yes but planned on making an excuse as the date got closer. No point in continuing a relationship if you just don't vibe with someone. And I'm so glad I did because this is what happened next.

Today she asks straight up if we should ""move on"" from each other and I say in a polite way that we should. I thought that would be the end of it. 

Except then she revealed (without me asking) the ""REAL"" reason she was on the app was to make money off of guys. I was absolutely shocked. This sweet nice girl I met just confessed to me that she had no intention of dating me, she just wanted my money. She actually sent me screenshots of guys texting her (she called them ""daddy"") to hang out with her and they would give her money.  She asked me if I could be her next ""client."" I immediately blocked her number. 

Another bizarre twist, minutes after I blocked her number I get a bunch of pictures of bloody tampons from a random number that doesn't come up on reverse phone number lookup online. I actually got some weird pictures like that around the first time I met with her, and now I think they both were coming from her- too much to be a coincidence.

Over the past month, I (30F) developed a one-on-one friendship with a guy (30M) who works for the same company as me. We don't work together at all; we met as part of an event. We're both single and have amazing chemistry together.¬†I have strong feelings for him, and I've noticed a lot of signs indicating he may feel the same about me.

I asked him to dinner last week, and he enthusiastically agreed. It felt VERY date-y: We had an amazing time talking about a lot of private personal things, and closed the place down after 5 hours there. There was a lot of flirting, and he paid our entire bill, although I was the one who asked him out. During this time, I said, ""I like you quite a lot, and I find that you're really nice to be around"". He blushed and said ""I feel the same about you."" At the end of the dinner, he said he would love to do it again, and he talked about ""next time"".

This week, I asked him, ""so, about next time..."", and he proposed a time and place for dinner again next week.  We've also been texting a bit about personal things. 

I've had 1:1 outings with male friends and coworkers before, but they felt VERY different than this, with less emotional warmth.

I haven't specified these as ""dates"", because my main intention was to get to know more about him as a person, before revealing that I'm romantically interested in him.  I also wanted to avoid an awkward situation if he doesn't reciprocate my feelings (especially as I'd still need to see him at work).

However, I want to ask him if he views these as dates. I want to say that I'm interested in him romantically, or ask if he feels the same.¬†I'd like for it to be as least awkward as possible:

* Is there a graceful way to do this, and should I do it next time we go out?¬†
* Is there a conversational segue I can use to bring this up?

57,pq9t22,1631916089,Wondering if I've just had bad luck in dating," 

Sorry in advance for long post but I thought context was important (as a reader but never posted this is my first go!)

30f. Since my last long term relationship ended 4 years ago, I've struggled to maintain any other relationship for longer than a few months. I took a year away from dating after the break up to work on myself, and then due to reluctance of using dating apps I stayed single for a further year. Although I don't see myself as unpretty, I don't class myself as conventionally pretty, I'm petite, carrying a bit of weight and don't overload my face with make up so I've never felt approachable to men unless drunk in a club in my early twenties during university. I've embraced that I'll never be a super slim girl, that I don't want to fake tan and embraced my naturally pale skin, and I enjoy making an effort with my appearance but I chose subtle make up, knowing how to enhance what I think is my best feature- my eyes.

About 2 years ago my dating life reignited as I was set up with someone I work with by a friend. And although the connection was really good, I felt I'd known him forever, his personal issues following the end of a long term relationship got in the way of it progressing, and we didn't go much further than approx 2 months. As I was moving forward from this one of my friends encouraged me to begin online dating with a lot of nervousness (Bumble and Tinder). Throughout my whole time using apps, I have dealt with ghosting, awful conversations, feeling down about no matches, feeling judged by looks and finding that difficult, only getting messages asking me for Snapchat because they wanted a sexting session not anything more despite what a profile said. I matched with someone and we briefly dated before a national lockdown, so following months of communication, it fizzled out (he actually jut one day decided never to reply after cancelling a date so I never chased). I dated another guy but although we got on well chatting, there was no spark at the time.

I began dating someone for approx 3 months, we deleted our apps, had fun but never had the bf/gf chat. He suddenly started acting differently on message but the same in person as usual so I was a bit confused and stupidly didn't confront and walk away when it began. It ended with a message saying you'll have noticed I haven't been myself lately, its not me its you etc, I won't be messaging again. So no idea what happened really and I felt very insecure about myself, I had felt at times that he was too good looking for me but looking back his behaviour showed me he didn't deserve me.

I dated someone for a few weeks after this but no connection for me. The guy I'd dated with no previous spark got back in touch (we had remained friends) and following a bit of a spark we decided to try again. However before we could even date, he ghosted me and about a month after he told me an ex slid back into his DMs and that the chat had gone well so it was bye-bye to me! I took a break from the apps as this had happened over Christmas 2020 and I needed time.

After taking the time and going over in my head that it couldn't all be my fault this was happening and I would be worth a lot to someone eventually, I decided to re-open my apps and chose to join Hinge as well seeing it as a better option- it appeared to be better than the others. I had a few odd dates from all 3 apps, nothing that went anywhere. The guy I'd dated with no connection for me got back in touch- I assumed he'd seen my profile as I'd seen his. I was suspicious and questioned if he was just bored, reaching out to anyone. He assured me he wasn't, but at first I kept a bit of a guard up. Following a few weeks of dating I realised it wasn't going anywhere, he wouldn't date me in public and he revealed he was moving away so we ended it. He continued to try and contact me for casual sex.

I then met my last relationship guy. I finally thought I'd found a genuine nice guy, I felt a connection. I'm not one for making a relationship sexual straight away, it means a lot more to me (I sound quite traditional and old fashioned), I don't wish to be a fwb etc and he respected that, in fact telling me as he felt this was going to be the beginning of something he wanted to wait as well. He had split up with a 9 year ex last year, dated one other girl so I didn't feel like a rebound. However his closest friend was still really good friends with her and she often got brought up in conversation. I didn't view her as a threat, I just took a stance of not mentioning exes in memories, shifting them to be my own experience as it was easier for me. We had a lot of fun, went out, stayed in, had a connection both with and without sex. He brought up being bf/gf at the first month, neither of us were dating anyone else and we deleted the apps. Although I deleted mine correctly, he just deleted the hinge app from his phone so still received emails. I was concerned about this and I expressed why but I did trust him. After about 2 months there was a brief opportunity for me to meet his friend but he told me he wasn't ready and my only concern was if he thought he wouldn't reach that point. I knew I wasn't a secret to anyone, friends and family were aware of me. A few weeks ago I felt I noticed a change in his behaviour, nothing in person and definitely not his sex drive with me, that remained very consistent. There was a night with the excuse 'I need a chill night to myself' which soon changed to out with a friend as soon as he was invited for a drink, so I felt a bit avoided and talked myself out of it as being insecure and paranoid. Then there was getting a terrible hangover and nearly cancelling on me, I felt a little bit forgotten about (silly I know). Then during a date day (meal and drinks out)following feeling one of my strongest connections with him, there was him mentioning taking time off work to see a friend but he couldn't be bothered to, moaning about going etc yet I had been asking him to do the same for me to go on a weekend away I thought he was interested in (he actually suggested a place to stay). Feeling uneasy I had decided to mention it once I was back from a trip away. I never reached this point as our final weekend together he invited me to stay over, we had a lovely meal in and he didn't hold back sexually. Then in the morning following him making me breakfast he wanted to talk. He'd been feeling unsure about how he felt for a few weeks and while I was still asleep that morning, he'd had thinking time and decided to end it. I do understand feelings between people can change but all he said was he didn't feel how he thought he should. I don't believe in there being a time line to follow, certain relationship milestones are expected within a certain period but it was almost like the big spark had faded as expected when you get comfortable with each other and then it was like oh where's that gone. I felt betrayed as he'd said he'd wanted to try before telling me as that had worked in his long term relationship and that he could keep initiating sex when I'd been clear I didn't have sex with friends, it meant more. I knew he was going to say it and I explained what I'd put down to me being paranoid actually now made sense. He didn't want to show me off, he didn't value seeing me and didn't want to commit to time away. I was hurt as I'd been so open and so had he about anything else that I didn't understand him not just talking to me so I could help him figure out if it was going any further. He thought he'd done the right thing but he'd told me his ex had been devastated at their split so he hadn't learn that the tactic of keeping quiet wasn't great and actually upsetting. I also felt hurt I hadn't been treated as my own person. This was someone I truly had believed would change how I saw men and dating and felt positive and honestly if I'd had to sit down and ask him why he wouldn't go away with me, and not got an answer I liked, I would've been walking away from him with feelings still.

I know at any point in a relationship feelings can change but I've always noticed things to indicate there was something wrong, maintaining the sexual connection made me still feel it was the same and I did think I'd been overthinking the last few weeks. Should I feel as hurt as I do that he continued to get sex when he wasn't sure just 'to check' when he knew how much I valued it? Did attraction take over and it was never going to last? And he was insistent in being friends and should I try that?

Do I just attract people who aren't good for me?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pq9t22/wondering_if_ive_just_had_bad_luck_in_dating/
58,pq9v3x,1631916279,Finally found someone great but I'm not feeling chemistry.,"I (40m) found someone (34f) who checks all the boxes. She's kind, attractive, educated, fit,  intellectually curious, wants marriage and kids. We're both in different professions that require advanced degrees and both work a lot. We met on bumble and we had a slow start but eventually started having great conversations. We didn't meet for the first few weeks because of vacations and a work conference so we communicated via the app for longer than I'm used to before meeting. 

We finally had a date and it went well enough to lead to the second date. We've now been dating for about a month meeting once or twice every weekend. No sleepovers or sex yet, which I'm OK with because I don't want to lead her on if I'm not sure of how I feel. 

My past relationships may have screwed me up a bit. Up to this point in my life all of my breakups have occurred because of a move (I've had to move a lot because of career and education). Or we discover an incompatibility or deal breaker. The past few years of dating has been tougher than normal. I've been manipulated, lied to and strung along by multiple women. Before the past few years my relationships have been relatively stable and healthy. 

I don't know if I should give this more time to develop or break things off. I don't want to string her along but this is also the healthiest relationship I've been in for years.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pq9v3x/finally_found_someone_great_but_im_not_feeling/

But a week ago she suddenly broke up (after us having a great last night out and a call as usual the day before) without giving any valid reasons and nothing but compliments. Which kind of bothered me. Eventually asked for more reasons but got the same response and eventually just said it made no decent sense, that she could have given some notice when we met each other a few days before, but thanked her for being a great and fun addition to the summer. 

Now it's two weeks from that moment and it still feels like stuff needs to be discussed. I am contemplating on suggesting a no frills, no expectations sitdown being completely honest about it over some beers or something, but not sure whether to suggest it or not. We haven't talked since the breakup. I know she would be open for the suggestion, but for my own healing it might be best left for what it is. We both really liked each other and even expressed fondness in the breakup, leaving me to ponder about this. Would love to have the talk, as none of us expressed bad feelings about each other, but it might as well be nothing at all and me overthinking it.

There's this girl, she is incredibly fucking beautiful. We go to the same high school, she's a year younger than me and I see her once or twice everyday in the hallway, everytime I get a bit anxious lol. Tried striking up a convo with her (through text) and had a few pretty short conversations with her, however she did follow me and like my only picture on IG which I know isn't exactly an indicator of anything but it gave me a little hope of having a chance. It's been a while since I last talked to her though but I want to ask her out sometime. 

Thing is, I'd hate for her to reject me and then have to see her at school the next day, you know? I'm extremely shy if I'm around a girl I like and if I'm being honest I am not at all confident in myself, even though my friends tell me I am good looking. (FIY I used to be fat for a few years and my self esteem suffered greatly for it, then I lost that weight and got skinny this spring after about 1.5 years of dieting and exercise)

Anyways, I think I could 100% do it sometime like at the start of a break whether halloween or christmas to give myself a few days/weeks to recover myself just in case she rejects me, but then I'm afraid that another guy tries to shoot his shot with her and gets a yes.

 What should I do? If I ask her out later, should I continue trying to talk to her even though I am the one initiating the convos all the time? I mean just chilling and asking her out outta nowhere seems like she'd find it weird. I can't stop thinking about it man, I know that I am probably thinking myself into a hole but that's exactly why I'm here.

1. Talking back and forth for a while and several messages at a time with regular replies, I don‚Äôt say anything inflammatory (I think?) suddenly our tinder conversation disappears mid flow

2. Date agreed going for pizza, we talk all night, he suggested we then go for a drink, we do, we talk a lot about tv interests (we shared a lot of things in common), he suggests a date a week later when we both aren‚Äôt busy. No kiss goodbye, which is cool. He doesn‚Äôt text again

3. Date at a local park (a Monday in august), we go for a 1.5h walk, talking back and forth, we both take interest in each other and share some common interests(or so I thought.) He then suggests coming back to my flat, we then go back there and we talk for a good 2 hours. I suggest next date maybe I could cook him something. He is busy on Tuesday but Wednesday but if he‚Äôs tired let‚Äôs do Thursday. End on good terms. He never got in touch, I didn‚Äôt push it or say anything because I‚Äôm disappointed and although I‚Äôm getting mixed signals, he‚Äôs not obligated to a second date. I haven‚Äôt texted. He has since liked some of my Instagram posts (last week)

4. Talking to a guy on tinder for two weeks and we shared numbers. Can‚Äôt meet as he and I both have busy jobs but have been talking back and forth with both agreeing to meet up sometime during the week of 22 September, both of us send several messages at a time in the meantime, it‚Äôs constant, seems keen. All my messages are responses to his. This suddenly stopped on his turn, a day after the silence (thurs am) I texted saying I hope he‚Äôs ok. He has read it but not replied.

Should I have texted in these instances?

73,pqbbjq,1631921385,"Background and a few questions after a first date (long, so just warning you!)?","Just as some general background? I just turned 50 and am recently divorced. (This is actually divorce #2 but was amicable. The ex got super involved in her religion, among other things, and it really wasn't anything I could deal with anymore. She changed a lot, knew it, and we had no interest in each other anymore. First marriage was in my late 20's and was a big mistake. Lots of physical attraction to someone with major mental problems that I was too young and naive to see the warning flags for. Ended about as bad/nasty as is possible short of someone murdering someone else.) Raised a daughter through all of this but she's grown now and moved out on her own.

So! Short story is, I'm definitely not looking for another marriage and not interesting in raising any more kids. Just want someone I find attractive who wants to go out and do fun things occasionally. (So many activities just aren't real fun to go to alone.) Also expect she'd be up for staying in and cuddling/snuggling/anything else that might lead to. They need to be at least somewhat intelligent and like good/long conversations, because that's a big deal for me.

I started talking to a lady via Facebook dating, of all places. (Really just toyed with it to see how it worked and most responses I got were spam bots and fake profiles.) She was surprisingly ""real"" and we had a lot of ""back and forth"" messaging that led to me giving her my cell to text directly.  She's a lot younger than me (28) and I eventually realized originally from Africa. (I've dated interracially a lot, so African-American is a total non-issue. But none of my previous dates were women originally from Africa, with the accent and mannerisms that go with it.) She says the age difference doesn't bother her at all and she's more interested in the personality of who she meets, plus ""she finds me cute"".

Our schedules are pretty polar opposite of each other, which makes it hard to meet in person too often. But her only days off work are Tuesdays and Wednesdays, so I arranged a dinner date last Wednesday after I got off work. She asked where and I was so busy at work, I didn't have a lot of time to even think about that. I asked if she liked Italian (as I knew a good Italian place near where she lived and worked). She said she really didn't care for it and suggested a steak house she said she'd ""been to once before"". I hadn't been there yet, so agreed. (Hey, I like trying new places.)

So, I got there before she did and was waiting inside near the bar, where the hostess suggested I could wait. She was probably 20 minutes late but did text and apologize. Really was no big deal to me because I was just glad to sit and relax a bit after work! They led us to our table, and I immediately felt a little awkward. Nobody mentioned ""table or booth"" but this was mostly an aisle of booths. She wound up walking in front of me in narrow aisle as we followed our hostess, who directed us to a table at the end of the row of booths. That put me in a situation where she was seated before I could do the ""gentlemanly"" thing of pulling out her chair for her. (And I'm bad about that sort of thing anyway -- and was trying to make the mental note to do it this time, since this was, after all, a first date!)

I guess dinner itself went pretty well. I didn't realize the place was going to be quite as expensive as it was, so that put me off a bit, that she suggested something that ""high end"".  (Trust, but verify, right? Is she just dating to scam free meals from guys?) But she seemed to genuinely enjoy my conversation and we paid each other a few random compliments throughout the evening. (She said she really liked my hair, for example -- and I really liked the dress she chose to wear.) The steak was really, really good -- so at least I can't fault the restaurant on that! Both of us enjoyed it. But near the end, she started complaining it felt chilly, and I honestly didn't think it was cold in the place at all. I'd just paid the bill anyway, so suggested we should probably get going. I walked her to her car and we hugged and she thanked me for the meal and all that. But as we walked to the car from the restaurant, I tried to hold hands or initiate some kind of physical contact and she didn't really reciprocate. I wound up kind of hugging her around one arm as we walked and she didn't try to push me away or anything .. but it was again, awkward....   

So going home, I was a little irritated I guess, although tempered with enjoying the meal and telling myself I can't expect every date to go great. As soon as I got home though, she texted me to make sure I got home ok and all that, and said she had a great time, etc. etc. She texted me the next morning to wish me a good morning, and generally shoots me texts throughout the work day while she's working too.

What should I make of this? I'm told there's some cultural stuff possibly at play here, such as folks from the ""Motherland"" expecting dates to be nicer/higher end like that as opposed to cheaper places just being ""hanging out"" like you'd do with a friend? And maybe they're not as comfortable with a lot of touching or kissing on a first date, etc. like we tend to do in America? Her working all weekend long really makes it a tough logistical thing for us to spend time doing some of the things I'd usually do. But she also keeps telling me she's trying to change her schedule before the end of the year and work fewer hours.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pqbbjq/background_and_a_few_questions_after_a_first_date/

So long story short I broke up with a long-term boyfriend about 2 months ago (possibly 3 at this point) due to me falling out of love and not wanting to string him along. I fell into a really dark and depressive state. After about a month I felt better and I started to do things I love again.

I started coming around his stream more and followed him on social media platforms in which he also followed me back. After he followed me back a few days later I posted a video of my kitten and I on an Instagram story and he responded to it saying that the cat was cute, haha. After that we've been back and forth for the past month and a half (almost two months) with DMing on Instagram. 

The responses are pretty spaced out but I get a response a day pretty much and he always lurks when I stream. I dunno... I know that I really like this guy but I'm just confused about things I guess, haha. Could there be interest on his side? Or am I really the hopeless romantic I know I am?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pqcbcy/i_cant_tell_if_this_guy_likes_me_back/
83,pqcjja,1631926119,Drinking alcohol a deal breaker for you (Dating).,"Hello, I would wanna know how you feel about having a drinking partner. Are you ok with it? Would you want to have a life partner who doesnt drink alcohol or drugs in general? Do you discuss these things while being in the dating phase. I, personally, dislike alcohol and wish a partner who doesnt drink alcohol (even occasionally). I wouldnt know wether I pursue a relationship further or not?

84,pqcqne,1631926905,Are mamas boys a dealbreaker?,"I‚Äôm 34 f, he‚Äôs 36 m. Dating like 4 months.

He wanted to take me to the next big city over from us (like a 3 hour drive) to meet his sister and attend a friend‚Äôs birthday party. I haven‚Äôt been to this city yet, so I was excited and thought it would be a romantic getaway. A couple days before he let slip his mom was coming too. Ok, makes sense, of course she wants to see her daughter. He shows up at my house and as I go to the front seat, he tells me that I‚Äôm in the back seat. The back seat is full of luggage. We rearrange some stuff and make it work. He and his mom chat the entire drive, and I sorta sit in silence. The music was too loud and they were too quiet for me to hear much, and joining the conversation was kind of hard. The whole thing was sort of weird.

We get to the hotel and come to find out we don‚Äôt have our own room, she is sharing a room with us. Ok, well maybe I‚Äôm sort of crashing this trip? Because when it came to sight seeing and shopping and whatever, she came with us everywhere. I felt like his mom chaparroned our romantic getaway.

The subject of Christmas came up and I floated the idea of us flying to my mom state to meet my folks. He said his mom loved that idea and asked if she could come too‚Ä¶..

She Iives with him if that‚Äôs relevant. 

Umm, these are red flags, right? Is this a dealbreaker? Otherwise things are ok. He‚Äôs a great guy, treats me well, I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs a red-hot romance or anything, but I enjoy his company.

85,pqd3se,1631928357,Is he using me?,"Back here again. We're both 16. So this guy I like, (he's said he's interested in me too) has people around him who have warned me saying that he's cheated on all of his previous relationships. I don't know if I should believe them or not. (One person told others who told me) We've only known each other for a month or something and I've only had a crush on him for a week. I really do like him but I'm a little worried that he's just using me for sex or something. He's asked me if I'm a virgin and some stuff like that which is a little concerning. However he is super sweet and caring, we sat watching horror videos and we just cuddled. And today when we were hanging out we hugged each other standing up for a few minutes just talking to each other cause I was tired. It was 10 something pm. Very calming. But when we watched a film today he was just on his phone the whole time, which made me notice that he talks to A LOT of people on Snapchat. Like he sat there for like an hour and a bit answering people. It kinda hurt me. It could be cause he's seen the film before and that my friend was with. When we were alone he'd turn his phone off and watch the videos with me. 

We don't talk to each other that much in school. I am too scared to go up to him, I think it'll be different on Monday because of today though. But it worried me because I believe that he might be ashamed of me. He hangs out with this other girl that he's been friends with for years and they have been together before and it's an on and off relationship thing, which confuses me even more. 

He did ask if I wanted to hang out alone with him soon with a winky face "";)"" and I am a little worried cause I don't want to do that with him, not after this and not this early. He might of just been flirting lol. He did say that he wanted to take things slow and I only got to know about all of this yesterday and today so I'm very confused. We do talk a lot and play games outside of school, even studied together. I'd say that were good friends. What do you think? Is he using me?

88,pqd837,1631928824,Last texts - 7 first dates,"Well I paid thousands and thousands of dollars for a professional matchmaker a few months ago. So far, I've been on dates with 7 different girls. Of which, 1/7 resulted in 2nd+ dates (around 8). I'm still single. Here are the last texts per girl I received, and a bried summary. What am I missing? 



1- Date went average, nothing intimate happened. ""Hi! I wanted to let you know that I had a lot of fun last night. I wanted to also say that I don't believe we'd be a great match, although you're a great guy!""

2- Date went amazing, went dancing and made out. Texted for a few days after, tons of chemistry. ""Hey there- I want to be up front and honest with you, an ex reached out to me this past week, I think there are still feelings there that we are going to explore.  Honestly it was the last thing I was expecting and the timing is terrible because I think we had a great time together.  But I wanted to let you know ASAP about it to be fair and up front."" 

3- First date went amazing, ended up seeing her 8 times. ""Hi sorry I needed to meditate on this before I said anything so that‚Äôs why it took me forever to get back to you but I kind of figured we were on the same page after you didn‚Äôt text me to let me know you got home sat. I have so much fun with you and think you‚Äôre an amazing guy but I feel like there‚Äôs people out there that are better matches for both of us"" 

4- First date went well, lots of good conversations. Texted for 4 days then she called me and said ""I think you're an awesome guy but I'm not sure we should pursue anything serious"". 

5- Date was very bland. The text wasn't surprising. 

6- Date went super well. She said she doesn't believe in going on just 1 date to determine if it's a match, yet the next morning she texted me : ""I wanted to let you know that I'm attracted to the typical bad boys for some reason. And I think you're amazing and really nice."" 

7- Date went average. ""Hey, I did have a really nice time with you the other night. I want to be honest and let you know I‚Äôve given it some thought and I don‚Äôt feel the kind of connection I‚Äôm looking for between us. l‚Äôm sorry, you seem like a great guy, but hope you understand!""


So, either I'm super ugly or I'm blind to reality. Ladies, why tell someone they're amazing and handsome etc, and then not be interested after a fancy dinner and a good conversation?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pqd837/last_texts_7_first_dates/
89,pqdgk3,1631929753,What I‚Äôve learned,"I‚Äôve read so many post on here about dating and it‚Äôs given me perspective. 

Neither gender has it easier. Most Women feel like men just want sex instead of a meaningful relationship, and men who want meaningful relationship are struggling to find that. I wish it were easier to find each other, but it‚Äôs not. That‚Äôs not something to be sad about, it‚Äôs a obstacle to overcome! 95% of dating is trail and error. Expect to be ghosted, expect things to not work out, expect bad dates, and expect a person to lose interest after a few weeks. With each experience learn something that will make you a better partner and what you want in a partner. Don‚Äôt have sex with a man just because the first date was good. Normalize getting to know someone before you share the most intimate parts of yourself. This is something I‚Äôm learning myself. 

Ask questions! If you feel unsure just ask. I think people are scared to ask questions because deep down they know the answer. Don‚Äôt let anyone show/tell you don‚Äôt want you twice. Be upfront and honest about your intentions and what you want.  If you want something serious don‚Äôt engage with someone who is unsure about what they want. 

Make sure you are in a good place mentally before dating. Work on trust issues, insecurities, family issues, etc. Work on making sure you are content and have hobbies prior to dating. Be a good person!

A 21 year old trying figure dating out lol ‚ù§Ô∏è",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pqdgk3/what_ive_learned/

93,pqdy7r,1631931750,Don't know what she's thinking.,"Hello!

Not good on writing things, also not good at english.

So i've met the girl in the internet. You know we do things together, like gaming together, we talk about various topics also we write to each other quite often. The problem is that its happening for 2 months and we haven't met yet. I feel like i like her so much, i'm interested in her but i don't know what exactly she's feeling. Like she is spending half of a day for me, we can talk or write for hours. Then when im trying to say that i think we should meet, she starts saying that's pointless, she's gonna hurt me, i'd better stop typing to her. I really don't know what to think, like she's literally spending so much time with me and in the exact time she's saying that she will hurt me and eventually she'll get bored and will just vanish. Thinking of some mental problems, some confidence problems, self-defense. I'm also having some confidence problems, i think we can help each other. But what should i do? What is she thinking? Should i just quit or keep contacting her and eventually she'll change her mind? Maybe she's right, maybe i'm just wasting time.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pqdy7r/dont_know_what_shes_thinking/
94,pqdz9i,1631931872,"I know people ghost because they fear the other person might react violently, but why not just tell him/her honestly then just block their number/unmatch them?"," 

The argument I always see being said around dating subs is that people ghost and people lie because they are scared of how the other person may react (tbh I feel like if your distrust is *that* huge you probably should be in therapy and not dating subs but my point is irrelevant in this post anyways). So why not just say something along the lines of ""Hey I am not feeling it. I would not like to continue this. Btw please don't take this as an invitation to ask me further. I will block your number because I am afraid of dealing with confrontation."" It is direct and goes straight to the point. At least the other person does not have to guess if they got ghosted or the person is being busy hence they don't get any messages. Whether the other person's gets way too upset or not is on them. And you won't have to deal with any of their outbursts in you blocked their number already.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pqdz9i/i_know_people_ghost_because_they_fear_the_other/
