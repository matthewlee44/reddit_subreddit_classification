1,njro2k,1621839098,Just because you love someone doesn't mean they actually love you back,"So I've been dating this guy for a month now and since then I've gone through quite a bit of heartache. I really cared for this guy, I gave him all the time in the world, gave him all that I can and more. 

I never got mad with him or screamed at him and would do anything in my power to make sure there was no conflict cause I really loved him and wanted him to be happy but all he has done his hurt me. He would tell me how it was a mistake to date me, compared me to his toxic and abusive mother when he was mad, screamed at me for finally stating my frustrations, would disregard my feelings and make it about him, make false promises and would falsely say he loved me then tell me he would only say those things because he would like those things to happen but realistically doesn't see them ever happening.

When I originally introduced him to my mom she thought he was alright but a little off (by the way he hates my mom for no reason) then he randomly dumped me because his friends were saying things about me when they have barely hanged out with me for a day and know nothing about me. She told me that she thought that he was kinda off and messed up emotionally. I should have believed her because he compared me to his toxic and extremely abusive mother when I finally called him out for disregarding my feelings and how he has been hurting me. Said I was making it all about me in the relationship and not about him which doesn't even make sense since I have been there for him non-stop, I always listen to him and do everything I can for him, not to mention he barely tells me anything and trust to hide stuff from me.

A good bit of it has been exploring a sexual kink that was new to both of us and that was releasing all the good chemicals in our brains but there was a genuine connection right from the beginning. Intense enough that we dropped the L bomb after a week. 

Today we did mushrooms and I had a BAD trip. She [34F] lovingly sat with me through it and now that we've been through the looking glass I think gave me some perspective. Much like the housing market, the dating market is a terrible cluster fuck. There's so many options it always feels like you should keep looking. Like there's some ""perfect"" person out there. Don't. The reality is you have to find someone you're compatible with, make an offer same day and become the perfect people for each other over time.

9,njsaf2,1621841776,Seemingly awesome woman. Matched almost two weeks ago. Still haven't called.,"Hello,

I matched with someone almost two weeks ago and we've been talking consistently off the app we used for a week. We snapchat or text a few times a day. For me though I don't really connect or trust someone till I've seen them/heard their voice. To me its more real and personal than texting. I'd rather have a 10 minute phone call for the first time than send memes. 

Anyway I've asked multiple times for a phone call but they say they've been busy. Recently they scheduled a call for Wednesday and a date to get boba on Saturday. I can't tell if I'm being too needy or if it feels like they don't have time to date. I feel like after a week they'd have 10 minutes to at least let me hear their voice. I asked tonight if they can spare 10 minutes tomorrow and they said no. Our texts were super interesting and funny but I feel like I should guard myself and pull back some. 

Some of you may say to just chill and I have a call/date but I'm not really gonna be interested in someone that can only call once every week or two. Other people that I've matched with have been pretty available to do calls or virtual dates in a reasonable amount of time. Or it feels like they have more time in the day than just a couple texts.

Now we’ve both kind of said that we’re exclusive, he’s not sleeping with anyone else and has told me he is no longer using dating apps.

Being a formerly fat kid, I know what it feels like to be the outcast, the bottom of the social ladder. My brain was very sensitive to every minor mistake that I made - sweating too much, having my period too soon, or just generally existing. 

That sensitivity is called shame, a mechanism to ensure that I would stay low-key in case the Queen Bee in class decided to decapitate any fat girls feeling confident.
 
Friends were few, and I was preoccupied by the feeling of wanting to belong. I would hang around the tuck shop for hours after school so that some people would talk to me- you know, maybe one of them would connect me to a group or something. 

Finger crossed. Rolling the dice. NOTHING HAPPENED. 

I mean , once in a while one or two would chat with me .But that only turned me into one of those fat pigeons unwilling to leave a spot because some people fed them occasionally. So there i was, pecking, pecking, pecking for crumbs of attention…
 
When you are surrounded by people who keep telling you that you are an asshole in a million different ways, you internalize that voice. Then you start to apologize to the world for being that shameful thing they say you are.
 
But not all fat-turn-thin people are alike – that’s my experience only. My point is -discrimination can mess with your head.  
 
I don’t want to be that fat girl nodding yes to every piece of unsolicited advices for my own fucking good anymore.

It’s not OK to pass judgements and disguise them as causal comments on us being single, be it well intentioned or not; it is not OK to keep asking us if we are still single every 5 seconds; it’s not OK tell us that we are picky, got issues, or my favorite, being an entitled princess.

NO, not gonna “take it easy” or “chill out” , because to whoever says that: You are not as funny or insightful as you think you are. You are just that schrodinger's douchebag waiting to see how everyone’s reacting before deciding that insult you just hurled at us being single should be a joke or not. 

I don’t have to be angry- but I would call you out, the same way I would call people out when they jump the line or fuck on the street. Yes, I cannot change the whole world, but women won’t be able to vote if nobody called this vagina-can’t-vote bullshit out either.

15,njti66,1621847004,Did I rebound already or am I about to rebound?,"I (25F) got married at 19 &amp; divorced at 22 (I mean who didn’t see that coming). As soon as I left my ex husband, I started a casually dating &amp; met my most previous ex, let’s call him John. Apologies in advance for rambling. 

John was never anyone I expected to end up dating, but he’s a fantastic people person &amp; I absolutely loved how fun he was  so about 4 months after meeting on tinder we started dating as officially boyfriend &amp; girlfriend. Two weeks later he got a dui &amp; lost his job but that didn’t matter to me since again, still wasn’t expecting anything suuuper serious &amp; was just trying to let loose. Eventually (8 months) things got more serious, “I love you”s where said, &amp; he started getting his life together somewhat. Flash forward 2 years later &amp; I realize, I don’t just want to have *fun* anymore. I care about him, we’ve spent so much time together, but I’m realizing I healed from the hurt of my failed marriage &amp; want to try it again some day. He however is pretty comfy in his lifestyle but still says he wants to progress. Not much progressed, things festered within me &amp; when I brought it all up he cried a lot &amp; asked if we could go on a break while he sorts out some priorities instead of just breaking up then &amp; there. 

During this time I of course felt unspectacular since he wasn’t moving at the same pace as I was, and hopped on bumble to see what else was out there. Had some casual chats, flirted, exchanged Snapchat’s, and planned on going out with a guy, let’s name him Ted. Things didn’t end up happening so I deleted him off Snapchat, thinking he had been trying to ghost me.  No worries, I wasn’t expecting anything to happen &amp; didn’t want anything too. 

Back to John. Our break ended after a week &amp; a half, we decided to give it another go as long as he continued to show me he wanted to progress our relationship as well as continue to working on himself (prioritize work, no excessive drinking, take control of his life’s goals, treat me more like his girlfriend of 2 years instead of one of his bros). Well, not even a week later he was back to doing what he wanted &amp; I started feeling the resentment building up for giving him another chance. I realized how much he helped me grow as a human being since being so broken, and as much as I loved him I realized I don’t think he will be the person I reach my own personal goals with (I am very career oriented now &amp; plan on settling down before I’m 30, where as he is not). He saw the breakup coming, we reminisced the good times, cried &amp; laughed, said we still loved each other then parted ways. Healthiest breakup of my life. 

So, was that a rebound? (My best friend believes it was)

The reason I question it is the next day after the breakup, I added Ted back on Snapchat &amp; we went out a few days later. Quick I know, but again I felt very happy about how healthy the breakup went &amp; don’t mind the idea of meeting someone new since I finally know exactly what I want out of life. We actually had a fantastic time &amp; Ted surprisingly ticked a lot of boxes of what I would want from a serious partner (not rushing into anything now, but it’s refreshing knowing that). I wasn’t expecting to want to go on another date but here we are. 

Is this going to end up being considered a rebound?? (My best friend also believes it will be) Or should I give it more time before attempting a second date?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/njti66/did_i_rebound_already_or_am_i_about_to_rebound/

18,njtvrn,1621848569,Telling men that they need to “just be confident” in dating is usually harder than simply getting good looks.,"For context, I’m a 22 year old male with no dating experience whatsoever. I’ve came close before, but for whatever reason it never amounted to anything. Maybe it’s my fault or maybe it’s not, I don’t really know. Everyone always assumes or jokes that I either just don’t ever want to be in a relationship or that I’m asexual, when in reality I’m desperately wanting to be in relationship. It’s depressing to be told these things when I’m constantly thinking about being in a relationship and wanting a family at the back of my mind. I’m afraid of living to a ripe old age with no wife or family. Any time I have brought this up, I’m always told that I need to just start asking people out, or that I “just need to be confident,” which to me seems like another way of saying I need to be more extroverted and that brings no comfort whatsoever to me, as it isn’t natural for me to be outgoing and talkative. Every time I’ve tried to be, I’ve ended up looking stupid and embarrassing myself.

Anyhow, I just don’t see how being told to “just have confidence” or be more outgoing is any comfort when just being physically attractive is usually much easier, especially for young men. It isn’t that hard to have a decent weight, good hairstyle and hygiene. Hell, I’m 6’2 with all of these physical qualities and that’s never made any girls fawn over me. I’ve even been told by many non-family members that they can’t understand why I don’t have a girlfriend when I’m a good looking guy, or something along those lines. I don’t have model looks, but I’ve seen guys way less attractive, both physically and emotionally, have way more success in dating. It seems what’s really important as a man is that you’re, at the least, able to present an ironically superficial and shallow persona to others. It isn’t necessarily confidence that attracts women, but insistence. And that is very hard to do if you don’t have a naturally insistent personality.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/njtvrn/telling_men_that_they_need_to_just_be_confident/

I am a very good listener and when people talk to me i have no problem with that and i can give good opinions, advices and always ask questions. Sometimes i interrupt people, because i want to ask something they just said. Even if they’re not finished so much interest do i show.

When i think about meeting or getting to know a women i care about what she says and i take it serious. I am kind, calm, understandful and always supportive.

For example: I do have/had female roommates i didn’t even know before and welcomed them with gifts and snacks.

One had birthday recently and even i knew her for 2 weeks i bought a birthday gift. Is this so unusual?

I always buy birthday gifts or people i get to know who have birthday soon as i met them. Also for males i do that.


But when i think about meeting a women i don’t really have interest in the personality i believe i just want to experience the sexual life. I don’t have much feelings when i talk to a woman i am attracted too.

The thing is i have what i believe is nice cool interests. Like cooking, sports like paddle/tennis, hiking, working out, meditation and yoga and i like rap music.

24,njuchg,1621850479,How to deal with inadequacy?,"Hi, 29/m here.

During the pandemic (around mid-feb) I started talking to a woman through a dating app and we immediately hit it off. Talking literally every day, saying good morning &amp; good night. Had video chats and phone calls often, had the rare feeling that this person is actually super into me and this could be something that could blossom.

We met up after a month of talking and had a great time, we both said it felt incredibly familiar and so easy to be around each other. Over the next couple of months we meet up multiple times, sleeping together, watching movies and exploring the local area together, and generally enjoying each others time. Honestly couldn't have been any better - it's been a long time since I felt this kind of connection with someone.

Then it comes to about the three month mark and it feels like she's starting to pull away. Messages were few and far between, conversations seemed quite one sided with myself driving it most of the time, usual signs that things may not continue in the near future. I saw her one weekend and had a chat about it and she explained that she's concentrating on her career and just finding it hard to keep up with everything - she's even leaving her friends on read for days at a time. I think nothing of it and we continue.

Then it comes to a weekend recently and she sends the dreaded message ""can we talk, i've been doing some thinking"" and turns out she doesn't feel a 'spark' and thinks it's best we break things off. I say I had a feeling this might happen but it's most likely for the best, sad to have it end but happy it happened etc. I live solo so of course over the next few days I start overthinking and trying to figure out what went wrong, because to me she was the full package, right? She was incredibly attractive, funny, career driven, and we had similar interests. And after our initial talks about how we felt it didn't seem to add up.

After about a week I send her a text asking what happened, what changed, and if there's something I can work on. This was not asking her to change her mind, more of an ask to let me know so I can work on whatever it is for whoever comes along next, to make myself a better person because to me saying there was no 'spark' is kind of obscure and doesn't really tell you anything.  

She explains that I don't need to change, just the emotional connection was right but the physical attraction wasn't at the same level.

So I know I am not an ugly guy - I look after myself and keep myself clean, I haven't been in the gym due to the lockdown but am now in the process of getting back into it. I've got features that are not everyone's cup of tea but I would think that would be apparent in the pictures or after meeting up for the first time.

I think this is just the first time where I really thought something could happen only to be told that the other person doesn't find me physically attractive. I've had some issues with body dysmorphia and self-worth due to some bad relationships in the past and just finding myself falling down that rabbit hole again. I want to get back out there - I'm not getting any younger and would really love to find the 'one', but I get these waves of inadequacy washing over me when thinking about it or thinking things like ""if I'm going to spend time and effort getting to know a person and really getting emotionally invested, only to be told I'm not physically attractive, who's to say this wont happen every time? Am I worth it?""

I'm not sure what I'm looking for posting this here, I think it's a therapeutic thing to get my thoughts out of my head and onto paper (or the screen). But I'd love to hear if anyone has experienced similar and what they did to help them get through the process.

27,njvby3,1621854187,Great 2nd date,"I 31m went on a 2nd date (33f) on Saturday.

We met on Match and talked a little. I ask most of my matches out on dates to weed out the ones that are serious, and she agreed. Our first date was a little awkward, though not a total disaster. There were some awkward silences and not a lot of ""sparks"" (for lack of a better term). I have a hard time reading her as she's a lot different than girls I've dated in the past. I'm not sure if there is a cultural barrier, she was born in Russia and moved to the US at 13. We texted and talked on the phone on and off for the following 2 weeks, and decided to try again.

It was a nice summer weather day, and I took her mini golfing. Conversation was a lot better from the start and we joked and laughed. I paid for the mini golf, then she paid for ice cream after. Not wanting the date to end, we walked around the nearby park, went on the swings, and went down the big slide. Drove her back to the mini golf course to pick up her car. Neither of us wanted the date to end, so we took my Porsche for a long drive with the top down, listened to music, and talked. She had never been in a convertible before so she had a blast. We parked back at the mini golf place and talked for about 40 minutes. This was the only deep conversation we've had and we really broke through the awkward small talk we'd been having. I learned that she is secure and confident, and doesn't cling to her bf in a relationship. We both joked about how we need our own space and do our own seperate thing, which is such a breath of fresh air to me.

When she got out of the car I got up to hug her. I really wanted to kiss her, but like I said, I have a really hard time reading her. Before I pulled out I heard her say ""wait!"". She came running up to me and gave me a kiss on the cheek and then ran back to the car. So now I know.

40,njxlgg,1621861762,How should I interpret ”Taking it slow”?,"I (21M) have been seeing a girl (20F) in my class. She is switching classes after this semester (which ends in two weeks). We kissed on the first date and have been on two more since. Its clear that we both like eachother (holding hands etc).

I told her I had been taking it slow leading up to our first date to which she replied ”I like that” so I am assuming she wants to keep things paced moving forward as well. Here are some other hints:

She also told me that other guys in our class have asked her out in which case she had to decline, so she doesn’t want anyone to know that we are dating quite yet (hence I am asking reddit :)).

Right now we are entering exam period and she is feeling stressed and would prefer not to see me until exams are over (in two weeks) to which I told her that I respect and agree with that (although it sucks cause I miss her).

We haven’t actually talked about taking things slow specifically but I get the feeling its the underlying reason for alot of this.

So how should I interpret these signs? Does she want to take it slow because she sees potential in us and wants to ”feel the waters” before getting emotionally invested? Or am I reading into things and she maybe isn’t taking this as seriously as me? I dont want to find out we have different expectations and get hurt.

She said that I am the first guy she has ever really liked, and this is the furthest I have gotten to a committed relationship (which by the way is what I am looking for) so this is pretty new for the both of us.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/njxlgg/how_should_i_interpret_taking_it_slow/

Specifically, I’d say most women (all races) don’t flirt openly with Blackmen mainly due to stigma. In my mind race is simply just a caste system. Their soul may want me but they fear judgement of the world. A gift &amp; a curse.

Yh majority of coloured men and ethnic minority would deny this. The focus is on money. Notice how the Blackman makes a big deal of how much money he’s worth before he has any chances of temporarily being accepted by any woman.

Would you honestly say that it’s too much burden being seen with a Black or treating him like an equal ?

47,njyxrz,1621865648,"Even if you don't have much of a dating and sex life, you should actively be learning up on them (especially the latter!)","While we pursue trying to meet someone, I think many people have a tendency to just focus on one part of the equation. It's almost like you're only trying to get to step 1, and then you'll worry about the rest later. However, I think it's still a really good idea to be able to prepare yourself for the entire picture so that if you ever do meet someone, you're not completely ill-prepared. 

For example, I think most people who are single, especially on this sub, aren't always dating, hooking up or having sex with anyone, and therefore, they have no reason to familiarize with the sexual aspect of things. Still, there are things you can do to learn about that area.

Classic example that I just became aware of, and TMI alert, so sorry in advance for the details, but if you're a guy, you should probably have a pretty good idea how to use a condom and which condom fits you best even if you don't have a partner. In my case, I just became aware of how I have #bigdickproblems and the standard condom doesn't fit me. Now I'm reading recommendations on condoms better suited for guys who are bigger down there, and there's a lot of things I never knew. Essentially, I'm learning that despite what bad marketing has been put out there that says a standard condom should fit anyone regardless of size, it's not true at all. I'd definitely like to be prepared for when I need to use one, though, so I'm glad I took the time to educate myself and experiment.

Another example I can think of that has nothing to do with sex is that many people are just trying to get a quality match on a dating app, but once they get one and engage in conversation, they fumble at the point of what to do next. It's almost like their only goal was to get the match, but then they didn't think through what they would do when it came time to actually meet the person and their comfort around that.

We have been texting for five months now and I’ve started to catch feelings over text. Out texting exchanges have become extremely intense and I’m comfortable enough to share details about my life and personal things with him.

One finds this type more in large metropolitan cities and certainly, if a young man wants to be respected by 'good society' he will find himself a young woman who knows ""how to speak professionally"". We have this obsession with 'professionalism'. 

The man who strolls into society holding hands with a foreign model, a young ballerina or actress, a dancer, etc... immediately gains the contempt of society. They ask themselves ""Well, what kind of man would date a woman like this and not a professional newspaper-reading stock-purchasing woman?"" 

We look at these relationships as too offensive because we believe that it is *unnatural*. Overall, we have the expectation that every little girl should be a Clinton, a Harris, a Theresa May. 

Society dislikes the man who dates a Ukrainian ballerina or a Brazilian model because they see it as fundamentally *unfeminist*. They say to themselves ""This is a man who likes women to be submissive!"" and they immediately cast suspicions on him. 

In short, they want him to date a woman with masculine inclinations because that is what is considered *good taste* and *modern.*",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nk1eew/taste_for_professional_women/

66,nk1wgv,1621873565,I can't tell if what my GF did is suspicious or if I'm just being paranoid,"Context: Been dating a girl for around 4 months. Things are going really well.

&amp;#x200B;

She is close friends with a guy who gave oral to, not long before we starting going out. I can live with that, it's not a huge deal to me that it happened, but I was naturally a little concerned about this guy and any time they spent together. 

&amp;#x200B;

I told her about this, and she reacted well. She was very reassuring, the kind of reassuring where you can tell someone is telling the truth. I know she doesn't have romantic feelings for the guy, but there is obviously at least attraction there considering they've hooked up in the past. 

&amp;#x200B;

A couple of days later, we are all hanging about at her apartment. Not just the three of us, but our other fiends too. At one point, the guy in question goes downstairs  to get his speaker from my gf's room as I am headed back upstairs with my gf. He goes into her room and the two of them are alone in there for roughly 30 seconds. I waited at the stop of the stairs to listen to what was going on (there was music playing loudly so it was hard to tell). I hear them chatter and what not, and then I don't hear anything for about ten seconds. I hear her say something along the lines of ""ok let's go up"" and she leaves and comes upstairs. 

&amp;#x200B;

I can't shake the feeling they were kissing, but I also can't tell if I'm just being overly sensitive, especially since I felt so reassured just a couple of days ago. I can't possibly confront her about this, because I have no proof. But it does seem a little odd, right? I don't trust him more than I don't trust her. But I do have a hard time seeing her go ""oh no this is wrong"" if he made a move.

67,nk1wxy,1621873599,Relationships seem to always end the same,"I seem to always have relationships end the same way and it’s getting really difficult as of now.

When I start talking to a girl it always starts casual flirty banter and some light teasing and almost always after a little while the girl states that she’s “not ready for a relationship” almost always the reasoning is due to her being fresh out of a relationship and being emotionally unavailable.

At this point I’m fine with the relationship not being anything serious but slowly the girl starts to excel things very quickly. She will start reaching out more, asking to FaceTime and driving to meet me in person.

This will grow for a couple of months and I feel as if I’m always catching up to how she feels about me. And then seemingly out of nowhere the girl becomes very cold with me.

One word responses never reaching out and instead of responding instantly I end up getting a response and hour later completely ignoring whatever I said.

I don’t know what to do at this point, most people say just move on but I’ve caught feelings now and don’t really know what to do.

I can’t tell if this is her trying to protect herself or if she just lost interest or what.

Any advice on what to do next would be appreciated I’m no the type to chase and if I do I never do it for long and I’m thinking it’s probably best to just move on as much as it hurts. Also and advice for future relationships to avoid this happening would be great.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nk1wxy/relationships_seem_to_always_end_the_same/
68,nk1x9r,1621873624,Establishing a relationship with someone that is leaving in a few months,"I have liked this girl for a while now. We are friends and would hang out in groups. For a long time I didn't make any moves as she was always in a relationship with someone and I am old-fashioned when it comes to making moves on women in relationships.

Several months ago she broke up with her boyfriend, but I gave it a few months (4-mo) as I didn't want to get in at the worst time. In the meantime I made sure we hung out together more when we gathered in small groups (this is allowed where I live btw). I didn't act different other than this.

Last week, we slept together. She was sleeping over and asked me to sleep next to her after telling me that she felt lonely and just wanted to hold someone as she fell asleep....one thing led to another and then it led to more. We talked quite a bit after that, but I didn't confess my long-time attraction toward her. She is coming over and spending the weekend with me again. I assume this will continue unless something happens.

About a couple of months ago I found out that she is going to another country to do a working holiday deal for a while later this year while we were chatting with friends. Theoretically, we will have about 4-5 months together. I am thinking about spending this time with her without confessing my 'undying love' for her. My reason behind is that I don't want her to miss out on her opportunity to be out there because of me. I know that I can offer her a lot in life, but not for a few years as I am changing my career rn but I know I can be successful and make her happy in a few years, BUT I don't believe that a woman should give up her goals/dreams because of a man. I am probably also scared that this will ruin my precious time with her for the next few months.

I am risking that she will fall in love with someone else.....I am a realist and know that long distance relationships don't work out.

I am not sure what I am asking for here. I am just confused. I don't want this to be just a sexual relationship. I don't want to end up just temporary friends with benefits.

Can you provide some input into my thought process and how I should think of this situation? TYIA",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nk1x9r/establishing_a_relationship_with_someone_that_is/

Situation: 

I have to take a board exam to get my RN certification. I have always known when I want to take it but it’s ultimately up to when the Ohio board of nursing approves my application. From there I can schedule it. I need to take it before June 21st as that is my tentative start date. 

My boyfriends father planned a trip from June 4th to the 12th back in February. That’s about when I’d probably schedule my exam. We are now running into the dilemma on if he goes or stays back to help me out before I take my exam. 

I would absolutely LOVE for him to stay in town because this exam makes me very anxious and nervous. I feel bad for asking him to stay back. I know deep down he wants to go but he says he’s willing to stay knowing that’ll make me happy.

79,nk2oru,1621875590,"Online dating is hilariously stacked in women's favor, and I give up on it. At least for now.","Without getting into too much detail, I'm a 31m who's played around since I was a teenager with getting to know women online and, in a couple instances, forming serious relationships. All in all, though the effort I've expended has at least gotten me better at holding a convo, it's effort that would've been better spend on my education, career, fitness, and on and on. To be frank, I could've done without those relationships, as well, but the internet isn't to blame for that not working out.

The consensus of men who try to date online in regards to the gender imbalance is spot-on, and it doesn't seem all that surprising. Women being choosy makes sense in light of human evolution, i.e. men being able to sire children potentially a thousand times a year versus women mostly being able to make only one baby per nine months.

It's still daunting to actually see it in action on dating apps. Just peep the countless threads of women who are bombarded with Lovecraftian horror-level sex fantasies day in and day out; all they did to earn that was create an account and upload a picture. Also peep the men who barely get any matches despite using the apps every day for months.

I have a friend whose experience kind of highlights the gender imbalance for me more than anything else. I'm really, truly sorry for anybody who's struggling with their weight if what follows offends you. My friend is morbidly obese and has near zero interest in losing weight or taking care of her body in any way. I don't know her actual weight, but I'll guess about 220 on a 5'3"" frame. Not only does she get matches, she gets *pursued* and has to try to shake some especially desperate men. Yes, I know that some men are into big women in particular. I'm also not trying to talk shit about a friend behind her back. It just really hit me, when she was describing her dating life, how great the difference was between the effort we've each respectively put into finding someone.

I'm sure there's some technique or trick I'm missing that will fix things for me, but even if there were, it would still be more time and effort gambled that I could instead spend on actually improving myself and making myself more dateable. Most of my ""success"" stories involved meeting chicks IRL anyway.

I had nothing to lose at that point so asked her why and if she is still into me, and she said she can never tell how I feel and that I seem like I’ve been going off her.

In fact I thought it was her going off me as she was being quiet and sometimes leaves my messages on read for a few hours although I understand we are both busy adults. She never communicated that she felt like that until I asked today after she cancelled the date, and she was really upset that I “didn’t like her”. I have convinced her otherwise and we are facetiming tonight to talk more about this.

Any idea what to do in this situation? By the way we talk online atm as we live about an hour and a half away from eachother. I do wanna see her a lot more as it helps connect better, but I can’t if she cancels, she is quite insecure so I feel I need to prove my feelings before we see eachother again.

fast forward to the pandemic and my views changed where i now identify as liberal and am pretty much anti-trump/republican/conservative. 

i find her parents nice but am annoyed when the parents are constantly making jokes within their family saying “don’t be a liberal” for example when wearing a mask when not in a store, her dad would tell his wife “don’t be a liberal” or when her 10 y/o little sister doesn’t want to eat the pizza they bought the dad says “don’t be a liberal”

I met this girl at a party the other night. We clicked right away and spent most of our time together away from the party (talking and sharing). Took her # and asked her to meet up, she said she's up for it whenever I want to. Dropped her at her place that night, nothing happened.

When we were talking she mentioned that she had a boyfriend (long distance relationship) I didn't really care. Not sure if it's true or not, usually when girls tell me that and then I figure out later it was either a lie or they were dumping them. If she has a boyfriend, she shouldn't be spending time with me 1on1.

The next day, she texted me because I had one of her rings on my finger (don't ask me why) and we agreed to meet up in a restaurant a couple of days later.  
The meet-up was fun, we talked quite a bit, I tried to convey her to come to my place for one last drink but she declined. Nothing happened that night either.

Afterwards, I invited her to a dinner I was doing at home with some friends. She told me she'll let me know because she has something on that particular day. I asked her a day before to confirm because I was cooking and needed to know for groceries, she told she was sorry because she really doesn't know. Long story short, she came nonetheless even if she was exhausted (woke up early to go hiking). I dropped her back home that night as well and asked her to meet-up again in a week's time, she said she'll let me know.

To give a bit of context, I'm in my late 20's, successful, lucky to have several group of friends, had 1 (very) long relationship and then dated quite attractive women. I'm comfortable around women, I'm not in a scarcity mindset but when I see someone who's checking a good amount of boxes, I usually want her.  
This girl at first was taking too much time to respond to my texts and I made her understand that I don't like it in a non butt-hurt way and then she started to respond in a timely manner.  
She also kind of thinks that I have multiple choices because she sometimes makes a joke about it and I just usually make it even more sarcastic.

Well I'm a bit confused because I'm not sure where I stand. Usually when I meet girls, I kind of know if this is leading somewhere or if it's a dead end. In this particular situation I'm getting a bit bored to be honest and am not sure if I should continue pursuing even if I'm interested.

Thanks for your view on it !",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nk4j9q/am_i_wasting_my_time_in_that_situation/
93,nk4k2l,1621880492,He was sooo into me then get distant and vanished. Why?,"Hi :) 

Let me tell you my story. I'm kinda surprised and disappointed right now.. I would like to understand the situation.

So.. I'm talking with a guy since 1,5 months. Everything was going great and we spent the last three week-ends together. He was constantly texting me, asking to meet me, making plans about coming to see me again or cooking again for me. He even kissed me in the middle of the street last time when I told him the week-end together was great. At the end of the day, he was holding me so tight and didn't want to let me go. 

During the 3 week-ends together, we just did some preliminaries but nothing more. I wanted to take it slow. And everything was going well for both of us. He even seemed more into me that I was.

After that, he got suddenly distant. I asked him if something was off and if he still wanted to meet me.. He told me he was just busy with work (he has to finish a paper). But he got colder and the dynamic between us changed. It's been one week that he's more distant, and 2 days that I don't got news, despite the fact that he's always online. I don't understand what happened so suddenly and I don't want to act clingy/needy. Some advices ? How can someone turn to the opposite like that?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nk4k2l/he_was_sooo_into_me_then_get_distant_and_vanished/
94,nk4q60,1621880939,Tinder + Mental Health,"So, I'd thought I'd share my dating experiences, and see if anyone on here can relate at all.

Since my breakup, I've probably been on dates with around 8 other women (around my age, 22). Things went well, however almost all of them had mental health struggles and didn't/couldn't continue dating. Most of these dates came from Tinder initially, which leads me to wonder if anyone else has had a similar experience with this app? I'm aware that this of course would not be the same story for every user, but it's something that i've started to notice a lot more of in the last year (I'm sure COVID has not helped either).

I was also wondering how any of you have proceeded from this point? I've since deleted Tinder, and I think i'll stick to in person interaction for the foreseeable.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nk4q60/tinder_mental_health/

96,nk4zow,1621881649,Should I even reply back?,"Went on a date with a guy who I really liked. We went out for some food and then when we got into the car, he immediately got super touchy and wanted to get us a room. He kept saying let’s get one and I kept telling him no. We fooled around the previous time but I wasn’t ready for sex. He tried to make me feel guilty and I just told him to drop me back home.

He sent me a message yesterday basically apologizing and saying sorry if you thought I was being pushy and then he texted me today asking how my day was going. Should I just block and move on or should I give him a proper response? That I don’t want to see him again as he made me feel super uncomfortable. I don’t wanna make him seem like a predator or anything but I just didn’t like having someone try to push my boundaries like that. :(",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nk4zow/should_i_even_reply_back/
97,nk56sq,1621882171,Giving him space,"So, I (21f) have been seeing this guy (23m) for two months now. He’s currently in the last couple of months of university and has a mountain of work still left to complete. Since meeting last, (just over a week ago) he started to get a little distant and such so I decided to ask him if everything was okay. He expressed that he had all of this work to do and that he was starting to get worried about it, but not only that, that he’s “worried that I like him more than he likes me” (even though prior to this it was the other way around) but he thinks it’s just gonna take him a little longer as he does have feelings for me. I told him that he should have just been honest with me and told me this rather than acting weird and distant and that he can have all the space and time he needs to get some work done and have a think about us. He said he thinks taking things slow is the best thing for both of us right now and I completely agreed. So, I told him not to message me the next day or the days following and to just get his head down and get some work done and to message me when he feels a little clearer. 


Do you think this was a good move? Fellas in particular, would this attitude and understanding in a girl make her more appealing to be with?
I’m just praying he doesn’t go off me during the silence.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nk56sq/giving_him_space/
