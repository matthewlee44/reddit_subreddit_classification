I have just come out of a near 5 year relationship. I would've done anything for that person. I put all my time and effort into them despite having college, 2 jobs and a life to maintain. I would commute to see them constantly. I would call them before and after work. I would do thoughtful gestures after exams and spoil them at events like their birthday. Despite all this it wasn't enough. The relationship ended unexpectedly and I was left heartbroken. They seemed to move on instantly and I questioned myself for a while. Since then I've started self improvement. I'm still the man I was but a better version. I now have all of those qualities and more. I have achieved more qualifications, progressed my career, gained new hobbies and got even fitter via greater gym time and boxing training. More exercise has really improved my mindset and I can't express how great it is. I feel confident and I'm enjoying myself a lot more recently.   
My problem is that I want someone. I dont need someone, I want someone in my life. Someone to love, support and care for. Someone who can share experiences with me. I can go travelling or shopping alone but having someone else there makes it even more special. Just someone who would like to spend evenings together and watch movies. Someone to explore with.  
I see a lot of my mates not appreciating their relationships enough. I see others who mislead women and use them before later breaking their hearts. I hate this. It isn't what I stand for.

This was literally less than 10 sentences of our initial contact.
Then he said I should look up the pension plan or something if I want to stay for long term.
I casually joked he is a smooth talker then he replied:
Your pictures are good but your conversation is not there.

I've been using apps like CMB and Tinder for some time since I don't have as much opportunities to meet new people irl. I’m quite lucky to at least have the appearance and a solid bio to be able to get matches on dating apps. But after the texting stage and moving onto the meetup stage, that’s where every single connection I’ve ever had ends.

In every date I went to, I made sure to put my best self forward, and try to make convo. I’m not the most extroverted but I try my best to be sociable, open and light-hearted. Many of the dates even seemed to go smoothly, with no awkward silences or anything in between. But once we part ways, that's when everything ends. Some of them were thankfully polite enough to at least tell me why I was rejected (albeit they usually made up a more politically correct reason like ‘it’s not your fault it’s me’ so that prevented me from ever knowing the true reason). The rest just ghosted me straight up or would give a blank obvious one-word text reply after a few long days to show their disinterest.

It sucks not because I keep getting rejected. It sucks because I don’t ever know what went wrong and I can’t improve or correct any potential flaws in myself because of it. I do know some possible reasons. One person seemed to reject me because they ended up being taller. Another one rejected me because they thought I was a working adult even though I clearly stated being as tudent. But these are just two cases. I have no idea what went wrong for the rest where these reasons were not valid. Just for the record I never lied or catfished or fake edit my pictures.

All in all, this honestly feels worst than getting rejected from a job interview. Or failing in an application to a top school. I could take the rejections at first. But what I can’t take is not knowing why I got rejected. After over a dozen rejections where I have absolutely… zero… complete idea what even went wrong, it’s does start to push me off the edge. I mean, even if the other party doesn’t feel the first date went up to expectations, isn’t it too early to judge by just one meetup? For every single one of them to choose to end it after the first date makes me wonder if I just screwed up that immensely bad.

So, after checking her socials for a bit, I realized that she's about 1-2 years older than me, and is a friend of one of my seniors.

After debating for a few days, I decided to finally text her, but couldn't think of anything to start the conversation with (we both never knew each other); also, I fear that I'll just run out of topics to talk about and make everything awkward, since I'm a very bad texter.

I'm afraid that if even if I do text her, she'll just not be interested since I'm younger, or she'll tell my senior and he'll make things very awkward for me.

Is it odd that there are super long gaps in communication (sometimes a full day)? Does that hint at lost interest or is it too early to tell?

Things were going well we were going on dates, had things in common I enjoyed the pace it was going. I had told myself I was going to take it slow and see how things unfolded, I had a good feeling about it because the intentions seemed pure. 

We had discussed our previous relationships, he had mentioned he had gotten out of a long term (7 years) relationship within the last year. They were living together, she broke up with him, he lost his job due to COVID, he moved back home (aka where I’m from) when this was first mentioned he said he had moved on from it so I didn’t think much of it. I mentioned my last relationship of 5+ years and how I’ve been single for almost 2 years and I’ve done the healing work to be fully at a place where I’m ready to let someone in again. He told me I was someone he could see himself dating that we just needed to get to know each other more which I agreed. 

Mid May he mentioned he had to go pick up items that were at his old place because the girl was moving out. I was okay with that since it was fairly new I felt he didn’t owe me an explanation. He said that they were cordial but that he didn’t really feel anything anymore it was more of a weird situation.


This month he went to go pick up the bigger items, I hadn’t really heard from him so initially I asked what was going on, and that I needed to know where he stood because the hot and cold game wasn’t working for me. 

He then mentions that it’s been an emotional week for him and picking up his stuff kind of took him back and made him realize that he has not moved on from his last relationship and isn’t ready to give someone else the 100%. He mentioned that he thought he was ready that’s why he saw interest in me but said it’s just bad timing. 

It is such a hard pull to swallow but I appreciate the honesty and better that I know now then later. I just feel so bummed in a way that in every other way, we were compatible but I can’t force someone that isn’t emotionally ready. 

Could be bad timing or just another failed attempt, who knows but I know I have done the work in my healing and I deserve someone that can give me the 100%. I’m one of the people that believes in fate so if it’s meant to happen it will.

a) Authenticity is an important quality. Into cooking, films, jazz/rock/soul.

b) Just looking for someone to cook for.

c) Something else entirely.

I wasn’t sure sure of what these traits to pull from.

Interests include film, 70s soul, comics, trying different cuisines, animation, cooking, jazz, acid jazz.

Recently moved to another area in my state.

Have my first full-time job in marketing. 

Some values I have authenticity, honesty, and solid communication. I would love to be with someone who enjoys different forms of affection. Also, I really dig cornball romance (like the thought of slow dancing at home)

We had amazing chemistry and spent about 8 weekends in my apartment without leaving.  I fell completely in love with him and stuck around for his deployment only to have him leave me at the end of it.  He ended up getting married to a girl from his hometown a couple months later (she wasn’t in the picture until he got home - and yes, I know this for a fact).

I always felt that he loved me and left because he was scared of the whole situation…i was a 28 year old attorney and he was a lance corporal in the marine corps…he told me often I was “terrifying.”

15 years go by and he’s always been the one that got away.  I messaged him on FB a few years ago and got no response.  A month ago, he messaged back and it was clear that the chemistry was all still there.  

We met up in Denver last weekend and it was, of course, amazing.  I got some answers.  He admitted he did love me but he knew he couldn’t sustain a real marriage and he thought he was going to die on his second deployment so he left me and just decided to “live it up” a little by marrying this random girl.  He said it wasn’t meant to last and lasted way longer than it should have.  He also implies strongly that he did think about proposing to me.

At one point I asked why he did it if he loved me and he said “would you rather it have been you and we’d gotten divorced?  Because that’s what would’ve happened.” I said “no this is probably better….” and he said “I have to think about my daughter and you have stuff you need to figure out” and I said “I know but it sucks”

Then he said “we will figure it out.”

After I got home we talked a little.  I know he’s scared I want more (and I do but I’m not pushing for anything right now but I don’t think he understands that….I just want to keep in touch and maybe see him now and then - I live in CA and he’s in CO so it’s not like I’m down the street).

Things seemed okay until he said “I hope you weren’t disappointed” and I said “I think it’s safe to say I was far from disappointed. I’m the one hoping YOU weren’t.”  This was a comment about the fact that I’m 43 and my current on/off BF says I’m old, I’m barely cute, etc.  so I’m sensitive to how I look (and btw I do know I’m very attractive but having someone put you down for a year takes a toll).

The ex made me feel wanted again and I’m super grateful for that but that’s what I meant when I said that.

He stopped responding and hasn’t texted in 3 days.  I sent him a joke text this morning about my shoe getting broken (because we always said things were going to break when we met up - sure enough, my shoe broke lol).

So now I’m waiting.  Everyone I’ve talked to has said my comment wasn’t weird or too much so what the heck is going on here?

I kind of feel like he does still have feelings for me and he’s scared again - this time because he doesn’t want a relationship because of his daughter.

What do I do here? Explain what I meant?  Just give him space and see if he comes back?  I’’m hoping my joke text will put him at ease because I’m acting normal and not clingy…just kinda trying to be cute.

Btw he hasn’t blocked me on FB or anything so I don’t think he wants me gone completely.

Now I’ve been mentally healthy, physically healthy and over a different person. We hang out sometimes and talk about people we’ve dated, none of it bothers me. I see him as a really good friend and I genuinely just want to hang out with him and make music. 

So I was going to move to a new city but some friends ditched me. He later told me he was going to move to the same city but his friend ditched him. I asked if we could move together and he said it would be weird.

I do! Understand ! Where he’s coming from but it’s just disappointing for me. Like I don’t care about him in that way anymore. I don’t have many friends and I just wanted to move in with someone reliable! It just super sucks that this concept of “ex’s stay ex’s” is a thing. It’s just a title, it means nothing once you’ve moved on and matured. Once you’ve realized people are just people and not what we make them? Sure I still admire him but boundaries are a thing.

The thing is that before we got together as a couple, he was seeing two other girls. He didn't have a relationship with them, and they knew that - they were sort of ""buddy fucks"". So to say, they ""accepted"" his terms"". But when we got together, I told him that I would like to be the only one, and he said he accepted it.

One of the girls he was seeing, let's call her Marcella, was the last one he ""broke up"" with. He said that, since he had been with me, she noticed he was treating her differently, and that she proposed to call him and solve things out. As far as I know, they talked about it and she got furious, saying that he used her and etc. They said they wouln't see each other anymore, but he didn't tell her he was with me. At first, that didn't bother me, because I knew they weren't talking anymore. Now, it does. And a lot.

On his birthday (about 1 month ago), she sent him a message on Whatsapp and I saw it. She was saying happy birthday to him and saying that she'd never forget him, and then asked if there would be a party in his house. He said no, and that he was working. (Yes, I stalked his phone...)  
That got me very mad because I just think that he should have been honest with her and told her that he's with me now...

As I went through their messages, I didn't find anything suggestive. What I did find was that she mentioned she would go for a bike ride with a female friend, and he asked her if he could come the next time.

I talked to him about it the last time we saw each other. He said that there's no reason for me to be jealous because nothing would happen. I asked him why he didn't tell her he was with me - he said that he didn't have the chance, and the next time she asks him about it, he'll tell her. I didn't buy it, because it was the same thing my ex told me before cheating on me with a friend of his.

I said that I wouldn't feel comfortable with him going out with her alone, and he brought the bike ride up. He said: ""even if there's another friend with her?"". I said it was okay if they weren't alone, but I lied, of course, because I don't feel comfortable with the idea of him seeing her at all.

Before we even met, he had promised Marcella he would take her to the beach when she finished her thesis (she's doing a master's degree). I asked him if he would still go - he said he didn't know, and that if he did, it was only to keep his promise. I said I didn't like the idea and that if he were on my shoes, he wouldn't like it too. He said that he wouldn't go then. I asked him if I was being mean, and he said he didn't think so, but that I was setting hard rules. He also asked me if I wanted to go with them to the beach, and I said it'd be just ridiculous.

Even though he tells me nothing will/would happen, I don't know if I trust him. I feel bad that I look through his phone, that I see his texts, but I also don't understand why he hasn't told her he's with me... I think she still likes him, and even though he says that he wouldn't be with her, I just feel more and more jealous.

I'm even feeling paranoid. Every time he doesn't answer me, I think he's with her. When he's online and taking his time to answer me, I start to make assumptions that he's talking to her.

He also said: ""I'm with you. If I wanted to be with her, I would have been with her. There's no reason to be so paranoid"". But I don't know... I feel betrayed just by the fact that he didn't tell her about me from the first place.

The weird part is that the people who cancel on me have no issue giving me their numbers or Instagram accounts prior to cancelling, so it’s not a matter of comfortability as far as I can tell...it’s just a complete lack of follow-through.

So I just had a date with a match on Hinge, and I thought it went well. She was busy and I was fine with that, I was optimistic we'd have a second date. A few days pass and she gets back to me explaining, as I thought, that she's been busy with the moving. Cool. Nothing until the following day when she responds and informs me that she is now exclusive with somebody else. Great... 

While I'm bummed about this outcome I've come to accept that women usually have a few guys they might be dating. While I can't blame her for seeing her options, it really irks me how I can never know who else these women are seeing at the same time. The system is pretty much set up for women to be pursued by as many thirsty guys as come across them. It's just a bit depressing knowing there's a fairly good chance you're already being compared to the first second or Nth person they've seen in the past week. Getting the first opportunity seems like a strong position to find one's self in, but the odds don't work out.

So I'm left with a  unpleasant  feeling in my  gut  even though I thought her being straight up and honest about the whole situation was very nice. Still doesn't make it any easier.
