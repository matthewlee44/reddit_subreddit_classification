I’ve been burnt out many times but never thought this before. I guess it’s because I’ve gone from a conservative authoritarian religious family to a place of true progressiveness on a lot of topics. 

I’ve come to realize that life’s tough. I don’t want to be with dead weight no matter how beautiful the woman. 

I want to be with someone like me:

Driven
Fit
Worldly 
Versatile
Adventurous
Creative

It’s so weird of me to write this. 

I guess I’ve finally broken that patriarchal programming. It was tough. 

I get that being a provider is sexy, but honestly sometimes I like to be the one provided for. Chased after. Etc.

Odd thoughts for a man to have? 

Yeah the old me would’ve said I was crazy. 

Leading is tough. It’s not fun to always be thinking of the ideas &amp; looking around the corner to anticipate the client needs or whatever. 

Perhaps it’s the natural magnetism of the feminine energy that attract the world to a person. But men have that energy too. 

Why can’t I lean into it &amp; attract someone who is all about me?

She looked cute and, since in the past I have suffered from the classic inaction in the beginning of a friendship, especially if its with someone from my group of friends, I asked her out for drinks in the first or second week after she arrived to the company. Now, the reason i suffer from said inaction is because I fear the consequences that can happen to the group of friends when a relationship doesn't work inside the group. These concerns were turned to a thousand in this case because she is a coworker and everyone says that is a bad idea, but I decided to do it anyways, first because my internship is ending in a couple of months and it is very unlikely either of us will stay in the company, so there would be no consequences for my career, but also because I just wanted to improve this part of myself and act on what I feel.

&amp;#x200B;

And so we go out and we talk and I find out a lot of interests of her that makes me even more attracted to her and she seems a generally nice girl. She is intelligent, she knows her movies and tv shows and she likes to study stuff other than her field. The only ""unattractive"" things about her is that she says she likes to party sometimes and that she smokes sometimes when she is out. I hate the smell of smoke and to kiss someone who just smoked, and although I enjoy partying from time to time, its more of a once every two weeks things, but this is not really unattractive because she says the ""sometimes"" so no big deal. I think it goes out well and in the end we say goodbye with a hug (a strong one from her). So I think to myself: great, I think she likes me, I just need to take things slow and steady and hang with her more out of the office (because I won't act flirty or get close to her while we are there, I would like to keep things separate, just as any bad feelings if we had an argument as a couple or break up would stay out of the office) so that an opportunity arises and I can kiss her. After the drinks I find her on Bumble probably because we were together and I swipe her right (never matched with her after that ahah). This gives me mixed feelings because on one side i get confirmation that she is looking for someone, but on the other hand my point at this time was precisely to get with someone other than an app user for a change. 

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, even in the office we are going for lunch almost every day, and I have never seen pupils so dilated as hers when we are having a conversation and making eye contact, she has very blue eyes so it is very evident. We had mentioned that we both like to cook and to eat and so i send her a message asking if she would be up for me to cook her a dish from my country ( on second thought this might have been too early to ask her for something like this since it implies she is coming over), and she replies she never says no to food. Great. So one week or so after that I send her another message asking if she is free on the weekend to do it, and she says that unfortunately she will have a friend visiting and she probably will not be available. I say, cool let me know when you can then. Then later that week I plan a night out with some interns and she says she is coming ( this would be the same day that I invited her for the dinner) but I think, thats ok she said she might not be available, not that she wouldn't, she probably just didn't want to risk canceling last minute. We go to this party with the group and we get some complimentary drinks, which I give to her since I dont drink, and some of those glow sticks, that everyone starts to put as a bracelet. She takes one and grabs my wrist and puts it on it. Maybe cool, maybe nothing. During the party she does one or two of those dance stand offs with one of the interns and for a bunch of time, since we are in a tight spot and the guys kind of need to keep our space from being invaded by other people, she stays next to him and since he is keeping the ""zone"" he has his arm around her back. Eventually she moves to my side and and she gives me some looks while dancing, but honestly with all the interns there Idd rather wait to be alone with her to kiss her ( might just be an excuse for my lack of balls at the time). Nothing of interest happens for the rest of the night other than another great hug when we say goodbye.

&amp;#x200B;

And now last night we were having pre drinks and thats when it hit me. She doesn't just smoke sometimes, when she is out she is smoking like a chimney. Then she is having this conversation on how much easier it is for a guy to get someone in a club than for a girl to do it ( implying she tries hard but its difficult? she is pretty hot BTW) and other going out related stuff. Keep in mind that the plan was for pre drinks and then go to a club. But i noticed that whenever we are with the other interns her conversation topics are mostly about going out to clubs. And at this point i just lost my mood to go with her to the club and try something because I just realized she is a completely different person that I imagined. I realized she is this shallow person fantasizing about this ""luxury life"" and going out like there is no tomorrow. But I dont know how to concile this side of her with the intelligent and curious cute woman that I met at first. Instead of feeling ""good"" for losing interest and not being in the position of liking a coworker, I just feel empty and sad because it feels like I lost that other side of her. 

&amp;#x200B;

And now im in a kind of existential crisis, because I just feel every girl that I know (or will meet) in social circles is like her, going out, getting drunk, and im tired of the hookups. but I dont know how else to meet a potential girlfriend other than online dating, and thats a whole other monster.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,976482,public,self,"I (24M) just lost interest in the girl i liked, but it feels like i have lost someone",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pd55yi/i_24m_just_lost_interest_in_the_girl_i_liked_but/,all_ads,6,,,,,,

We were talking on the phone for a few months and then we went on 4 dates. I made a good amount of mistakes with her (acting kind of clingy by texting too much, not going for a kiss and thus confusing it into friendship, etc.) but she also has a past that she said impacts her to the day. She decided to end things after date 4 saying she prefers friendship.

I want to understand how much of it was my mistakes and how much was it her past that contributed to this not working out? She did some odd things throughout. For example, we started talking on the phone every day immediately after we met (we met online dating and she was initially long distance but then moved very close to where I live). But, then for no reason, she just stopped talking for 2 weeks. At that point, we were still talking but at a much slower pace and I thought it might be over (she later explained that bc a guy led her on from long distance, she got scared with me). However she got back to the point of showing interest again and then we went on the 4 dates. But, in the dates, she was always very guarded and it was hard to even initiate touch or hold hands or put my arm around her. There would be zero response. And then she even invited me to her place for dinner and drinks (the 4th date) but again, she wouldn't really allow touch or physical intimacy. I ultimately asked to kiss her good night after this 4th date and she said yes. Regardless, she still ultimately said she wanted friendship. Additionally, she sometimes posts things on social media about how she doesn't need a guy as long as she has her girlfriends who matter most to her.

Is it more likely that this girl was driven to friendship by my mistakes or could she be kind of scarred from past bad experiences with guys which prevents her from crossing certain emotional levels of connection? Part of the reason it became friend-y was also because she didn't let it become anything more than friends by not responding well to the flirtation and touching escalation.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,976550,public,self,What is the impact on a girl when the father is not in her life and she has had guys in the past who led her on and then abandoned?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pd5zsz/what_is_the_impact_on_a_girl_when_the_father_is/,all_ads,6,,,,,,

So i ended up having to drive two of the girls to their apartment because they needed a ride back and F22 said she would meet me at my place. For context now its like 1:30 a.m 


So i wait for a bit then while I’m chilling and waiting i call her, no answer. So i sent a text asking if she wanted me to meet her somewhere and she takes like 30 min to respond. Then says “sad datyy” i wait for more info but nothing so i ask if she is still tryna meet up then texts me saying “im dunzo”


Just fucking tell me if you don’t want to its chill. I got gps and see that you’re alone at super buff dudes apartment i can put two and two together

We used to solely meet for fooling around. Also, we used to talk about our personal life, friends and all of that. I started having feelings for him and I confessed the same. But he said he just got out of a breakup and its way too ealy to have something serious and it won't be good for both of us as we had religious differences. Since we have religious difference, it is impossible for us to have a future together, and that sucks. 


We both stay far from each other and were busy with our lives. So with time, the sex started becoming monotonous. But we still decided to keep on meeting since we were comfortable with each other and liked what we had. 


Later we stopped meeting because I felt that my needs weren't being met (and I still had feelings for him) and it's not okay for my mental health to continue all this. I used to give him emotional and financial support knowing that him and I could never be us.


I came to know from a friend that he started seeing someone from the same religious background. But he never said that. He still used to text me saying that he misses me and all of that. I never reciprocated with the same energy because I knew he's dating someone else and I thought it would be weird if i brought up this subject.


One day he texted me that he misses me alot and it wasn't for sex. He said that I think of him as someone who is 'cheapo and creepo' and as if he is some monster. He started saying sorry plenty of times and I had no clue why. He said that he really wants to see me somewhere away from the room and that he wants to be better with me and to give him another chance. I wasn't sure because I knew he was in a relationship and when I confronted him he said he was in a relationship but he broke up because there was no peace. 


When I replied him with ""im not sure"" he said ""Its okay. You dont have to. Im glad I got to talk to you and tell you how I feel""

Im 30(m) and I've been seeing this girl (27) for about 9 months now, and before I start I wanna add that I'm the only guy she has ever dated, kissed or done anything sexually with minus actual sex. So she really has no idea what she is doing dating wise or how to act around men in general.  

She originally told me she didn't want anything serious at first, and just wanted something casual. So me being the hopeful romantic just went along with it trying to be causal. Well that didn't last long, and I'm so in love with this girl I don't know what to do.

Now I've told her I like her, and she liked me too but wants to stay casual. Now she always makes sure to keep it as platonic as possible when messaging or talking with me, so as not to lead me on and be respectful to me. Which I appreciate, but she gives me so many mixed signals, and from how we fool around and the fact we do so many things as a couple that I'm just confused.   

I afraid to keep pushing and talk to her about this anymore, or even open up emotionally to her just because I never thought I could feel like this again. I don't wanna do too much and scare her away, but at the same time I don't know if can keep being casual cause I really do love her and it kills me being able to say it to her.

All summer we only went on 2 'dates' and we are both super busy until the end of October which is when we plan to get together again. We still talk over text nearly every day but I feel like the conversations are getting pretty bland and repetitive. We are both seniors in high school and we never seam to talk at school outside of a minute or two because we are both awkward when there are other people around.

There never really was chemistry between us but I liked her because she is truly something else. At this point I feel like I'm looking for more of an emotional connection not something that feels forced. I just really don't know what to do at this point..

last year we did not go to prom because she had work which was fine, but she has never really seemed to have time for 'us', I always thought that would change but so far it hasn't. We never really see each other much and when we do its weird.

I don't want to break things off because I know she is going through some mental things and also in the same friend group so that would mess things up too. Like I said, she is the perfect person in my eyes the only downside is she is very closed off and not very affectionate.

So there’s a co worker I think likes me and I like her too. We’re both 17 and here’s the story so far. I originally didn’t like her because she trash talked me to another co worker about me taking all the customers at the registers (not on purpose but I just made eye contact first). Anyway a few weeks after that I had to help her at registers and she was super friendly, I remember thinking “man she’s talking a lot for not knowing me”. But I was super dry and blunt because I was mad at her remark she made at the time. She did things like ask what time I got off and then acted disappointed when I got off before her. Before I left I had to buy something and I went to her register. When I did she said “oh hey, it’s been awhile) and smiled and had a flirty look on her. She also was messing around with me and being mean in a playful way. Like messing with me when my card didn’t work and said “well we close in 30 minutes so if you don’t get it by then idk what to tell you” but it was flirty like I said


Fast forward a few weeks later and I see her one day and I decide to put what she said behind me and kinda have a “fresh start”. I started taking to her and it went so well. I made her smile and laugh a lot and she was playing with her hair a lot. I was looking to see if she played with her hair when I wasn’t talking to her and she was but not as much. It went so well that day. The next day I worked tho she was busy and around other co workers so it was hard to talk with her. I finally wanted to at least say hi. When I did I went full blown stupid and froze and just wave. I said nothing but she did the same, waved and said nothing. For some reason I looked away and then looked back. I have no clue why. When she left I told her bye and she said it back but she didn’t seem flirty or interested at all. I thought I ruined it until today and yesterday


Yesterday she was there and I noticed she had her hair dyed. I wanted to compliment but decided not to because after last time I didn’t wanna make it worse. So I just told her good bye and she said “bye, hey did you get your hair cut?” I did so I said yeah. She said “it looks really nice”. I said “thank you!” And went on. She asked “do you work tomorrow?” I said “yeah wby?” She said “not until Thursday”. I said “I work tomorrow and Wednesday but not again until Sunday” she replied “I think I work Sunday!” I said “ok nice, see you!” And left. Today is when it gets amazing. Today she came in as a customer and checked out at my register. When she came up she was playfully being mean and stuff. I got to the screen where I couldn’t scan her discount and she said “wow do I need to do your job? I think I do, cause I will if you can’t” we both made each other smile and laugh a lot and it didn’t feel like a normal conversation, but like she was flirting the whole time. I asked her “do you need a bag?” She said “if it makes your life harder I totally need a bag”. When she went to leave she asked “you work Sunday right?” I said “yeah, you do right?” She said “yeah!” I said “nice I’ll see you then, btw I like your hair!”. So I finally complimented her new hair

I decided to have the “what are we” talk with him last night and it didn’t go very well in my opinion. He said he’s not ready for a relationship yet at this point but “likes me and enjoys spending time with me”. From everything I’ve read, that’s a red flag…. All I asked was if this is something casual to him or if he saw a possibility of a future. He said that he likes how things have been going &amp; blooming but me bringing this up feels like I’m forcing it. Said he doesn’t feel ready for a label on it &amp; that his feelings aren’t developed enough yet. He didn’t say it in a douchey way, but he was saying things like “I’m sorry I know that’s probably not what you want to hear”. He did say he’s only dating me and doesn’t want to talk to anyone else.

Should I run? :( I don’t want a label right now either but I do really like him and have developed feelings for him. The exclusivity thing was all I had really hoped to get out of the convo, which I did..but his hesitance to say there was even a possibility of a future is concerning to me.

The title says most of it, but I'll elaborate a bit.

First off, I just want to clarify that I'm not desperate, but I am losing any hope of ever finding a woman in my life. This is in large part because my social life has been very vapid for as long as I can remember. It doesn't help with the fact that I am a Highly Sensitive Person (HSP) with severe ADHD, Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria, and Aspergers. All of which have made my life in general a living hell for over a decade.

That said, the last 10 years have been utterly brutal for me overall socially. Most of my experiences and overall interactions with most women I've come across have been for a lack of a better term, either utter shit or lackluster. Even with girls who have been friends of mine, they eventually ghost me in the end, regardless if I'm on good terms with them. The last one who decided to ghost me was a former college classmate and buddy of mine. In the dating world, most interactions I've had have been IRL and I've never had my feelings returned. I've gone for older women and younger women, fat and skinny, it doesn't matter. At bars, the women have been vicious and rude.. and I don't understand it at all.

This kind of behavior prompted me to look in other communities and I didn't meet any success there either. I've tried to go out with foreign women, but when that happened, I got either stood up or burned. Granted, these women were living in America and/or were Americanized, so maybe I'll still give the ones overseas the benefit of the doubt..

Keep in mind that nearly all of my dating experience has been IRL and not online. I don't even bother with dating apps because they go nowhere.

I have repeatedly taken breaks from the dating world every now and then. 2011-2014 were the years that I really tried. 2018-2019 and then early 2020 were when I tried again, but to no success.

At this point, I have no clue what to do. I'm slightly above average-looking I've always come across as kind, chill/relaxed and confident in myself. Yet, I can never get what I yearn for.. I want to be married and have a family of my own one day, but I honestly don't know if I will ever find it here in America..

She had gotten out of a six year relationship a year ago and she said our situation is ideal for her as dating is something that makes her anxious and nervous so getting to know each other over the next several weeks before we actually meet would help her be less anxious and nervous about it. We have a fair bit in common and have talked about her showing me around when we get there and all the places we want to go. We’ve also been very open about things like non-negotiables, what we want in our partner, stuff like that. 

Anyways, even though we’ve had really good, productive conversations so far, and I will say even though she’s always responsive and seems engaged in conversation, she’s a very dry texter. I don’t just want to call her out on it and come off as rude as I really do like her and can’t wait to actually meet her, but figuring out where to go next, and then having to do that for four more weeks is honestly kind of tiring.

We had one phone call on Wednesday night, where I felt like he was pretty tipsy. I knew he was coming home from a boy's night (on a weekday for some reason), and on the call there was something a bit off. He shouted at a passerby who allegedly said something racist to him, he kept talking over me and interrupting me. But still, I was like let me give him a chance. We agreed for a date on Saturday afternoon / today. 

Yesterday night I video called him on my way home from dinner, as I was a bit intimidated as men kept cat calling me or staring at me. We talk for a good few hours even once I get home. Here he's a bit more calm, he's indoors because the night before he said he had another huge night out and he was nursing a hangover. This time we talk properly about our spiritual journeys and professional goals, and we have things in common. On this call, he discusses a date again for the next day. He mentions he will pick a museum before we go out for a late lunch for our date. Nothing is confirmed but we hang up around midnight and I go about my day. 

So today comes around. And I hear nothing from him until half 2 ish when he asks if I'm bringing a handbag with me. At this point, for me the date isn't happening. I have a standard *when someone invites me on a date, they should be confirming a few hours ahead, the time, location and whether everything is still ok*. He didn't, so when he checked in, I said no. He called me, and he got angry, swore at me and then called me a flakey fucker. 

I know I could have confirmed with him, but he asked me out. The good manners I look for is the person who asked me out, for whom I cancelled other plans, should be checking in, confirming time and location a few hours before or I'm not going. This person didn't tell me where I'm going, which museum we were supposed to be going. It was a bit weird. 
For me, when it comes to online dating, I'm trying to be as cautious as possible and any thing that remotely wastes my time or fails to uphold the traditional standard i.e. you should check in ahead of the set time to let me know where I am going, isn't for me. This is both due to safety and because it's just respecting my time imo.

I’m not sure if anyone else has had this problem. For me, when I start to feel the blossoming of a new relationship my mind goes hyperactive thinking of ways it won’t work out in the long term. This can be really frustrating as I tend to really sabotage potential relationships with my own anxiety. 


My brain just thinks things like “you won’t grow with him.” “He is too ____” “he has ____” and mind you, these would usually be valid concerns if you knew the person well enough to formulate those opinions. I really want to try and give things a try but I think I’m so scared of it not being “the perfect match” (wether or not that even exists) to give anyone a try. I also think I’m just scared of breakups in general but, I don’t know. I am scared of wasting my time when life can be so short.

But, she is coming to see me in 4 weeks time, which is great!   

I would love to send her some flowers, and I'm sure she would enjoy the flowers and the gesture.  The only issue I have is she never gave me her address.  I found it quite easily online, but I think maybe that will feel creepy, but I do love the surprise nature of sending a gift.

A few other notes.  I know generally where she lives (she's from my hometown) and have seen her apartment on video chat, etc.  It's not as if she has been hesitant to share with me.   But as someone who is quite adept at using the internet I realize that often people don't understand how easy addresses can be found and it comes off as if I invested time &amp; energy to find out this seemingly private info.

I mean I always make an effort to send longer messages and ask questions and all I get are short, dry answers and stuff like ""ahahahahah yeah"" which leaves me with nothing to say

And the other thing is, I don't feel like this happens to other friends of mine. They manage to have conversations with these women (honestly, from the little I've seen, these don't seem that interesting either, but at least they're answering properly)

It was going really well and despite the age gap of around 4 years we were really compatible with each other. Right one year ago on 4th of September to be precise, she told me that she is bisexual and is in love with a girl. Before I could discuss the scenario with her, she broke up with me and blocked me completely out of her life. It was a big breakdown for me as all of this happened within a week's time and I was destroyed completely. I started taking therapy and slowly started to normalise my life again. When I think of it, I do feel i should have supported her during that time. Her sexuality wasn't a problem for me but the fact that she liked someone else than me freaked me out and maybe that created some tension!
Today it's almost one year to that and I can say I have 50-60% recovered from that trauma of breakup. Yes I do have a lot of friends but being in a relationship for 4 years I do feel alone on that part. I feel there should be someone by my side to support me and stuff. I have thought of it but being committed again scares me because of what I have been through. I am really confused about what to do. Also I don't have much of girl friends so that's the other scenario as well! And I don't know whether the dating apps are a good way to do it. What should I do?

i would think it is similar to school/ work due to regularly meet up schedule, but then again I may be wrong.

I graduated from college, i've worked a few years, took time off for myself... really didn't meet many people, so it goes without saying i didn't meet any women

anyways i am now 30, and i am thinking about joining some classes i am interested in. of course if i meet someone nice that'd be great but I am doing it mostly because i enjoy the class and i want to meet new people.

anyone who went this route and got success? activity groups could be anything like a running club, a sports league recreational, craft &amp; arts, movie night, whatever

were the people generally closed off to the idea? I generally find the people there to be much more on the older side (ironic, because i am old too!) but they likely married , either just moved to a new city and not out looking for dates/flings/relationship.

Whenever things are going smoothly and calmly in the relationship, we have these small petty arguments about things that's often caused by miscommunication. Despite having very open and honest communication, these things still happen sometimes. I've always been a very private guy when it comes to my emotions and feelings

When she goes through hardships and bad times, I am always there to show my support and cheer her up. This is anything from flowers, to supportive texts. She has always been open about her feelings, but this being my first relationship, I find it quite difficult to do. She feels that I am always there for her, but she is never there for me when I need it.

Recently, things in my personal life have taken a turn.  When I was grieving, I told her what would help me cope and she tried her best despite being busy herself. A part of me is always hesitant to come out or text her how I'm feeling during the week, because  she is usually very stressed with work and I don't want to be a burden to her with my issues.

She told me that she feels that I am not open enough with my feelings to her and this has led her to not wanting to share her own with me. She thinks that I do not want to confide in her during my time of need. When I told her that I find it hard to communicate about my feelings past the usual ""I'm good"" and ""I'm feeling meh"", and that I need help being more open about it, she told me that it's as if we are not serious and that she feels reluctant sharing her feelings with me because of it. Even when I really am feeling ""fine"" and I tell her, she suspects that there is more I'm feeling.

At times, I just don't really feel in touch with my feelings myself and despite loving her, it's hard for me to communicate it with her. This is ruining my relationship.

TL;DR: I find it difficult to express my feelings openly in my relationship.

So through that he received my number and he would text me things like ""did you take your walk hun?"" And I'll be like ""yes"" and he will respond with ""good girl"" and that smirking emoji this one 😏.  He has now called me good girl three times over text and I don't know if this is how he talks?? But the only time I heard someone call me good girl over and over was my Ex during bedroom activities. He also asked for a selfie to see if I was getting better and I declined. This is weird. I obviously don't want to overreact but I would like to get ppls views. His gf is out of town for work and I don't want to disturb her rn. For what it's worth I love in the South USA and hun isn't a huge deal typically only women say it though so I'm confused and he isn't even from the south. I'm 23 my friend is 25 he is 33
