As requested by u/throoowwitalllawaaay

I made a general list of red flags in women. Every situation is different.  Not every red flag necessarily means the relationship is doomed, sometimes you need to just work around it. This isn't an all inclusive list, and can usually work for both genders, but I was requested to make one specifically for women. 

**If she isn't responding/engaging in conversation** - She's most likely not interested, and if she is, is it really *worth* it? If a girl wants to talk to you, she WILL. Nobody waits days to answer someone they're genuinely interested in. 
**If she's obsessed with you** - This might seem great at first, but can turn south quick. Codependency is not healthy, and can create a foundation for control, manipulation, and abuse later on.  It's better to have a life outside of your relationship, rather than let your life revolve around it. 
**Always expects you to pay/bad with money** - This might not be an issue right away, but can come back to bite you in the ass in the long run. How can you build a future if your partner can't stop spending? How do you feel about being the breadwinner? Why should it be *your* responsibility to pay for everything? 
**My exes are psycho** - This one take with a grain of salt, because sometimes people legitimately just have bad luck dating and reading people. But in a lot of situations there's one common denominator and a reason their relationships ended badly. So stay on your toes. 
**She slaps/hits you if she's upset** - Physical violence is NEVER okay in a relationship, man or woman. If your date/SO hurts you in some way, run. If they do it once, it's likely it will happen again, and could be *much* worse. 
**She makes her mental health your problem** - A lot of people legitimately have mental health issues, but it is not okay to make them someone else's responsibility. You shouldn't have to tiptoe around them all of the time. If they can't handle their emotions on a day to day basis, they have no business being in a relationship. If they ever ever ever say ""if you leave me, I'll kill myself"", run like the wind. Contact police, family, whoever you need to, to get them the help they need. But that's the end of your responsibility. That is nothing but an abuse/control tactic and is never okay. 
**Showers you with gifts and affection, but uses it against you** - This one is tricky. Have you ever heard of ""love-bombing""? Basically, someone will shower you with affection, but use it against you later. ""I did XYZ for you, and you can't appreciate it?"" You didn't ask for it, you don't owe them anything. It's manipulation. 
**Makes fun of you for humor** - She'll joke about your flaws or make rude comments, but say ""babe it was just a joke"". There's always some truth behind every one, and a lot of people will use humor as an excuse to make fun of you/complain about you. If it hurts your feelings, it was probably meant to even though she said it wasn't. Don't encourage those mind games. If it's a one off situation it might be an honest mistake, but if it's reoccurring, run. 
**She's always picking a fight** - As much as people like to say ""relationships are work"", they shouldn't be like this. Relationships really should be a source of stress relief. If everything you do is a problem to her, you need to find someone where it isn't. You shouldn't have to fight for a relationship, it should come naturally. 
**She doesn't say what she means** - This is a big issue I hear talked about a lot. ""Women never say what they mean"". That just means she has poor communication skills and expects you to just read her mind. Nobody is a mind reader, and relationships don't work without communication. I *promise* you that the women out there who are worth it, *will* tell you exactly what they want. How are you supposed to know unless she tells you? That's not fair to you.
**She plays the poor me act** - Some people are truly down on their luck. But for some they use it as a tool to manipulate you. They just need some help back on their feet, but never seem to actually get back on their feet. They're usually just using you as a meal ticket. 
**She only talks about her ex** - Sometimes this is unavoidable if they've spent years of their life with an ex. However, this is often a sign they are not over them or might be comparing you to them. You shouldn't have to compete for your partner. 
**She isn't consistent** - If some days she's super interested, and other days she's not. She might be working, might have other commitments, but watch for patterns. If she's hot and cold all of the time, you might not be the only one on her radar. If she does have other commitments, are you okay with working around those?

You might be thinking, well how do I find a woman that doesn't have any of these red flags? If it were easy, everyone would be in great relationships. But it's not.  Sometimes you need to sift through *hundreds* of women before you find her. It is not worth dating someone who doesn't give you the love and affection you deserve. Again, this list does not include *all* red flags, but just some major ones I see come up a lot. 

I can't link anything here, but look of different types of emotional abuse tactics. 
Read them, get familiar with them, and save yourself some hurt in the future. 

Remember, you never are obligated to stay in a relationship. Their life is NOT your responsibility. Take care of yourself first.

One day he sent me a funny video, but it was my brother's birthday and he has recently passed, so I told him I wasn't really in a laughing mood and told him that it was my brother's birthday and he died last year. 

His response was ""well, it's been two years since I've had my heart trampled on"" (she had changed her mind about loving him, and that wasn't fair) 

I'm just not sure how to get him to stop updating me on his daily life and trying to pressure me to hang out. I'm dealing with a lot of health issues and need space. And telling him that doesn't seem to mean anything to him, it just starts him on his own rant. And he also acts like I should feel lucky that he's willing to let a bit of his wall down for me.

I think the dating power balance could be described as:

1950s and before: Men had most power.
1980s to early 2000s: Men and women had equal power.
2010 forward: Women have almost all the power.

Dating apps have given women a monopoly of control over the dating market.

I (38M) recently started seeing someone (27F) I met on a dating app. We’ve been on two dates and the banter/chemistry is good. I have my doubts about dating someone that much younger than me, but we’ve been on two dates and the attraction/banter/chemistry have been good enough to keep me interested. There have been a couple flags that have come up, mostly having to do with what she’s looking for  in a relationship e.g, long term vs short term, monogamous vs poly, etc. I think these are pretty black and white preferences, but her answers weren’t all that clear. At any rate, I figured that’s okay for now since we’re still getting to know each other. 

Anyways, we got into some pretty heavy kissing and petting on our second date. There’s definitely some good sexual chemistry between us and it took a lot of willpower for both of us not to let things go too far. The following day we chatted over text and both said we were excited to see each other again. Things got weird later when she said “bummer your parents snipped ya.” I was wearing some hiking pants that leave little to the imagination when I’m aroused I guess. She then told me she prefers uncircumcised men and that she is pretty “anti,” and as a medical professional would never perform a snip on a child. 

One of the things that attracted me to her in the first place was her candor but I’m kind of at a loss now. We all have our preferences, but this doesn’t seem like something to say to a potential partner or even someone you’re in a serious relationship with. I think it’d be analogous to telling a large breasted woman I prefer small breasts, which I would never do. I’ve never felt self-conscious about being naked around a partner but her comment makes me feel kind of like she was body shaming me or something. 

I’m considering just calling things off with her, but wonder if I’m overreacting. Maybe she slipped up because we’re already pretty open with each other? At the same time, I’m not sure if I’d ever be able to think that she’s not somewhat disappointed by my body.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,972890,public,nsfw,Personal preference vs. body shaming??,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pbflry/personal_preference_vs_body_shaming/,promo_adult_nsfw,3,,,,

We settled on getting sushi and Ice cream after. During dinner he turned out to be really cool We talked about all our travels, family background, work etc. Our conversation flowed smoothly. We talked about interests music, TV shows We liked. It went really well. We got ice cream then he invited me back to his place. 

Once I got to his place he introduced me to his new puppy and we talked and played with his dog for hours. I was sitting on his computer chair and he was sitting on the end of his bed.. He asked me what kind of music I wanted to listen to and played it on the speaker. 

With all the talking we did none of it was sexual. But after sitting across from each other in his room after hours of talking there was def some sexual tension going on. And we did end the night off with an adult activity. 

Anyways after all that I never knew what his work schedule was like. Our date was Sunday night. I stayed at his place all the way up to 6pm Monday. I thought to myself wait when does he work?"" He then told me he works 7pm-7am Monday-Friday and doesn't work weekends. 

Basically before I left he's all next time I'll give you the wifi password and told me when I find out my next schedule to let him know and we will get together sometime. 

So a few days go by and midweek he asks how I've been doing and I told him that work has been pretty rough and he asked what my schedule was like. We talked a little back and forth. I told him that I'm off Tuesday and Wednesday. And that I get out at 4 on Sunday etc. And he never replied and it's been 5 days.

We're both looking for the same thing (relationship that will lead to marriage), but there are a few things I'm looking for that she doesn't have and not sure if I should try to pursue something with her or just have her as a good friend. So here's the pros and cons of this girl.

Pros:

\-She comes from a 2 parent household with strong masculine and feminine role models

\-She's nerdy

\-She's kind 

\-She's virtuous and possibly a virgin (claims she's saving herself for marriage)

\-She's not covered in ink

\-She doesn't have a sailor's mouth

\-She's short and petite

\-She wants to be a stay at home mom

\-She strongly believes in monogamy

\-She dresses modestly

\-She doesn't pursue constant male validation and doesn't post anything trashy on social media and isn't on any dating app.

Cons:

\-She's insecure

\-She's a little selfish and self centered

\-She has a bad spending habit

\-Though she's thin, she's borderline anorexic

\-She doesn't know how to cook and expresses very little to no interest in learning

\-Learning about her dating history, possibly due to her insecurities she picks fun of her dates which caused her ex to dump her, and she constantly over compliments celebrities and fictional characters she's crushing on with little to no compliments towards those she dates or are involved with

&amp;#x200B;

I had asked her out on an official date which she said yes to, however because of my mixed feelings I went back on the date offer and instead mentioned that we should be just friends, however she looked a little hurt and instead I back peddled gave her the option to date or just be friends, which she decided we should be just friends and that she likes me but I'm nearing 30 and she's nearing 22 and doesn't like the age gap.

We hung out recently as just friends and talked about goals that we had and she opened up a lot more including family drama. We talked about kids and I told her why I haven't had any despite being 30 next month and told her that I tend to go for character because ""looks fade"" (not directed at her) and that I dodged a lot of toxic bullets because of that mindset. She tried hyping up herself saying that she doesn't have to worry about that, that she's got good morals and that she's got a baby face so she'll age slowly. It almost sounded as if she was hinting at why she'd make a good partner. Our hugs have been getting longer and I'm not gonna lie I have thought of just shooting my shot and kissing her, but it's the mixed feelings that have stopped me from doing so, also I'm moving to another state and know how rare long distance relationships ever work out.

So if you were on my boat, what would you do? Would you down play the cons and try to start something or would you wait for a better option to appear despite them having a lot that you're looking for?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,972959,public,self,I like her but have had mixed feelings throughout our friendship,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pbgsyk/i_like_her_but_have_had_mixed_feelings_throughout/,all_ads,6,,,,

We shared umbrellas and ate together outside many times, I even wiped food off her face. After we finished studying in the library she would always be able to come up with some excuse for us to spend more time together, whether she needed to buy something or wanted to see something cool together before she went home.

Before i myself went on vacation i decided to ask her out on an “official” date for when we both got back.

She was uncharacteristically flustered for a good minute or two, and said she didn’t want to say yes because she didn’t know when she’d be back from her vacation home. That itself is fine, but then she said me asking her out was very unexpected, and she had no clue I had felt this way about her, even though her friends knew about my interest months ago. She also said she valued our friendship?Overall awkward asf, and she ended the facetime with a have fun on vacation or something like that.

I’m trying to enjoy vacation rn, but i’m confused as fuck. This is the longest we’ve gone without any form of communication since we met as well. Idk if I should text her or what? I seriously thought we had already been dating in a sense and have no clue how to proceed.

I wasn't/still am not ready to jump into a relationship, but I am interested in feeling this out more with this girl. She knows that because I told her. 

Our last conversation 3 weeks ago wasn't the best. She had been dialing back on talking to me as much, since she used to FaceTime, text, and call me all the time. She was giving me a lot of attention and I got used to it. When things started changing and being one sided, I voiced my concern to her

She said she needed space. I asked her if she wanted to cut ties or if she just wanted space, and that I would leave her alone. She got a little annoyed and said ""I've literally said it already. I just want space rn. Thank you."" So I gave it to her. Went no contact for 3 weeks 

Last night, after my band's rehearsal and maybe getting a little baked, I saw a text from her at like 11pm. She texted me saying ""hi stranger, season 3 of Manifest is out !""

I've been thinking about her a lot during the no contact period. Just some self improvement things I need to work on, and i missed her. Seeing that text from her was almost off putting because I was pretty zoinked from my delta 8 pen and didn't wanna deal with it at the time. 

I don't know why she texted me or what this means. I'd like to talk to her again and pick up where we left off maybe, it's just a little unexpected because I thought she would never text me again.

Hey,

Recently I've met F24 in my university, she asked me out to park (it wasn't romantic). She is a bit unique in the sense that she isn't shy at all, it is extremely easy to approach people for her, and she is very straightforward (sometimes it is borderline rude).

We were talking about each other, and she has told me that I am boring 40 years old. Honestly, I was surprised as thought of myself as erudite but socially dull. 

I've mentioned to her that girls are not important for me, and I want to study extremely hard, almost torturing myself to achieve high grades, and later on, have an excellent job with a lot of money.  The justification of that was that if I work hard on myself and have a lot of money the girls will chase me instead of the other way around.   
Also, I don't drink, don't do drugs and don't smoke. As it may fire back on me. My family had a lot of alcohol abuse, and it is an extremely sensitive topic for me that I didn't mention to her or to anyone. The thought of drinking a bottle of beer is already disturbing for me. 

I am reserved and introverted, although I dress well and it isn't a problem to have a good conversation with someone.

I met her through work in february through work and what started off as just a bit of fun with talking on the phone slowly evolved into a really strong connection, we meet for the first time 30 march and after the second date we spoke out to eachother that we like eachother. I always have a hard time opening up but she did not mind and was willing to wait, two weeks later i slept at her place and we slept together. Until that point everything was great between us until a week later she said she does not know if it just friendly between us or romantic. I told her it would be hard for me as i do have those romantic feelings, She just had some doubts about it, some moments she did had attraction towards me and sometimes she did not.

As time progressed we remained friends, still talking on the phone everyday, telling eachother everything going on in our lives and she frequently said things like she is really happy that she has me in her life and that she needs me. But as time progressed it also was harder for me at times. Especially if she was hanging out alone with her guy "" friends"".

I was feeling jealous and really questioning my own self worth/ respect at times. I know i just should have go NC the moment she friendzoned me, but yeah stupid me.

But i was becoming more distant from her to just protect myself and 3 weeks ago she send me a messages that she really misses me and did not thought our bond would ""break"" this quickly. I told her i miss her aswell but from the moment she told me she just wants to be friends a lot had changed because i really thought we were building something more then just friends. she did not respons on my reaction.

For the last 3 weeks our conversations are really dry and it feels forced. I got a snapchat from her last week from her that she was taking a drive with her ex, which she always complained about to me and talked alot about when we were ""dating"" in hindsight it maybe meant she was not over him still. But since she send that snap i did not contacted her and it has been 3 days now.

I need some advice on what to do next, should i stay no contact or should i contact her? i have to be honest and tell you all i am having a hard time, also because she is undergoing surgery coming thursday and i want to be for her, but on the other hand it is hard to be in her life as just a friend",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,973002,public,self,"I need advice, no contact or not?",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pbho7x/i_need_advice_no_contact_or_not/,all_ads,6,,,,

I‘ve been talking to a guy for a month and we instantly clicked and we texted several hours per day until one day his attitude towards me changed. But then something happened and he felt really down and I was there for him and it felt like we grew closer again for a few days at least (even closer than before). After a few days he started to be weird again and I finally asked him why he‘s like that. He told me he texted with another girl before he got to know me, but then they kinda lost contact and afterwards he got to know me. Of course they started to have contact again when he started being weird and said he doesn‘t know what to do, like when we both talked, it felt extremly real and genuine and he even said things that pointed to him having feeling for me, but after hearing the story I’m just confused.

I’m currently feeling hopeless because I’m never able to attract the right person. There’s either no chemistry or they just eventually end up ghosting. Most are guys that really have nothing much going for them, at least they seem decent enough to strike up a good conversation with, but the potential partner qualities just aren’t there.
You end up getting used more often than not and usually the frustration of finding a mate is more aggravation than it’s worth.
And when I do find someone attractive, everything is great up until they start to talk, which reveals they are extremely shallow and that gets annoying/disappointing fast.

I get that maybe I’m not the greatest catch in the world but I do have a lot to offer. 

Interesting conversation, consistency, a loving home, stability, etc. 

A positive attitude to go with it. But that’s slowly starting to change.

I would consider myself very feminine in appearance and behavior but I can be a bit outspoken whenever I feel like I need to get my point across..

Why do I always get hit on by the unattractive, weak men? It may sound a little harsh but I’m honestly sick of getting pursued by the undesirable.. Is there something I can do to change this? Or is it inevitable?

They usually live with their parents, socially-awkward, no money, effeminate, no assertive nature, etc.

I follow up a week later and she's been just ghosting me. I waited a week for her to reply and nothing. Extremely unusual as she typically responds almost instantly to all my messages.

Afterwards she's been orbiting everything I do on social media and it's getting frustrating. I was thinking of texting directly to see what's up as we've been mainly messaging on social media. But I think that wouldn't help.

We met when we were 19 in college, through a mutual mentor and ended up working together and starting a club with some friends in college. We started off normally and went from acquaintances to friends, but towards the end (I'm a year ahead in school) when I had graduated and was in our college town working a year before grad school and he was a senior in college, I started getting this vibe from him and from a lot of people who know us that he was into me. 

What I mean:

He always hugged me whenever we saw each other but never does that with anyone else; he would always ask if I'm seeing someone (""who's the lucky guy,"" etc.), says I remind him of his mom, liked all my stuff on Facebook, the friends in the club we started all asked us if we're together and say they can't imagine us without each other.

He never made a move and I hate missed connections so (since we're both from California), I invited him to the county fair in my town in the summer when we were both back, a no pressure thing, for fun and to kind of feel things out. He drove 150 mi to get there, insisted on picking me up, and we hung out all night, but again, no move. I tried one more time to get a sense of what's between us and asked him via text if he thought that was a date, and he said no, and we left it there.

We both went to law school on opposite coasts, and were busy and didn't talk for a few years but got back in touch in late 2019 right before the pandemic because there was some stuff going on in my family and I needed a character letter of recommendation. 

It's been 10 years and as long as I've known him it is so easy between us when we're together. But also as long as I've known him he always has a different girl, and they are most always dysfunctional (e.g. one of them made him wear lifts in his shoes to be taller). I happened to be in the same city as him 2 weeks after his breakup with the last one and he tried to make a move on me (we had dinner, he wanted to meet for breakfast the next day and show me around the shopping area near his office, and then texted me on New Years to see what I was up to)

When he did that, I brushed him off by talking about how crazy things have been with the family, because I didn't like that he tried to use me as a rebound or to indiscriminately fill a space in his life of ""generic girlfriend."" 

He has trauma in his past and we have a lot of childhood stuff in common and I had really started to like him towards the end of college and haven't been able to shake the feelings all these years later. Whenever I see him and I have a bf he seems annoyed and changes the subject. 

Now it's about 1.5 years later since we last saw each other and we just spoke about something he and our old group of friends are helping me with, and he told me he's moving in with the latest girlfriend after only dating for 7 months and they are looking at rings. She is the type who has 70 billion selfies on social media and is slightly manipulative and I really care about him and don't want him to end up with someone bad or who's a narcissist.

I’m 23 and recently started a new job and one of the girls starting with me is 17. We were paired off during group interview stuff and then kind of sat next to each other and got talking on the first kind of day. I was naturally trying to be as friendly as possible because, well obviously you want to get along with your workmates, and I’ve been in her position before entering your first big job and I knew it can be daunting so I wanted to make sure she was comfortable and didn’t feel awkward.

Anyway, during the first day I noticed she was gravitating towards me all the time, even when we weren’t paired off. And during conversation she started dropping hints that I would usually take as a girl being interested in me. Now, it could be perfectly innocent, but she started saying she would give me lifts to work, she was talking about how we should grab a drink to ‘celebrate’ the fact I’m leaving my old job, she messaged me on Facebook starting conversations and asking how I am and when I’ll be in work with her and stuff. It was all just a bit much after knowing someone for a couple of hours. I’m not an idiot; I could tell she was trying to get us to hang out outside of work and trying to kick something off beyond being work colleagues, but it’s deeply uncomfortable for me for the obvious fact of how young she is. 

I’ve never really been in this position before. Girls my own age never really take notice of me and I’m never the one being pursued. I’m really noticing a trend as I get older of girls around 4-6 years younger than me being attracted to me and it makes me feel really uneasy. I have a baby face but I’m still an older guy, so I think for them it’s like the best of both worlds; I look their age but have a bit more maturity or whatever. I’m not used to being given attention like this in general, but especially when it’s unwanted and uncomfortable for me like this. 

She’s basically been trying to message me all for a few days and I’ve been replying really slowly as not to encourage it, but beyond that I don’t have a clue how to handle this. I need to sensitively out it across to her that this is never going to happen. But she’s 17, she’s young, stupid little crushes like this can feel really intense and make you emotionally vulnerable at that age, etc., the last thing I want to do is upset her by ignoring her and making my job awkward. But, at the same time, I do not want to entertain it for a second and give her any ideas. I just don’t know how best to do that. I need to be friendly towards her, but not so friendly that she gets the wrong idea like she seems to be doing right now.

So, how can I handle this and make sure she sensitively, but firmly is sure that this will never happen? It’s hard putting your foot down like that going into a new job. And, I suppose in more general terms, why am I always attracting younger girls and how can I stop that? It’s a trend I don’t like; a little younger is fine, but obviously when they’re teenagers it becomes really uncomfortable to have to deal with, doubly so in a work situation.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,973364,public,self,A girl at my new job who’s only 17 seems to have a crush on me; how do I sensitively handle her advances while making sure she knows this will never happen?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pbnjcw/a_girl_at_my_new_job_whos_only_17_seems_to_have_a/,all_ads,6,,,,

Title says it all really. I'm 32, gay and male. Last year I went through a really rough breakup. Basically, my ex boyfriend got me excited to go out on my  birthday for dinner, proceeded to dump me after dinner, tell me he only spent time with me out of pity and was two timing me with someone else. He has never acknowledged this or apologized for his behavior and the only contact since has been about 6 texts two months ago. For context, my ex had been watching my social media posts regularly and I called him out on it and implied it made me uncomfortable. I don't want him back in my life in any capacity, so that's not what i'm looking for. 

I stayed single for the entire past year, for a few reasons. 1. I was (understandably) upset about the breakup, 2. I was questioning my own ability to judge character of others and 3. I wanted to focus on myself and meeting personal goals.

In the past year, I finished grad school, lost 20lbs, got featured in a spotify podcast, sold my home, moved out of my hometown to Dallas, Texas, got a full-time remote job with the mickey mouse company, started stock investing and just bought a new 2022 Honda car.

Sounds top of the world, right? Yeah, but i'm not excited to date at all. I have Hinge and Bumble on my phone and have a few dates lined up, but i'm not excited for this. Maybe it's leftover feelings of annoyance from last years fun breakup? Maybe i'm jaded from constatly feeling like people are a waste of time? Who knows? 

Anyone have any tips or suggestions?

tl;dr: I had a bad breakup last year, am starting to put myself back into the dating world, but am unexcited.

Anyway I told him this and said it's not going anywhere and for him to message if he wants to meet. He replied with 'i agree and yes I'll message if I'm your way' impling that if he happens to be in my city (unlikely) he'll message. But that's very different to actively coming to see me.

But then, he said he felt sad and disappointed and wasn't expecting to feel that way and is now mad, not talking to me. Is this a red flag? Is this justifiable? We're both technically single, not exclusive but very much enjoy each other's company and want to see where it goes.

I am 34(F). I have been single for 12yrs. (The first two were healing years after an unhealthy relationship). 

I have been in the dating scene for 10 years. With the exception of cooling off periods when it becomes “too much”. 

The only guys that I get messages from are guys who want to be friends with benefits. I politely but firmly respond every time telling them that I am dating for a relationship not interested in a FWB. Many disappear but many have tried to convince me to agree to it.

I’m ready to give up. I have put serious thought and effort into improving myself in all areas of my life, dating included. My dating life is breaking me. I’m embarrassed and feel like such a failure.

I feel like my only options are being alone or settling for a constant line of FWB’s while waiting for one of them to eventually deign to invite me to have an emotional connection. I feel like I’m forever chasing the elusive relationship carrot. I’m exhausted and find myself getting increasingly angry, and just wanting to give up for good.
