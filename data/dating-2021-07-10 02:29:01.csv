2,oheeoe,1625902942,Always afraid of showing physical near in public,"So I met this girl already two times, and I think we definitely vibe together. At least there are visible signs of affection on both sides.

But we are both very unexperienced and therefor a bit ""slow"" to take the next steps. We doesn't had much body contact at our dates (just hugs at the beginning and at the end of the dates), but I suddenly feel the ""wish"" to. So in my mind I think I should start to just hold her hand or something like that.

But the problem is, that I constantly have the fear to be seen. Long time ago I also had these anxiety when I just walk next to a girl. The good thing is, I made a therapy and therefor most of these anxieties are gone. But I'm getting very anxious when I think about trying to hold her hands in public, for example.

Arrived home we talked, she kept me company on phone while I was walking outside, we have a lot in common. 

2 weeks have passed and I went back to visit her, she was ok in meeting up. Seen her yesterday in a dress(damn she was beautiful), we talked, grabbed a glass of wine, eat and I walk her way home. While walking I tried to see if I can make her come close to me, to hug her or something but it felt that she quickly goes back to where she was. Arrived in front of her place I ordered an Uber, she stayed with me until the car arrived and hugged her. Felt like just a casual night not date. We talked that is hard to meet people this days with common interest and we have pretty similar interests (both in IT, want to travel, sports, stocks, technology and I see we are compatible and talking goes really smooth)

Today I am going hiking with her and another 2 friends, was thinking of asking her after the trip to another dinner or something. Want to talk to her and maybe say that I like her company and I would like to know her better and see what is her approach.

I don't usually meet new people, I am a little shy, but with her everything goes smooth. Would like to visit more often but would also like to know if there is a spark and something on her end. 

Hope it goes well, but I feel like I was just a good company and nothing more, feeling a little down.

8,ohfeo2,1625908285,Not MY supervisor,"Okay, so I work at a Walmart. This guy is not my direct supervisor, he is a supervisor from a different department. I obviously have a crush on the guy that’s why I’m asking this. But how can I tell if someone is flirting or is into me in this type of situation, where he isn’t my supervisor but we see each other A LOT and talk. 
Whenever I can’t find stuff I go to the very back and he is always helping me find the item even when I don’t ask him specifically. Sometimes I do when he’s the only one around cause I’m shyish. He comes by to talk to me quite a lot while I’m doing my work and kinda hangs around for a bit kind awkwardly standing there but talking to me until I have to go basically. 
Recently I was in the break room and this girl that knows I have a crush on him said something along the lines of “your boyfriend this or that”(which annoyed me from her) in front of this other coworker of ours whom is in my department and that other coworker was like what boyfriend and I immediately said I don’t have one blah blah and she wanted to know who I have a crush on and I was like it’s probably obvious and she said I think I know who. Earlier that day he had come over when me and her were doing something and was “talking to us”. Well she said his name and said he was staring at me and kind of smirked at me. That day the coworker from my department stayed later too because SHE asked him if she could but that day he came over just to ask me. And the academy trainer for his department had us each do two separate things when he saw me he came over to help me but didn’t help her. 
Another note is he is always asking me to stay later after my department is done to help him in his department and I swear he always has me do menial stuff. And is basically with me the entire time so we work together. 
He asked me about music tastes and asked me if I’m from the area(I’m barely two months into working there) I said yes and he asked what schools I went to. 
Just the other day he asked me to stay an hour overtime even though he had his entire team. I told him I came in at a certain time and he said he did too that it was okay doing the overtime. And then he said please I need you. Like I said he had more than enough people in his department. 
The reason I’m explaining all this is because I dense as hell usually. And can never read signs properly. I don’t know if he’s just friendly and helpful or if he likes/is flirting with me.

9,ohfh99,1625908685,Caught in a fix,"Hello everyone. This is my first post here, and I don’t really know how this subreddit works but I thought I’d vent here and say things I haven’t told anyone very openly.
There’s this girl I’ve known for four years now. We’ve had a “will they/won’t they” sort of tango going since the very beginning. She’s way too shy and awkward about these things, and she hasn’t once said it to my face but it is really obvious to everyone that she likes me. A LOT. I realize that if you’re just reading this you might think I’m assuming things and I totally understand that (I would have thought the same) but way too much has happened to convince me and some others that she’s madly in love with me. Instead of saying things up front, she insinuates and drops hints everywhere. She’s told me that I’m the kind of guy she likes, that I’m the only guy she’s every known who doesn’t mistreat her or who isn’t trying to get close to her simply because of the way she looks (she is easily the most beautiful girl I’ve ever seen in my life), she cried on the phone when I told her that I wasn’t going to ask her out, and she has at least once tried to get me to kiss her. Sounds strange I’m sure but it’s true.
What about me? Well that’s where it gets confusing. On the one hand, I can’t possibly date her. She’s never been in a relationship before and she has these unrealistic expectations according to which she will only date a guy if it will lead up to marriage. That’s a commitment I can’t possibly provide right off the bat. I COULD have considered it at least but I can’t because we’re really different in fundamental ways.
At the same time, I do have feelings for her. Genuine feelings. I think about her everyday, have literally dreamt of holding her in my arms and there have been times when I have just wanted to kiss her forehead (as a matter of principle, I never think of girls I like or know in a sexual way because that just seems disrespectful). I feel protective of her, she has these insecurities which make my heart ache for her. I just want her to be happy.
Going back to the fundamental differences, she played silly mind games, never openly says what she wants, deliberately starts a conversation and then doesn’t reply and has twice stood me up. It’s a really weird situation. I’ve tried cutting her off completely but failed to do so longer than six months, but I have told her on three separate occasions that we’re just friends and that I will not ask her out. She tends to be dismissive of these attempts, always saying things like “you never know”, “you’re being too logical” and “the universe has its own plans”.
As of today, it’s been four years. I can’t possibly be with her, but god damn me if I don’t love her.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ohfh99/caught_in_a_fix/

Which sounds like a bad idea but our issues then are non issues now and we are both in a much better place. 

We started texting each other a few weeks ago. He asked to hang out a couple times but things just kept not working out. 

One of our biggest issues in our relationship was moving at hyper speed. We met each others families and lived together within a month. 

So now it seems like he is making a very conscious effort not to repeat that. Which is a good idea. I am someone who does move very quickly though, so it’s hard. 

We finally met up again earlier this week. I had a really good time, we still have really great chemistry. We very quickly and naturally fell into how we were with each other before. 

We ended up sleeping together and he fall asleep at my place. He made sure to tell me twice that he didn’t intend to sleep over and that his intention was not to come over to hook up or anything. 

After he left we texted eachother that we both had a really good time and enjoyed seeing each other but we didn’t make further plans. 

A couple days have gone by and i want to see him again but i don’t want to scare him or seem needy. He offered to drive me home from work today, i asked if he planned to just drop me off and he said probably.

12,ohfzld,1625911428,I don't understand straight women,"They seem more flexible and lax about their sexuality, for instance, kissing/making out, cuddling, dancing, holding hands, sleeping in the same bed and even showering with another woman is common and normal, they have no qualms about it.

Ladies night out or simply all-girl get together is more enjoyable, fun, relaxing, amazing than any awkward date/encounter with a guy I always read about. Most women are uncomfortable, suspicious and uneasy to even being close to a guy.

Orgasm gap, anatomical reasons and certain negative experiences prevent women to fully enjoy and look forward to have sex with a guy. Also male genitals are not necessarily appealing for them, the infamous dic pics are like a plague.

In conclusion, guys do not seem to be entirely compatible for women for companionship, sex and romance. I think we need a new definition to what it means to be a straight woman.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ohfzld/i_dont_understand_straight_women/

I have always been in shape but it looks like someone threw a brick at my face. I am legitimately ugly.

Ive been told by multiple girls my face looks “scary” over the years. I have major rbf.

In highschool, college and in professional relationships, 99% of women ignored me, pretended I was invisible or was down right hostile for no reasons. Stranger women still do for some reason. All my female friends referred to me as big brother and treat me like therapist on call. 

It was pretty discouraging and lonely over the years but I didn’t let it get to me and kept working on myself for better future. In fact, I pretty much became a workaholic because I didn’t have a girlfriend or spouse to go back to at night and to distract myself from being lonely. 

By the way, I never stopped putting myself out there but women will just not give me time of the day. 

Last year, I sold my company stakes for low eight figure sum and I am on “sabbatical”. 

I want to experience love that isn't one sided but it seems like wealth is the only tool that I can use to attract opposite sex.

31,ohi6ik,1625921660,Anybody else finds dating in summer off-putting?,"As someone who lives in a hot and humid country, and who's extremely heat-intolerent, sweats easily and just all-around gets irritated very quickly by heat, I find dating during summer very unappealing and even actively off-putting. Historically it's always been the season I date the least in, and rarely actively pursues something during these months of June-September.

Several weeks ago in late-May I again deleted tinder and the other apps, regardless of summer tbh, more because I've been wanting to focus more on myself for several months and so far it's proving great. However, even in these moments where I entertain the idea of getting back on the apps, this idea is quickly dispelled when I think of what it means to go out with somebody during this season.

Ungracefully sweating within a minute of walking outside or sitting someplace not / unsufficiently  AC'ed, bugs, stings/bites/bumps, at least for myself and I assume most men - less appealing wardrobe than that of colder seasons etc'. Also, the heat makes me less wanting of physical intimacy compared to colder or at least comfortable temps'. 

In all honesty, it serves perfectly as a reason/excuse to continue on this dating-timeout and focus on self-care and self-improvement. I find that dating starts to look appealing again starting with November, or at best October.

Was wondering if somebody else feels this way towards dating during summer, or, if you prefer dating during summer why so :)",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ohi6ik/anybody_else_finds_dating_in_summer_offputting/

When we broke up however, i still had feelings for him and it was hard for me to see his status update so I unfollowed him. Like i said he has every right to block me too but when i did that, he puts his ac private hence I couldn’t connect with him at all.

Basically i matched with this guy on tinder that I actually have a lot of mutual friends with from high school, but we live in different cities that are 10 minutes away from each other. 

He messaged me first kind of like “hey there ! haven’t seen you in a while” 

we text each other each day, but it’s not very consistent. he responds pretty slowly so I assumed he had no interest in me and just liked talking on occasion, so i also treated it as a very casual conversation.

On monday night i changed something in my tinder bio to something like “probably can beat you at mariokart” bc i genuinely think I can. Later monday night, around midnight he asked me about that part of my tinder bio, saying he probably could beat me at mariokart. The conversation escalated and eventually he said “What are you doing tommorrow?”.  So we scheduled to hang out Tuesday at noon for coffee then go back to his place for mariokart. I thought it was great. 

Fast forward to tuesday, he tells me he has an infection in the back of his mouth and can’t make it (which i totally get)

So i actually made him bread that morning though (i’m known amongst my friend group for making good bread, and one time he mentioned he wanted some, so why not?), So i dropped by his place to drop off bread and some tea bags. He did seem fairly sick. we talked for 15 minutes casually, it was actually a good conversation in my opinion. 

Anyways so we postponed for wednesday, but then he said he wasn’t feeling well on wednesday.

49,ohl8up,1625932524,(21M) Dating struggles to success!,"I’ve only ever gotten rejected by girls who I asked out in real life. One rejection in particular by a girl in my class badly tainted my High school junior and senior years. Safe to say, my self confidence was at rock bottom by the time I graduated 3 years ago.

Since then I’ve taken to playing sports a lot more, hitting the gym 4+ times a week and generally putting more effort into my appearance (new clothes, tried to take better pics, grew out my hair and got it permed). These lifestyle changes helped me decide this year that I was ready enough to give dating apps a try. Initially I was pleasantly surprised that I was able to get a couple of first dates from them. Nothing materialised as I wasn’t really interested in any of the girls I met, until my most recent match last week. Not only was she very attractive, she also seemed incredibly funny, smart and confident over text so I knew had to meet her.

Had our first date last week where we got dinner and talked for around 5-6 hours. We seemed to get along really well and after getting home I immediately asked her out again next week. She accepted straightaway and said that she’s really looking forward to it. If it does happen (which it should) then this will be my first time ever going on a second date! I was nervous about touching her at all but I think next time I will muster up the courage to ask if she wants to hold hands. Any further advice would be appreciated!

Looking back, I‘m proud of how far I came over the last few years. Working on myself did indeed give me the confidence to put myself out there - something which the old me would never have done.

50,ohlacj,1625932675,I don’t know how to do modern dating.,"Let me preface this by saying I grew up in a politically liberal but culturally conservative background, at least compared to mainstream Americans.

I (27 F) didn’t want to confine myself to only people of my religious background, so I’ve been using dating apps and trying to find a relationship on my own. I’m looking for a serious, committed, monogamous relationship. In my community, usually people do courtship for about a year and then decide to get married.

I don’t have to get married within a year, but I do want something serious. What I’m finding is that the men on apps either don’t want something serious, or don’t have the time to invest in other dates. I keep getting one date, being told by then they had a good time (their words, not mine, so it’s not all in my head) and then later I discover they’re not looking for a serious commitment or don’t have time for one.

This really hurts. I’m starting to think maybe my idea of romance and dating doesn’t align with modern American mentalities (I say this as someone who is American, born and raised).

I want someone who takes me out on dates, cares about me emotionally and wants invest time with me with the end goal of a serious commitment. The only cause for there to NOT be a commitment would be if we didn’t have a connection or attraction.

54,ohlvts,1625934625,Falling for someone who’s not ready.,"So back in Feb I started talking to someone, we both agreed we weren’t looking for anything serious. I had come out of a relationship of three years in the November beforehand and he had just come out of a 13 year relationship in the January. 

We’ve been talking everyday since and see each other a few times a week, have been away for a weekend together, amazing sex, great connection, lots of fun dates and time spent together. 

However he is not over his ex, he always says ‘we’ about referring to what they did or went and talks about ‘our’ house (being his old house he shared with her) and I get this is normal in a sense. But he also told me he isn’t sure if he will ever love someone like he loved her, and that he feels a grief because he knows she’s out there somewhere but they aren’t in contact. 

Meanwhile, I’m falling for him. And I know he is not in a position to do the same. And it’s making me…not resentful…but I feel like I’m just there to satisfy the sexual need and loneliness he feels being single for the first time in his adult life, and it hurts. 

A part of me is telling me to be patient, wait for him, it will be worth it. And a part of me is scared shitless he’ll never want to take it further and I end up heartbroken again and back at square one.

55,ohlwu8,1625934719,To all the new people who r into dating and can't understand what went wrong...,"Okay so here is the thing guys .. let me ask u .. has it ever happened to u that a girl/guy is taking interest in u from the start and the moment u try to close the gap or get near to her/him or start giving response .. every thing goes side ways..

My advice is don't get attached to people if they are giving u attention.. why bcoz this people are actually benching u down ..

The Bench theory:

Imagine this ur crush is sitting on a chair and the chair opposite to him/her is empty .. the bench adjacent to that chair is filled with people.. and ur crush while sitting on the chair is looking at everyone at the same time..
The people on the bench think that he/she might be calling them to come sit on the chair.. bt the fact remains that the chair stays ""Empty""..
That's all there is to it.. u r basically on the bench with other people without u realizing that urself.. in the hopes that something is gonna happen..

Why do they do this??

1) they may think they r too good for anybody and they deserve waayy to much better.

2)attention deficiency: they may be grown in a house in which their parents may not have given them enough attention during childhood which leads them to want the same amount of attention from other people in life.. that forces them to want more people to like them

3)popularity syndrome: movies and series alike makes them want to be that unattainable fruit for which everyone is going mad

4)They themselves are stuck( this ones are the most dangerous ones) .. they are nice but are not decisive enough.. and thus everyone in their life are on pause.. their exes are their friends.. and they still hang around .. they can't say no to anyone so they don't reply anything..basically u can't move on from this person not bcoz they r grt but bcoz they don't allow u to leave

5) Family situations: Well these are rare but basically their family already has different plans for them but they are in that rebellious phase so they go against their parents wishes dates u or don't..  bt in the end they don't commit
 
6)jumping ones: they date u for a while until they find something wayy better then they leave 
&lt;write down any additional ones if u know from experience&gt;  &lt; 7) then write &gt;


Now for the real question is it worth it to go do the bench theory urself??

Here is the thing no matter who us people always have other people in life with whom we can try this out..(kinda)(even introverts yes)(I may be wrong .. but don't sue me 😑)
So is it worth it??
The short answer ""NO""

The thing is the whole scenario is wayyy to sad
Coz the person who tries this never finds his/her partner.. remember this Genuine people always walk away once the realize that they are on the bench.. all the person is left with is desperate losers who noone wants.. u basically can't run this shenanigan long enough...

Secondly, in start it is fun .. u kn so many people are texting u.. inviting u out..and all is fun but slowly slowly even u would start feeling lonely even if their are so many people in ur life..coz noone is intellectually smart enough or funny or close enough to make u happy everyone is at a distance.. coz u would always be afraid to tell anyone everything in fear of what if they judge u or walk away from u..

This cycle always ends and soon people start to walk away from u.. and then u run after them or find a new circle to start this again with and u basically are never happy..
*not genderising a topic or anything but usually girls (not ladies) flirts with a guy just to see if she can get him or not.. just to see if he is in her range or not and guys always fall fir her thinking ohh maybe she likes me*

So everyone is basically sad .. the person in the chair and the people on the bench..
All things said this even applies to sex.. this follows the same rules..
And 90% people are like this.. all their life they just run after people and want people to run after them..until they settle for someone.. which they get tired of and end up having affair..

56,ohlz1n,1625934924,I made a best-friend off a dating app,"Hey all, so this is a little different but I would like to get some feedback if anybody else has encountered this type of scenario or just what you guys think of this.

I went out with a girl about two months ago and we agreed we didn’t have that “spark” but we had a fun time and she enjoyed hanging out. So I was like “lets be friends” and she was like “are you okay with that…?”. Now this friendship has gotten to a platonic level.

We have hung out three times since, gone out to eat, hung out at my place watching tv, I went to her area and she bought me ice cream and we just sat in the rain talking about our lives. 

We have deep conversations about a lot of things, she even asked me one specific question she had on her mind. “Do you have one person you would drop everything for to be with” and that sort of made me think if she’s concerned I’m going to leave one day. 

Now about that - when we first hung out as friends, we spoke of our entire first date and at the end we AGREED that one day we will meet someone, and that day we have to be prepared to say goodbye. We both know that our friendship will end one day.

I can’t tell if she’s getting feelings or not, I asked one of my other girl friends from school and she said she could be starting to. Recently her best friend requested me on Facebook randomly and told her to invite me to a bonfire. So her friends definitely want to meet me which is cool but why meet her friends if we know one day this will all end?

I really do enjoy hanging out with her and vibing, and truthfully at first she was the one who said there was no spark - she was right. But now could she be feeling something? She told me I was the last person she went out with.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ohlz1n/i_made_a_bestfriend_off_a_dating_app/

58,ohmk9c,1625936861,Is it normal to feel such a dread about a first date?,"So, I'm 28M and I have never had much of a dating life (my social life overall has also been always very limited). I've had anxiety for as long as I can remember, and it definitely went up a few levels after I went through college. I'd say the anxiety is somewhat managed, but it continues to be an hindrance without a doubt .
I've been single for almost all my life, and although I fear a future where I die alone, I've kind of become used to being by myself.
Lately, I have been chatting with a cute girl. It was quite unexpected. She reached out to me and initiated the conversation. We were friends in primary school and I haven't talked to her since, so she's just a little different from any stranger in Tinder.
As I've said, she's definitely cute and attractive, I've flirted with her a little, but we still haven't had a first date. My question is: is it normal that I dread that date so bad? At some point I will go through with it, but, understanding that I'm an anxious person, is my dread response normal, or does it indicate that, deep down, I don't want to go through with this?

I've listened to a podcast that really spoke to me on this topic. The idea was that there is no growth without discomfort. I'd like to think that this is just that. I'm about to get out of my comfort zone to try and grow into what I want to become, and that's why I feel the way I do.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ohmk9c/is_it_normal_to_feel_such_a_dread_about_a_first/

After I broke up with him, he harassed me and told me no one would ever love me/want me and no one else would put up with my depression and anxiety and no sex like “he did”.

For years I believed that was true and no one would want me due to my mental illness. It affected me for YEARS. 

This morning I had a realization, I am so happily married to a wonderful man who is always there for me on my bad days and never makes me feel bad about it. We are expecting our first child, my mental health, while I still have my struggles, is better than it has ever been. I’ve never been happier.

(a) she identifies as bi/pan with a preference for women
(b) I really don’t want our friendship to go south because of “I like you”. However, we also do both value being vulnerable about our emotions, so I’m not sure how to go about this.

91,ohpypw,1625947961,Destined to Be Alone,"Im a 21[M] who is having a really hard time trying to figure out wtf to do and need to vent about it. 

My history with relationships and women is quite short and unlucky. There has only been 2 times (maybe 3) where there was mutual interest but all came to an end because of timing. 

Girl 1 (which is the maybe), I had known since kindergarten and we were really good friends and I had the biggest crush on her and I believed its was mutual. However, around 8th grade I was getting bullied nonstop and asked my parents to send me to a private school (did not tell anyone but I would have rather kms then suffer 4 more years of crap). They were hesitant because we aren’t rich but they realize now it was worth it. It was a small town so you couldn’t go hang out with certain groups of people or else I run into the bullies. So, I basically cut most if not all ties, except I would try to keep up with her. This caused some friction, which she would only display over message basically getting mad at me for leaving (again no one knew or realized I was getting bullied, I was pretty good at hiding it/playing it off). She never explicitly said that though. I never asked her out because I hated myself and knew neither of us were ready and hs relationships don’t last long. 

This private school was only boys so the only girls I was interacting with were my new friends gfs. Then Soph year came and I had met this girl who seemed interested in me (Girl 2). We talked and realized she knew some of my new friends. Thats when I started seeing red flags all over the place. I quickly distanced myself and ended up dodging a bullet when she screwed over this nice guy I knew from my old school. End of hs came and didn’t have any girls to take to prom and all my friends girls they knew were going with others. I wanted to ask out girl 1 but never got the nerve. 

Summer before leaving for college I started to work at this summer camp to make money to help pay for college expenses. I met this girl who was really nice and pretty. But since I was moving really far away for college I wasn’t looking for anything. Then last few weeks of the summer came when I was told by a coworker that It was obvious we both liked each other. Then the night before I left we went out on a “date” (idk if it was actually a date). In fact my only date ever. I thought it went well and was told by a coworker that she was sad I was going so far away. However, she ghosted me for the entire year until she wanted to hang over spring break. She then blew me off and had a bf 2 weeks later. 

Now the second half of my second year and my full 3rd year of college was taken by covid and ill be graduating in the fall. Im going into a career field thats 99% men. I feel like I’m fucked. 

I tried asking out Girl 1 to lunch when I was home for Christmas but she wasn’t going to be in town, nor did I think she wanted to see me. She did however like my message that we should try and get together another time, but I think she was just trying to be nice. 

Girl 1 is also at the center of all if not most my dreams and I don’t know why because I am not thinking/talking to her. I legit had a dream where I woke up in a panic because I thought she was coming over and I needed to clean. It took me at least 10-15 min before I realized that wasn’t going to happen. These dreams make me sad knowing Ill most likely never get the chance to even see her in person and have a conversation again.

My only fear going through life is that I would end up alone and I feel like its been set in stone. Im not blaming anyone other than myself. 

I’m already at the point of my routine being going to work/school coming home exhausted, eating then going to sleep and repeat and I don’t know how long ill be able to keep it up alone after college.

Im not someone looking for hookups, so conventional dating apps won’t be for me and the type of women I’m attracted to. Im also short/skinny af and not too good looking. But feel my personality makes up for it.

Im really introverted and don’t drink or do drugs, which leaves out bars and clubs. Im also claustrophobic in situations with a lot of people. I also haven’t had a first kiss, real date, or sex because I haven’t found someone yet that i can be conformable with. Still sleep with my blankets that I was given as a baby and suck my thumb to help me fall asleep.

93,ohqd6k,1625949326,"(M 33) Im indecisive, don't know what I want in life and not funny. Am I undatable ?","It seems like that is all women on dating apps are looking for. And if that truly is the case then it will be impossible for me to find someone. I am just a regular easygoing dude who wants to find someone to connect and spend time with, I'm also fairly suuccessful at what I do (but hate it :D). 

I think I have some good qualities but it seems to me that women on dating apps definition of a man is: decisivness, knows what he wants in life, passionate about what he does and can make me laugh. That's all I can see on the dating apps.

How true is that and what can I do if I can't become those things ?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ohqd6k/m_33_im_indecisive_dont_know_what_i_want_in_life/
94,ohqdrj,1625949383,I can't even imagine myself dating,"It's just something that happens to other people. Adults. I'm like a kid.

I've never been in a situation that was even remotely sexual. People just don't see me that way.

Even in middleschool, when everyone was playing spin the bottle, I was excluded. I just wasn't let it, because I wasn't considered ""an equal"", a sexual being.

I just was so beneath everyone that they collectively decided that I simply do not posses the ability and the right to have any sexual thoughts.

And to this day it is true. I'm in university, and when people discuss something related to relationships I'm quickly booted out of the conversation. Even physically sent out of the room.

And like I've said, never been in any kind of a situation that someone hinted that they might be interested, or that they even consider me as an option.

Rejection is one thing, but to not be even considered is a lot worse. 

Can't imagine myself making some kind of a move, or flirting, or anything remotely sexual. It just wasn't meant for me. I don't even look like an adult. I see girls that I'd be interested in, but then I remember that it's just not for me.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ohqdrj/i_cant_even_imagine_myself_dating/

96,ohqh6z,1625949710,"What's your go to strategy when dealing with girls who play ""hard to get"" and who try to play with your feelings and make you look stupid?","I think the best idea is to just stay calm and don't get angry because that's exactly the response she wants and expects.  And then screenshot me and laugh with her girl friends at me, well I'm not falling for that.

I already decided that she's not worth it, but I want to finish the game that she started playing. I think the best idea is to start treating her the same way as she did me and then when she starts complaining, finish it off with telling her I'm talking to a girl that actually likes me and finds me important enough to tell me and make some time for me. That will piss her off and makes HER the one who will walk off being butthurt. What do you think, good idea? I kinda like it, yeah I know, I can just cut the contact and completely stop communicating, but I wanna play the game, I'm bored.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ohqh6z/whats_your_go_to_strategy_when_dealing_with_girls/

98,ohqz9g,1625951390,I screwed things up with my ex but want to fix it badly,"I treated my ex really really poorly during our few months of off and on dating. To make a long story short, she literally just wanted to spend quality time with me and have my attention for just a couple of hours of the day but I was extremely unwilling to do so. I instead tried to prove to my “friend” that I wasn’t a loser by giving my complete and utter attention to him and playing games with him. I didn’t feel remorse for how I treated my ex up until I took an extended vacation a few weeks ago and I spent a lot of time away from that particular friend. My ex and I had maintained communication even though we had broken up, but asked that during my vacation we not talk. Upon returning, she told me that she was still super hurt by the way I acted and treated her, and that while she doesn’t want to cut me off completely, she wants to take a fairly large step back from me and not talk to me often, if at all. I realized too late that this girl actually means the world to me, and I want to do everything in my power to make it right. I, again, flouted what she wanted by trying to make any excuse to talk to her when I came back from my trip, but I realized that I was not being fair to what she wants. I wrote her a letter telling her that I was extremely sorry for how I acted and that I know that my chances with fixing this relationship with her are all gone, but I still really really want to make things right. What should I do, if there is even anything?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ohqz9g/i_screwed_things_up_with_my_ex_but_want_to_fix_it/
99,ohr8r1,1625952297,Wanting to break up but not doing it...,"I am 18F and my bf is 19M. So we've been together for 6 months now and things are getting bad between us... I feel like he doesn't love me anymore. Plus, he cheated, he talks to others girls, he often lies to me, he told me that he's not sure to do a long distance relationship with me (we are going to be miles away from each other for at least 5 years...), he said things to other girl like ""wish I had a girlfriend like you"", he takes me for someone stupid, he cuts me off when I try to communicate about an issue between us, he has a weird conception of women, he is immature, and more... There are so many red flags, and know its been two days hes been ignoring me while he is the one who hurted me by trying to manipulate me thinking I am dumb, and he is just ignoring me now he didn't even apologised..

I know it's time to break up. But I still dont do it. Maybe I am afraid of the pain I'll experience after the break up, maybe I am scared to be alone, maybe I am afraid to hurt his possibly existing feelings...
What should I do you finally break up and get over this? I am listening to everything.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ohr8r1/wanting_to_break_up_but_not_doing_it/
