2,psrup5,1632257783,Grown men seemingly unable to function,"I (40F) have been on two dates recently with two different men met through OLD both whom have had professions, live independently and decent level of educational attainment however throughout my first dates with them they have seemingly been unable to complete even simple tasks without seeking my involvement, opinion or approval. Bare with me I realise this sounds incredibly judgemental. BUT .....


The first man contacted me to say he was over half hour late due to traffic and then when he did arrive, he asked me to leave the cafe to assist with the parking ticket machine. It was in public place well known to me so I did. Read the instructions by the machine out to him, i.e. put money in machine, press button and display ticket. He said he to had to go back to cafe to get change. So I advised him to go short distance to sign posted free parking bays. And returned to cafe whilst he moved his car.

The second we went for walk and he suggested we get ice cream, whilst we were reading the menu he asked me what the different flavours/mixes/cones were. I answered that I had no idea other than what was written that I have no additional information available to me. At this he was seemingly stumped at what choice he would/ should make. Although we had a bit of a conversation about possibilities and my choices, he was flustered at making an order, so I ordered and waited ahead of him.

In both I observed multiple similar behaviours and I guess the thing I'm wondering is how can grown men in to their forties be unable to demonstrate simple independent living and social skills but confidently assert they feel ready to be fathers. I don't doubt that men have experienced similar however that's just not my POV. Do others find adults faltering in simple tasks a source of despair? 

I'm not perfect, I suffer indecisiveness when faced with new circumstances, first date nerves and lacking knowledge of the other persons preferences but that does not impinge on my ability to complete every day tasks.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/psrup5/grown_men_seemingly_unable_to_function/

8,pswps7,1632273249,New partner left me alone to go party by herself. Confused.,"Just wanted to get your opinion. I (48M) was married for 21 years before it sadly finally ended.

I recently started dating again and met a wonderful lady who is 47. We live in Los Angeles. She was never married before. Most of her relationships lasted only 3 months. One lasted five years. She is adorable and so kind and loving and I just cannot wrap my head around the fact that she was never married before.

My question relates to the following:

We have been in a relationship for 2 months. She says she is serious and that I am her boyfriend. 

I really love her and she tells me she loves me. 

We are basically a couple.

But during these 2 months she has been gone twice; once on a one week camping trip with friends which is perfectly fine because it was already booked before. But now she left again. This time to take yoga classes in New York City. She is somehow addicted to experiences. Constantly.

I was fine with her going to New York since yoga is her passion. But I did feel it was awkward to leave your boyfriend when you are in a brand new relationship. Maybe I am old fashioned but I like to be with my new partner as much as possible. When I talked to her about it she didn't get it.

She also says she has a key to an apartment of a man in New York who is supposedly married but who never lives there in which she is allowed to stay any time she wants. She has stayed in this apartment once a month for the last year(s). Serious red flag I thought since giving keys to someone means you are usually involved with that person sexually. But again. Maybe that's just me. So I send her an email about my concerns and that I felt bad. She only replied ""thank you for sharing your feelings"". No denial. Nothing.

Now she is texting me (still from New York) that she is not only going to Yoga but also going out in the evenings with friends. 

She loves music so she is going (by her self she says) to bars and clubs with life performances where she is meeting some of the bands that are playing. Then she sends me texts that she is so happy that some of these guys give her compliments about how young she looks for her age. Now I am completely lost. I ask her what she is doing and that this is flirting and she says she knows these people for years and that she has no physical attraction to them. She is just there for the music.

But again no consideration to my feelings.

So a week passes and I get all these conflicting signals. 

Today she texted me and told me that she misses me while talking romantic walks through NY.

But then why did she leave me in the first place?

I don't get it.

Totally confused what is going on here.

So my question to all the ladies (perhaps men who experienced something similar); is this normal behavior when you are in the beginning of a relationship?

Thank you.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/pswps7/new_partner_left_me_alone_to_go_party_by_herself/

However, I also have others that want my time and want me to plan my first date nights with them. Do I make more time for the guy I’m interested in?

We talk through the week via text and phone. He calls after dark on weekends. I end up staying the night at his house Friday or Saturday night,  sometimes both.

I do love him, (we've exchanged ""I love you"" a few times) but this ""situationship"" is not the relationship I want. I feel like I deserve more.  Once we went to a festival thingy, and another time to a house of a girl he knows (yeah, ikr?). Besides those times it's strictly just at his house, as I explained. I just can't anymore. And, I fear greatly hurting him.  But, for my own sanity I need to make this stop. We are alcoholics. And I'm 15 days sober. Part of me is scared he'll drink himself to death if I tell him I can't do this anymore. So, I keep going through these motions despite my feelings. And also because I don't know how to get out. When and where do I even start this conversation? Do I just say I have plans the next time he ask me to come over? This is extremely difficult for me.

This got super long. TL;DR is at the end.

So, it's now been 18 months since I meet my (43f) incredible boyfriend ""G"" (33) on Bumble. 

Our relationship has continued to deepen and grow, which has been a beautiful experience for both of us. 

My life circumstances have changed dramatically since we met. Then I was a half-time mom. Hadn't planned on mixing kids and partner, figured I had plenty of time to see G when my kids were with their dad. Now I'm a 100% mom (girls 13 &amp; 10), and there's, unsurprisingly, been tons of turmoil involved in the transition for both me and the kids.

G has been patient and present and understanding to an extent which is hard for me to even understand. It is, of course, difficult for him though. I can't shake the feeling that he'd be better off finding someone whose life lines up with his better, with less drama, but he's very sure that he wants to be with me. 

There's also still the issue that he will most likely be moving away in the future. It probably won't be within the next few years though, and he will try his best to get a permanent position. I know I'm not cut out for a long distance relationship (we're already too far with 2 hours with public transport now), but I've had to tell myself that I'll at least try it if he does have to leave so that I can allow myself to love him like I feel compelled to do. Ninja mind tricks, I guess. Thinking that our end was almost certain felt like holding my thumb on a hose. It wasn't allowing me to let the relationship and love flow as it wanted to. (Sorry, it's so hard to talk about this stuff without sounding painfully sappy/cheesy.) G doesn't worry about the future because he feels certain it will work out and we'll be together. I'm trying to adopt that perspective.

Time will tell what's to come, but for now, it's the deepest, most harmonious love I've ever experienced and I'm just trying to suck it all in and enjoy the hell out of it. 

I'd appreciate any stories of life circumstances being difficult and working out any way, or of people deciding to part ways and things turning out well!

TL;DR

We have so much fun together, we never argue, we respect each other's boundaries, spend lots of time together and our kids get along amazingly well. In short, things are great!

But, we are a year in and he hasn't said ""I love you"". I feel like he loves me and my daughter (13F) says all the time that she can tell how much he loves me... but the words mean a lot too. I'm the kind of person who says ""I love you"" to my daughter multiple times a day, every single time I hang up the phone with my mom, etc. It feels kind of unnatural for me not to say that to him as well, but everyone goes at their own pace so I have let it go, up until now.

Big question is... how do I figure out if he truly loves me without directly asking if he loves me? I definitely don't want to put him on the spot or make him uncomfortable... but I am starting to feel uncomfortable and need to know. I am not about to waste my time with someone who maybe just cares about me, but isn't in love with me a year into the relationship.

Three months in and she's been taking her kiddo to the doctor for something and working and being a single mom, which is obviously all very time consuming. She went on a girls weekend. That's great. Said have an amazing weekend let's do something when you get back. 

Check in about the weekend and the doctor visit and if she's busy or not the next week and she's going on a wine tour with her ""other friend"", which I don't know what that means (likely from the girls weekend) but not really my business. We haven't had that exclusive talk and still aren't physical yet. 

I said I was hoping we could do the nice crab dinner I'd said I was going to make her (she mentioned liking crab) and she said it wasn't locked down and maybe she'd be available.

At this point I was probably a little annoyed she'd made more plans when I'd asked her to do something else and expected me to wait around in the hopes her plans fell through. I just decided I'd leave town and visit friends. 

I checked on her son once more and then went for the weekend to see friends. Decided to let her engage if she was interested. 

It's been 9 days since and she didn't write to say she was going to the winery or not. Didn't write to say how the doctor's visit went. Didn't check in to see how my weekend went and didn't reschedule.

I'm assuming that's just done, right? Continuing to contact someone who seems pretty disinterested or unsure isn't feeling great.

Clare's Law is a 'right to ask' scheme in the UK whereby you can ask the police if somebody in your life is a risk to you essentially. This came about after Clare Wood was murdered by an ex-boyfriend who had previous history in domestic abuse.

I am just asking our UK daters if they are aware of Clare's Law, if they have used it, how they heard about it, what would stop them from using it, and most importantly - have they even heard about it? I am asking as I am becoming more shocked how few people are aware of it and I have recently used it myself for the first time so would like to alleviate any concerns.

I (48F) connected with this guy (51M) on OLD about 1.5 years ago. I am single, have never been married, no kids while his long-term girlfriend passed away 5 years ago, no kids. We are living half the world apart. I normally connect only with people living in the same location but this guy is originally from my city. He used to travel back to my city at least twice per year before the pandemic. Due to travel restrictions and required lengthy quarantine, he already postponed his trip twice so we have not met in person yet. We promised to visit each other as soon as the travel restrictions are lifted. We have never video called but we had phone calls and voice messages many times. He didn't write much but he sent emojis every day. He loves to cook so he shared photos of his dishes and taught me how to make them through voice messages. On my birthday, he was the first to send me birthday greetings and called me right at midnight. When I was sad, he called to comfort me even when he was trying to get more sleep (we are 14 hours apart). I have slowly got used to hearing from him every day even if it was just an emoji. 

Since the beginning of this year, he hasn't been contacting me as much as last year. The daily emojis are gone but we had a few more lengthy phone calls. He then suddenly stopped texting me in mid-July. When I texted him, he doesn't reply. I don't want to pressure him so I hold myself not to text him too much; maybe just twice a month. Finally, he replied to my text in mid-August saying that something had happened and he doesn't have the mood to deal with anything. He didn't say what had happened though. Again, I didn't want him to feel annoyed and definitely didn't want to push him further away so I kept quiet even though I have been wishing for his text every morning. It's been over a month since he texted so I checked on him a few days ago but I haven't heard from him so far. 

I miss him very much and I still want a chance to meet him in person. Do you think he's ghosting on me? What can I do?",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/pufmn8/is_he_ghosting_on_me_i_miss_him_what_can_i_do_to/

60,pugudn,1632478845,Know Your Place,"   As I was sitting and reading on the beach yesterday, a quote hit home with me. I’ve heard it before, but it resonated with my experiences this week. I thought I’d share some thoughts with you all as you plan out your dating adventures for the weekend.
   “If you want to know how someone really feels about you, don’t listen to their words.  Pay attention to their actions.”  A person you are interested in may tell you how beautiful and amazing you are. They may call you cute little nicknames such as honey, sweetie, babe, etc.  This can definitely be a good thing, and may make you feel all warm and fuzzy.  However, pay more attention as to how they show up in the relationship.  Do they make a concerted effort to make time for you?  Are they there for you when you have a difficult day?  Do they commit to you after several months, or years, of dating.  Do they include you with family and friends?
   Most of this sounds like common sense, right? However, it is easy to get stuck in a trap with an avoidant partner. The highs are so good, that you stick by the lows, you fall in love with the potential.
   I fell into this trap not really sure if it was avoidant issues, or the depression he suffered from.  Due to life circumstances of health and job loss due to business closures, I made allowances.  We had broken up a few times during low episodes, but tended to work things out.  I continued to be understanding.
   I ended up hurt in the end. I know I will be ok. My advice here is to know when to walk away. If an avoidant makes no effort, things will most likely not work out; especially if you are of the anxious attachment style. If they are depressed, that is a serious medical issue that shouldn’t be taken lightly. Again, if they aren’t willing to get help, it is unhealthy to stay in that relationship.  There is nothing wrong with supporting someone you really love. Love and support might feel encouraging for a partner to want to get help or work through their issues.  Just know your limits and be honest and open with that person. I may have hurt another dear person by releasing my own emotions, at an inappropriate time, after being hurt once again.  It could have been avoided with open communication.
   Just know your place in someone’s life.  Don’t just assume.  Have a great weekend, y’all.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/pugudn/know_your_place/

He’s moving away soon which will make things easier, but I was so tired and sad in that relationship of trying to make him love me when he just didn’t or couldn’t. (Yes I’m in therapy.) I’m blessed to have wonderful friends here in my city, and my sibling is the best person in the world (even if a ten hour plane ride away 😞). I’ve got a great job and engaging hobbies.

But it’s not enough.

I want to meet new men just to talk to, get to know, and feel light and fun again but I don’t want to use anyone. I don’t want one night stands, or anything sexual (I can only sleep with people I’m in a relationship with) - I just want male company if that makes sense: that wonderful energy that many men have which is so different to that of my female friends. I don’t have any male friends in my city. I find that dating apps are profoundly depressing and in any case I’m not in the right place for a new relationship. With Covid the usual places like concerts and outdoor markets aren’t convivial to chatting with strangers. In my hobby groups the guys seem to be jealously guarded by their wives all the time (sorry but true) … so where do you meet men just to talk to these days?

The set up: Me and my wife had been married for 23 years until last year (Sept 2020) when she looked at me days before our anniversary and told me that she wanted a separation. We have been separated ever since. She has been saying all along that she plans on filing for a divorce. Within the last month or 2 she even said that since she moved out in October (and this October will be 1 year), she is planning on filing for a ""no fault divorce"" then. I have tried just about everything that is in me to get her to change her mind, but all she says is that she just does not want to try anymore. I know I can not change her mind and that I can not force her to do something that she does not want to do. So I know in my mind that this marriage is over. However, my heart still says that I love her and I want her back. I miss her so much... I know I need to be able to let her go, but for some reason I just can't....

Which brings me to this... She has already dated 3 guys since our separation, and just moved in with boyfriend #3. Just tonight/last night, I ended up helping her move in with said boyfriend. All the while feeling awkward, sad, and annoyed (while trying my best to put up a good and kind front) that she is moving in with him even though she is still legally married to me with no divorce filed yet. I still love her greatly even though she has cheated on me. (In her leaving it was the 2nd time she cheated...) I feel like I should not be loving her as much as I do, but yet I still do... I ended up crying about 1/2 of the way home (for the last year she only lived across the other side of the small town ""we"" live/lived in. Her boyfriend that she is moving in with lives 1 hour away.) (By the way, yes we do have kids, but they are both adults now about to be 23, and 24. 1 still lives at home with me, the other calls my house home, but is rarely home due to his job.)

She was my first (and still to this day) my only girlfriend and on up in that kind of relationship. So, I really do not have a lot/any experience in dating other people. This is still my first ""break up."" I know we were young when we got married (me at 19, and her at 18). But this still hurts...

I don't want to be lonely, so I have been looking on about 4 dating sites (as I am not a bar goer and I am not someone that gets out very much either). I have not found anyone to date yet. I am trying to get over my wife and sometimes it feels like I can, yet other times I just feel like it is a hopeless cause and that I should not even be trying to date yet. Thinking that it would not be fair to that other person if I were to try to date. I am very up front with anyone that I have talked to (even though I think most were fake or scam accounts...) Nobody seems to be interested in me, and at this point I don't feel like I will ever feel loved or love someone else again... Does this ever get better? I know they say time is a healer, but this sucks... I wish I knew years ago what I know now, and could have prevented her leaving...

Any advice? I don't have the kind of ""real friends"" that I feel comfortable talking to, even though there have been some that offered... (I am a bit of a loner in the friend department...) Which is why I have come her to ask... It feels easier to talk to a stranger for some reason...",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/pvnm3o/is_my_love_misplaced_when_do_i_know_when_i_should/

93,pvnw2j,1632635486,"Always match words with actions, it spares so much heartache.","I(46f) recently ended a friendship with a man that I had grown pretty fond of. He said he wanted to be friends, that he didn’t have time for a relationship and just wanted someone to hang out with and I was happy to do so. We have interests in common and it was nice to have a simple meal and watch a movie together and have companionship every once in a while. 

Then, last weekend, while hanging out he started to kiss me. I’m not going to lie, I’m attracted to him and thoroughly enjoyed it. I pulled away first, remembering his words thinking, “This is not what friends do.” I left pretty confused. 

We usually text every few days and this week I made an effort not to reach out first and sure enough within two days he wanted to know if I was okay. I told him I was and he said he wanted to have me over and he would cook. Fast forward to tonight. We had a nice meal and then sat on his couch and watched a movie. Half way through he put his arm around me and we cuddled. It was really nice, but again confusing. 

As I was leaving I leaned in to give him a hug and peck on the cheek and he dodged me(this is normally how I leave him- affectionate but platonic). Startled I backed away and he said, “I told you I only wanted a friend to hang out with.” Deeply hurt, I left immediately. 

When I got home, I texted him saying that I had enough confusion in my life without having someone add to it and that I thought our friendship needed to end. His answer was to say that he was honest and had told me up front what he wanted and that I had agreed to it. 

I’m laying in bed now, not sleeping, and thinking about other situations where someone has done one  thing, but meant another and how hurtful it can be. I realize that people can change their minds, but when clear boundaries are set, they need to be stuck to for the sake of both parties, especially when emotions could get involved. While my example has a man being questionable I know women do it too and that a lot of people are probably guilty of doing this. 

I want to clarify that until he kissed me I was doing really well keeping things separated in my head and in my heart. 

I feel that it’s so unfair to establish boundaries, cross those boundaries and then, when things go haywire, repeat those boundaries like the other person is crazy.
