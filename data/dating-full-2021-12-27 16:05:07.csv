Okay, so I know how weird this is all going to sound. I literally do not know what to do, as most of the time, when guys are into me, they just are. Does that make sense?

Anyway, here we go:

So I live out in rural Ohio. The place isn’t teaming with young singles, but I love the area. I’ve got a graduate degree, and I am an intellectual. That sounds cocky, but I don’t mean for it to. What I mean by this is that I like high conversation: politics, religion, literature, etc. I have cultured interests. That also makes dating difficult, but again, I love it here.

So, let’s get a few other things about me: I’m 30. I am in great shape. Am I a Victoria’s Secret model? No, but I know I’m pretty. I take care of myself. I have eclectic but cute style that guys usually compliment me on.

Again, normally I have no problem getting men, it’s just the match that is difficult.

A friend of mine’s mother has a friend (the chain here...) whose so moved to town a year ago. I am told “add him on Instagram! He’s lonely.”

I did just that - I’m 29 at that point, he’s in his 30s. What’s the big deal? It’s not like this is middle school. And again, I’m confident (most of the time), so I have no qualms about approaching a man first. 

I said something in an Instagram message along the lines of “Hi! My name is *Kara*, and your mom’s friend *Linda* said we should maybe meet, that you’re new to town.”

Please know that by this, I did not mean “meet me around the tool shed sometime,” I meant, “we should grab coffee.”

Two weeks go by, but I finally hear from him, and he’s added me back on Instagram. 

Okay, maybe he’s not on Instagram all the time. Most guys aren’t. That’s cool.

He replies that he’d love to meet and that he hasn’t met a lot of people here yet.

I start suggesting places, since he’s new here. 

CRICKETS. And I can see that he’s seen it, because it’s Instagram.

Well, this continues to go on. He’ll message me that he likes my sweater, or that I look pretty, or he’ll send me videos of cute animals... and goes on for a year. I ask if he wants to meet at the local coffee shop, and I won’t hear from him for two months, but here’s the first weirdest (it’s all bizarre): 

I’m a social media influencer (not major, but I get paid to post for some brands) and a lot of people look at my story, but I kid you not, this guy is consistently one of the very first people to look at my story, even when I post during the day, when I know he’s working! Why? He clearly has no interest in meeting me, right? He’s been playing coy for a whole year, and I have dated other people, because I am not going to wait around on some guy who is scared to meet me, right? But why does he clearly have an alert on my posts? It’s not like I’m a bikini model... I’m telling people which moisturizer is the best, or which J.Crew sweater I’m wearing today. 

In the meantime, people who have NO IDEA what’s been going on are trying to set us up, and I know on good authority he’s super single.

So, I kid you not, a YEAR goes by, and he messages me on Instagram, asking me if I want to come over to his place. I’ve gathered enough from his bajillion videos of cats and dogs that he’s not going to try and have sex with me. This is clearly a friends thing. He apparently has an indoor pool and tells me to bring a swimsuit. Okay. Again, this is a friends thing.

Well, I go over, and it’s totally a friends vibe - he is so awkward, laughing at things I say that no one usually would or should laugh at, almost like he doesn’t know what to do. That’s fine, but we’re having a great time, anyway. Then, we get in his pool, and I’m not in there two seconds and he’s pulling me on top of him, and he’s got a boner. He’s telling me about how left out he feels because all of his friends are married with kids and he is single and childless. All while grinding on my ass.

As you could expect, this isn’t where I saw this going. So I’m like “maybe he wants to?” I keep turning around, thinking he’ll kiss me, but nope, just keeps subtly touching my boobs and  being flirty. 

Dude does not kiss me, but I leave at 1:00 AM and go home...

And don’t hear from him again about meeting up for SEVEN WEEKS.

So, at this point I’m too curious to say no.

I go over to his house, because apparently he’s allergic to a social life, and no one has seen him at a restaurant in town, ever. We drink a bit, he doesn’t touch me, and then BAM! The pool is boner city.

At this point, I’m like “what are we doing?”

He thinks I’m pretty, funny, and great to hang out with, but he “is just going at his own pace.” 

Own pace? Can you imagine what being strung along on line for a year feels like, then have your ass used as a boner cushion by a guy who is too scared to kiss you or have sex with you? He appears to have to get liquored up before he has the confidence to touch me, meanwhile, I’m over here wondering why my boobs and ass are good enough to practically dry hump but I cannot be kissed. He then tells me about how I’m the first girl he’s felt comfortable letting over to his house, which is sweet, but also... you have been here for over a year now.

So I leave again. He doesn’t hug me, and I tell him that friends that live in the same town don’t go seven weeks without seeing each other. He seems to understand.

Meanwhile, he’s scared to use my phone number, but feels fine messaging me on Instagram. What’s scary about my phone number? It’s a PHONE NUMBER. 

Reader, I am lost. What is wrong with this guy? He’s cute, funny, but seems to be lacking confidence. Is he a virgin? Gay in the closet? I’m not sure. I just know I’d like to kiss him and have sex with him but he’s terrified of me, it seems.

The thing is, despite how awkward he is, I’m attracted to this guy. He’s mostly sweet, and seems to be really shy. I just am at a loss for what I should (or should not) do. I’m the more experienced one here, I think, which is weird, given that i can count all the guys I’ve slept with on one hand.

I like to believe that the same phenomenon applies to getting a girlfriend. I see it everywhere that alot of men can't get girlfriends for the life of them and are always bummed out by it in some way or another.

I'm not referring to people who are simply just attractive or wealthy and lucky enough to get girlfriends easily. I'm wondering if maybe there is a lucky guy out there in the world who managed to develop the unknown and highly sought after knowledge and answer as to how to get a girlfriend. Maybe there is someone out there who managed to cleverly find a not yet known strategy that works well and can easily use it to get a girlfriend whenever he decides that he wants one in his life regardless of his wealth or looks, I know those factors play a good role but the guy Im mentioning, whoever or wherever he may be, is a guy who can get a girlfriend cuz he has the key knowledge on how to do it without insanely good looks or wealth. 

The guy probably sees past all those dumbass online advice from dumbass dudes and online articles that say ""GiRLs LIke ThIS"" or ""GIrls lIKe THat!"" And sees that they are all bullcrap and knows in his mind a more simple working method where you don't have to fake who you are or be a dooche. This guy would see the bullcrap pick up artists on the internet and tv and laugh at them because he knows that they are doing it wrong and how. He would never have to worry about being without a girlfriend because he can always fall back on what he knows.

Maybe this hypothetical man knows psychology and sociology so well that he successfully conceptualized the answer and found out how just about anyone could make a romantic relationship happen naturally.

I ended up getting pregnant. We argued and fought for weeks over what to do and ultimately I got an abortion. He pressured me into it, constantly pushing for it and I gave in. I don't regret it, but I realized how selfish he was during all of that. He promised he would be involved while I went through it all and be there after. For the most part he has been.

After the abortion he spaced out and barely talked to me. It was like he got what he wanted and was done with me. When I called him out on it, he said he needed a break since we had been fighting so much and it was stressful. I get it. We barely knew each other. He kept talking to me over text, checking in on me, trying to make conversation, calling me on the phone etc . The conversations before getting pregnant were mostly sexual and now have been more about how I am doing/feeling and lighter topics. He says he wants me to feel better and be happy. 

He did not go with me to the abortion (my choice) and I haven't seen him in person since. Our schedules make it hard to meet up which is why the casual situation was ok for both of us. My problem is he plays hot and cold. If I ignore him for a few days, he assumes I need space and doesn't text or call. This pisses me off. Sometimes he will then reach out or sometimes I will. He is super cautious about anything being serious or romantic, but he says he cares about me. He is also very insecure. He will ask why do I want to talk to him, or see him, or what do I want from him but he will never say how he feels about me. I also don't say anything back because I'm scared I will push him away because he is so sensitive about anything serious or a possibility of it going that way. I'm not lookin for anything serious either and he knows that. He is the type that mirrors what I do or say. For instance, if I'm mean to him, he is mean to me. It's an ""I asked you first"" mentality.

So my question or feedback I am looking for is wtf do I do? I don't even know if he wants to keep seeing me, even though he says he does. I don't know if he is playing hot and cold to keep me away or keep from developing feelings. Is he that scared of himself? Should I just walk away from this guy? I genuinely like him and care about him, but I'm just overall frustrated at his behavior and he knows that. He apologizes for everything and says the right things, but I have doubts. I should mention, I have not been the easiest or nicest person during this time either.

My 'relationships', I call them that because on my end they were very intentional, but didn't last more than 3 months, and it seems my exes just toyed with me until they found someone else.

&amp;#x200B;

My first experience was with a friend I knew for 7 years since childhood and I feel she betrayed my trust completely, it's something I still from time to time think of and feel really upset about. I used to reminisce about the experience I had with her and feel like we had something special and real which I will never experience again. I thought she truly liked me back and it seemed obvious to me that since the age of 15 we were attracted to each other but too scared to make a move. 

&amp;#x200B;

At 19 we dated during Summer and she said she had a crush on me for years which was mutual from my side. I spent a lot of time with her that Summer and planned to keep in touch when I got back to my studies abroad. She wanted to come to England as well to be together but she gave up on the idea because she was scared of making such a big move. When I returned to the UK and started my 2nd year at university I had a lot of coursework to complete and had to learn to animate in 3 different mediums including computer generated animation and make everything from scratch in just one semester, the tasks were completely new to me.

&amp;#x200B;

When I discussed about what I am learning she dismissed me and told me I am boring and too interested in what I am studying. I was also overwhelmed with my studies as I had too many things to learn and do, and didn't have 24/7 to dedicate my attention to her anymore like in Summer, which she hated me for. I tried to discuss her feelings still, reassure her and talk everyday with her but she started being very negative to me, dismissing everything I said and critical. The gap between how she treated me that Summer and during the semester was abysmal. She then ghosted me for 1 month and returned to show me pictures of dating several guys on Tinder, note that was my first introduction to dating apps. I found her overwhelming &amp; suffocating when she was negative and demanding to me, then found her heartbreakingly distant and malicious when she disappeared on me.

&amp;#x200B;

I felt deeply hurt and sad, but she shut me down and didn't allow me to express any of my feelings. I also noticed I have always been the one listening to her, but when I was having a rough time at home with my mother once she told me 'Please move out and don't come to me with your anxiety, if you are going to become a sponge of anxiety I don't want to hear from you'. She often had episodes of feeling down and very negative and I was listening to her and trying to cheer her up but she was downplaying my availability and willingness to be there for her.

&amp;#x200B;

When she showed me pictures of one specific guy she was meeting behind my back she introduced him as a friend to me and talked about him like she really fancies him. I didn't say anything to show my hurt but she was telling me and accusing me of being jealous and upset I can't control her which I never tried to. She attempted to convince me to meet with the two of them next Summer but I didn't want to because it hurt and I decided to end the friendship, she was the first to suggest it and seemed really not bothered at all with losing me. I'd venture to say she seemed quite pleased that I am out of her way and she can now date this guy instead. 

&amp;#x200B;

Next Summer I found out they were dating. It then just clicked to me that she was trying to set me up to be a side piece watching them evolve as a couple, I think she has antagonised me in her head and felt right to do me like this. I felt betrayed and resentful at her even if no longer in touch. After 1 year I tried dating again, I told myself there can't be another woman as bad as the one that was my first love, so I still had a semblance of confidence and faith when approaching women, which note I no longer have!

&amp;#x200B;

I still carried a lot of hurt and I tried to overcompensate it with a 'strong' tomboyish persona, but deep down I felt very depressed and robbed of my happiness. I wish I had someone to reassure me and be there for me but I had no one, and my parents seemed even colder and dismissive than usual to me. I was on my own truly and when this new girl I met on an app showed to care about me and be attracted to me I instantly felt happy and alive again.

&amp;#x200B;

Looking back, she wanted someone that is dominant and a leader. I thought I could be that for her as long as she communicates clearly what she wants from me, and I really liked her. As the few months went by I figured she didn't like the real me and the more she got to know me the less she liked me. When I told her about my past and my insecurities she gradually lost attraction to me. When we first met we made out a lot, then of following few dates I noticed she wanted to have sex immediately with me, but would want me to make all the moves and she was waiting lying down. I saw her looking at me like she is testing to see if 'I got what she wants and know what to do' and when I tried to communicate with her she said she doesn't want me to ask just to do it. I didn't want to have sex with her because I was afraid she will leave me so I put if off and never had it, even though I was attracted to her and had fantasies of doing it. My first love was actually good at this part and she communicated with me so we did have intimacy, unlike my last ex. 

&amp;#x200B;

After she figured I am afraid to sleep with her she started making passive aggressive jokes hinting I am submissive and putting up a front. I felt ridiculed. She also started a soft ghost on me. Didn't talk to me for weeks and when I tried to talk to her she lied to me that she is studying, but then posting on social media that she is out with her friends. It felt like I didn't matter to her anymore, and that got confirmed soon. She told me I am worthless and that she never loved me. I blocked her and stopped talking to her. Similarly when after 2 years I reached my ex thinking of getting closure, she seemed to feign how sorry she is, just so I don't tell anyone. I reached her again and confronted her more directly telling her how I feel and she put her boyfriend to pretty much verbally abuse me and tell me I am all sorts of insults. My ex also said she felt weird being with me and that she was never into women. It's been 3 years.

&amp;#x200B;

After this I felt like I am not good enough for anyone and that I need to work on myself to prove my worth. I instead focused on graduating and getting jobs, improving my skills, all while denying my need for friendships or love. I felt like the resentment I have gathered inside would make me a monster if I tried dating again, so to avoid hurting myself and others I have stayed off for 3 years from relationships. I have grown more numb and cold and depressed, but functioning enough to figure out how to get jobs and work. When I went to therapy I felt like my therapist doesn't know how to help me, so she focused instead on my relationship with my mother and jobseeking. I did improve in those areas a lot, but I still feel empty inside and handicapped when it comes to relationships.

&amp;#x200B;

When I go online I just see the types of women my exes were and I see all hints and signs in their dating profiles that they will in some way or another be displeased with me, or use me. And my luck isn't great either, women seem to be bored with me, and the only time I see people interested is couples looking for a side piece. I had one couple ask me if I am nice and pristine down there and then asked me to drive 2 hours to their place and lick their arseholes which I politely denied. I am monogamous so this is out of question.

I am looking to hear your perspectives based on this occasion I recently encountered. To give some context and  important information I think it is appropriate that I start by describing “ myself” or more accurately my circumstances. I had lived in Toronto for the first twenty years of my life. At eighteen my father and I purchased a remote property (lot) roughly 600 KM north of the city to begin fulfilling our dream of building an off-grid camp/cottage. Every year afterwards we have spent six months out of twelve months(June to December) building and developing our property. And the remainder of the six months working and saving back in Toronto. This fall we permanently moved from Toronto. I am currently returning home from a trip to Toronto for the holidays(to see my mom and brother). During my stay, I messaged some friends from elementary school on Instagram out of boredom/curiosity(people I haven’t seen in seven years) and surprisingly they wanted to meet up. Two of the girls came over to my moms flat later that night. We made food, had some drinks, caught up, an genuinely had a great time. Now I don’t profess to be some sort of expert in the game and honestly my experience is little to none( you know living in the forest and all). But I’m not so thick that I wouldn’t have noticed the vibes I was receiving from both of them. It was pretty obvious. Anyhow, with there being both of them thereI I did not act on anything. The one girl was a lot more my type(don’t misunderstand they were both very nice and sweet!) but the one had caught my eye from the beginning. We will just call her…Jada to make things easier. Eventually they had to leave so I walked them out and just like when I met them we hugged goodbye. Though I couldn’t help but notice that Jada’s hug was quite lovely in particular. Fast forward to this morning(the next day) and I had sent a video of a song that I played on guitar (as promised) because they were upset that they missed the opportunity to hear me play that night. Both complimented me on the video and Jada sent me a photo of myself from our grade 8 yearbook. I don’t know what to think of all this. I kinda like this girl a lot and have liked her in the past. Which she is aware of because I told her so when talking on Instagram about 4 years prior to this and we almost ended up going out together then..She is very aware of my lifestyle, where I live and the time I devote each year to my property. I live 600km from her. I’m hesitant to even start talking to her because I am pretty sure a relationship at such a distance could never survive. I should mention she is in university and couldn’t move away even if she wished to do so. So what do you think?

I am always very genuine during my dates and have a caring attitude towards my dates. Most of my first dates are 6 hour plus long dates (as opposed to 1-2 hours typical for first dates). Girls always seem to enjoy the time and they are usually the ones to suggest one activity after the next during our first date. Yet, I am always surprised by when I am ghosted by girls so frequently even after having a nice time with them.

Whenever I have had been in a relationship and had to break up or even whenever a girl asks me out for a second date but I am no longer interested in her, I always empathetically let the girl know explicitly that I would not like to see her further romantically. In fact, I check on the girls I have been on multiple dates with if they are doing fine after breaking up with them.

I have ghosted just two girls after going on a date with them. I met one of them in a park, didn’t like her, and explicitly told her that I was not interested in seeing her when she asked me out to meet again. She kept on bugging me and it got to the point that she got so clingy and creepy that I had to block her (I had no choice). I do empathize with women as this happens a lot more frequently with them but before I blocked her, it was much worse than what most women might have experienced with the creepiest of the guys in my opinion. The other girl I ghosted is one I felt so bad for for a long time. I was really going through some other stuff in life and couldn’t see her anymore. And I feel bad for ghosting her rather than telling her I couldn’t see her anymore.

Yet, I am so frequently ghosted by women as if it’s no big deal. I have been on full day long dates with the girls telling me multiple times that they would like to see me again soon and that they’re having a great time. However, when I make conversation after the date, I do not even receive a reply back with half the women I meet. I get it that people prefer to keep others hanging and have them as an “option” but I find it extremely uncool to not be explicit about your intentions even when asked so.

It doesn’t even seem like those girls just pretend to be having a good time. Most of the times, they are the ones who keep on prolonging the date one activity after the next (outdoor activities, food, movie, or an activity that requires us to take our clothes off, etc). They share the check a lot of times so it’s not even like they use me just to feed them and show them around. Some girls I have been on multiple dates with have mentioned to me how dreamy our first date was. So, getting ghosted has always surprised me.

Question: Does it just happen with me or is it common with others too? Is it common for girls to ghost guys with guys finding it uncool to do so due to which they let the girls know about their lack of interest in seeing them again if that’s the case instead of ghosting them?

We’ve been together for 2 and a half years. The beginning of our relationship was great because, obviously, it was the “honeymoon” phase. Even though we are complete opposites, we still fell for each other. 

Us being so opposite at first didn’t really seem to bother me, but when we moved in together after a year of dating.. the differences exploded in my face. 

It’s little things. Im a very open person and I don’t really any rules for boundaries. He’s very private. I don’t mind if he comes in the bathroom while I’m in there, but he won’t let me come into the bathroom with him at all. In fact, he locks the door every single time. He refuses to let me see his phone. I can’t even touch his phone to check the time or he’s running after me. 

Im a very affectionate person. My love languages are physical touch and spending quality time. He does not like being touched. I can’t rub his back or any part of his body. He tells me to wait until he’s sleeping to touch him so he won’t know I’m doing it. We don’t hold hands. We don’t kiss. Every time I ask for a hug or kiss, he sucks his teeth and says “HM” like it’s a chore. We barely spend any quality time together. His definition of quality time is me watching him play his PS5 or watching YouTube videos. We rarely go out, and when we do go out it’s because I begged him.

I can’t initiate sex, it never works. I have to wait for him to want to have sex and that is once or twice a month. In the beginning of our relationship, we would have sex 3 times a week!

I know it sounds bad, but I like him the best when he drinks. He’s more open and more affectionate. More talkative, and will talk about his feelings. He is diagnosed with depression but stopped taking meds years ago and is not getting any mental health treatment. I’m not sure how severe his depression is but I do believe it is affecting our relationship.

Then i saw him still felt neutral when i usually had these intense extreme emotions everytime i saw him, we made out still felt normal and just ‘😐’ , its just that i loved him so much last year that i couldnt love anyone else or catch feelings towards anyone else but now i want to feel love i want to enjoy it, but i can’t. Has anyone ever been thru this? Does it get better? Did u stop being numb and started feeling things? Problem is he’s the nicest guy u can ever meet he kept telling me that he’s so in love with me and that his brian couldnt handle how much he loved me and that he doesnt believe that what we have is real and kept telling me how much he loved me.

I’m a first-timer posting here, and I’m also posting from mobile, so I’m sorry about any formatting issues!

I (21F) have been dating my boyfriend (21M) for about a month and some change now. Over the course of our relationship I have come to learn that my bf is the sort of man who prefers ass. Obviously I see no issues here, I’m a bisexual woman so I can see the appeal (however I, myself, prefer the chest region lmao). 

The issue here comes to the fact that 
A.) I don’t have much of an ass, it is simply genetics. My moms sides of the family are all full-chested and flat-assed, and that’s the side of the gene pool I mostly fell in. He’s still generous with the booty-love and doesn’t neglect her at all, which is wonderful. The problem comes to- 

B.) He has a slight staring problem. Unfortunately however, it’s not staring at me. If there is for example a waitress, a coworker (we work in the same restaurant), etc. he is just staring or constantly stealing glances. It’s hard for me to feel confident and to not compare myself to others when he’s looking at bigger and better butts right in front of me like this. 

I try my best not to be jealous, and honestly I’m not all that jealous- it kind of just makes me feel bad about myself. 
I admittedly haven’t really brought this up to him at all, in my defense I have just become set in the way of sucking it up and taking it because I got tired of being called ‘sensitive’ and ‘a crybaby’ for bringing up stuff that bothered me over the course of my lifetime every time I confronted someone for doing it saying something that bothered me. 

My question is how I can politely bring this up? I don’t care what porn he watches, or whatever goes down whenever I’m not there (as long as he isn’t cheating of course), I just want him to have a bit of respect or tact at the very least, whenever I’m around.

Pretty sure I got shadow banned from tinder because while I used to have no problems matching and getting dates, I stopped getting any activity at all.

I'm really tired. My grandpa passed on Christmas Eve. My parents are getting divorced. The woman I dated this summer still wants to be in my life, but I'm too anxious to try being friends with her.

A lot of same interests and such. She is very busy and doesnt live closeby, we tried to meet up a couple of times but didnt work out. Then finally last week we met up, immediately for about 5 days as well, actually with part of her family as well. So basically our first date was 5 days long. It went really well, like really well, she pretty much agreed herself. We have a lot of common interests too and made a lot of jokes. Lot of positive things to say about that, even the ending went well. Despite that I do have mixed feelings about her reflecting back on everything, so Im just gonna name some things that happened, hope anyone can give advice, both men and women (please address your gender when replying):

\- The day before the last one she told me we're still strangers. To me thats weird, because we've talked for such a long time and such. Tbh Im actually taking a bit offense to being called a stranger still. Perhaps its a cultural difference or something, but Im really not sure. 

\- She talked a LOT of stories constantly about guys hitting on her and dating and such. Really annoying actually. Seems a lot like bragging. Makes me also feel insignificant, unappreciated, and like Im totally not special out from the crowd. Like Im not good enough and competing with many other guys just for her. Honestly I could label myself at least as 8/10 or 8.5/10: virgin, pretty handsome, virtuous, faithful, wise, intelligent, husband-material and funny. Off course some preferences differ between people. I do feel telling her she should just go ahead with those other guys.

\- She literally said there was this ''very, very, very attractive guy'' in a particular story. It was a serious, non-sarcastic tone. I find that pretty disrespectful tbh because I literally traveled 1500 km to meet up with her for a date. I absolutely would never say such a thing.

\- Noticed on her telephone that she actually had Tinder as an app... she claims to be rather Catholic and all, if Im correct she is still virgin (not fully sure about that. I only date non-virgins which I made clear many times is very important to me, just like women perhaps dont date short guys or those who only want intercourse). I never expected her to be the type to be using Tinder as an app, since we met on a Christian dating app. I was quite shocked when I noticed it. She really isnt the type to do hookups, I trust her on that, but I dont like the idea of her chatting, flirting and even dating other guys while dating me. Im not sure she does this however at the very moment. 

\-  Very important one: literally asked her at a certain point if she wouldnt care if I'd be chatting with 10 other girls right now. Said she wouldnt, even though later she said she is a bit half-half in between. Even though there may have been miscommunition about the differences between chatting, flirting and dating. In her defense she claims just because she wants children within a few years she has every right to find a man in time. Atm Im not really sure with how many guys she is chatting/flirting/dating these days. Its pretty hypocritical from her I find since she is so much against womanizers. Personally I really am against dating multiple people at the same time, even if people are open and honest about it. I already feel guilty when Im talking with two people at the same time. I wonder what people think about this actually, is it okay to be dating multiple people at the same time?

\- In response she said I was insecure about feeling appreciated, and that its my fault/problem for taking offense. I really wonder what people reading think about this response, isnt that pretty unkind to say? To me its not about being insecure, its called having self-respect.

\- Said I shouldnt think a lot in dealbreakers, even though I made her realise she has several dealbreakers as well. In fact, everyone in the world does. 

\- Compliments mostly seem to come from my side.

Im thinking about sending her a short version of the above story in audio. I really appreciate all the responses I will get.

We laughed it off and I went on about my day. A few days later we connected on LinkedIn, I requested to follow them. We briefly messaged there but nothing inappropriate, just pleasantries.

Come to find out this coworker has a significant other. They haven’t done anything wrong, the conversation still has not been inappropriate but they have acknowledged that they enjoy talking to me more than what they should. They won’t take my phone number to text out of respect for their relationship but also messaged me multiple times a day over two days. I don’t see the difference.

I said to this person that I enjoy talking to them and getting to know them and that I am respectful of their boundaries and if at any point they don’t want to talk to me to say so. They haven’t said otherwise but the messages have stopped. There’s a response if I say something but that’s it. I ended up apologizing if I made them uncomfortable… they acknowledged my message but didn’t say if I made them feel weird about it or not.

I was shamefully strung along and deceived by someone, who my BFF now refers to as a sociopathic narcissist, for many months last year.  I feel like he totally wasted my time.  Starting on the beginning of date 4/meetup 5, which was the very next date after the first time we had sex together, he sat me down and told me he didn't want me hooking up with, dating, or talking to other guys if we were to continue having sex and seeing each other.  I didn't want to lose him, especially since I really liked how things were going with us and I was so happy to finally have someone willing to give me a consistent steady stream of sex after I'd had multiple very long sex droughts before that.  Over the months, although he took me out to multiple restaurants for dinners and kept having sex with me and I enjoyed our times together (God do I regret this now), he didn't refer to me as his GF and he also didn't do other things that I realize most BFs do for their GFs in relationships.  For example, I never got to meet his family or his daughter or even any of his friends, I have zero photos of us together, we went out to restaurants but never to any of the bars or restaurants that were his favorites where he usually hung out with friends, and we didn't spend a single holiday together even though we dated from summer until mid December.  Worse, he started becoming what I realize now is verbally abusive and a bully to me.  One day he unleashed a tirade on me when I'd done nothing mean to him at all (I was literally NEVER mean to him, in fact), it led to a huge fight, both of us offending each other after that, and eventually us forgiving and having a truce.  We were supposed to meet up again, this time I insisted he take me out to a bar where there's actual people and a bar that he actually enjoys typically hanging out at (as opposed to only going to small tucked-away restaurants outside his usual hangouts,with few people there, where he knows no one).  He agreed and we set plans.  Instead, he stood me up entirely, leaving me to fall asleep while all done up and awaiting his phone call about which location to drive to and meet him at.  He then made up a lame-sounding far-fetched excuse story the next morning, while falsely accusing/sl-t shaming me of most likely screwing someone else, then dumping me a few days later after he saw me in person one final time.  Then only after he dumped me, he freely admitted that he'd made up the whole bs story about why he'd left me hanging that night, and bragged that he had purposely stood me up because he'd in fact met an apparently much hotter chick that same night and decided to go hook up with her instead of waiting for me.  He continued to instigate me with antagonistic contacts after that on occasion, and I admit I responded to it, because I finally had the anger and sense in me to finally see him for the a-hole he was and therefore I wanted to finally stand up for myself and finally show him that I was no longer oblivious and dumb to him.  Even if I didn't respond to his texts, he would still periodically send me lewd texts, random d-ck pics, irritating ridicule, or things that were just downright condescending.  He would also brag about all the great sex acts he was getting from this new hotter chick he was seeing, and claim she was more fun because she had more ""free time"" and that she didn't care about wanting kids the way I did/do.  When I would respond in retaliation, he would then act like it was ME who was obsessive or had issues, when he'd started it.  He would then deny ever initiating contact, tell me I was crazy or needed to go back on my psych meds.  One day when I clapped back at him by text, he told me off, scolding me that I need to stop texting him especially late at night (even though most of his harassing texts were at late night!!), because it is interrupting he and his GIRLFRIEND from sleeping.  I was outraged at how he could make a first-night hookup into a GF after only a month or two, when I'd been the good girl loyal to him all those months.


I admit I was really angry and also offended and insulted by how he did me dirty that way.  He really made a fool of me, and made me feel worthless, by stringing me along but then treating the next girl so much better than he treated me.  It would have been better for me and less hurtful if he'd just been an a-hole to every girl, because at least I'd know HE was the problem not me, but by him making girls before and after me his GFs but not me, it had me questioning what is wrong with me.  To spite him, I'd written on a particular girl-power blog known for outing cheaters about him, warning girls not to date him.  I'd warned him previously I'd write about him and he laughed me off, told me he could care less if I published my opinions of him.  When he told me this one night stand chick was now his GIRLFRIEND, I was so angry, I sent him the link to the blog in retaliation for him telling me off in such a belittling, hypocritical way.  He was finally mad, told me off, then soon after posted much, much worse stuff about me in irreversible, unforgivable ways online (ways which WOULD be illegal if we'd both resided in most other states! grrrrr).  He changed his phone number exactly around the time he posted all that stuff.  Then when he posted more, he claimed in his post that he had changed his number to get me to ""stop harassing"" him, when in fact he had initiated sending me lots of stuff, and didn't change his number until he posted unforgivable stuff online.  In the year+ after that, he's continued to very sporadically harass me, this time by email.  No more d-ck pics (because he has a GF now *rolls eyes*), but occasional messages jarring at me and rubbing it in that I am shamed on the Internet.  He's also sent me a lingerie pic of the girl who quickly and eventually became his current GF, with the head cropped off, bragging that she has a better body than me.  He later sent me a pic of him and her together and yes she's blonde and gorgeous.  :(  He's also randomly sent me more bad pics he has of me, threatening blackmail on me.  Yes, I tried calling the cops, but on the one time I tried, the cranky dispatcher snapped on me and claimed the a-hole did nothing illegal and that if anything, if I confront him then I'LL be the one getting in trouble.  He also claimed I was wasting his time and tying up the police phone line.  That both scared me and pissed me off, but scared me, so I never tried calling cops ever again after that.


His crap has already gotten back to people in my life.  It literally got back to an old friend from the other side of the world!  Literally!  I had a male friend from Scotland who I and a few female friends used to hang out with a few times roughly 10 years ago on the few business trips he'd make to the US to visit some of his American friends.  He's really cute and I'd fooled around with him part of the way back then, but it didn't go any farther as I knew he wasn't the BF/commitment type, but I would still talk to him on occasion just platonic friendly small talk.  I hadn't heard from this Scottish guy at all in over 5 YEARS.  I never even told him my last name.  Randomly last summer when I was already going through a ton of bad stuff in my personal life, he randomly texted me ""Is ____ your last name?""  I'd never even told him my last name, because our friendship was THAT light and casual.  Then the Scottish guy asks if I know a guy named ___ (name of a-hole ex-non-BF), and says he ran across that guy at a casino's bar in a neighboring state, and the guy was talking all about me to everyone at a bar, telling them all this bad stuff, showing them bad pictures of me while boastfully showing them the bad stuff he wrote about me and posted about me on various websites.  He told me private details about me that I'd never ever told him, that a-hole knew about and had ridiculed me on.  He told me enough info for me to know he had in fact ran across the a-hole...SMALL WORLD!  I played dumb, pretending not to know who my Scottish friend was talking about, but the Scottish guy (who's pretty smart, given his high-end international corporate job) didn't believe me and called me out on ""lying"" when I said I didn't know the guy.


In addition to my European friend happening to have a chance encounter with this a-hole at a casino hours away from where a-hole lives, other guys have found the stuff a-hole posted about me online.  One was my neighbor, a somewhat younger guy who acted like he might be interested in me until I confessed to him that I was considering possibly changing my name to evade damage from a-hole's Internet postings possibly ruining my new job and new career.  He acted supportive at first, but went home and did exactly what I told him NOT to do, i.e. look me up online and try to find the stuff posted about me.  After that, he seemed aloof and condescending, and pretended to be interested in giving me a charity hookup (which is insulting in and of itself), then ghosted me.  I've had multiple guys from OLD sites stand me up or ghost me, and I always question if it's because of them too finding the stuff online and recognizing me from the pictures, or them having a fluke encounter with the a-hole the way my Scottish friend did.


As a result of this, and feeling helpless like nothing I do or don't do will change it, admittedly I am spiteful and angry.  Therefore, I admit I sent an anonymous email (from a different email account I made up on the fly) to him on Friday, a month after yet another out-of-the-blue ridiculing threat-to-blackmail email he sent me.  I wrote it from this new email address and used terrible spelling in hopes he wouldn't think it was me, saying I heard his family doesn't want him to be around on Christmas and he'll be spending Christmas alone and I can see why.  Yes, I was trying to be hurtful because of ALL the times he's done it to me, plus I was taking my own bad Christmas out on him.  He responded back the very next morning (but I didn't see it until yesterday, right before I met up with my BFF in the same city he lives in, coincidentally) with this:

""Facts:

Way more than a year later and you are sending me fake emails at 1:18 in the morning on a Friday Night/Holiday, [my full name]. You must still be hung up on me to be emailing me anything you think might have to do with me. How could someone you hardly knew leave such a lasting impression?

As far as your email I have no idea what you are talking about. My family doesnt have a problem with me. Im not alone because my girlfriend is spending christmas with me. I have had the same girlfriend for over a year. This below pic shows that. As you can see you look nothing comparatively and that is why I never contact you nor even care. Now back to your sad lonesome life troll.""


WHY would he send me this??!  He claimed I ""hardly knew him"", yet I saw him regularly for over 4 MONTHS.  He told me all about his childhood and stuff!  He acted like he never sent me any of his many harassing emails after we no longer associated.  In the recent past he's pretended that he didn't post the stuff he posted, that I KNOW he posted because he was the only reciepiant to the pictures that were posted online.  I know the GF pic is recent because the background makes it very obvious it was a very very recent pic of them (i.e., holiday scene in his city, with stuff that didn't exist prior to this year).  I am angry and OUTRAGED at how such an a-hole narcissitic sociopath a-hole can have a GF, and keep her around this long, yet I can't even get laid.  For example, a guy I'd been casually seeing for 2 mos wouldn't even give me sex on Christmas or act apologetic about it, which makes me think it had more to do with him not wanting me, than pure impotence.  How can guys do these things and still get a GF, especially a really pretty one?  Are looks everything?...Is that why it's so easy for his GF to get guys, including him, while I struggle and am lucky just to ever even get laid once every long while?  Is that why his XGF from before me kept getting repeat dates and him chasing after her, even though (according to what he wrote on his blogsite) he took her to a fancy restaurant on the first date and she never even thanked him??  Yet I thank guys just for hanging out with me watching TV for free, yet guys lose interest?  Why are a-hole guys having an easier time getting and keeping dates and relationships?  Please help me?


TL/DR: A real jerk that I'd dated for months last year with no two-way established BF/GF status has now been in a long-term (&gt;1yr) relationship with the really pretty blonde he cheated on me with and dumped me for.  He literally ruined my life, and ruined my chances of finding a guy interested in dating me, by posting terrible things about me including incriminating photos of me, shortly after he dumped me.  He has also continued to contact me with harassing, belittling things via email (because he changed his phone number immediately upon posting bad pics of me online, but falsely claimed he ""changed his number"" to avoid MY ""harassment"" to him, when in fact he was the one harassing me) throughout the year.  When I responded to his written abuse by anonymously belittling him in retaliation, he responded by accusing me of being obsessed with him, while rubbing it in that he's still with the chick he left me for.  I want to know, why do a-hole guys like him get pretty girls so easily, seemingly much more easily than girls can get guys?  And how can I stop him from falsely accusing me of stuff and continuing to humiliate me on the Internet and somehow seeming to run across male friends of mine IRL?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1141550,public,self,"Why does he [38M] keep belittling me [33F], then pretending that I'm the one obsessing and harassing him?",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rpx3jr/why_does_he_38m_keep_belittling_me_33f_then/,no_ads,0,,

I (24F) ended a short relationship of just over a month with a man. Over the last month and a bit, I caught major feelings for him and felt the most loved I have felt in a couple of years. However, I had slowly learned that he is not financially stable and can not land a job. We could not go on dates as he could not afford it and preferred that I didn’t pay since he wanted to be able to properly treat me well. 

I am at a point in life where I have a stable job and salary and continuing to put money aside for a house and near-future life goals. Whereas he was dropping his third college program, struggling with money and not able to get a job. I would like to have a long-term partner who is also able to support themselves with a stable job and stable paycheck, this does not mean that I am looking for someone rich. Him and my friend understood it that way and called me materialistic and unfair… I know that I am someone who is easily influenced by others opinions, so I am very saddened that people view me that way and also saddened to have hurt someone with a breakup.

We had a casual thing going on originally when he told me we had to stop sleeping with each other as he was seeing someone else exclusively. I had made it clear from the beginning that I wanted casual only, so when he became single again I didn’t feel like I was being a mug by starting up seeing him again as I didn’t feel like us was ever really an option to him anyway. I don’t think either of us viewed it as anything other than casual - that was the agreed situation.

However a few conversations etc and retrospectively I think it may have been obvious I caught feelings a bit the first time. Never communicated so can’t say for certain. But I worry he came back to me, and I felt independent and casual about it, when really I should have felt wary that he knew I would say yes.

A bit of background - at the time I was seeing him the first time, although I DID kind of catch feelings I did not allow myself to do anything about it or even really feel them. I was in a VERY bad place - my mum had just very traumatically and suddenly passed away - and I did not want to be burnt by anything else hence not wanting to start anything with meaning. Thus making it very clear no relationship was on the cards. I can’t say whether he would have wanted one at the time or not. He did a few contradictory things so I’m not really sure but I didn’t mull over it at the time as I was so closed off to the idea. It was only when it ended that I realised I missed him and not just the sex, but obviously I couldn’t do anything about it so just left it and moved on. Then he became single again and I am in this mess.

I can’t change what I did or that I decided to start sleeping with him again. I can’t change that I like him and may have been obvious in that. I also can’t change that I never communicated it the first time so will never know if I would’ve been the first option if I had. I suspect near the beginning I might have been. Near the end, I suspect not as he had already met the new girl and was interested in a relationship with her clearly.

Advice on how to act now? Do I continue which is what I want to do, and view this as a new and separate situation? or do I stop for fear his perspective is that he is using me until something better comes along? Do I speak to him about it? Explain this time around I’m looking for something more serious and be prepared to walk away if he isn’t? Or is that me being weak - should I just end it anyway?

Remember the scene from Before Sunrise, where Celine and Jesse are sitting in a restaurant and have a lot on their hearts but having an awkward feeling to begin, and they pretend to call their friend and the other person pretend to be the friend.

Believe me this method works every single time. Especially on the first date, it tells you a lot about the other person. I could never propose my girlfriend but did this phone call thing and it turned out to be in my favour.

I (F24) hung out and flirted with my college friend (M27) because I had a crush. I'm getting cold feet and want out of this

First time in this situation, please be kind to me. I have no previous relationship or dating experience and a very low self esteem that most guys take advantage of.

I have been friends with my college friend, A, for 3 years. I'm not gonna lie I've always found him attractive but he is kind of out of my league looks wise. I'm thin but below average attractive facially, never had male attention in my life and when I go out with female friends I'm a ghost. My life has been full of urequited crushes for years and thats how its going to be for the rest of my life, I don't think I will ever settle down due to looks requirements most guys have for their GF/wife.

I also believe he is out of my league because he probably has a lot of experience with women in his life yadayada.

Beginning of this year, with distance education and everything being closed down, I started talking to him more. We would chat on Snapchat, he would help me with school assignments, we would play LoL and other games and talk on Discord etc. It was funny. We would also have talks about politics and other stuff that were deeper. Suddenly this summer he asks me out on lunch. I can't go but come up with another time and date, and another activity. We go out to play minigolf, I meet his friends, a couple of weeks later we go out and play pool and have drinks etc. None of this is labeled dates. Before we meet up for pool he sends me a Snapchat selfie with lots of heart emojis. I have a bad feeling of it and don't respond or mention it.

Come september, he starts working at a bar/resturant for students and asks me to come there at his shift. I went there and talked to him for a while, it felt like he wanted to show off his bartender knowledge or something. The next day later that night at around 11-12 PM he texts me asking me to come there again but I'm already in bed so I can't.

The following months we are still writing to each other regularly, but the texts are being more suggestive and more flirty in tone. I go on with it, because this is the first time a hot dude is giving me any attention. However, one thing happens in school that makes me freak out about his intentions. He sits next to his friend and I walk past them and can hear his friend whisper my name in a low tone, but he probably didn't realize I heard it. This is when I'm thinking holy shit they are discussing me as a sexual conquest behind my back and laughing at me, because why else would his friend tease me in front of him?

However I also notice he is starting to play games as I disengage and go cold on him and hang out with other male friends. He asks curiously who I'm with when he sees my Snapchat stories of me hanging out with other guys. He later sends a pic of him and some other girl in the bar (probably his coworker), when otherwise he NEVER mentions other women in front me, never ever. Not even if I ask him. He starts flirting by calling me sweetie but backtracks when I ask if he is joking. Once I told him he is on my best friend list on Snapchat and he responded by sending a pic of him doing a heart with his hands and writing under ""best friends ❤️❤️❤️""

He acts cold and hot but ALWAYS reaches out through Snapchat if I don't write anything to him for 1-2 days. Like yesterday he sent a pic of his cat asking me what I thought of it, after I had not sent anything for days. Stuff like that.

I'm getting cold feet and want out from this. I don't know what to do I'm freaking out, since I've flirted with him before he is probably thinking of me as an easy hook up. How do I backtrack without coming off as an idiot? I just want to be loved and treated good, not seen as a sexual conquest.

Hello everyone, just wanted to ask your opinion on making meals for your partner early on in a relationship.

I’m (20F) and I just started my 1st relationship with a guy (21M) through mutual friends last month.

He’s currently in an engineering program and just started an internship Monday through Friday from 8 AM to 4 PM.
For the company he’s working at he was joking about how the food sucked.

So I’ve been contemplating making lunch for him everyday that he could pick up since my apartment is 5 mins away from his before he goes everyday. Just something casual like a bento box with rice/veggies and some form of grilled meat.

Would this be too weird or clingy especially since we only just started dating recently? I don’t want to feel like I’m pestering him too much or anything. It wouldn’t take much time on my part either since my scheduled classes aren’t until 10 AM, so I wouldn’t mind waking up early to prepare these meals for him.
