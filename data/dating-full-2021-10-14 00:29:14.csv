This is my first relationship, and I had vague idea of what I want entering into one.

From the first few dates, I have enjoyed my time with her. She is funny, sweet (with a hint of spice), responsible, and willing to share initiatives, and more. I have been attracted by her personality that I was happy to continue dating her despite other downside. I haven't had any crush on her, but I wanted to get to know her more. After all, all crushes I had in the past came after getting to know them a bit.

Fast forward few months, the relationship is going going well - kinda. We enjoy our dates, and are fairly comfortable in front of each other. Very little conflicts, and we are both mature enough to communicate. However, I still don't have the same degree of emotion to her as my previous crushes. No butterfly, no heartbeat, etc.

I have told myself that such emotion will build up with the relationship, but I see little to no improvement so far. I'm phlegmatically thankful to date a good person, but my heart is yet to be kindled emotionally. I am increasingly questioning myself whether if I will ever have a crush on her. While I don't believe relationship is all about having that butterfly, I also don't think the relationship can sustain without having any at all. My desire to explore things with her is slowly dwindling away, even though she is a great person.

I can continue the relationship, hoping that the emotion WILL build up further down. However, with my previous crushes, I have already known my feelings before I got to know them as much as my SO. It's possible that this might be a sinking relationship, but I've never experienced one to take as a reference.

I'm not afraid to become single again if the relationship will not work out, and we haven't been together for THAT long. However, she seem to have some scars from her past breakups, and last thing I want is to break her heart explaining my current feelings (which will likely spell an end for the relationship).

For some context, he and I work in the food industry and we go to the same university. We have a lot in common, and we talk frequently. He's a friendly guy, but kind of nerdy. At first, I would always be the one initiating the conversation. I'd ask him about his weekend plans and such. He would give me detailed answers, and he'd ask me questions back, but I didn't want to be the one starting the conversation all the time. So for one day, I didn't ask him any questions. I was still being friendly to him, but I didn't make any effort to have a conversation. The next day which we both work, he came up to me and started asking me about my weekend plans. It's been that way ever since; him asking me questions first. Sometimes, he won't even start the conversation; he'll just come up to me and stand next to me and not say anything, so I'll start it.

Another thing is that he's so helpful at work. Even when it's inconvenient for him to do so. For example, one time it was really busy during lunch, and he and another employee were at the register. I was in charge of expediting food. I was the only one expediting, and it was a struggle for me. Not an impossible one; but a struggle regardless. Even though there was a long line of customers waiting to pay for their food, he came and helped me for a few minutes. Another time, when it was less busy, I was at the register, and he was restocking items. I messed up, and forgot to give the customer change, so I was heading to the back to ask another more experienced coworker for help (to reopen the register, we need an ID card number to do it). But before I could go to the back, he stopped what he was doing, came up to me, and asked me what happened. I explained to him, and he tried to use his ID to reopen it. He wasn't able to, but he tried regardless. Of course, he helps other coworkers as well, but it's usually only if they specifically ask for it.

On the same day where it got really busy, when we didn't have any more customers. He asked me if I was okay. Could've been friendly coworker talk, but I thought it was interesting.

This is the first lasting thing after my marriage ended so I’ve been out of the dating loop for the whole of this new modern world of dating and feel a bit lost. 

When we do see each other we usually spend the entire weekend together as there’s a bit too much distance for regular during the week meets. I usually instigate this but he never says no and he never cancels. When we’re together there’s never any lack of conversation and we go out for coffee/food, go for walks, cinema, visit galleries - and sleep together. 

The rest of the time we talk intermittently throughout the day via text (and occasional calls) every single day. There’s no pattern to who texts first, it’s just whoever has something to say. 

He confides really personal stuff, he listens and helps when I’ve had stuff going on. And in that sense I feel like we trust each other implicitly with our feelings. Except the only thing this heart on his sleeve man doesn’t seem to have on his sleeve is how he may or may not feel about me. 

Because the thing is when we’re not in bed together we make no reference to the fact we’re sleeping together at all. We are tactile (but I don’t know if that just comes from the intimacy of sleeping together) in private and in public. But it’s more a hand in the small of the back to get the others attention rather than holding hands if that makes sense. 

So it’s beginning to feel like we’re very very close friends (because we have become that’ll) and have benefits rather than the traditional come over fwb. Is that a thing that even makes sense? Or is this what is known as a situationship?

My personal opinion? I think it’s rude. It shows a lack of interest in actually getting to know someone. Especially in the early “talking stage” of the relationship, it’s really no different from ghosting.

The fact is, we have our phones on us constantly. Except at work or when we’re asleep, when don’t we have our phones on our person, if not directly in our hands? And you can’t take a minute out of your day to check your messages? Let someone you’re supposedly interested in know that you’re still alive? How long am I expected to wait for you to dane to acknowledge my existence before I just move on?

But, maybe I’m the one in the wrong here. I recognize that a lot of people don’t like texting. They prefer phone class or FaceTime, or just talking in person. But we can’t always be around each other, and if I can’t trust you to respond in general conversation, how can I trust you to respond when it’s important?

What do you think? Is this a red flag, or do I need to get over myself?

If I did something wrong, please advise and let me know. 

Girl 1 I met in orchestra. We spent a bit of time together then after knowing her for about 2 weeks I told her I thought she was cute and we should hang out more. She said she wanted to stay friends, and I was ok with that so I asked her if she wanted to meet up and just hang out casually. Ever since then she’s been “too busy” to hang out with me. 

Thinking that maybe I asked her out too early, I met another girl in one of my classes and thought she was cute. We got a bite to eat once after class and talked for a while before going to my school’s botanical gardens. I didn’t want to scare her away like the last girl so I asked her if she wanted to get dinner sometime. She told me she was busy. I get the feeling she doesn’t want to spend time with me anymore as the situation feels similar to girl 1.

We agreed we’d give it a few months before actually putting a label. We mesh very well, extremely compatible even with slight differences. Everyone says that we look in love and that he deeply cares about me. But something I can’t get over the past few days is the need for physically intimacy.

I’m a virgin and he’ll be my first everything if I even let him. My first kiss, first boyfriend, etc. We only been on a few dates and I speak up about taking it slow and he’s very patient and consensual. 

I grew up in a really dysfunctional household. I never got hugs, kisses or compliments. So I began to think touching was weird and unnecessary. I even get uncomfortable when my girlfriends hug me or touch my shoulder. A close relative would sometimes touch me inappropriately even if it was a hug or a kiss, that was the only physical touch I could get.

I have bad memories of what could of happened but it’s mainly foggy so I can’t say exactly what happened but I’m just very uncomfortable with men touching me or touch in general.

I know it doesn’t seem like a problem but here’s the thing. He has a very high sex drive. Hyper sexual even. He controls himself very well and treats me with so much respect but that doesn’t stop me from me a bit scared. He says he needs a connections first before even thinking of sex. And even if he wants me to make the first move or waits for me to tell him to hold my hand, I can’t help but wonder if I’m progressing to slow for him. If I’m being annoying or if he wants something better. I’m just scared he’ll leave me for something I have a fear over.


Is there any way I can control my fear or let him know he doesn’t have to wait up for me. I would genuinely hate for him to suffer because I’m scared. Is there also any way I can substitute some physical intimacy for something milder? Or am I being dramatic?

I have pretty much resigned myself to resorting to online dating due to a variety of factors.  That being said, I constantly see profiles (usually ones with ludicrous requirements) getting blasted by folks.

I gave writing a profile a go, and by the time I felt like it adequately reflected me as a person, it was multiple paragraphs.  I am pretty positive there is a such thing as “too long”, and would cause people to get bored and move along, but I also don’t want to have a short, shitty one with no details.

Basically what I am asking is what sort of information do you (primarily womenfolk, but any information is appreciated) look for, how detailed, is there a such thing as too long?  Better to have a comprehensive list of things such as hobbies or other activities, or after a certain point is it better to say “I have too many to list, ask and find out.”  Especially if some of them may be turn offs for some, (hunting, shooting, etc).  Is there anything you find lots of people add that isn’t necessary?

I also know everyone has their own preference, but I am just trying to get a general grasp of what to and to not write.

On a somewhat related note, how important are profile pictures?  Photo quality, just face?  Backgrounds, just one or multiple photos?  Of me doing some of the aforementioned hobbies?  I really don’t know.  My anxiety absolutely screams at me to not add a single one, but I am fair certain the odds of getting any matches or whatever drop to almost zero without.

Appreciate any input!

Also feel free to AMA if it clears anything up or if you're just curious about anything, I have some stories I don't mind getting off my chest.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's a snapshot profile of myself: Just turned 29M, straight, 5-9 and 150, biracial (half random mix of white/half Japanese)

\*\*Some things I see as negatives that I don't want to drag me down:\*\*

\-Inexperienced. Like a virgin, hey never been on a date. Also never kissed or even held hands either, only danced with a girl once (incredibly, she grinded on me).

\-Mental health issues. A #7 aka depression, social anxiety (might be AvPD?), frequent suicidal thoughts, and insomnia on whole wheat with cheese

\-Cutting scars on wrist/forearm (but 10 years clean at the end of this month)

\-Past drug usage (2 years clean at the end of November): severe weed dependency (yes, actually), heavy but non-addicted (yes, actually) daily cocaine usage, heavy but non-addicted weekly LSD usage, occasional (once or twice a year) usage of other substances. I still drink scotch though.

\*\*Some positives that I think I can show off:\*\*

\-Educated (MA, working on PhD)

\-Exercise regularly and in good shape

\-Diverse interests (plus I \*actually\* listen to every kind of music\*)

\-Not many friends, but they’re all very close (depressingly/impressively, I'm a 3x best man at weddings)

&amp;#x200B;

An important thing I want advice on (and this is why I'm not sure this is the right place for this post) is how do I even begin to evaluate who I am in a healthy, positive, and productive manner so that I can present myself confidently on a dating platform or even on a date? Honestly, self-evaluation is something that's really difficult for me to do, both physically and mentally. My chest literally hurts just by thinking about the person I've ended up as at 29 years old, and my mind ends up getting lost in a pretty dark place. It's hard to better myself when I keep ending up down this path. I just don't know how to be less cruel, if you will, to myself.

As for other things I'm looking for advice on regarding the negatives category, how and when do you discuss negative but highly impactful aspects of your past with potential dates in a healthy manner? What have positive and negative experiences taught you about how to discuss relationship inexperience? When and in what manner is it appropriate to reveal and discuss self-harm scars?

As for the positives, I have questions about that kind of thing too. Most of my communication is done in the form of jokes, because they're engaging, entertaining, and most importantly non-personal (I have a highly inconvenient fear of being negatively judged so I cope with jokes I guess). So I don't really have much experience with sustained serious conversation in a non-work/school environment with women. So my questions are, unfortunately, extremely rudimentary. Like, how do you even begin a conversation? Honestly, this is my biggest barrier with online dating because I think way too hard about this and then I get flustered and give up. But yeah, basic questions of that nature.

I was hoping this would be a little more cathartic when i got to this point, but no, that's what scotch is for I guess. So, anyway, somebody check my brain? Any advice or discussion to help me think is welcomed, thanks.

He was cute, so I said yes. We ended up chilling and talking for 2-3 hours. He's divorced and has a 3 year old kid btw. It was really fun and we vibed and he said he wanted to do it again.

Then a few days later he asks me to come over and hang out - but the way he phrased it could have been interpreted as a booty call, so I called him out on it and he said that's not what he meant, but then kind of disspeared after that. He said he was busy that night and that he'd text me that weekend and never did. 

After that, we were friendly too each other in passing, but nothing more. It felt like we were back to just being random neighbors, so I kind of accepted the fact that he lost interest in me. Not sure if it's because I accused him of the booty call or what (any theories?). 

Then a few days later - he introduces me to his son!! I was super thrown off by this because I thought he didn't like me anymore. Super confusing, but I was like, ok maybe he's just taking it slow-

But then the NEXT night, I ran into him on a date with another young 20 year old petite blonde girl (like myself) by my building. We locked eyes and said hi to each other, but it was incredibly awkward because I basically caught him trying to sleep with another vulnerble 20 year old girl that looked similar to me. I guess that's just his way of getting girls to sleep with him? Go for the young, vuulnerble ones? 

Anyway, after that, I kind of realized that he was kind of an idiot and a creep and decided to just move on and not care. I was also kind of upset so I just decided to ignore him. Ntr for attention. Just to genuinly distance myself from him and whatever he was trying to accomplish with me. 

So the next few days, I kind of don't acknowledge him thinking he'll take the hint, but instead  he goes OUT of his way multiple times to get my attention. Sitting near me at the pool. Walking back and forth in front of me. Trying to pet my dog. He even invites his ex-wife and kid to swim in the pool a literal foot away from me - which he has never done - and gets in and out of the pool RIGHT in front of me despite multiple other places to do so. It all felt like a rouse to get me to acknowledege him. But I thought maybe I was thinking too into it until - 

The next day, I'm alone at the pool, and he walks by a few times and I don't acknowldge. He eventually comes over to say hi to me to strike a convo to see if I'll bite. I just said a polite ""Hi how are you?"" before going back to work and he got the hint and left.

But then I ran into him AGAIN later that night. Like what do I do and why won't he leave me alone?  He was not THAT interested in me until I caught him with the other blonde girl and now he wants my attention. Like what is this behavior? I don't understand. 

Can anyone, particularly older men, explain this to me? Is this his ego being bruised? Does he feel like he missed out on a cool girl?

Few months ago, we got into our first major fight because of this and because they never seem to stop despite me sharing my sentiments about them. We even took a break from each other for a couple of weeks. When we got back together, he says that they hardly talk anymore and he opened this up to her. I think that’s the closest thing he could do to give me a peace of mind. So I took his word for it and trusted him. Then just recently, while he was streaming a game, I saw a familiar name and it all went rushing in, I snapped. I confronted him about it and he said that this was the first time they talked in a few  months and that she was just asking a question.

2. Having someone come with me at grocerries or other stuffs.

7. Being spoiled on simple things
8. Being with someone out of my league.
9. Exchanging genuine messages and convo.

One evening my parents brought my son back from babysitting him and my guy was there. This was during my business hours and took place in a lobby with customers. As to keep jt in the Downlow and not make a big deal in front of customers. 
I went to my parents and I said “this is John”.
They shook hands and talked quite awhile. I went off to do a few business things a few steps away bc they were taking awhile.

My dad then called me the next day saying it wasn’t a good introduction bc “I just said hey this is John”. 

My guy didn’t seem to have any issues on his end. 

Tbh I avoid my parents bc everything I do ends in some doing something wrong and endless questions. I guess they just expected a formal introduction in front of my customers “hey this is my new boyfriend” I don’t really fucking know !


But did I do something wrong?
That’s how he introduced me to his teen daughter actually: 
“Hey holly this is Christina”.

I’m new to dating at this age and I don’t know how it all works…..

But did I handle it wrong?

Tldr parents are complaining about how I introduced new guy. Did I do it wrong

Something I always wonder and cannot seem to find a related topic on - 

When I'm out in public and passing by women, I will generally get a smile and/or eye contact from a passerby. Usually more often than not. Sometimes I can feel like I'm being watched when I'm not directly looking at a woman. And many times I notice a woman will fix or preen her hair when I am approaching. Are these things that women consciously or subconsciously do when they see an attractive person just in passing, like at a grocery store? Am I reading too much into it?

I know there isn't a definite yes or no/one size fits all to this. Just curious. I am not really trying to brag, kind of the opposite actually, as I do struggle a good bit with my self image and esteem, even after many years of working on it. I'm in a much better place now.

Hello, I am 25, Chubby and Morena from the Philippines. I have been single for a while, almost 4 years. Despite of being in a relationship before, I never experienced real and true love. I never experience being cared for and its all about me begging them to stay. Its all about one sided shits that made me doubt if I really deserve love. And as my time goes by, I got confused on how love should be. I never had a clear idea on how it goes. All I know is that I should do everything for them so that they will not leave me. I am really longing for love. I am looking for a guy (tall, kind, caring, attractive +++) to pretend as my boyfriend.

Just for the reason that I want to experience someone coming to fetch me at work and tell stories too. I am chubby, not too pretty but I am confident and I like intellectual conversations.

I am posting this in the hopes of finding a group where I can find someone to make me experience love, because I really want to experience the basic things that couples do that I never experienced. I just want to be genuinely happy and experience real dating. Not a one sided dating, or a relationship involving sex desires only.

1. Being fetched from work to home and vice versa
2. Having someone come with me at groceries or other stuffs.
3. Have a coffee date.
4. Have a genuine and sincere date.
5. Cuddle with Love
6. Hearing genuine and sweet compliments
7. Being spoiled on simple things
8. Being with someone out of my league.
9. Exchanging genuine messages and convo.

Some of you might think that I am desperate and yes, I am. I have been alone, and never been in someone’s choice all my life. And for the first time in my life, I desire to be a priority. Even in just pretend game, even if its fake. I just want to feel how genuine love can be to someone like me.

I know I've offered more than once.
Unfortunately there's a problem with that, and it's not on my end. I've heard many a woman proclaim 'This guy bought me a drink, then he came over and wouldn't leave me alone'. Like Wanda Sykes.
Now, if you start talking and realize you're not interested *that's a different matter*. When you indicate you're done talking then the guy *should* leave you alone. It's the complaining that he tried to talk to you *at all* that's the problem.
The problem, or miscommunication rather, is that there's a protocol that most women (in my experience) don't know. As such, I feel the need to educate.
When a gentleman buys a drink for a lady she can either accept it or not. If the lady looks at him and decides she's not interested (or married, has a boyfriend, etc.) then she should decline the drink.
Accepting the drink is an invitation to come over and talk.
So, if you decide to accept a drink ladies, don't complain when he comes over to talk, or at least tries to. Even better, if you ARE interested, tell the bartender to ask him to come over, or go over to him.

Note: The reverse applies to us too guys, as well as whatever gender/gender preference combo is applicable to the reader. Also, if the person you buy the drink for accepts and isn't interested, just leave it alone. Again, the same if you start talking and they make an obvious move to end the conversation.
If you aren't sure, ask.

We are in Japan, he's an ALT, and I am in the IT field. He asked if we could meet up on the first Saturday after we matched on Bumble, but we moved it to the next Saturday instead. So as a Filipina, we like taking things slow. And I personally, I always have a hard time being comfortable with someone who I just met.

So when he arrived at the station near my place, he asked if he could take a bath at my place first because he just went on a hike, and he stunk of sulfur from the natural hot spring. This really made me uncomfortable because he will know my place, but what can I do about it, he reeks of sulfur so I let him in my place. We went to Starbucks after to chat for a bit, he insisted to pay for it. I only ordered a drink so that's only like 4-5$ and I'd gladly pay for my share. Initial plan is that we'll watch a movie but the movie we wanted is scheduled late so he suggested to go to a Karaoke place instead, and I was so disappointed that he let me pay 20$ for our stay. Personally, if you asked for a date, if you suggested places, you can at least pay half. Now, I am not sure if I want to go out with him again. Paying is not a big deal for me, but if he asked me out, I'm hoping he pays at least half. Like, he didn't really bother to pay for his share, and offered just a few cents. Maybe he was thinking he drove to my area, so I should pay for our date because he took extra effort to come meet me? But I didn't offer anything in the first place, and it was all so fast, we haven't even been talking that much. It felt like I owe him for meeting me when I'm really not that interested with him.

Then, we went home. I asked if he was hungry so I prepared something just for him. He stayed at my place to chat some more but I was really not in the mood so I got myself busy with my laptop instead. I know, dick move, really really rude of me. But I was just hoping he'd offer to just leave and head home but he was planning to sleep over, so I told him he can't since I only have one single bed, and no extra futon.

I'm not sure what to expect with American guys on dating. This is my first time to date an American.

Hey everyone. To start, I’m a 21M dating 21F for 5 months. This is my first serious relationship, but I have experience casually dating/ hanging out with other women in the past. For as long as I can remember, I have wanted a serious relationship. In the past, I tried to force myself to find one, but I found that I had to wait for when the right person came at the right time. When I was least expecting it, I found someone truly special. When we met at first (about 1.5 years ago), I didn’t think she was going to be a long term partner (just thought we would hang out a few times) but quickly I realized that she was exactly what I was looking for. I decided to settle into a relationship with her (my main concern was the distance/ trust; we are both in college far from each other but live in the same city at home). I have loved being in a relationship with her, but things have started to change. First, being apart because of school is obviously tough, but 100% worth it because I know I love her. She has a difficult major and multiple extracurriculars, so we haven’t been able to talk as much. She seems so much more stressed than usual, and she isn’t great about communicating/ saving time for herself. We don’t talk as much, which is fine but difficult. The main thing that worries me is her behavior. She used to love physical intimacy and talking about it/joking about it. Now she is telling me that she doesn’t like to talk about sex, and the last time I saw her for a weekend she even said she’s not sure if she wants to have sex as much (which is hard for me to understand since I only see her every 4-5 weeks except for when we are home). I already told her once that I was totally fine with having less sex this summer when she brought it up before (maybe once or twice a week which was less than I would have liked but I was totally okay with). Now she cites worrying about pregnancy/ being a good person as the reasons why. She also said “I may have fallen in love with someone who wasn’t her” (in regards to her sex drive and relationship with sex) although I know I love her the way she is now. I just want her to be happy, but I don’t know if  I can take less physical intimacy than I already get (about once a month). She said she loves me more than anything, and I feel the same. Im very confident she isn’t cheating, so is she just losing interest? (She said she isn’t at all) Can this relationship last? If so, what do you recommend? I’m just confused, but I love her and want this to last. Thank you and Sorry for the length.

TL;DR : 
I love my girlfriend of 5 months, but the shrinking physical aspect and proximity to one another (long distance) has made things difficult. Don’t want to breakup; what do I do?

Would love some advice to help boost my spirits at the moment.

My boyfriend (30) is Lebanese and I (29) come from an Italian and Greek background. We are very serious, are in the process of opening up our own business and will be getting engaged soon. Although we were both born in America, his family is very much so against him being with anyone woman who isn't lebanese. They do not approve of us being together and it has really been taking a toll on me these last few months. 

When he first told them about me and his intentions on marrying me, many hurtful things were said which I unfortunately overheard. In their eyes he will be settling if he chooses me, ruin his family's reputation, and that every American woman lies and cheats on their husbands. Even though they have had many sit downs trying to talk him out of being with me, he remains open with them about his intentions and never lets anyone disrespect me. He tells me everyday that he knows who I am, and if his family doesn't want to give me a chance it is their loss and their ignorance is to blame, not my background. 

I am trying my hardest to not take this personally. I know they are very proud of their culture and are scared that if he ends up with someone outside of it he will no longer carry out their beliefs. I have made it a priority to learn to speak lebanese and also how to cook all different meals his mom makes to show how much his background means to me and how his culture will always be relevant in our life together. It hasn't made a difference in their eyes whatsoever.

Any advice on how I can remain confident and feel worthy enough to be in this relationship when so many people are speaking otherwise?  I am trying my hardest to be understanding and even more importantly forgiving because if the day ever does come where they accept me, I want to welcome them with open arms. I am a very loving and caring person and this whole experience has made me realize how weak I actually am.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1065720,public,self,Advice for relationship with different cultures,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q7utfl/advice_for_relationship_with_different_cultures/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,

Not someone that I regularly work with, but somebody that I'm regularly around. We got a drink after work one night &amp; she invited me to a fun event with her and her friends. I decided to take her up on it. Me, her, and her friends all ended up having a great time, and some sparks were flying between the two of us so we ended up making out before departing our separate ways. Over the course of the next month, we ended up hanging out frequently, hooking up, and sleeping over. Over the course of the month I opened up about the fact that I wasn't into the whole hook-up/casual thing anymore, that I was looking for something with more substance &amp; was basically over that phase in my life. Interestingly enough, she was the first to broach this subject. It was something we connected over &amp; spoke much on the first night we decided to hang out. 

So the other night we were hanging out again, hooking up &amp; having a good time. Eventually I decided to ask what we were, if we were dating/wanted to explore that, or whether we were just hooking up. I didn't think it felt inappropriate or too soon to ask, but perhaps I was wrong. She immediately said ""I don't want to hurt you"" (and kept saying it) and then proceeded to talk about how great of a guy I was/how good the sex was (It's OK. She's kinky and fun, but she's only gotten me off once while I make sure she finishes every time) but that she didn't want a relationship. This surprised me, as our beliefs about that were something we'd initially connected over. I responded casually, letting her know that I respect her boundaries (which I obviously do), while also hiding the fact that I felt pretty hurt by this. I've had some sexual trauma in the past, and I'm honestly not seeking any hookup/FWB situations right now, something I thought I'd made clear. Since then, I've been a bit distant while processing/deciding how I want to proceed. She's been kind of fishing for me to ask her to hang out, the same way she'd been doing it before. I just haven't taken her up so far, since I need to figure out where my head's at. I also felt blindsided by this as we were doing relationshipy things beyond a FWB situation. We'd go on walks/hikes together, she'd want me to stay the night when we hooked up, she's always trying to be close/next to me, she's told some coworkers that we're involved, and  
we were watching a show together (I know that's stupid af, but that's not something I've ever done with a FWB). 

TLDR: She says she doesn't want a relationship. I respect and believe her, but her actions and words have been quite misleading and she still really wants to spend time with me.

I started working with this girl back in February, asked her out initially in May and she said no. Fast forward to last month and we went on a night out as friends and there was clearly something between us, and she told our mutual friends that she had wanted to get with me that night.

So I asked her to go for a drink some time a few weeks ago, and she said yes and now we're meeting up on Friday. Problem is that this is my first date in about six years since I got out of a long term relationship in March and I honestly have no idea how the fuck you're meant to escalate something on a date.

I'm not worried about the conversation or anything because we're already friends and get along really well, it's solely the escalation part of it to a more romantic thing. Anyone have any tips on how to make a move on a friend on a first date with them, or just general advice on how to proceed?

Including women and they usually find me funny and creative.  I have also had a few girlfriends.  Issue is I am currently single and looking, most of my friends are either married or in dedicated relationships.  Of course, I look for opportunities elsewhere besides going out but I am asking a specific question here for reference.  


I have some anxiety going out on my own now, even though I can enjoy it when I am just relaxing.    


Issue I am trying to solve is approaching a group of women, because mostly girls are together whether it would be at a bar or nightclub.  There are exceptions but I want to get better at what is currently difficult to me.  In a group of my friends and us talking to girls, I have never had an issue.  


But I guess I have some anxiety when it is just me and 3-4 girls I am approaching.

Do I focus on one completely that stood out to me and basically start ignoring the others?  


Or do I try to focus the conversation in a way that can include everyone there first and then wing it based on if I pick up signals on who seems interested?

What I have done a few times is approach and point out something special or interesting about one of the girls and try to start a conversation.  1 on 1 is alot easier for me, but my brain becomes a little hyperactive when there are multiple people bc there are alot more variables and thoughts going through my head.  


I guess I would ask women if it is different when one guy alone approaches you and your group of friends vs a group of friends approaching your group of friends?  


Obviously I know it shows confidence but it seems more difficult to master.

I would ask guys if you often go for this strategy or do you prefer just to find a girl who looks bored or disinterested and feel like it would be easy to start a conversation with them?

I tend to wing things alot on approaching 1 on 1 and it works well. But in this case, it seems like not having some sort of idea of what you want to do going in make might things harder.

I would appreciate answers that focus on this issue in particular, not why don't I do X instead of trying this.

So I \[25 M\] am seeing someone \[22 F\] for just over a month, There was a very strange episode today and I am struggling to see what it meant...

Some back story. She has some history of experiencing vertigo. I've seen her experience it twice already and she usually just needs a second to breath and it works out and continue on.

Now further backstory, I did have issues with how fast this individual wanted things to go from the start. For example: asking to be exclusive in 1 week, saying ""I love you"" the next day after that, and then attempting to schedule meeting her parents for the second week. I communicated this to her and it has slowed down a lot and honestly been going good. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Now on to today. I am driving her home from some Halloween activities. I pull up in front of my house when she says she is getting vertigo. I am checking up on her asking if she is okay and she nods and nods and suddenly goes limp. She seems to stop breathing for about 8 seconds. I find her pulse and am getting ready to call 911 and start CPR when she starts breathing again. I tell her ""stay awake, keep breathing"" and she nods and I can see she is breathing harder. I work in the medical field and do notice her heart rate to be a bit fast around 90-95 BPM.

&amp;#x200B;

She then seem's to go incoherent and starts saying random things. ""I love this sunset"", ""No, I don't want to go"".... ""Did I tell you I met somebody else?""

&amp;#x200B;

This last one seemed more coherent to me, so I responded ""No? Who'd you meet?""

&amp;#x200B;

And she said ""This awesome guy, mom. I want to marry him, but I don't want to scare him away""

&amp;#x200B;

She then said some additional things that didn't make sense. About 1 minute later, she comes out of it and opens her eyes and asks where she is. She is able to start becoming aware. I stay with her another 10 minutes before she says she is sure she is good and she leaves back to her house. The only comment about it she made was right before leaving she said ""Yeah.. I was thinking about my mom for some reason""

&amp;#x200B;

My question... what was that remark? I almost feel like this was a stunt or something? I have no idea. I did not say anything in the moment and completely gave her the benefit of the doubt to make sure she was ok.
