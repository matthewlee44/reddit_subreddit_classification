Met a girl at my retail job about a year ago. Started talking to her and she started joining me on my breaks at work just about everyday we worked together. She immediately caught my interest as in my experience girls who are not interested do not go out of their way to talk to me or take breaks with me

Over the next 6 months i started to get to know her better in time we spent talking on our breaks. These talks would usually end up going 5-15 minutes over our scheduled break time once we got to know each other better. 

She started asking me more personal questions about my life, interests, and school. Alot more personal questions than ive ever had with any other co workers. She would ask about my family and follow up on the things I told her. 

She told me a lot about herself as well and always seemed excited to sit down and talk with me. She always wanted to know what I was up to on the weekends and told me she wanted to go to some museum once the pandemic was over. 

She even mensioned to me that she was single on valentines day and asked if i gad any plans. Then proceeded to randomly tell me that a few coworkers hit on her but she wasn’t interested. I changed the topic as i was un comfortable. 

 After about 6 months i finally got up the nerve to ask for her number. She gave it to me with no hesitation.  Texted her the next day and we texted back and forth about 6 times until i got distracted and didn’t get back to her until the next day. Texted her the next day and had to go to bed early and left the convo. 

The next day I texted her but got no response… thought i was ghosted but then texted her a day or two after and she texted back  I then asked her if she wanted to go out on a date to which she said she didn’t think she could because she had a brother with health issues and may me vulnerable to the pandemic. I thought this was her way of rejecting me. 

I told her i understood and I wouldn’t talk to her anymore. I understand how awkward it can be to be asked out and I didn’t want her to be un comfterbal. She said I didn’t need to do that as she really enjoyed our relationship. She told me to treat her the same and said a few other things that confirmed she understood I asked her out. 

Didn’t talk to her or hear from her until I saw her at work next. I tried to avoid her but that was impossible once she sat down with my on my break. We talked for an hour and the topic of that never came up. I didn’t know where I stood or how she felt about the whole thing. I decided i just needed to get over her

I texted her a few days later and asked her if it was ok if she could not talk to me at work because I needed to get over my feelings for her. I also told her I thought she was a cool person and was my friend, but I just needed some time but id like to remain friends. 

She told me that she was into someone else and I tried to convince her to shoot her shot because i thought we were just friends at this point. She agreed to being friends and I thought everything was fine until the next time i saw her she seemed very upset. 

It was not my intention to hurt her in any way, i just didn’t want her to feel uncomfterbal or anything like that. I texted her that afternoon and said it was ok if she wanted to talk to me at work again but i got no response

She seems to be aware and knows when people are hitting on her. She seemed used to it so idk why she wouldn’t just tell me she wasn’t interested. 

I went up and tried to apologize to her the next time i saw her but she wouldn’t even face me and said she just wanted to be vague. 

Today I was sitting in the break room alone minding my own business then she sat down across the room. My friend called me and after 30 seconds of talking to her on the phone, she gets up and hurries out of the break room. Just kinda weird.

TL;DR: met a girl and thought we clicked.

In my heart I do want to keep seeing her, but in my head I feel I should end it as it’s drawing too much of my attention away from my own goals.

I [F25] am in a little bit of a predicament. I‘ll start with John[M39]. I met John 2 months ago through OLD. Things were going great, I trusted him, the sex was awesome and he seemed genuinely interested and happy to be with me. He is an older guy who runs his own business but would always go out of his way to text every morning, or even check in throughout the day. 

Last week I told John that I was going to be on staycation for the next couple of weeks and that I wanted to see him….Absolute crickets. I haven’t heard from this man in an entire week. Do I leave it? 

Now onto Harold [M35]. Him and I had been talking for much less time. Possibly two weeks but have known each other for months. We work within the same company but not together. He expressed a lot of interest in me and just like John, would go out of his way to check up on me. 

I asked him some questions about his day about 2 days ago and…More crickets. No response, no follow up, just….Silence.

I haven’t reached out to either of them because at the end of the day, if you can go 2 or more days without talking to me then you aren’t interested in me. I’m so confused as to why this keeps happening and how I can deal with the rejection? I’m really unsure of what I’m doing.

Also to put things into context. I’m not clingy, overbearing or text all day. I have a busy job and text back when I can but always put in effort. I expressed interest in both men and they expressed interest back, openly and in person. This was very out of the blue.

Even when applying the most severe and unrealistic of beauty standards to this guy and analysing him through every single lense possible, I literally just couldn't see how anybody could consider him *that* ugly, hell, I would have still considered him to be above average.

I dated a girl for about 5 months in early 2020. She was beautiful and mysterious and quirky and weird and she was head over heels for me. The conversation was stimulating, we shared the same quirky sense of humour and the sex was incredible. She also happened to have an extensive mental health history and an incurable personality disorder and over time this became apparent with gaslighting and lying and I had to distance myself from her until we broke up, twice. We have never spoken since.

I know that there was no possibility of living a happy normal life with her but the passion and chemistry is not something I have experienced before... or since. And this truly haunts me.

I have been with many women since then, trying to find a connection, but I can't. I have managed to pinpoint the feeling that something is lacking to a few features: shared quickly/weird humour and conversation. I can be conventionally funny but I have a pretty surreal sense of humour and I like making up words and singing bizarre little songs and she is pretty much the only person outside of my brother and male friends who really clicked with that. Conversation wise she just seemed to have interesting takes on topical issues that I rarely find, she could play devil's advocate and be a little controversial but in an intelligent way. I mostly find that on dates I am entertaining someone with my conversation rather than having a true back and forth, or just discussing topics in a fairly dry way.

She was all this whilst being head turningly hot too.

At the time I felt like it was no problem, I'd find someone with those qualities who didn't happen to have a severe personality disorder that revealed itself later, but every single time I meet someone and give it a chance I honestly just feel nothing. It's been almost 3x more time since I left her than we were actually together and still I feel like I am getting nowhere.

So I’ve been talking on and off to a girl for the past couple of weeks. I matched with her on hinge and we were into similar stuff, our taste in movies and entertainment was pretty much the same, lotr, Star Wars, marvel etc that kind of stuff. We talked on hinge for a bit and then I decided to ask if she had Snapchat so we could talk somewhere else and I gave her mine and said if she wanted to talk that’s cool but if she didn’t that was fine, didn’t want to pressure her and also went in with the notion of I might as well try. 

She added me soon after and ever been talking on that from then on. We spoke on Saturday and she sent me a message about a wedding she was at, I asked her how it was and we talked about it for a bit. She then asked what I did with my day off and I told her I went out with a friend for some drinks in the city and a meal and talked about what else we got up to. She then suggested that we could meet up and get some drinks sometime and I said that I’d be up for that depending on our schedules as her shifts rotate. 

I’m certainly up for it even if I just tell myself it’s just a hangout not a date as it’ll be the first time I see her in person. It just felt weird being asked to meet up by someone again, I’ve been single for a year so that’s probably why. I mentioned it to the friend I had drinks with and he thinks I should go for it and I’ve got nothing to lose and she must be interested as she brought it up first.

What do you think I should do? She seems nice but I don’t know how I’ll explain to people about a potential date with a girl off of hinge especially family. I’ve also been single for a year and I hope that won’t hinder me if i do go on the date/meet-up in terms of confidence.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,970015,public,self,Should I go for it and see what happens?

During this time I shared a flat with this Morrocan guy (21) who I developed a situationship with.  We lived together for 6 months and it was amazing. We agreed on keeping things casual. I was seeing other people, vice versa.

But then things began to change. What was before a casual fwb arrangement, now seemed a lot more intimate.  He started acting a lot more affectionate, holding my hand in public, giving me forehead kisses.. He introduced me to all his friends and family, and spoke of visiting me in England to meet my family. On valentines day he even bought me a crystal necklace. I stopped seeing other people as I saw potential in this, and he wasn't seeing anyone else either.

Near the end of my time in Spain I was dying to tell him how I felt. But the fear of scaring him off, or a LDR not working held me back and I decided not to. It was obvious how we felt about each other, without having to say “ I love you” just yet I naïvely thought. 

After Spain, my 6month study abroad in Japan began. We messaged each other everyday for 5 months and I planned to visit him in September. Thats when I decided I’ll tell him how I feel. I thought if we can survive 6 months apart and still prioritize each other, then an LDR could actually work.  

Until I noticed this girl who he began chatting with near the end of my time in Spain, began appearing pretty frequently on his story. After the third time she was uploaded on his story, I decided to call him out on it. To find out if he had moved on, and what we actually were. 

I got my answer. He still didn’t want a relationship and told me he was sorry if I developed  feelings. Turns out he treated his previous “friends with benefits” with the same affection and they all got the wrong idea too. I was crushed. I felt like I was just another one of those girls he used for sex and affection. we spent 6 months living together, n got so close that I thought I meant more to him than that. All this emotional investment felt like such a waste of time.
  So I decided to cut things off with him. He told me he’d give me the time I need, but he “cant lose me as a friend n as a person who means a lot to him.“  I chose not to respond and to try n just move on.

Long read but need your help.

So I think I messed up with this guy. Long story made as short as possible. My friend and one of her roommates matched us together and its like a blind date kind of thing. We hit it off despite very different views and backgrounds and have been talking or communicating daily for about 5 weeks. He's long distance and works 7 days and we are both finishing off degrees. We made plans to see other this past weekend since we had a small break from everyday life. He has family near me and stays with them when he comes down. They are really close knit. Despite being uber nervous about meeting in person for the 1st time we had an amazing date on Saturday night. It was a breath of fresh air. We had made plans initially to hang out on Sunday for brunch and after the great date we were still on to do that but it would't be a long date because he had to get on the road to get back home for school and work.

Fast forward to Sunday. I called him to see about meeting up after leaving another event and he answered but had to get off the phone rather quickly to help a family member. When I got home and got ready I texted and asked him if we were still on for today and told him I would head to his side of town since it's about an hour drive. He called me right back and asked to take a raincheck. I was kind of taken aback and at a loss for words. His reasoning was that he didn't really get a lot of time to spend with his family and said he would be back in about 2 weeks for another family gathering. I got kind of quiet and he asked again if that was ok. I mustered up the statement and told him I would be pretty disappointed if I didn't get a chance to see him before he left because we don't get a lot of time together. I'm assertive, he's passive and non-confrontational. He stated that he would work something out and I said I'm even willing to meet you on your way out just to see you and we don't have to brunch or anything. I could sense the tension and after a couple of alternative options I just gave in and told him I fine with whatever he decided to do. It was a little awkward to say the least. I found out later that he had this entire conversation in front of the family member that hooked us up and then of course she told my friend. They thought I was a little dramatic. I like people to keep their word and I explained that to my friend who is as flaky as the wind so she didn't get the big deal.

He and I did talk as he drove home but we didn't get to see each other. He apologized and I also apologized for the way that I handled the situation. He asked the question where do we go from here and I explained that I really liked him and would like to see where this goes. I'm intentional, he is a if it's meant to be kind of guy.

It didn't happen in my own friend circle but it did happen outside of it. This also happened with some frequency in the celebrity world, with some beautiful female celebrities dating ""ugly"" male actors.

However, I notice that this phenomenon seems to have dissappeared for quite some time. Even years before the covid 19 lockdowns, I had noticed that the number of ugly guys dating pretty girls or even just any girls in general have dropped drastically, to the point where i wouldn't be able to find even one when walking down the street. Even in the celebrity world, this trend was apparent. I follow quite a few millenial actresses who play these coming of age comedies where they date nerds and stuff but was quite dissapointed when i found out their boyfriends were all 100% handsome male models and not the geeky guys i shipped for on TV.

Regardless of the intimacy, I either didn't text next day or let the conversation die out and now I hate myself for doing that. It's not that I was looking for sex and then ghost them or something, but in reality it may sometimes have looked like it. Although I never let a text go unanswered, my mind was almost always set on getting rid of them. 

Now that I'm somewhat older and more mature, I recognize the harm it could have caused and the mistrust in people it definitely caused, as well as the damaged self esteem of some of these sweet girls.

There really is no specific reason for me to come with this now, but it has been bothering me for a while and I honestly hate myself for having treated girls like this.

After a work injury, surgery, getting lazy, and gaining a lot of weight (both of us). I decided to get in shape.  I told her my routine and how I was going to change things up to work on myself. Here are some of the facts from my relationship. 

1) I am a Doctorate of business student with about 1 semester left. I finished my bachelor's and masters in less than a year with a self paced program. 

2) I've lost about 40 lbs of the weight I gained and I want to lose about 30 more.  I have gained a lot of muscle and even doubled some of my max's from last year.  (Curling 50 to curling 100lbs)

3) I feel that my girlfriend has no drive to do anything and I am quickly becoming unattractive to her.  I sat down and told her so, and she accepted it because she kept doing nothing and has been doing nothing.

4) Her daughters father makes 75k a year and doesn't pay a dime in child support, but she refuses to ask him for any help so I get stuck with the bill. Also he keeps her for maybe 30-40 of 365 days a year.  

5) She is constantly on her phone looking at houses and stuff to buy.  Things she does buy is not used but for about 2 weeks and then trashed. 


Our arguments consist of: (""  "" is her words verbatim)

 ""well I work out when I'm cleaning the house"" (of course I never do enough around the house according to her) (cleaning is not working out.... thats called moving)

""I don't like when you go workout because you leave me here by myself""

""You get to spend your money on stuff you want but I don't get to buy anything""(I bought a 3D printer and I am making money using it)

""Of course you're never wrong, you're a doctor!"" (I admit I'm wrong all the time.)

""Why don't we have sex anymore? I bet you don't find me attractive""

In short....  im tired of busting my butt to provide for her and her daughter while her dad does nothing.  I'm tired of all the useless arguments.  If I was to pick up and leave tomorrow I could afford my own place, but she may be stuck for a bit. But, her house (where we live) is about 45k more than what we put into it.  
I tried to leave in January, had an apartment booked, and the day before she went through my email and found out about it.  I felt so guilty and pressured into staying that I canceled everything.

&gt;be me 

&gt;at party

&gt;cute girl ive talked to before

&gt;booze.png

&gt;tell her if she wants to make out

&gt;”later”

&gt;later in the night tell her when we are gonna make out

&gt; we go outside and do it

&gt; tell her to go upstairs

&gt; “later”

&gt; people realize we made out

&gt;mutual friend tells me that she’s saying that she didnt want and doesnt want which is weird because when I went to her she started walking with me instead of saying no

&gt; we go upstairs

&gt; locks room

&gt; tells me to not say anything, jumps on me and starts making out

&gt; grabs my dick and start jerking me off

&gt; ask if she gives bj

&gt; “later”

&gt; she leaves the room and then I realize that she’s telling people that I forced her

&gt;wtf??

&gt; back home later that night

&gt;she tells me, sorry abt that. Let’s do it properly next time, when do u wanna meet up?

&gt; wtf??? 

&gt; I ask why she said I forced her

&gt; “I only said that I didnt want, not that you forced me and you were telling people taht you sucked my tits”

&gt;(I only told my best friend)

&gt; Next day she tells me “hey I dont wanna be on bad terms with u either, maybe when we see eachother next time we can do it again, just dont say anything”

&gt; ask why I cant say anything

&gt; “I dont like people knowing who ive been with and who I havent” (this is not true, everyone knows who she’s been with)

Is she ashamed of me or what? I think she said I forced her because she got mad at me telling people or because she was ashamed but why does she still wanna do it? 

Idk if I should do it or not

Suddenly I have 4 dates this week, and 3 of them (Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday) are at the same location at the same time of day.  For some reason I just started imagining a scenario where one of the workers notices and makes a joke about it, and now I'm afraid it was a mistake to even take that risk (even though I know it's extremely unlikely).

These are all just first dates so there's obviously nothing wrong with playing the field, but I'd prefer it if these girls don't have it thrown in their faces (especially the girl I'm meeting on Friday, who I like the most).  Am I insane for even worrying about this or should I try to change locations now?  All three girls have expressed excitement about this place because they've never been before and think it sounds cool, so it would kinda suck to have to change plans on them.

l(24f) met this guy (27m)on tinder and we rarely talk at first cause I didn't want to have sex w him at all and all I want is just fwb. long story short, one night I got a mental breakdown so I ask him if I can go to his place crying and hugging. he says yes, and that is our first time meeting in person(plus we only match for 2 weeks). we kinda like it so he asked me to stay over at his place 4 nights in the same week eventually. (I know it's crazy)

I still go to his place to sleep/have sex w him now and we get alone well. But he is just very sweet and nice to me: he cooks me delicate dinner, we watch movie tgt, and he even made me my fav bagel from scratch one morning. we hang out at the park once, have coffee a few times and he also hold my hands and kiss me in public.

I found those behavior confusing so I told him I enjoy this fwb and ask him what he want: he said he doesn't know what he wants at this point but he is really attracted to me and enjoys every moment w me.

he starts to ask if he can see my place, mmet my friends, wanna take me to the beach, to the museum, and have dinner date w me.

since I only do fwb kind of things here so I kinda just lost the ability to see if it is a serious thing or not...

we get along v well, have the same taste in music/movies, share lots of interests, however, we both just got out of a relationship.

sorry, it's kinda long BUT my question is just—is he interested in something more?

I left and as I drove past, i gave her a friendly 'beep' as she crossed the road, so signal no harm done essentially. She gave me the finger.

throwaway account bc i’m not sure if he uses reddit (even tho if he sees this its blatantly obvious its about him) 

i (19f) started a job about a month ago at a fast food place to get some money over summer before i go back to uni and i’ll probs be back at christmas, easter etc. i really feel like i’ve clicked with my shift manager (22m) and might be catching feelings for him and i can’t tell if he is too so basically ::: 

we have a lot of banter which is sometimes quite flirty, he regularly mentions how he hasnt been laid in 5 years and he regularly makes comments about my body, i’ve also noticed him looking me up and down pretty obviously a few times- one time he was sitting a few feet behind me and made a comment on how my apron wraps around / crosses over at the back where my ass is (ie he was looking at my ass) and this means i’m super skinny (not sure if he realises this is a massive compliment to me bc i have struggled with my body image my entire life). a couple days ago he pulled me to the side and said next time we close the store together i have to sweep/mop on my knees bc i did a bad job lol. he also drops compliments on my weight into conversation a lot. we have a lot of physical contact for example a lot of the time we will poke eachother when we pass eachother, he will feel my biceps and abs sometimes, and when i burned my neck on the grill he ran his fingers over it and i swear i got butterflies for the first time in years. he also talks to me about my love life and has suggested that someone else ‘isn’t the right person for me’ and he had a bit of a hopeful look on his face when he said this. he hugs me sometimes when nobody’s around (his hugs are so nice) . we also brush up against eachother quite a lot and sometimes we’ll stand next to eachother while working so our sides are touching all the way down. we message outside of work too, the other night he said if he could drive he would take me to a viewpoint so we could look at the moon,  and in another conversation said ‘you can have more compliments if you want’. 

i catch myself thinking about him a LOT and i really think i’m catching feelings but i’m in a weird situation at the moment and i’m going back to uni in 2 weeks so i won’t see him for 3 months. i also don’t want to let him know how i feel incase i’ve read the situation completely wrong and i dont want to fuck anything up. reddit, does he like me?!!",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,970347,public,self,is my (19f) shift manager (22m) into me or am i reading it wrong??,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pads21/is_my_19f_shift_manager_22m_into_me_or_am_i/,all_ads,6,,,,

How do I reconcile this feeling?


Will I ever be good enough? This may sound like another low-self esteemed guy complaining. But I want to be clear about a few things.

I think if you’ve had low success rate at anything, you would think you are not good at it. To think otherwise would be delusional. But that is not to say it is permanent and that you cannot improve! Because you can!

But to explain my mind state, we would have to look at it from a longer period of time, where I have been changing, so there’s different results at different times. But I say that to make the point that it seems like I’ve tried everything and still having little success. 

Assessing myself as honest I can—trying to limit my personal bias—I think I am a great catch! But at this point I feel like none of my positive qualities matter cuz I’m rejected before they get a chance to even know me…

I’ve never felt I was a good looking guy. Particularly my face. I’ve always been in good shape, athletic. Totally ripped at one point. But I try not to show it off like some douchebag. 

I have a ton of grit and perseverance. Overcome a lot of personal circumstances to get here. I am intelligent, got a well paying career. I’m focused on self improvement and spirituality and inner peace. I prioritize being honest and not mislead people, even if it means I don’t get what I want. I think they call that integrity or something. 

I think some other words that would describe me are: disciplined, mindful, focused, determined.

I’d like to think my communication skills are good but I am also skeptical of this, since communication is a two way street. The ways I communicate, I believe is efficient however if others are not on the same page, it doesn’t matter. So in a sense, I feel like my communication skills are being “negated” by others’ less efficient communication. I am aware of this and trying to figure out if I’m just full of myself or others just suck at communication.

This can be used as an example of a larger theme I suspect. I believe I am conducting myself in efficient manners, but the rest of the world doesn’t. So communication is even worse cuz we are not on the same page in terms of HOW to communicate. It may very well be better if I “dumbed down” myself just to be on the same page as the rest. 

Listing as most efficient way to communicate:
1. Both communicate in my method
2. Both communicate in their method
3. Both communicate in differing methods

I love basketball. I can say with certainty that I’ve spent over 10k hours playing, practicing, and studying basketball. I am my most confident self when on the courts.

I appreciate art. I like poetry. I used to and still dabble in art and poetry. I like hiphop/r&amp;b music. I like puzzles/board games/brain teasers. I like to think of my own witty jokes. I am a curious forever student. I have a great attention to detail, great memory, I can recall 100 of digits of pi or lyrics from some of the most hardcore gangsta rappers. 

I can come off as blunt/insensitive/asshole because of my honest/unfiltered mouth. I will make inappropriate jokes. (I’m also not fully convinced that this is a flaw but mismatch in personalities; my closer friends seem to understand me).

I am an introvert and don’t like big groups. I don’t drink alcohol (aka the de facto adult activity) so I don’t go to bars much. I’m not a dancer so I’ve never been to any clubs either. 

I can be pretty black and white about things. 

I’ve never been in a relationship. partly because of my whole family/at home situations that I don’t think it wise to bring someone else into. Maybe I don’t deserve to be loved..? But of course the self esteem thing too. 

I have an above average sized member and the women I’ve been with seemed to be impressed. And they seem thoroughly satisfied with my ability to use it. 

I’m a deep thinker and can see both sides of issues impartially. I think this can be interpreted as passive and indecisive. Or that I am against the person I’m talking to. A lot of times we don’t have the luxury of time to explain our whole thought process to one another. Most people usually favor one side passionately. I also wonder about the difference between being opinionated and judgmental.

I love who I am. But I also lament that I am not like the good looking, loud, lively, outgoing extroverted people (aka “the popular kids”)

I am tired. I’ve worked so hard to get where I am now—school, career, financially, and last and most importantly myself. But damn wtf it feels like I worked so hard and I’m still not good enough. 

Because of all the shit I’ve been through, I learned to be optimistic and find silver linings. I had to. I know this negative thoughts are not indicative of that guy but It’s what I’m feeling now. 

I’m not sure if I’m ugly or average? I’ve been called handsome, cute. But I feel like those are weak words. I’ve been complimented on my style. I’ve never been called sexy, fiione, hot, kyooote. I think I’m a pretty good catch otherwise. And still improving. But I don’t want a woman to be like he’s got everything I want except that he’s ugly in the face.

And she was actually more attractive (physically and character-wise) than her bio had me believe. 

The next day, we texted for a bit, but her responses were super short, some only 1 word.  I was thinking perhaps I miss read the great date.  However, I thought I'd take my shot, because I felt like I was about to get ghosted as I have in the past--so I asked her out for a 2nd date.  8 hours later I here back ""Sure!"".  Another 1 word.  The next few days I tried to limit my texting to not be overbearing.  Sent her something funny I saw and got a ""haha"" 8 hours later.  So I'm thinking, she is super busy or doesn't really like me.

So the 2nd date we planned was coming up. I asked if were still on yesterday, never heard back so thought for sure I was getting ghosted this time.  Well, just heard back, ""totally!"". 

Perhaps some people are actually just not texters, at all?  I have had people with poor texting skills, but never experiences this.
