I currently live in Ohio and I‚Äôm relocating to San Antonio this fall for a fresh start and new opportunities in my life then being stuck in my awful state. 

I visited the state and enjoyed Austin a lot more but was too expensive to live so I chose San Antonio and got an apartment already approved for me this fall. 

How‚Äôs the dating scenes and are the women in SA or Texas in general more hospitable and nicer than the Midwest women? 


I don‚Äôt ask a lot I just want a feminine woman who won‚Äôt discard me for someone else and isn‚Äôt full of herself, somewhat active and without children since I don‚Äôt have. 


Is it best to cold approach or go to events to meet women? My tinder account got banned but I‚Äôm mentally over using dating apps due to the low results and being rigged for women to make things happen and start and end relationships and conversations. I refuse to participate in those apps anymore due to constant disappointments and being unmatched after I asked for a social media or number after hitting it off with a woman due to her unlimited options it‚Äôs frustrating as decent guy to deal with shit like this. 

Any advice or tips of San Antonio dating or Austin dating will greatly be appreciated.

I always had a lot of female and male friends, but I never was interested in dating since until i was 18.   
I never managed to find a girl who I like and who likes me too. I tried dating apps but with poor results (girls taking days too respond, and I'm not even attracted to them).

People find me funny, smart, cute, nice and peaceful. I'm 6,1ft and kinda athletic. But I just really don't like small talks and meaningless things. I like to hang out, go to the bar, restaurants, watch movies, cuddle and deep talks. 

But I don't have the energy to go see girls randomly in the streets to see if they're a good fit for me or not since I really can't deal with small talks. I would just want to do activities with girls and skipping the ""what's your name, how old are you, where do you live, what's your fav color, do you like bread ?"" phase.

Does such a thing exist ??

I really don't mind being single, but I feel like I'm missing a lot of experiences by not trying to give more chances to my love life. And I really want to meet someone who doesn't just see me as a friend or a hookup.

It just seemed too complicated/potentially inappropriate. I also still live with my ex. He knows that we broke up and I‚Äôm planning on leaving soon, but still. He recently quit (or got fired - I‚Äôm not sure what happened) and I‚Äôm seriously considering asking him out now. 

I‚Äôve frequently caught him staring at me. A few times I‚Äôve caught him looking at me and I smiled at him and he immediately looked down like he was overwhelmed. He never really tries to talk to me, but when we have, he usually tries to make me laugh, he doesn‚Äôt break eye contact and sometimes he‚Äôll have a big smile while talking to me. I‚Äôve also seen his friends tease him twice around me and he walked away from them. They kept looking at me so it seemed like it was about me. 

Once, he came by to fix something for me. When I went to explain to him what the problem was, he seemed to play dumb so that I‚Äôd have to lean in close next to him to show him. After I got closer to him, he started awkwardly fiddling with his tools. I scurried away then and he said he‚Äôd have to go get a part and he‚Äôd come back the following day. Cue the next day and he said he was all done, I thanked him, he told me to have a nice day, and I waved good bye to him as he turned back and looked at me before he went out the door. Then a minute or 2 later, he knocked on my door. I thought either he forgot something or maybe he was finally going to ask me out. He leaned in close to me with his phone and asked if I could give him 5 stars for his business. He seemed nervous to ask me, which was so adorable that I couldn‚Äôt help but laugh and tell him yeah no problem. My dog was trying to escape so I kind of rushed him off and told him to send me the link. He didn‚Äôt though until I texted him asking him and he just said thanks. I left him a glowing review and the next time I saw him, he grabbed the door for me and touched my hand. 

One of the last times I saw him, my dog went up to him and he started petting him and asking me about him. When I started to walk away, he tried to keep the conversation going and when I walked back over to him, he raised his eyebrows at me and had the biggest smile. He still tried to talk to me more but I got so nervous, I sort of ran away. 

BUT the other week, I texted him about a repair and he left me on read. My ex texted him eventually and he responded right away and fixed everything and even put in a new light fixture when he didn‚Äôt have to. Still, it makes me nervous that he ignored me. 

I‚Äôm thinking about texting him asking if he wants to get coffee, but I‚Äôm shy and I‚Äôve never asked a guy out before so it‚Äôs pretty nerve wracking.

He was patient &amp; understanding. Throughout our relationship I‚Äôve always been super honest &amp; open &amp; my fianc√© has never asked to see my phone or to go through my phone but I, on the other hand, I do ask to go through his phone. I have his password (he gave it to me). He does seem to be a little hesitant whenever I ask for his phone. He‚Äôll get nervous or say ‚Äúokay babe, give me one second‚Äù &amp; then he‚Äôll give it to me after he‚Äôs checked something. So yesterday, I just grabbed it out his pocket when he was driving &amp; he didn‚Äôt care, I opened it &amp; saw he had a Reddit account, which I don‚Äôt mind because I have one. However when I said ‚Äúoh so you have a Reddit account‚Äù he immediately reached &amp; was like ‚Äúlet me see‚Äù. I could visibly see he was nervous like literally shaking. He deleted some searches, it looked like. Then he just handed it to me &amp; said ‚Äúyou know what, here you can look‚Äù. I looked &amp; he had made one post 2 months ago asking for advice about having a spouse that was having doubts in a relationship. Which is fine because that was a tough time for us but I just feel like that was nothing to hide, you know? He could‚Äôve just said that &amp; been open but because he was so nervous, it‚Äôs causing me to think there might be more. We had premarital counseling yesterday &amp; talked about this incident &amp; he said ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt tell her because sometimes when I bring things to her attention it always ends in an argument &amp; I honestly just wanted advice‚Äù. 

My question is, should I just let it go &amp; take it for what it is or do I have a reason to be worried?

We went on a total of 4 dates. First one was like 4 hours, second was 9, third was 10. Fourth was short since it was during finals. Also FaceTimed her during the summer for a couple hours. Whenever I was in person with her, we'd be laughing and, it at least seemed like she was having fun. 

On the third date, it was the first time we ever cuddled. Laid in my bed after watching a movie for the remaining 6ish hours. Just talking. I snuck a cheeky compliment in at one point (still proud of how smooth it was and her reaction lol), and at one point she began rubbing my arm. 

I really regret not at least asking her if I could kiss her

I really enjoyed each date. She was very funny, and I was very attracted to her. I saw a potential for a relationship with her.

Anyway, early June rolls around, and my job hadn't started yet so I was incredibly bored at home. Very hard to keep my mind off her. At one point we lost our best friends on snap, and it slowly turned into snapping only twice a day.

At this point, I figured I should be straight up with her to see if it was worth stressing about. I sent her this message:

""I feel like it's kind of implied, but I just want to make sure we're clear with each other. Idk if this was supposed to be brought up earlier (haven't gotten this far on tinder lol) but I just wanted to say that I definitely see potential for a relationship. Just wanted to let you know where I stand in case you don't feel the same way

Ik this definitely came out of the blue but idk I figured there's no harm in knowing where we both stand""

To which she replied ""fair enough. I don't know what I want"" (not verbatim. It was along those lines).

So I followed up by asking her if it was worth continuing to talk. She said she'd have to think about it.

A day later I unadded her from snapchat and Instagram. She did the same.

However, we're still matched on tinder. I'm kind of contemplating asking her if she wanted to hang out since I'm back at school now. Figured maybe she said she didn't know what she wanted because she either

A. misinterpreted what I said and thought I wanted to be exclusive at that point

B. Didn't want to string me along because she didn't want to talk all summer only to change her mind later

I also highly doubt she would message me if she wanted to hang out again. She wasn't the type to initiate seeing each other (maybe she was just never that into me lol). So if she did want to, I'd have to find out by asking her

I want to ask her, obviously, because I really liked her. I don't want to because I feel like I lose my dignity by asking her again after we cut contact

I turned him down when he tried to have sex with me and told him I just wasn‚Äôt ready. He was very respectful of it. 

So now he is flying me out again for 2 nights and I‚Äôm nervous about if I should have sex with him this time or not.

Another thing is, we haven‚Äôt had the talk about where we see this going. We both said we‚Äôre looking for a relationship and not a hookup, but we haven‚Äôt talked about us specifically.

I was head over heels for her. She took my V card about a month into it. I thought it would never end.  It did end and come to find out she was playing me pretty much the whole time.

When I met her I didn't have that same fireworks feeling I had with amber. But I brushed it off because keri (my wife). Was a really nice person and I was attracted to her and I thought that feeling would show it self at some point.  I was her first everything. First boyfriend first kiss first sexual partner. I did try to break up a few times without success she just kept coming back and would not give up.  During one of our break ups I got her pregnant lol.

I didn't think about it at first but it's become weirder.

 We went to a party and he kept putting his arm around me, and when we got caught in the rain he hugged me and rubbed my back to keep me warm. He proceeded to want to see me every week and we have so far. He's said he doesn't get affectionate with friends in public because it makes them think ur dating. Anyway we've cuddled and he's opened up to me about some trauma, said he cares about me and trusts me. Last time i saw him he didn't wanna hold my hand and he didnt want to hold me , but he wanted to lie on me, and have our arms intertwined and when i would try to move my arm he'd yank it back. But we've barely spoken since, except for when he said ""I'm busy my friend I'll text you later"" . He's also asked about my ex boyfriend A LOT, and stopped talking to me as much as he used to after finding out i still have some photos of him, he also said i should delete them, and only after an hour he said i should do it if it hurts me.

 Today he sent me some very explicit messages about liking g*ping a-holes and he could stretch mine with a dildo and he'd say we was joking or kidding but continue and he said he wouldn't do anything with someone he's not attracted to or a friend. And i have no idea what the f**k is going on.

I know that I can just ask and see, I just don't want to make it awkward after if the relationship needs to keep going.  
A few cases for example: She is awesome, and I met her via my new group of friends. I don't want to sour the relationship with the group since I am a newbie, but she is a unicorn and I don't want to miss my shot.  
Another example, I met her via another contact I use for my career, she is awesome too but I don't want to risk my career contact.

Okay so like.. I don't know if this is super shallow, but I'd like to think that people are allowed to have preferences and I'm allowed to not find people attractive but here's my sitch

I am on tinder and currently have over 500 matches im not like boasting or bragging about this because I honestly don't like half the girls on tinder tbh, so like as sad as it may be I have an auto clicker on my computer that just automatically likes everyone on tinder then I go through and pick which ones to stay matched with, but like recently I've seen a reoccurrence where only 1 or 2 girls liking me back I actually find attractive. I'm so serious when I say only 20 out of the 500 matches are actually somewhat attractive and like I'm not asking for supermodels but at the same time I know I'm not ugly, but I guess what I'm trying to get at is what's separating me from this other tier of women I don't seem to have access too? honestly, sometimes I think it's because I'm not white and I live in the midwest, but like then again maybe it's the way I carry myself? honestly, is it too much to ask for a girl that I think is super attractive and way out of my league? because I've talked to some before but I always seem to mess it up, like I just recently messed up with a girl who was perfect to me super attractive really easy to talk to, I even traveled 50 minutes to go see her one time for literally 10 minutes and of course, I ruin it because I was pushing for sex way too fast. maybe it's all a sign I need to work on myself more before I'm ready to handle like a super attractive girl but like I've been struggling with this ever since I was younger because I'm such a helpless romantic, I say ""I need to work on myself, I'm gonna quit tinder and bumble and work on me"" but what does it really mean to work on you?! I've never quite figured that out and like I do it for maybe about a week but then I get lonely and my phone is just so dry that I go back on dating sites because I'm just craving human attention. I need clarity because I'm confused not only in my dating life but in life in general, like for the longest time I said to myself that I just wanted a fwb just to have someone around but then I met this last girl who I messed up with and now I want a relationship again because of her. I should also state that I'm the type of guy to talk to a girl and get bored of her after a while, and then i end up leaving or finding some way out or even sometimes just blocking them on everything.

I've been noticing that more women have been DMing me to ""hang out"" or just seem more interested and engaging in conversation with me. Most of my life, I've been overweight and working a lower wage job. I've lost a over 70lbs and making almost 7 figures this year alone. I post most of my achievements on social media, not so much for gratification but to show how far I've come, so of course the same women that have rejected me before when I was fat and working a low wage job are now showing interest. Normally, I get extremely turned off by people like that, and personally I think you're fake if you behave like that.  


For example, this chick I've been really into for a while. I told her I was feeling her early last year, she showed zero interest. She even went as far to tell me she wasn't interested in dating anyone at the moment, then started dating someone a month later. Now of course, she's in my inbox wanting to get to know me better and whatnot and I'm not interested anymore.  I'm a pretty direct person and expect others to be the same. It's a bad expectation, I know.  


I know most women hate when men say they are ""nice guys"" but I really am a nice guy. I've been coming in last place for a long time and finally want something genuine. This ""nice guy"" routine has been getting me no where and I feel as if I start being \*\*somewhat\*\* petty and not letting these girls have the time of day, I'll look like a asshole. idk. Probably doesn't make sense. Let me know your thoughts.
