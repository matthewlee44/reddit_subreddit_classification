And since women always say that personality is much more important than looks for them, does that imply that white men just have better personalities?

Personally I'm an Asian guy and I always hear from Asian women how white men are so much more romantic, gentlemanly, masculine, assertive and ""fun"" than Asian men (other races are not even on their radar). Do you think this is true? Do white men actually have better personalities or are women just racist?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/neyjer/do_white_men_have_more_attractive_personalities/

10,nezwgw,1621308121,I broke up with my girlfriend after cheating on her. How I can make up for my failure?,"I know the hard condemnations that are about to come my way. I'm a piece of shit.

After being in a relationships for over 3 years, I decided to spend my last semester in college single so I could date around. However, I met a woman I grew close to and one day she told me I was her boyfriend. (without me asking her) I went along with it. However, I found it hard to be faithful to her. For our year and a half relationship, I was unfaithful to her. 

I found any justification. I told myself that my flings were only temporary. I told myself that as long I was emotionally active in our relationship, it was okay.  I would plan numerous dates, provide her emotional comfort, and let her know how much I loved her to quell my guilty conscience. She eventually asked if she could go be intimate with other girls and I used that as an excuse to call our relationship open. (even though she didn't give me that permission)

Eventually I found a woman whom I developed more romantic feelings for. This convinced me that I finally needed to end my relationship. My girlfriend didn't deserve what I did. Our relationship had numerous problems. She struggled with undiagnosed mental health problems and her &amp; I were different ideologically, We both were already questioning the long-term viability of our relationship. But she did a lot of great things for me and deserved better.

I'm now pursuing therapy and will not be entering in another relationship until I'm better. I know what I did was wrong, I've been put through the wringer by friends and family. How can I make up for my mistake and move into the future a better man?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nezwgw/i_broke_up_with_my_girlfriend_after_cheating_on/

15,nf0ab7,1621309344,My ex just got married less than 5 months from when we broke up,"So yeah, like the title says, she got married 5 months after we broke up last weekend.  Some of my family are friends with her. 

She has had about 5 Facebook official relationships and has gone back to the girl she left me for, (I’m a straight white male) and been kicked out by her for hooking up with too many dudes and then got in a few Facebook official relationships.  The most recent one she broke up with a guy about 3 weeks ago and now she’s married to the girl she left right before she started dating me. I didn’t purposely steal her from that relationship. We were acquaintances and had exchanged about 8 very boring Facebook messages 2 weeks before I found out she wanted to date me. 

Besides: bullet dodged, I’d like to hear some real interpretation of what she’s going through. Speaking of bullet dodged, she’s the only currently living survivor of a mass shooting and she tried to force me into an intimate love triangle with a coworker and somewhat vilifies me to family and friends. 

I held her accountable for the forced intimacy with the coworker thing and I don’t think she liked that. I said really the most hurtful things I could imagine to make her disgusted with the idea of actually starting a relationship with that girl she worked with.  I thought of the girl she worked with and her boyfriend as predatory. She’s 23 and I’m 38. Am I predatory for dating her?  

Not many people expect much of her because she LEAVES people that try to hold her accountable. I really thought we were in love (lol now). We had known each other for about 2.5 years and dated for 6 months. It seemed really good. We had an awesome time together when things were good. She hadn’t shown this kind of volatility before me. We’re not exactly on speaking terms as you can imagine.  

Please don’t attempt to determine who she is. You won’t be able to. This isn’t about that and it’d be mean. I just want to know how to feel about it all.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nf0ab7/my_ex_just_got_married_less_than_5_months_from/
16,nf0ek4,1621309729,How the hell did I fall for her? I've never fallen for anyone like this before.,"I (18M) have started dating a really wonderful and sweet girl, same age as me. She's new to town, and she's been doing volunteer work at the neighborhood elementary school, where I work part-time as the librarian since 2 Mondays ago. We hit it off at work really well, and she even left me a bowl of cookies with a card with hearts on it on my desk one day (I just thought that was sweet).

I decided to ask her out on a date, and she said yes. I picked her up in my Saab convertible lowrider around lunchtime and took her out to the beach and spent the day with her. We had a really good time, and it ended with us kissing and making out as we watched the sunset. Now, I have a second date with her scheduled for this Friday night, I'm taking her out to dinner at the one nice restaurant we have in this town.

I've been wondering though, how the hell did I fall for her? Don't get me wrong, she's a really great girl and I'm glad I've gotten to know her. But I've never fallen for anyone like this before in my life. 

I've grown up in this same rural small town of 7,000 people since I was 6 years old, and I've met pretty much all the girls around my age around here years ago. Yet not one of them ever gave me the same feelings I have for her, and none of them ever seemed interested in me either. Some of them are pretty, yes, but I've never seen any of them as anything more than a friend. Back when I was in high school and people would ask me if I had a girlfriend, I'd always tell them I liked the single life better and didn't want a girlfriend right now.

Then all of a sudden, she comes to town, and I'm head over heels crushing on her. She gave me butterflies in my stomach and put a smile on my face whenever she came around. I was never too nervous to talk to her or anything like that, but I still felt something with her. Now we just started dating, and I couldn't be happier. 

I'm starting to feel like such a sap, I was never this mushy/sappy before.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nf0ek4/how_the_hell_did_i_fall_for_her_ive_never_fallen/
17,nf0fdd,1621309806,I am a little confuse,"Met this girl one month ago on tinder.We vibe pretty good, we saw each other 5 times in like 10 days, all our dates were on her house by the 4 date we had sex.If I wanted we could had have sex the 3rd date but I decline cause she was a lil drunk that night. 

The last time I saw her.I ask her what she was even looking for with me and she said she was not ready for something serious cause she was too busy with work and school and also cause she got out of a relationship months ago and is still bitter about her ex but she said she wanted to keep seeing and that she like me a lot and that was almost a month ago.

Since that last time I saw her, she kept going distant and distant and everytime I asked her to hangout again she always said she had to go out with her friends or something came up with her family or that she was busy most of the times I think she was telling the truth cause the days she told me she had to do something she posted stories going out those days.

I honestly after seeing that she was not that interested as she use to, to see me and also her texts getting dry, sometimes even leaving on read, never telling me when she was free and always trowing the I let you know phrases,  I gave up and did not text her no more and even unfollowed her from all social media.But the weird part is she has not unfollowed me from IG since then and this was like a few weeks ago and I'm pretty sure she already has notice that I unfollow her long ago.She keeps seeing all my stories sometimes reacts to them, likes my posts.Why does she keeps following me even after I unfollow her but doesnt talk to me at all.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nf0fdd/i_am_a_little_confuse/

Honestly I do want to try to use a bit of advice from both sides because on the one hand, yea I definitely want to be myself and be able to talk to and attract women with my own personality without using pickup art. On the other hand, some of the things I see pick up artists teach seems like it might help me a bit when it comes to the anxiety I have when approaching women. 

Obviously I dont agree with most of the things they teach, like negging, and other negative aspects, but things like ""Approach her with the mindset of not trying to attract her, and instead with the mindset of, do you like her personality beyond her looks?"" Or the advice of having an abundance mindset where I have to have the mindset that I have other options beyond that one girl that I like even if I dont. It has helped me decrease the nervousness that I have when approaching women. 

&amp;#x200B;

One thing I notice in dating is that people will say, ""If you see a girl or a guy that you are attracted to, then you should go up and introduce yourself."" Now I totally agree with this, but what Im confused about is, isnt this the same thing as cold approaching? 

&amp;#x200B;

People say that cold approaching is very shallow and yields no results, and that a lot of women hate cold approaches because it is shallow and awkward, but isnt cold approaching just introducing yourself to someone you are attracted to, but havent gotten to know yet? Isnt it the same thing? If it is then shouldnt the previous advice of saying ""if you see someone who you find attractive, approach and introduce yourself to them"" be just as shallow?

28,nf286a,1621315774,What the hell happened?,"Recently, my ex and I (25M) reconnected and talked/dated again for a few weeks. For context, we dated from senior year of high school to senior year of college roughly, and ultimately what did us in in late 2017ish was the massive stress and pressure of grad school (specifically, the stress of her getting into her grad program causing her to push people that were trying to help her away)

Out of the blue, she messages me on Facebook a few weeks ago after not talking for about 2.5 years and tells me that she’s been thinking of me lately, and she wanted to catch up. My gut instinct was to ignore it and continue moving on with my life, but she seemed remorseful for the pain she caused me in the past, so I figured I should at least hear her out.

We meet for dinner, and it goes great - we obviously have a lot to catch up on in terms of life events, but I could tell that she was in a much better place in life and much less stressed about everything. That night, a million thoughts race through my head, and part of me thinks about maybe trying again. I’ve been pretty lonely lately, and she was dropping hints that she was looking for commitment and couldn’t get it from other guys in the time we were apart, saying that she knew what she wanted - I thought that if the obstacles that were in our way in the past were gone now, maybe this is an opportunity worth exploring that I shouldn’t be so quick to close the door on, and this could finally be my chance at love. And I figured she had to be at least interested in the possibility herself; I mean, she sought me out after 2.5 years of no contact. 

The next day, we met for coffee and agreed to try again, but of course on the same page with taking it slow for a couple months at least to feel out whether we could actually work before jumping rashly into anything. At this meeting she said that she partially intended on wanting to try to make it work again in reaching out to me, as I suspected. Due to our hectic work and life schedules, we saw each other only once a week, and texted a few times back and forth each day but nothing crazy.

Last week, she wasn’t texting me back as much and became distant. I figured that she was losing interest and that I was probably boring her, so I decided to step my game up and try to keep her on her toes for the date we had planned for that upcoming weekend (I was going to surprise her with a picnic in the park). That night, she texted me an essay saying that she completely changed her mind, and that she didn’t know what she wanted in a partner, wanting to keep all of her options open. I expected as much given the lack of responses I was getting from her, and I can’t control her decision, but I was very confused. Why the sudden 180? Why come back into my life for a few weeks just to play with me for a little bit, then just cause unnecessary emotional pain despite claiming that she understood pain she caused me before?

The more I thought about it, the more angry I got. If this was going to be the end result of the exercise, she should not have reached out to me in the first place and made damn sure she was truly 100% confident in what she wanted. I told her that she either lied about what she wanted from me, or she lied about knowing what she wanted. I felt like my time was just wasted massively, and in the time I’ve grown since the last relationship I had with her, I’ve learned to advocate for myself a lot more. I’m not going to sit around and be her plaything at her beck and call whenever is convenient for her or things don’t work out with other guys. I’m not going to be settled for, and I won’t be someone’s second choice. Don’t get me wrong, I’m lonely as hell, but I’d rather be single than be in that situation. After we talked on the phone about this (she didn’t even have the decency to do this over the phone until I asked for it, let alone in person, despite her heaping praise upon me for how I approached making sure to propose we try again in person). After that, I thought about it a lot more, and I sent her a couple texts that night laying into her for the games she’s playing with me and how I won’t stand for it. She responded the following morning with the usual denials and just trying to keep me in the back pocket as a friend or “we’ll see” about the future, but I made damn sure to explain to her that she was missing the point entirely, completely changed the page we were both on in a matter of 2 days (and the reason I was upset was because of that, not that it didn’t work out), and that she was using me as a fallback which I want no part of.

Sorry for the vent/ramble, but this whole thing has been making me feel a variety of things, from confusion to anger to depression. I’ve been doubting myself a lot because of it - my ex reached out to me and wanted me back, and then changed her mind, so there must be something wrong with me, my brain is saying. I don’t have a lot of confidence right now, my faith in modern dating culture is absolutely zero, and I fear each and every day that I’m going to die alone. 

So I guess what I’m trying to get at, other than just venting, is what the hell happened? I figure that I’ll read between the lines and that maybe she met another guy, and that’s fine - we never became an exclusive couple again, but for intents and purposes on my end it was pretty much exclusive for me since I tend to focus on one person at a time even in the “talking/dating” stage. And if that’s what happened, it’s got me down because apparently this guy has something I lack. Maybe he’s sexier or buffer, I don’t know.

33,nf2sop,1621317732,I guess the gender warfare on this sub is pretty stupid lol,"The problem with heterosexual dating is whenever one of us is having some kind of difficulty with dating, it’s related to the other gender.

And whenever the other side is complaining about dating, it is easy for it to sound like they are complaining about **your gender** and by extension **you** personally.

And if someone feels attacked or to a certain extent is being attacked by someone complaining about dating and they respond to it by modifying what is being said or rejecting it outright, the OP is almost certainly going to feel like what is going on is their experience is being dismissed by this person. Which may actually be happening to a certain extent. And they will respond and make no mention of the thing that actually fired the person up in the first place.

And then the dynamic will be set up for a lot of talking past each other. Then some people will hold grudges and start attacking other members of the other gender with barely any provocation.

This is the best case scenario. Lol.

There are also functioning radical echo chambers on reddit getting members of each gender fired up if they want to listen and/or participate in these communities. And the anonymous nature of reddit certainly unleashes extra hell onto us here.

So I think everyone just needs to relax. Lol. We’re just all really enjoying what this whole dating thing is giving us, aren’t we? /s

Maybe we should all go gay. Problem solved. Then it would be easier to be like: well, I guess we’re the same so... I guess they can’t be all bad. Right?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nf2sop/i_guess_the_gender_warfare_on_this_sub_is_pretty/

She doesn't engage or ask any question or initiate conversation in text, for the most part she seems disinterested, but she does respond somewhat and when I see her she talks to me and is very touchy putting her hand on my leg or arm.

So should I just play the long game keep txting or is she not interested and just playing with me,but why not just tell me if she's not interested she said she didn't mind me asking her out but ""lol"" at me asking if it made her uncomfortable.I feel like most girls would just tell me they aren't interested.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nf3s6b/can_i_get_some_perspective/

I would give some advice.. focus on something else. Try a new hobby, a new skill, a new thing of interest that is not motivated by sex or relationship.. something you actually like.
All my relationships have come from being in a certain place at a certain time. I know it sounds like a long way around to hitting the goal, but at the end of the day you should hope to find someone who compliments you. The intensity of someone who has been waiting for the moment of finding a date for months and years may actually drive that person away.

I’m no dating guru or pickup artist, I haven’t had massively long relationships or found the one, but I’m happy with my experiences and it pains me to see r/dating full of confused and down people.

71,nf924v,1621339817,I'm conflicted...with options,"I'm new to the reddit scene, so be gentle. 
I'm a 32 year old male and I've hit the dating scene hard in the past few years, as I never had the opportunity to properly date in my teens and early 20s.
Long story summed up: I've had some mild success- I've learned what I like, don't like and what I want.
To that, I've met and have been chatting with a nice woman who I'll refer to as Dee.
Dee isn't local to me, so we haven't had the opportunity to meet IRL. There's some red flags here-  ghosting me for hours on end; I'm always keeping the conversation going; and her constantly referring to male friends that she consistently talks to.

My confliction lies in the fact that other than those red flags, we're connecting on every level. Similar interests, wants and needs. 
The options I alluded to are this however: the closer I get to going down the rabbit hole with Dee, the more I'm opening my eyes to more local singles. There are a few I'm aware of that have told mutual friends of an attraction.

What do I do? Part of me wants to get more serious with Dee, but in the back of my mind I still want to keep my options open.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nf924v/im_conflictedwith_options/

76,nfaahr,1621343301,"My past racist experience as an Asian, makes me wanna become a cheater.","I am a south-east Asian.

I was born in a white-European Western country. Back then when I was young, growing up I always had difficulty dating or attracting girls. Girls back then, none of them were attracted to Asian guys. They were all interested in guys of their own same nationality/White guys.

Flash forward a few years, now in my early 20's. There's this sudden boom of Korean pop culture: K-pop, Korean tv dramas, etc.
All of a sudden, when I was used to no one being attracted to me or no girls getting interested on me, now I'm starting to attract girls and catch girls' attention. This sudden outburst of girls getting interested in Asian culture due to Korean, and also up to some extent, Japanese culture, made them also get interested and attracted to Asian guys.

I went from meeting no girls at all, to sleeping with maybe  around 20-30 girls in matter of 2 years. For sure, they were girls that were not interested initially because of my personality, but because of my race. What used to condemn me before, now is what makes me somewhat succesful.

I am now dating an amazing person, who oddly enough, even though she found me attractive due to my ethnic-cultural background, is not a girl obsessed with K-pop or K-dramas or none of that. She is an amazing person, and she fulfills me both emotionally and sexually.

But I've gotten to a point that, I want to have sex with more girls. I feel like, due to my past racist experience of girls not getting attracted to me due to my race, it's like I've wasted a lot of time. And even after sleeping with around 30 girls in a short period of time, I feel like it is not enough.

Now I am hungry. Hungry for sex.
I know what I shouldn't do (which is cheating).
But at the same time, I know what my body is screaming for me to do. I want to take advantage of their racist fetish and use them for my sexual pleasure, as they use me because of my racial Asian condition.

But I know I shouldn't because I have an amazing girlfriend lol This is so f*cked up. I am so confused.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nfaahr/my_past_racist_experience_as_an_asian_makes_me/

Looking back at all of the crazy stuff that's happened in my life I realized that I am very confident or at least brave for tackling all those issues but something that is challenging is that outside of being around the social group most women around me will never be able to see that

I am not super pushy or aggressive and I am way more feminine and sensitive than I am masculine and I know that hurts my chances with dating.

Women still seem to want a man to leave even though they don't need a man to lead anymore and that's the biggest conundrum of our time


I can sense it too and I think that's why I still struggle because I see a man acting confident around a woman as a performance and an adage of an old gender role and not something that is real


Of course a man can act how he is and be confident but that does not mean that he will be looked at more favorably despite what the advice says.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nfbq1p/you_can_be_confident_and_still_get_rejected_all/

86,nfbtww,1621347383,How do I rein it back?,"I've had a therapy for around 7 years. It started mainly with CBT for anxiety but around a year and a half ago, I dealed with a death in the family, a member of the family being hospitilized and essentially finding out my long term boyfriend didn't want to be with me any more so I ended the relationship. Safe to say my mind was not in a good place and I ended up getting EMDR therapy for trauma/anxiety/depression alongside counselling for about 7 months.

Fast forward to now I'm a completely different person, I'm extremely extroverted and very open and honest. I'm a big believer in talking, however I find when I go on dates with people they'll literally tell me all their deepest life situations. One guy I went on a date with I asked him ""oh are you close with your family?"" And he responded with ""no, not really"" to which I responded ""ah, right okay"" then he proceeded to go into detail about why he wasn't close to them and then said ""I don't know why I just told you that, only my best friends know that"". 

Obviously he needed to speak about it which is great and like I said before, I love when people are open, but it's getting to the point now where I think every other guy I date is doing the exact same and then they end up freaking out because they feel like they're in too deep.

We were supposed to go out in Saturday and she cancelled last minute, luckily just before I was about to get the bus and train to meet her! I wasn't really expecting to hear from her again tbh, but yesterday evening she asked me if I was free that night and we could go for a couple of drinks.

I wasn't really in the mood but I spoke to some friends and they said I should go, so I went. I was feeling super relaxed until I arrived at the bar early and she text to say she was running late. I was starting to get the feeling that she wasn't gunna show. Queue the flop sweat and anxiety. But 10 minutes later she got there. 

So we spent the next few hours talking and had a few beers. It was fucking amazing. The time just flew by, the bar staff eventually had to ask us to drink up and leave! We tried to find somewhere else for a drink but nowhere was open so I walked her most of the way home and she said she'd wait for my taxi to arrive. I was gunna ask if she wanted me to walk her all the way home but didn't want to come across as pushy or creepy or anything. We had a little hug and she asked if I wanted to go out again, which of course I do! 

It was just so great to talk to someone who was so interesting, intelligent and beautiful. She was geniunely interested in what I had to say too, which for me is quite rare. There were 3 occasions of very brief silence but other than that we talked all night and it just felt so easy and natural. There was one occasion where she was telling me about something and I was just so distracted in my head thinking about how great she was and how much I was enjoying listening to her that I actually wasn't listening to her 😅 I realised pretty quick and managed to catch up on the conversation so hopefully she didn't notice and think I was being rude! 

I made sure to text and ask if she got home okay and we briefly spoke about another date. It's taken all my will power not to text her as soon as I woke up this morning, I don't want to come on too strong after just one date. I'm really excited to go out with her again. The only issue is I'm moving a few hours away for work soon, I hope we keep dating despite that. 

Just wanted to share my happy story. I've not stopped smiling since I got in that taxi last night! I'm trying not to get carried away but I'm a hopeless romantic and it was just such a good evening! 

We'll see how things pan out, but I feel pretty good and for the first time in a while, I feel genuinely happy and I'm really excited about getting to know her.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nfc3zk/my_first_date_with_alice/

As I got up to continue skating, this guy grabbed my arm and called my name. Turns out it was a guy that I was close to in our high school years (we didn’t date and we weren’t in a relationship). 

We spent A LOT of time together back then. I went to his football games. I was close with his mom and grandma and his mom and my mom worked together. I was always over his house (no intimacy or anything). We went on little teenage outings together. It was plain to see that me and him had crushes on each other. Unfortunately, I moved and we completely lost contact. I seen him one time a few years later in passing.

So seeing him at the skating rink was really nice. He stayed by me most of the time, he asked me twice if I had a boyfriend and we just had good conversation. He also kept saying (since it was each our first time at that rink in years) that it was crazy he seen me. So it’s time to leave the rink and I strongly felt he was going to ask for my number and he didn’t. I was a little sad, can’t lie. I don’t know if he was shy because my friend was right there and didn’t want to ask or what. 

So the next day I followed him on Instagram (he told me his name on IG at the rink). He immediately messaged me saying it was good seeing me and we should meet up sometime and I basically agreed. Anyways he ends up giving me his number and I text him. 6 text messages in (simple, casual conversation) he doesn’t respond to me, but of course he’s active on Instagram. It’s been almost a day since his failure to respond. 

I’m not clingy, I’m not going to double-text him. I guess I just don’t know what to think. It was my hope to reestablish our friendship, but I don’t want to look desperate. No he’s not too busy and I’m sure he has sent out texts to other people since I texted him. Plus he’s active on social media. Yes, we aren’t dating or in a relationship, but we use to be close so I expected this to go totally different. I guess I had high hopes and expectations when I shouldn’t have. 9/10 I’m overthinking. 

However, it may be that he’s not interested, which is ok. But why would he ask twice if I have a boyfriend, message me on Instagram and give me his number? What are your thoughts? (My apologies for the lengthy post).

98,nfcsg8,1621349719,"Before dating, everyone should become familiar with certain terms/red flag behaviors that define what dating should NOT entail","Probably much too late in my life, I became familiar with many of the terms used to define bad behavior within the context of dating and relationships. I really wish I had been more well aware of these behavioral patterns so that I could identify them in some situations and avoided people who brought negative experiences into my life and dating.

For example, a phrase I only just became familiar with recently is ""love bombing,"" which is when someone will lay on the compliments and infatuation toward you very heavily, but then they do things like they withhold giving you that same attention or ignoring you after they've built you up to feel great about yourself and in turn, falling for them. It's this whole toxic behavior involving control, emotional manipulation and making you feel attached to them. I totally had that happen to me over the course of a few months some years ago by a woman I was seeing. The whole time, I was just confused about what was going on because I didn't understand the behavior. When things ended, she ended things abruptly right after she had literally just told me she wanted to go all in on our relationship, and with that, my self-esteem was pretty wrecked while also feeling like I was the one who did something wrong. She had some issues, and 

There are plenty of more terms as well, like gaslighting and everything under the emotional abuse umbrella. I think that younger people have a better grasp on these behaviors than people my age (in our 30s) did, and for that, I think it probably makes them smarter daters. I wish before I had started dating, I had been well versed in what dating shouldn't look like and what a healthy partner does not do rather than just being concerned with all the good aspects of it.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nfcsg8/before_dating_everyone_should_become_familiar/
