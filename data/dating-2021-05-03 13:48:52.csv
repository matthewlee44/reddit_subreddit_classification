1,n449m9,1620068347,Sick of friends giving advice they wouldn't themselves take in the same situation...,"Does anybody else here have friends who seem to repeatedly take stabs at your attempts in the dating world or choices in potential partners? Going as far as to make suggestions to you that they themselves wouldn't do in the same situation.

I live an alternative clean living (no alcohol, smoke, drugs etc) artist lifestyle and I fully accept that it isn't for everybody, so I try to scope out potential partners by seeing if our values align. I know that people who frequent clubs or live a party lifestyle are going to find me boring, and all of my past experiences dating extroverts led to them trying to pull me outwards when it just isn't who I am, and was a miserable experience for both sides.

No matter how many times I try to explain myself or explain what it is I'm looking for, I just get my friends labeling me as being ultra picky. These same people who say these things all happen to be in relationships with people with the same core interests and values as them. They're gamer couples or both have similar hobbies and lifestyle interests they can share with their partner.

We're all different and we all have things we seek out in potential partners, and I'm guessing for most of us we are seeking a partner that has a lifestyle that will compliment our own, and I do not think there is anything wrong with that. I understand that sometimes people who are completely different will have chemistry, but I also don't think there is anything wrong with wanting to find somebody who you share lots in common with, even if it does narrow your potential options down.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n449m9/sick_of_friends_giving_advice_they_wouldnt/

Are there other men out there who believe in being seen as an equal in a courtship or relationship? I'm (29M/EU) not the best looking or the most ''genetically gifted'' in terms of dating market value (aka not white or a black male) but I'm of average height, do clean up well, am educated and have a stable life. That's gotta account for something in terms of attraction or interest, right? I know dating is stacked against us to begin with but I'm genuinely wondering if my standards are set too high in wanting to be with someone that is just as into me/willing to put in the same level of effort as I am. It's gotten pretty demeaning putting myself out there, getting to know people only to realise that in most cases, I'm the one 'dragging all the weight'. Some guys out there may be fine doing so given how we are often 1 out of hundreds of matches... but is there something wrong with me if I'd rather be single or miss out on finding someone to share something with rather than subject myself to this rat race of sorts?

7,n4546g,1620070420,Not sure where I stand with him,"I've recently been talking to and hanging out with an old co-worker of mine. When we worked together (at a treatment center) I had a serious boyfriend. We've been broken up for 5 months now and over the past month and a half or so, I've been talking to this old co-worker a lot. He ""slid into my DM's"" so to speak.

We text for a short period of time usually every day and it's been this way since we met up for coffee about 5 weeks ago. It had been almost 2 years since I'd seen him and we talked for 4 hours. He is in recovery and I'd learned he'd relapsed and is in a sober living program now. He is currently getting certified to be a personal trainer &amp; is working toward finishing up his program and getting a job. I understand he has a lot going on, so I definitely don't want to rush anything but I'm confused. He was definitely very flirty when we first started talking. Heart eye emojis on my photos, complimenting me, etc. He also went out to dinner with me and my friend and her husband on my birthday a couple weeks ago. I feel like we have an awesome time together and always have stuff to talk about. We just went mini golfing the other day, too and had a blast. We definitely flirted a little, but the night just ended in a hug as per usual.

He is a very attractive, nice, and easygoing man and I honestly feel like he is out of my league, so I'm a bit hesitant to show him I'm interested. It's a weird thing going from old co-workers to telling someone you like them. I get that he is possibly just taking things slow due to his circumstances or possibly even mine, having recently gotten out of a very serious relationship.

Obviously, his sobriety is number one and I know he needs to focus on himself, but all of this talking and hanging out has me confused. I feel like the more times we hang out and it continues to end in a hug, things are just going to grow awkward.

I guess any advice is appreciated here.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n4546g/not_sure_where_i_stand_with_him/

When I asked her out, I was very upfront and direct, and I also took the time to plan out dates and was respectful the whole time. I really like her.

Since we've last seen each other (our last date),  I've worked on myself, and I can proudly say I'm a much better man than I was a year ago! I'm in a way better position to have a serious relationship with marriage in mind. Would it be okay if I sent her a text asking how she is, explaining I've worked on myself quite a bit and asking if she would be willing to give us another shot? Obviously, in the message, I'll say don't feel bad/no worries if you're not interested. I want to respect her original decision; the only reason I'm mulling over this is that I feel like I've made significant changes, and I don't get to see her in person, so she can't see it naturally in which I would leave it up to her.

17,n46h7j,1620073822,Is she giving me hints or is she just being friendly?,"Hello Reddit. I've had a little bit of a crush on this girl I work with for a little while now, and I am probably the least experienced person with women and relationships I know, so I honestly can't tell if she was hinting at me at work the other day. I would greatly appreciate any and all insight into the situation!

So, the other day, she was put on the register right in front of the one I was working on a slow day. We literally had no customers so we were just talking about music. We have about the same music taste and we both collect records, so we were just bullshitting, nothing too out of the ordinary. I forgot how this happened, but she ended up coming up to me and asked for my hand, to which I obliged, getting a little nervous because I had a bit of a crush on her, and I'm generally an anxious person. She just drew a smiley face that said, ""smile"" underneath, but it stood out to me because I've been friends with plenty of women before, and never have they asked to draw on my hand lol. I could see how it could just be a friendly gesture, but as I said, I can't read signals for shit so.

 We bullshitted again for a little while until she was put elsewhere. As she was walking away, she looked back at me and said, ""Bye, JLennon224. I know you'll miss me!"" which was something else that I thought could be her hinting to me. 

Other than that, on my way out of work, I was looking for a drink at some of the coolers at the end of our register lanes, and I noticed as I was looking for a tea, she peeked back and said ""Hi JLennon 224!"" to me and of course, I said Hi back. I then checked out the drink I was buying and was walking down to the exit closest to my car, which happened to be towards where she was working, and I noticed she was smiling and making short glances at me, and when I got close enough, she said bye to me and I said bye back.   


Usually, I don't have that much of an opportunity to talk to her, so I was thinking maybe she's just a really friendly person, and that day I just so happened to have the opportunity to talk to her, but I really don't know what to think but I digress. I would really like any insight you all have for me! And as a side note, I am going to try and pursue her because I'll be moving elsewhere that's within a relatively short driving distance, and I'll hate myself for potentially missing this opportunity because she's really cool, but I would like to know what you all think.

So I went on a date on 25th of April with a guy. We really clicked well and spent 6-7 hours together. We did end up sleeping together (I know too early), but he wanted to introduce me to his best friend right after which he did and he wasn’t acting any distant. He kept hugging and kissing afterwards too. 
But being stupid me, I was expecting him to message me and didn’t even consider messaging him. He did react to my insta story too. He didn’t message me, so I thought he’s not interested. But now thinking, I am sure I acted not interested and cold when said goodbye. Many people tell me that I do act distant so maybe he wanted me to make a move for the second date. I did like him a lot. I am scared of rejection. 
I want to message him this Thursday and ask if he’s free either Saturday or Sunday. 
Also, we both agreed that we didn’t want to have one night stand and he was the one who told me that first.

23,n47ia4,1620076394,Why the fuck is he [27M] dating me [22F]? Why is he so insecure when I bring up other guys?,"We met on tinder. Neither of us want to commit but we are both out of the honeymoon phase. He said he usually loses interest in dating someone after 2 months and right now, it is 3 months. We would call and talk every few days because we were so needy. The courtship was very honeymoon, we were very interested, remembering small things telling each other were cute dis n dat. We struggled to connect on an intellectual level. We check up on each other through lots of images and text. It was great.

He did look out for me in small ways. He bought me soap, asked about my uni, my work, told me to invest, see more friends, career advice, remembered that I liked camembert cheese, life advice and small details he remember every week we met up. It was charming and caring. He noted that he thinks I’m very mature for my age in how I approach life and friends. Wtf does that mean?

He tells me because he’s Canadian, he doesn’t have friends here. Only hangs out with acquaintances when he needs something from them. When he asks which of his friends do I think are hot, I tell him and he got jealous. Which is very odd because all of my guy friends know they’re good looking they complement each other and admit it. I told him i have a lot of male friends, and that all guy friends want to fuck you and I was a bit shocked because I didnt think so. Most of my guy friends and I have civil conversation. 

We did sexual things every week but not actual sex. One weekend stood out for me. After say, 2 months straight, he asked for sex 3 weeks in a row to which I had to use protection and I said no. His mood was immediately pissed off and annoyed. I asked him how he was feeling about me and he told me that he felt like seeing other women. He logged into Tinder and said that he didn’t swipe because he felt guilty because he was seeing me. He also said that he cares about me but he didn’t want to hurt me. And said to me “don’t you know what every guy wants? Every guy wants to date other girls while the girl he dates doesn’t get to date any guys”. I felt angered that he still didn’t like me. So I told him that I wanted to see other guys too but I couldn’t because he got jealous. He said “well if you date someone else you won’t find someone like me who will take care of you.” I immediately red flagged him and was so upset that he would try to coax me like that. I told him, right in front of him that I wasn’t feeling too great and smiling through the tears I was holding back. He felt sad for me but didn’t offer any explanation or emotional reassurance.

Neither of us want commitment. He just checks out my girl friend in my FB profile picture which is normal. When I asked him why were dating, he said he thinks we get along well and that the biggest issue he’s had in the past with other girls is lack of compatibility.

I knew for a long time that his entire dating history has been Asian women too and I was annoyed at this. When I told him once I interviewed my cousin for a news article, he was like “ooh your cousin?”. It was just gross, like he’s trying to get with every girl he sees or hears about. I was clearly upset about everything he said.

He called the next day to see if I was okay and I told him that we can have arrangements if he doesn’t want to see me anymore. I told him how he hurt me. I understand he had needs. He said sorry. He said that he didn’t want to lose me and that he didn’t want to invest in getting to know another person and then going through the whole process.

Since then our interest levels in each other have stayed relatively low.

His texting language has also changed. We are texting less affectionately, but more like busy friends. We don’t ask for pictures of each other like we did before. His language feels flat and resembles the language he uses with his guy friends. Just casual. And doesn’t really add a splash of affection to his texts to me. He cares more about me than I do about him.

Yesterday I asked him if he wanted to watch mortal kombat and he said yes. Today he followed it up and asked if we wanted to watch the movie in 2 days, which is usually date night.

Note: I’m 22 - designer, recently finished uni, designer, he is 27 - physiotherapist

————————

TLDR;
Does he still like me? Why the fuck is he dating me if we don’t have sex? I honestly felt like it was a dealbreaker and important thing to him. I just want to date someone hot, who respects me, is interested in me, who will watch me grow with my career, and stop perving on my friends. Just really confused because his texting language feels like he lost interest. Why is he so insecure whenever I mention other guys? Some part of me feels like he’s progressing and getting better.

This gap at the dating age creates a shortage of women to date. In past times this extra men would have die in war/labor or other dangerous actives that are much safer or none existence in the western world.

I don’t want to leave because I am so tired of starting over. I’m tired of leaving someone I cared about and feeling forgotten. I’m tired of feeling like I’m not enough. I’m 30 yo female. I want a family and I want undeniable love but through all the pain in relationships I’ve had it’s become impossible to imagine me getting from here to there. 

I feel lonely and a piece of life that I desire so badly feels empty. 

I have my own place, a great dog, good job, friends, family...I know how to work hard for what I want but romance just doesn’t work like that and it’s honestly embarrassing to me how bad I want it, but with the right person.

31,n48mpm,1620079261,Why text me with nothing to say?,"Okay so I’m actually curious because this has seemed to happen to me a fair few times recently. 

Context:::So this guy I met on discord few months back and I started talking, we both straight off the bat admitted we were attracted to each other. We flirted little and often for a few weeks, exchanged some pics and such. We had a few conversations where we tried to get to know each other a little.. I felt he was quite guarded. Anyway, somehow fizzled out and we stopped talking for a little, mainly because I wasn’t getting much from him in his responses which made me think he’s not genuinely interested in the conversation so it comes to a natural end lol. 

So confusing part is though he has messaged me ‘Goodmorning’ every day, yet has NOTHING to talk about.
The problem is it never starts a conversation, and the conversation just seems a little pointless. It is a little annoying because he always does it at times he knows we’re both gonna be busy immediately after.
Like his reply to my response is usually something like ‘I’m going to work have a good day’ 

Am I wrong to find this annoying? I feel like he’s playing some kind of game and I’m tired of being the only one who puts any effort into conversation so much of the time. AITA for not appreciating the good morning text..?

Also why do people do this?! Is there ever an innocent reason?

TL;DR
He hmu every morning but got nothin else to say. He’s confusing my little brain...",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n48mpm/why_text_me_with_nothing_to_say/

33,n48usg,1620079850,"I don't feel comfortable flirting unless it's clearly consensual. Is there a way to figure if someone is comfortable with flirting, but without being so direct that it kills the mood [22F]?","**TLDR;** I have trouble making making a move or being flirtatious with someone I like unless I'm 100% sure they're attracted to me; knowing I feel extremely uncomfortable if someone I'm not interested in hits on me. It's costed me over the years, because I feel like I've lost possible love interests this way. 

When someone I'm not interested in is flirtatious with me, especially if they make physical contact or stand closer to me, it makes me extremely uncomfortable. I can't really quite describe it but it gives me an uneasy feeling and makes my stomach turn to be spoken to in a sexual/romantic way by someone I'm not attracted to. But at the same time, I get it. How else are they supposed to gauge if I'm interested in them? They're going to want to test the waters and see if they can break the personal space barrier and all that. 

So when I like someone, I struggle to figure out how to act around them without knowing how they feel about me first. And if they try to flirt with me, I'll second-guess their actions and worry I'm misinterpreting it.

It's been a vicious cycle of:

1. Guy seems interested but it's not clear. 
2. I hold off on flirtation until I have clear verbal confirmation they're interested or at least attracted to me. 
3. My type is men with submissive personalities, or extremely introverted men, so I think they're actually waiting on some kind of sign of interest from me. But I can't bring myself to flirt with someone unless I know attraction is definitely reciprocated. 
4. No clear sign is given by either party. 
5. I tense up around them and become very timid and hesitant, because I can't figure out whether to act platonically or flirtatiously around them. 
6. We never get to test our true compatibility because I couldn't be myself around them without knowing how they felt. 
7. Too much time passes and they lose interest. 

So it's like I need some clear verbal confirmation of ""I'm attracted to you"" or ""I'm interested in you"" before I feel comfortable proceeding with being even subtly flirtatious around them. I really just have a personal issue with giving someone unwanted romantic/sexual attention and making them uncomfortable.  But I also feel like it's not common to straight up ask someone ""Are you interested in me?"" or ""Are you attracted to me?"" I feel like it could come off as presumptuous or cocky, like I'm assuming they're attracted to me (or is it)?

I also feel like actions that are too direct are probably mood killers. Asking someone for consent to flirt seems like overkill, but I also don't think I could ever bring myself to do it when I'm uncertain about whether attraction is reciprocated.  Is there a way to go about this where I can get clear verbal confirmation from a love interest that they're attracted, but also not so direct that's a mood killer? But also not too cocky?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n48usg/i_dont_feel_comfortable_flirting_unless_its/
34,n48xta,1620080088,This guy that left me on read a lot and basically ghosted me is mad I removed him from social media,"I (27f) met a guy (29) online. Had great conversations. Had plans to meet up but something came up and then the next week he what a funeral and the next weekend I was away. He didn't want to meet during the week bc we're a little over an hour apart. By the 4th weekend, we barely spoke. He left me on read. Took forver to respond. Stopped replying to snapchats. Would shut down conversations at 9pm when we used to talk to midnight and tell me he was going to bed, but made it clear he was a night owl and was likely up. Ignored or played dumb towards some advances (like me telling him the sunset would've been better with company, meaning it would've been better with him). Stopped taking my jokes and took them literally (he joked I blow all my savings on the lottery and I said it'd be easy because I have none - which isn't true at all - but he took it to lecture me and tellcme how it's ""crazy"" I don't have anything). Wouldn't reply for several days at a time. Etc. 

So basically, tons of signs he wasn't into me anymore. Which is fine, it happens! Personally, the fact he talked shit about his transgender sister (happened towards the end) was enough for me to not be interested in pursuing things further anyway. I don't think that's cool and it's definitely not a good first impression. But like, man up and say something and end it? Especially when he BEGGED to continue talking when we had a disagreement about something major. 

I considered reaching out to end whatever we had, but I also feel like he wanted me to do that so he didn't have to. And he wasn't respecting me and my time either. So I took his approach and went radio silent after he left me on read for the 4th day in a row. I did plan to tell him I was done talking if he were to reach out again, but he hasn't.  Until today when he noticed I removed him from snapchat. He was PISSESD. I explained how he made me feel, how it was obvious he wasn't interested, how I've lost interest, and ultimately, keep snapchat only for those close to me- which he wasn't. And how he would ignore me but watch my snap story almost immediately. I basically told him to just stop because it's obvious he's not into it anymore. He kept saying I was wrong and crazy but if that's what I want, to not talk toc him anymore, then fine. 

Was I wrong to remove him without warning? Did I interpret things incorrectly? Or was he just gaslighting me in our recent convo?

I have a lot going for me.

I don't expect any more than this from any woman, and in fact I regularly compromise on a few of them. And yet, still I am only ever rejected.

And is it reasonable of me to remain single when the only options available to me seem to be women who fulfil none of my criteria whatsoever?

I started messaging her afterwards and she would take a little while to reply and conversations would fizzle out and wouldn’t hear from her for a couple of days. 

I asked her out and we met up for a coffee and it was really nice, still got along great. Then I didn’t hear from her again and when I messaged her she would take hours to reply and so I started to assume maybe she wasn’t interested and that was fine. Then out of nowhere she asked me out for a coffee again and that was great as well. 

I’ve seen her again since then at an event and after that I asked her out but she was busy, and I asked about another day but she was busy as well. We chatted for a bit but now I feel like I need to back off a bit as I’ve asked her out twice but she’s busy so I obviously can’t keep asking. It’s been a couple days since we’ve talked. 

I think I know now that she’s probably just not that into texting (which is fine) and I know not to take it personally after I didn’t hear from her then she still asked me out, clearly interested. 

It’s just a little frustrating as it’s making it hard to keep the momentum going and I really want to see her.

I know that being a mute is baggage and this severely hampers communication. A lot of people don't wanna deal with other people's baggage. You hear a lot of bizarre caveats people have with their date that are really nitpicky and decide to call it off so you can understand just how much of a deal breaker it is to not be able to speak.

So anyway, I've been getting into dating recently because I've been hit with a quarter life crisis and to be completely blunt want to get laid. I don't even want to do it for the same reasons I had as a teen, I'm mainly getting into dating cause my self esteem is so low that it crashed through the fucking floor after being rejected constantly all these years and it's been so debilitating lately. Like I can't even focus or study anymore because of the constant negative thoughts that I've got no control over.

I'm at a massive disadvantage so I realized I had to compensate heavily. Since I got into dating, I tried to get into whatever could sound appealing/attractive. The list of things I've learned is this:

* Guitar
* Windmill breakdance move
* French
* Drawing
* A fuck load of quips and jokes for situational use

Still I never managed to really get my foot in the door so to speak. I've been ""trying"" to date for the past 3 months alongside uni work but I never actually went on a date. I'm genuinely curious now, has anyone here gone on a trip of personal development in order to be a more suitable mate?

I fear every opportunity my GF has to meet new men (She's playing in a co-ed soccer league with strangers, and Im literally panicking), I fear that I can't trust her guy friends, or people she has hooked up with in the past but are still around in some capacity. These thoughts, when present, consume every ounce of mental energy I have. It is literally exhausting. While there have been some reasons to raise an eyebrow from time to time, I do not have a legitimate basis to really feel this skeptical of my GF or anyone else I have dated for that matter.

Heres the hard part, and why I don't want anyone to feel bad for me. I'm the asshole in this relationship. I dont treat her poorly, infact quite the opposite. I shower her with quality time and affection. But, I got into it because I was lonely, and the pandemic really cut dating and sex out of my life and i truly felt desperate. Other than the fact that Ive now spent 4-5 months with this girl and developed some level of emotional attachment, there is so much lacking in her and in the relationship, that I know I wouldnt put up with if i felt more secure with my prospects outside of her and I together.

I am an objectively good looking guy, and have recently really come into myself socially. But my anxiety with new women is still crippling, and I don't have many friends in the city where I live. I don't know what to do.

I am just so sad, and feel guilty. This girl is falling in love with me, and here I am just going through the motions.

I end up going to play a gig and I immediately clicked with one of the musicians (f22). It’s hard to describe but our interactions flowed so well, and after the performance she actually asked for my snap (ik lots of people hate on snap but that’s the world we’re in). Something definitely felt different about this girl and I figured let’s follow this feeling.

We live 2 hours away from each other so it took a couple weeks but we planned a date and it went swimmingly. Hands down the best I’d been on, and the chemistry was even stronger. Just one of those things that felt right ya know? We agreed we wanted to see each other again and what not. Our second date ended up being canceled as it was a holiday weekend and she had family, understandable I’d say. We’re both in college so she wants to wait till end of the semester and while normally I wouldn’t wait I thought this would be worth it. Anyway through all this we hadn’t texted/snapped a whole lot and for the most part I didn’t look into that much and figured long as in person interaction is solid who cares?  

Well we get to me checking in a week or so before semester ends, this is just a few days ago, and I’m left on delivered for 2 days, and now on read. I know this isn’t uncommon to happen, I just felt this situation was different. I’m not saying she was THE ONE but she made me wanna build a relationship and take that chance with her and I was excited to explore it. I think I know the answers I’ll get but is there any advice on if I should do anything or should I leave it all behind and move tf on? I keep telling myself over and over the latter but it’s eating at me and I guess I’m just really confused and conflicted. If anything this was kind of a vent but I appreciate anything y’all throw in here.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n4b3f6/dont_put_all_your_eggs_in_one_basket_folks/

I am 28, soon 29. Basically I was a kissless virgin for a solid \~28 years. What really fired up my desire for change was meeting a girl who I really fancied, but realistically I had had no idea how to approach her.

&amp;#x200B;

Watched her get a boyfriend while I was on the sidelines as a bystander, and I was pretty sick of my complete failure at this part of life (and many other but that's not a discussion for now).

I installed some dating apps, did my best to LEARN how to be engaging, funny, creative in text. I only ever told like 3-4 girls about my lack of experience, and none of them ended well. They either didn't believe me, ghosted me or the combination of these. I really quickly gave up on the idea of being honest.

I went on lots of actual dates. Let me tell you it's hard to try and give out the vibe of a confident guy when you haven't as much as held hands with someone before....lol.

&amp;#x200B;

Tons of different experiences here. There was a girl I really fancied who just disappeared after 3 dates, girl who I ended up not liking at all after really getting to actually know her...random car sex on the 2nd date...honestly just overall a mess of things I could probably write a small novel about.

I was afraid of dating for such a long time , and it ended up being not such a huge deal after all. I would like to think If I could put together enough of a presentable man to attract someone, most other guys out there can do the same (unless they are lightspeed ugly I guess). I was absolutely stunned by the amount of compliments I got on just generally being a decent and interesting chat partner on dating apps ( the avarage male must be godawful )

&amp;#x200B;

Covid of course put a stop to a lot of this, but towards the end I did meet a girl who I still feel to this day is a really good match to my personality. We've officially been together for 6 months now, but I haven't a goddamn clue whether what I am feeling towards her is actual love. I never told her about my lack of experience, or well I actually did several times, but she considers it a joke ...so yeah.

We don't yet live together, but spend a couple nights a week at my place or her place. All is well, but it 100% feels like she desires my company a lot more than I do hers. I care for her a lot, but I have no idea how to make a decision on this topic, feels 10x harder than any of the dates ever did.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n4bfsb/spent_28_years_as_a_kissless_virgin_then_tried/

We started at 5:30 and by the time I got back to drop her off it’s about 12am. She invites me inside to check out her apartment and we end up making out on the couch. 

I was a little touchy than what she was used to and she simply asked me to slow it down in a calming manner. I obliged of course. She told that it had been a while for her, which i understood completely. Shortly after she said she was tired and would go to bed. She let me crash on her couch since it was late and a long drive home for me. All night I thought that I had blown it with this girl. 

The next morning she texts me to lay in bed with her and cuddle with her, which blew my mind since it was the last thing I expected. We then grabbed lunch. 

I guess she is still interest based on what happened the following day, but in my mind I still feel like I lost her interest in some form or fashion.

We go on dates, hangout with each others friends, cuddle, and spend nights with each other. I think its obvious she likes me and I think I make it obvious that I like her. We hang out a few times a week.

I have this problem of taking things personally when she takes a while to text me back. Even at the beginning of the relationship before we met up, I almost considered letting it go because I didn't think she made an effort to message me in a timely manner. 

Rationally, I know she will text me back eventually, and when she doesn't message me for awhile she always has a good reason to have gone MIA. In my mind, letting texts sit for over 6 hours shows negligence and worries me that she is not as interested as I may think. Currently, she just opened my snap, left it on open and still hasn't responded to my texts congratulating her on getting an internship. 

In my last relationship when I was doing long distance I was dependent on getting texts back and part of why that relationship fell apart was because I couldn't stand being ignored. We are not yet dating but I would like to continue getting to know her. I am looking for advice on how to not be obsessed if this girl texts me back and have such a big effect on my mood.

People my age can easily have a body count of over 5, some even over 15. It’s not that I’m not into hookup culture. I wanna try it, but it seems like no one wants to try it with me. Sometimes I just don’t get why some ppl can get hookups easily, but for me I can’t even though I’m living in a uni dorm in Australia.

Yes I might sound desperate in the above paragraph, but I’m just trying to prepare for the long run.

This made me sad and worried.

I don’t want to get to the stage where most people have slept with a bunch of ppl and I’m still a virgin but sadly I’m getting there.

75,n4cl7j,1620090925,Today is the 1 year anniversary with my first ever boyfriend and I've never been so happy,"Today is my and my partner's 1 year anniversary of being together. This is honestly such a special day for me because I never thought I'd be so blessed to be with such a fantastic human being. I'm not surprised that we made it to 1 year, but I'm more so thrilled that he decided to stay with me for this long because I really am a handful, ngl.

I've never really been good at dating. I didn't start until I was 21. I went to an all girls high school and didn't have many interactions with the opposite sex. When I did, they were beyond not interested in me. I'm not the most attractive girl. I'm a little chubby with stuff that wiggles and I have chronic acne. I can't style my hair nor can I apply make up perfectly. I'm just an average girl that likes to be one of the guys, I guess, which made dating hard for me. On top of that, my personality is a little like a tornado in a jar: it's chaotic where I'm sometimes a bit all over the place due to what I experienced in high school, so I tend to be on the defensive a lot when associating with people. I'm an introverted extrovert, I guess? Like, I love not socialising and I love my me time where I can just watch Netflix and cuddle my cat, but I love having friends and I love going out with them, you know?

Having a boyfriend was something I always wanted, especially when I was watching all my friends get into relationships and I felt like I had no chance. I wasn't pretty. I wasn't skinny. I just didn't seem like much of a catch, in my opinion. I'd spend hours on Tinder trying to get any kind of conversation. I really was lonely. I guess even desperate. After a couple of average and even terrible dates, I'd given up hope that I'd ever meet someone. I didn't like the idea of going to bars and just chatting with randoms. Tinder wasn't working, Bumble was a waste of time, and I was just about to delete it all and give up hope.

And then I met my boyfriend. I still remember the first photo I saw of him. It was this moody black and white professionally captured photo of him modelling. I was intrigued. As a photographer myself, that photo really caught my eye. But he wasn't someone I'd normally try to go for. I won't lie, I had the conventional idea of what I wanted, like, Hollywood style man: 6ft tall, muscular, a beautiful face and just all around a hot specimen. The man I was looking at didn't fit that mold: 5ft8, quite skinny, couple of tattoos. But damn, his face. I was like, ""damn, he is one hot man. I'd love to photograph this perfect man.""

I messaged first. I messaged him with this stupid joke that last week he told me was really cringe but he played along. I found out later that he thought I was trying too hard to be funny, which lines up with me perfectly. We chatted and really hit it off. We had so much in common. When we met up the next day, I remember distinctly that he was trying to explain gaming to me. I listened and then just unloaded all my gaming knowledge, showing that we both had that in common. His jaw pretty much dropped. We went back to his place to Netflix and chill, and I always had this rule for myself that I'd never stay at someone's house on the first date. But I was just so comfortable with him after lots of cuddling, so much so that I slept over. I went home the next day and I got his number, and that's when it really began. I ended up finding out later that he'd almost deleted Tinder. I'd messaged him minutes before he was going to delete the app. Divine intervention? Maaaybe!

1 year later and we're still going strong. We live together now. Our parents love us. My mum treats him like her third child, always giving him medical advice and medical needs when he needs it (Mum's a nurse and my boyfriend's body is a bit susceptible to illnesses so Mum helps him out when she can). His mum absolutely adores me and she always asks for me when she calls her son. His dad gives me loads of life advice that I always need because I have no idea how to adult as a 23 year old woman. Later this year, my boyfriend's buying his first house and he wants to make it a home for us. In the beginning, I was always worried we were moving so fast with this, but now 1 year later I've never been more happy with my boyfriend. I can't stay at home for longer than 8 hours until I want to go back to him. I've just never been so happy.

So, with all the recent sad posts I've seen on this subreddit, I just want to let all of you who are looking for someone know that you'll find someone. I'm not going to give you the advice to wait until he/she/they come to you. I'm not going to tell you to be patient. It doesn't always work like that. Waiting didn't work for me. It wasn't until I went out there and put myself out there that found my person. The One won't necessarily come to you, you find each other. But there's also nothing wrong with being single. It gives you a chance to love yourself before you can love someone else. I never did that. I never took the time to love myself and be content and happy with me and who I am before I found my boyfriend. I was just so lucky that I found someone who helped me do that as well as being able to love him. He's helped me grow and he's helped me become the person I am today. 

So have faith, my friends. You'll find the person you're looking for in time, but don't forget that being single isn't bad either, because loving yourself is just as important as loving someone else.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n4cl7j/today_is_the_1_year_anniversary_with_my_first/

There’s this guy (24) I (23) met here on Reddit (yep, you read that right folks! In another sub obviously). We moved to TG and we have been chatting for a week.

In my months of seeking for greater connection on dating apps and the internet, this guy is like the first I actually vibe with. He is very nice, we share the same values, he is pleasing to the eyes (well based on his TG icon which I doubt he is cat-fishing lmao) and just overall easy to talk to. You can say that I am interested in him. I do maybe even like him a bit.

I am not really the type to chat with multiple guys coz it drains my energy and I have stuff to do too so even after chatting with this guy only for a few days, I decided to unmatch with my Bumble and Tinder matches and deleted both accounts. I just want the continuous cycle of failed interactions to end. And I thought this guy was the answer..

Until yesterday. I was the one who sent the last message. He has seen the message but has not said anything ever since. It’s been 48 hours. Idk what he is up to and that’s what bothers me. We do not have connection outside of TG. We are both working professionals and he might be busy at work, and afaik he likes playing online games too so maybe that’s another one. But d*mn having anxiety is really not helping.

I also kinda blame myself coz I told him I want to start as low maintenance friends. But I also said that I am not closing possibilities to dating and he is hinting at that too when we first started talking. I feel I’m inside a veryyyy slooooooow burn fiction right now. We haven’t even talked about personal stuff it’s really just surface level conversation. I know I have no right to demand anything but I really can’t stop overthinking things.

In the first few days that we talked he also ended up not sending a message for 2 days and takes like 3-8hours to reply. Since then I started overthinking but not to the point LIKE THIS.

Did I make the right decision to just stick to this guy until I’m ready to talk to another person again? What if he is really just not interested in me and he might be chatting with multiple people too (very possible)? Did he finds me ugly?? (I sent him my pic and he only said cute but I might not be his type lol). Or is he really just THAT busy? I don’t wanna look needy since I was the last person who sent the message.

Maybe I will also end up deleting my TG app for good if he doesn’t reply until the weekend. Or idk maybe I should wait for him and just keep myself busy in the process until I start loosing interest in him? I would appreciate some genuine advice but if you have reached this point reading my nonsensical rant then I appreciate. Thank you.

PS: If the guy I’m talking to ends up reading this, well idk maybe give me a sign that you are still there and not gonna ghost coz I’m tired of being ghosted.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n4d8fi/feel_like_i_got_ghosted_but_also_im_really_tired/
82,n4d9t9,1620093151,Dating a Nurse,Feeling really conflicted with this one.  I just feel powerless because I have no sense of her schedule.  I happen to work a M-F 9-5 schedule so ideally the weekend is the best time for me to meet especially in the early stages while I am still trying to get something going with this girl.  So far it's only been 2 dates and they have been suggestions at the end of last one that we should meet again. I tried to suggest the weekend 1 week after our last date and it turns out she couldn't for that one because she took a shift from another colleague and shared that she usually takes every other weekend off.  I dunno if that means that the subsequent weekend she wouldn't have off or I'd have to make do with a non-weekend date which would have to be in the evenings instead.  To make matters she is not very communicative and I feel like I am having to make most of the moves.,dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n4d9t9/dating_a_nurse/

90,n4eafp,1620096525,Your opinion; does she like me?,"Hey, community.. looking for advice here. 
Pretty much (as summed up and short as this can be) I matched with a girl on FB Dating. She's about 45 minutes from me. We began talking over fb dating and then I gave her my snap, IG and FB and we've been talking for about 10 days. 
We made plans last week to hang out this previous Saturday near me and she said essentially she didn't feel like driving 45 minutes to me for the first date.. so I said I'd go to her and then the day of the date she ended up canceling because of helping someone out with something and it going longer than she expected it to (she posted a snapchat of it so it wasn't a lie) and told me afterwards that she would make plans with me this week or two weekends from now. 
She asks to FaceTime at least once a day, she will snapchat me a few times a day, she'll call me cute or handsome and implies about us doing something together like watching a movie or hanging out...but then she will read a message i send (sometimes) and leave me on read but be active on fb. 

I normally can figure out girls but this one has me confused. 

Any advice on if she's interested, what I can do to help reel her in etc... would be appreciated. Comment here or feel free to message me. 
Thanks!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n4eafp/your_opinion_does_she_like_me/
91,n4ee0u,1620096856,Social Anxiety,"I’ve been snapping this girl for a while and I’ve always thought she was cute but I was never able to tell idk why because I have had multiple people tell me she thinks I’m cute which made me happy. I always wanted to tell her that’s she is cute and just last week I did and she told me personally that I was cute and I just got so happy. She asked me to go to the carnival with her on Friday and I said yes, I was thinking about hanging out with her for the whole week and when the day finally came I went to the carnival with some of my friends and she came with some of her friends. I went to get my wristband and she was getting hers right next to me but I just couldn’t get myself to at least say hi I was scared that she thought I was ugly for some reason and I just went off with my friends and she went with hers, my friends were telling me afterwards that she was just staring at the whole time and I felt so bad. She texted me the day after that she saw me and she wished I said hi and I made a promise to her that I would say hi to her the next time I see her which will hopefully be this Friday. I am just asking how do I not be socially awkward and what should I do.

95,n4elpu,1620097607,"Does anyone feel like they're too ""wholesome"" or not ""secular"" enough for modern dating? Any middle ground?","So I was a super, SUPER late bloomer. I lost the V card junior/senior year in college. I was afraid of having sex due to my religious upbringing. I didn't have a REAL relationship until my late 20s and that only lasted 9 months. Then my next relationship was a total disaster that lasted about a year and half. I've joined a Christian based app (CatholicMatch), I'm pretty much wasting my time there. I don't follow all of the teachings and most guys on there are not looking for that. I deleted Catholic Match within 3 weeks. I'm Catholic, but secular in some areas. I go to mass, but I also believe in birth control and such. If I join Tinder/Bumble/etc. I'm not wasting as much time, but most men expect sex within the first 3 meetings. Even before meeting I say that I'm looking for a long term relationship. If I don't know your last name, I'm not having sex. 

On a date with a guy I really like he unexpectedly mentioned sex. On the inside I was taken back by it, but I played it cool. Later that night before went I home he said I was an ""angel"" and wholesome. I disagreed, but he insisted I was. Is not having sex on the first date wholesome now? 

I don't consider myself an ""Angel"" at all. In fact, I'm a sinner and it's kinda fun sinning. Attending Burning Man and eating mushroom chocolates was one of the best experiences of my LIFE! Obviously I'm not going to mention this to man on the first date due to him thinking I'm a drug addict. Personally I don't find taking certain substances a sin, but to others it's a mortal sin. I feel like there are too many extremes in dating and not enough middle ground, which is causing me some frustration.
