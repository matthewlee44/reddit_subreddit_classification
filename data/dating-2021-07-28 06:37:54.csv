3,ot8iof,1627473834,Is it worth staying..,"hi folks I need some help here..
Me &amp; guy (30M) met online dating. He seems like a good guy when we went out he's always sweet, hold hands and took good care of me. We had gone on 5 dates &amp; known each other a month. 

But I feel there's something lacking. Like he never wanted to talk long on the phone &amp; likes texting instead. Whenever he kissed me on the lip, the kisses felt like a peck on the mouth instead of actual kisses. Also he never asked me to stay over his place but only one time when we went to dancing club i got drunk. 

I know I'm not young anymore and can't be expecting sweet love, but I just felt that this is really lack of passion. Everyday he would text me a few messages and then tell me to call if I want. But he doesn't seem to be interested in initiating calls. Idk if this is normal or these are signs that he doesn't like me that much. He did ask if I wanted to be bf /gf but I said I need more time to think about it. 


Any advice is appreciated.. thanks.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ot8iof/is_it_worth_staying/
4,ot8pbr,1627474559,"As someone (24F) who has no previous dating/relationship experience besides situationships, how do I navigate meeting men irl?","For context, I (24F) have never been in a relationship before and you could call me a later bloomer. I focused on my studies/academics in university and didn't have much of a social life. After university, I moved away for a job where I knew no one, but have since moved back to the city for work, and to be closer to friends and family. 

Most of my relationships even with friends and family have been long distance relationships due to living in different places for university and work. I am quite introverted, anxious, and shy, so anything that makes me feel uncomfortable I don't want any part of. 

I've only had situationships with two men. The first guy was a family friend's son who I got along really well with. We were good friends, I liked him, and then he told me he already had a girlfriend. He said if he wasn't in a relationship, then he would be happy to be with me. The second guy was someone who I met online on a game who I developed feelings for and he lived in a different country. He said he really liked me, but couldn't see himself in an online relationship or an LDR. He also told me to not message him again (twice). So yeah, there's not much of my ""experience"" with men. 

All of my friends are in relationships and live with their boyfriends. They found their significant other on dating apps, but knew them before through an acquaintance/mutual friend. I'm really happy for them and sometimes I feel a bit jealous or envious as I've always been alone and single. It's kind of sad really, but not in the miserable sense of way. 

My cousin told me to meet someone in person who I can actually spend time with instead of someone who lives far away from me and in a different time zone. She, along with my friends have suggested me to try dating apps and I honestly don't see the point of them. They feel so forced and not organic at all. I don't want to hook up or have something casual. I want something real, authentic, and long-term. 

I did hear about an app called Kippo which is for gamers to meet other gamers. So I downloaded it, then realized I don't have any pictures of myself (not one for selfies or getting my picture taken) and gave up trying to make a profile. I also felt guilty having downloaded it because the man who I met online on a game, we both said to each other that we wouldn't meet anyone else in our lives. Unfortunately, four months have passed and we are not in contact with each other. You'd think I'd be able to move on, but obviously I have not and I don't want a rebound since I feel I am emotionally unavailable right now.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ot8pbr/as_someone_24f_who_has_no_previous/

6,ot8qtl,1627474721,One side wants effort. The other attention,"I think people do the right thing for themselves, not in general. Good for them as there are no hard rules in dating. It just boils down to how you feel about someone you're dating (and yes some soft societal rules apply)


Now as a divorced 34/M with young kids, I will say that two weeks is a standard rotation of my time sharing schedule with the kids and their mother. In that time several things could happen which can cause me to not text, after setting a date with someone who I've matched with in a dating app. Hell just the past two weeks alone my kid broke his leg, we flew to WI to their cousins grad party, got back and went to Orlando to meet their new born baby cousin, made a toy airplane out of spare remote control car parts, made several software development deployments to advance a side business, brought things up to a point where I could take a small vacation with my current day job/employer (if you're in corporate, you know)

So while some daters are busy wondering why a match is not chasing... Some good people may actually be trying but busy with life. I mean, did they text you the week of the date at least to confirm?. If you set plans and sometimes don't talk leading up to a date, I can see some folks seeing that as ""well I'm no priority"" or maybe give the impression you're seeing other people. Single moms should understand me here. But for those of us just busy being responsible adults having the misfortune of meeting someone who wants to suck up your positive energy claiming to be your latest victim and subsequently ghosting for lack of pursuit..

7,ot8sb0,1627474876,What are the biggest red flags you've encountered in someone? How did you deal with them?,"I've seen people talk about red flags on here and now I'm curious to hear about your experiences with people with red flags.

Here's mine:

I (19F) haven't put myself out there in the dating world yet since I've honestly never really been attracted to anyone and I focussed on school instead. But I've had a male friend (19M) confess to me before and that's as far as it gets. The red flags in this guy were HUGE. And it has kind of discouraged me from ever trying to date.. y'know, it's a strange feeling when the only person who's ever shown any romantic interest in you is a creep.

So, I had known him for about a year before he confessed to me. He was in my (very small) friend circle but we weren't really close. He was close to my best friend tho and she invited him to hang out with us sometimes.
He was very awkward from the very beginning. He's really nerdy and he talked to me like I was the first girl he'd ever spoken to. I didn't think anything of it, I didn't think it was cute like my friends did, but it didn't strike me as a red flag either. Being awkward seems to be cute to some, but since I'm extremely awkward myself, I don't like it in other people. It's not something I find attractive.

The first thing I noticed in him was how he tried so hard to be a gentleman. He always held the door open for me. Starting from the very first time we spoke. I didn't figure out that he did it specifically for me because I always walked around with my two friends, so I thought he did it for us... because we're girls?
You might think ""oh what's so wrong with holding the door open?"", well, I do it too, but I hold the door open for everyone who wants to enter after me. When I'm using/ have used the door myself.
But whenever this guy saw that I was going to open a door for myself, he stopped what he was doing and ran towards the door to open it for me. Like I had two broken arms or something. It just pissed me off after a while so I tried to avoid going through doors whenever he was looking haha

I noticed that maybe he really didn't know how to interact with girls. He treated me like I was some kind of helpless damsel in distress and didn't let me carry out the most regular tasks. Like, you know I can carry my own books, right? No need to ask me every few seconds if you should carry them for me. This isn't a romance anime.

But okay, nothing too concerning. Until he proudly showed me and his friends some kind of short story he wrote with his friends a while back. They apparently wanted to turn it into a comic. It was a funny story at first. Some typical cringy isekai thing. Then it turned into a r*pe fantasy. We were shocked and asked him about it. He told us he wasn't the one who wrote it and that it was just a dumb joke. We laughed it off, but man, that was so off-putting. But somehow I blocked out this memory until a few days ago, which is the main reason I wanted to make this post.

I thought to myself ""nah, no way he was the one who wrote it. He must be telling the truth. No way this shy and awkward dude is secretly into this stuff, right?""
But now that I think about it, first of all, even if he didn't write it, he still must have proofread the story before he showed it to us. And he was proud of the story, so he clearly didn't have a problem with this kind of thing.
This part of the story was written in a way that romanticized r*pe. And he thought it was okay to show his female friends. Alrighty.

When I put all of his previous actions into context with the way he acted when I rejected him, the guy turns into a big red flag.

I already suspected he liked me before he even confessed. He was obvious with it after all.
He confessed a few days after I asked my friend if she thought he liked me. Weird coincidence, maybe she gave him the final push? I never asked her about it.
Anyways, he confessed to me when he drove me home. This was something he regularly offered to do and it made me uncomfortable every time. I had no other way of getting home though, so I accepted his offer. But that was the last day I accepted.
When we reached my house, he stopped me and told me he had a present for me and that I should check the glove compartment. He probably felt so smooth, but it was awkward. Anyways, I opened it and next to piles of trash there was a box of sleep medicine. I was confused, but it did make sense since I had problems with sleeping. But then he told me to open the box and inside was a selfmade figure of a korok (a character from botw) holding a heart. And then he told me he liked me and that he wanted to go on a date.

I was so overwhelmed and didn't know how to react, so I declined the date but I didn't make it clear that I didn't want to date him in general. And I wasn't even sure at the time that I didn't want to date him. So I told him I had to think about it and exited the car.
When he got home he texted me and asked if we are in a relationship now and if he can tell his friends. And I was like ""ummm no? We aren't?""

We didn't talk about it for the next few days. I slept it over and made the decision to give him a clear no. But he texted me in the early morning saying he wanted to talk. I also had something to tell him so I was like ""great, perfect timing!""

He insisted to meet up, even though this was like a week after the first lockdown and regulations were still really strict. And I didn't want to meet up anyways. When he confessed to me we were confined in a small space and it made me really uncomfortable. I didn't want to be somewhere alone with him when I rejected him. I was scared that he'd get angry and that I couldn't escape the situation.

We went back and forth between him pressuring to meet up and telling me he'd drive over to my house and me explaining that it made me uncomfortable. Until he reluctantly accepted to talk over text.
I jumped right into it and made it very clear that I wasn't interested in him romantically and that this wouldn't change. I also included that it wasn't because of anything he did but moreso because I wasn't attracted to him and that I wasn't seeking out a relationship at the time.

He seemed to take it well at first. I told him that I was fine with continuing to be friends after this but if he wasn't, I'd understand if he needed some distance.

He said it was okay. But then he asked if my brother was the reason I didn't want to date him (for context: he's friends with my little brother and apparently he thought the reason I declined him was because it would make things awkward between us three??). I once again told him that, no, this doesn't involve anyone else, I'm just not interested.

And then he offered to list all the mistakes I had made. And I was like ""uhm I already know all my flaws, thank you very much. I don't need you to tell me"". Then he wanted me to list the mistakes he had made ""for future reference"".

This was so frustrating. I told him something along the lines of ""well, since you're asking, your mistake is asking me to do something like this as well as offering to list my mistakes. It's incredibly awkward""

We wrapped it up there and didn't talk much the next few days until he visited my little brother at our home for the first time. He started coming over from time to time which he had never done before. Every time he hung out with my brother, he had apparently asked him if I could join them because my brother came knocking at my door to ask me to join. And I declined. I didn't wanna see the guy. I just wanted privacy.

A few months ago I found out that he had told my brother that he liked me. And I thought he didn't want to make things even more awkward between us? Maybe he hoped that my brother would set us up together lmao

We stopped pretty much all contact after he confessed to me, but we shared a few classes and we run into each other then.

The last time I saw him was at prom. He approached me pretty much every time I was alone. It seemed like he was watching me, waiting until my friends left. He kept asking me if I wanted to go outside with him. It was pitch black outside and I sure as hell didn't want to go there with him. But I tried to go outside to search for my friends after he had left me alone again. And that's when he came running after me. He held his phone up to me and asked me why I was avoiding him and whether I wanted to keep in contact after school. I shook my head and headed the other direction. He tried to follow me again, but my friends swooped in and took me with them. And, like I mentioned, he didn't approach me when there were people around. So thank god they found me. This could have gone really wrong. I was pretty drunk and I don't know if I would have been able to defend myself if anything happened.

I haven't heard from him since, other than my brother talking about him. He's like an entirely different person when he talks to my brother.

So, I thought about all my experiences with this guy and came to realize that I really avoided something here.
He'd never take no for an answer. And he was incredibly pushy. When I rejected him I noticed that he didn't take me seriously at all. It's like my feelings didn't matter to him.

He just saw me as this weak little girl who needs a strong guy to defend her. Yes, I am short and weak, but I can stand up for myself. I hate it when people look down on me.

I don't think he liked me for who I am. He had this false perception of me and he must have thought I was easy to get with. And I perfectly fit into this fantasy of his. He thinks he's the main protagonist of a romance anime. Well, it's time for him to wake up.

When I think about the way he couldn't take no for an answer and the way he behaved at prom, the r*pe fantasy in his short story starts to make sense.

One time when me, some classmates and him were talking, we came to the subject of sex (I don't even know how and why, but it was really casual) and he started this pity party of how he's a virgin and he'll likely stay a virgin forever. No one asked and no one reacted to this. We ignored him and changed the subject because it was getting weird.
It made me think that he's probably the type of guy who would guilt a girl into sleeping with him. The way he talked about it was so off.

So yeah, I'm glad he didn't guilt me into dating him. I felt really guilty when I rejected him. He was such a ""nice guy"" after all.

A few days before he confessed to me, a female friend of his told him how it's weird that he's still single and that any girl would be lucky to date him. Seems like he got the wrong idea.
When I rejected him, I told him he'd find a girl who likes him just as much as he likes her and that I'm just not that girl.

But I'm not so sure if this was the right way to phrase it. I hope he changes his approach. He doesn't seem like a bad person.

Sorry this was so long lol
Anyways, do any of you have similar experiences to share?

TL;DR: awkward guy treated me like a damsel in distress, couldn't take no for an answer, pitied himself for being single and a virgin and wrote a short story that included r*pe fantasies; he thought he was the protagonist of an anime",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ot8sb0/what_are_the_biggest_red_flags_youve_encountered/

9,ot9klw,1627477754,Boundaries while casually dating ?,"I had a date with a guy I knew through mutual friends a couple weeks ago. We ended up spending all weekend together, and have been hanging out regularly since - including going on dates like dinner and the movies. 

We have had sex already, and the next day he randomly(we were sitting outside having a completely unrelated conversation prior) blurts out “if you’re fucking me, you aren’t fucking anyone else, because that’s gross.” I said “what?” And he repeated himself and said “like we aren’t anything, but I think it’s gross.” 

Before I could respond, his friend walked into the backyard and the conversation was done. I didn’t get a chance to bring it up again and now it’s been almost 2 weeks. 

We haven’t talked about exclusivity since, nor am I wanting to rush things. The comment did put a bad taste in my mouth - probably because of how it was worded more than anything  because I do think it’s a conversation that should be had when people are being intimate and establishing ground rules around that. 

My dilemma now is that I am much more newly single that him. I’ve also always rushed into relationships and don’t want to make the same mistake again. I like him, we get along well, but I’m not sure if I can see it being “forever”, and there is a part of me that wants to continue to see what’s out there. 

I’ve been invited to go away for the weekend with a friend and a small of her friends that I haven’t met before. From the sounds of it, we would be the only girls going. 

Because of my history and how I’ve approached all my relationships in the past, no matter what stage they’re at, I always give 1 person my full attention, whether we’ve agreed to be exclusive or not. So I feel weird agreeing to this trip even though I know we are far from being in a relationship and I should have my own life. 

I guess what I’m asking is if this is a conversation I should have with him or if because his only comment before was solely about sleeping with other people, I even need to bring it up. I will obviously be telling him I’m going away if that’s what I decide.

10,ot9yp0,1627479072,Hobbies don’t define you.,"Hey everyone, I know this might seem like a no brainer for most people out there but I am seeing a lot of post about people who think their hobbies define who they are. With that, they tend to think they need a partner who has the exact same hobbies or they won’t be compatible. 

Not to sound too stereotypical. Guys, it is ok if you play video games or watch anime. Ladies it is ok if you like to watch the bachelorette and follow makeup reviews/tutorials on YouTube. The problem arises when you believe your hobbies define you or they are the only thing you can talk about.  

Think about it. There is so much more to you. Friends, family, values, outdoor hobbies, travel plans, music, movies, foods, drinks, fitness, work, politics, religion, passions, goals, ideas, art, jokes, fashion, and the list goes on. 

My point being it is ok to broaden your search and date someone who isn’t exactly like you. If one of your hobbies is a general turn off for your intended date, don’t let it define you. “Sure I like to ____, but it isn’t something I do 24/7. I think it is ok and healthy if we like different things. Sometimes we need space from each other and ___ helps me to relax.” If your date has a hobby that turns you off, show a little empathy.

I feel like it’s all on me sometimes. It’s either one thing I say or do that just ruins it for them. I feel like I have to hold in my actual personality a lot of the time and it makes it less enjoyable. The more I show of my personality it just ends up back firing on me except like at bars or social gatherings and the like. I know it’s my fault and it just sucks, it’s not like I’m venting my whole life to these people it’s just jokes or just a random thought. I just feel like crap to be honest and I feel worthless because of it. A lot of the people I’m talking to now I don’t even care about, and it’s so hypocritical cause I’m doing them the same way people do me, either being dry or I stop texting them abruptly For no reason, even if I do find them attractive I just don’t feel anything for them and I dont know why. When I genuinely like someone it always tends to backfire on me, so it’s easier for me to just not care about anything. Like what happened yesterday, the conversation started off really well and I was even vulnerable at points. Everything was going good then I send her a sort of long message explaining what I do for work then bam I don’t get a reply after that. I’ve always been a hopeless romantic and sometimes I struggle with the notion that maybe what I’m doing is just hurting myself, ego, and pride. I’m just putting my heart through this gauntlet of what feels like torture just in the guise that it is to grow as a person. I’m tired and all I wanna do is lay down and go to sleep, or just run away from all of these emotions. I’ve never been the type to be able to coherently show how I’m feeling and that sucks :/  but I’m happy to know that I’m at least trying. I’m not really looking for sympathy but to have someone at least relate to me that would be pretty neat.

She looked better at the photos and a lot skinner but I didn't mind. At the end of the date, she said there will be a next time. We planned the 2nd date a week after.

Everything went downhill. Before the date, we had phone calls and she texted a lot. Then throughout the week, I initiated all text and phone calls. We had like 3-4 phone calls and they lasted 30m-1 hour. She told me she had depression and had to be remitted to a eating disorder facility. The day before our second date, she flaked saying her mom thought we were taking things too fast. I asked how and she hasn't responded in 3 days via text so I ended it formally with a letter and she read it. 



Second date of my life comes around a week after this incident. My heart sank as soon as I saw her, she was overweight but I went through with it. We planned a boating date. Her personality didn't match mine and it was a 3-4 hour date. Now I feel like sh*t.  During the date I kept thinking about my first date previously.

I personally feel like I can be together with someone for some time even though I know I cannot trust them fully. Someone I might not be able to lean against all the time. We can still fool around (sex and the chemisty with her is more than good), go out with our friends, travel. Be there for each other. And even though it might happen in any relationship, I feel like I’m fine with our relationship ending the way her previous one did. I know what I’m getting myself into, I don’t wear no rose-colored glasses.
Anyone else able to do this? I’m young and  experienced in dating. And I’m not afraid of heartbreaks anymore. I’m not lonely per se or just taking any opportunity that falls in my lap. This one feels right.

23,otb214,1627482616,How can I get some confidence back?,"Hi all,

I have been in two very serious relationships for long periods of time and have probably been single for 5 months in my entire adult life. My first LTR (5.5 years) ended with my partner cheating on me relentlessly for months before breaking up with me. They were emotionally and physically abusive to me and l was pretty shattered by it. My latest relationship I ended because once again it was emotionally abusive. Within a month my partner was dating other people and sleeping with them (we had to live together and I had to have it rubbed in my face everyday). Needless to say I am totally shattered right now.

At this point I don't know how to gain some confidence. I have pretty bad social anxiety, which doesn't help matters. I have learned how to manage it pretty well, but the fear of approaching someone is very real. I tried OLD, but my stock is pretty love as I am probably like a 6 in the looks department and a pretty odd guy in general. I am just kind of hurting for companionship and connection right now (and also sex!). Anyone else been here? How did you gain some confidence around dating?

I decided to leave and pursue someone who reciprocates my efforts, and after a few dates with guys that didn’t work out, I think I found someone !! 
He (23M) is such a great match for me. Not only are we the same size, but we have the same energy. 
We just really hit it off since we first matched. It’s so weird how much we have in common. It feels like we’ve met before !!! 

Last night was our 3rd time hanging out, and we got on the topic of our hopes and dreams for life. He told me that his parents are still together and in a healthy marriage, and that he would like to find someone to be his life partner. How refreshing it felt to hear that! I told him that I am wanting the same thing. We agreed to close things off and continue dating each other monogamously.

27,otbmcc,1627484346,"Telling a woman she's ""insecure"" and ""should get help"" for feeling hurt when her partner interacts with other females online is a form of gaslighting.","I have never struggled with jealousy in my relationships... not true jealousy anyways. However, I have certainly been accused of it by a handful of partners... and it's usually because I confront them about their shady social media behaviours. Whether it's liking all the bikini photos of that one girl he went to college with, or leaving thirsty comments on influencers photos about their body, or swiping nervously away from DM notifications from their ex... it is a bright red flag in a relationship that has been established as both monogamous and committed. 

Because social media is such a grey area when it comes to cheating, people tend to try to take the approach that they should just ""be cool"" if they see something that makes them feel a twinge of uncertainty or doubt in their partner. After all, a ""like"" doesn't mean they are sleeping with that person, a comment doesn't mean they are sexting them in the DM's. Its one thing to take issue with every single woman your partner interacts with, such as cousins, and close friends who are very obviously platonic, or married, or even living abroad. Catching up with people from your past is a normal part of interpersonal relationships and is not something that most people feel compelled to hide from their partner anyways. But it is not unreasonable to feel your trust in your partner is challenged when their online behaviour would be unacceptable to you if it were played out in real life.

If we would grimace at our partner oogling, whistling or commenting on how attractive another person is,  in front of our face... why do we suddenly afford leniency to that same behaviour from behind a phone screen. If your partner is consciously making an effort to engage with, and validate other people on an application that is public for everyon in their inner circle (including you) to see... it is perfectly reasonable to feel disrespected, and to communicate that. No need to be the ""cool girl"", no need to try and rationalize how the drool emoji he left on a girls bikini photo could mean he likes her passion for the beach more than her boobs. People will always find other people attractive, even if they are in a long term, married relationships, but the way you express that attraction is the fine line between simply noticing and pausing to admire it, and being openly disrespectful by expressing that attraction through any sort of action. 

It is not insecurity, it is self preservation from a potentially bad decision to open up the discussion with them. If you think the foundation you are standing on is weak and could potentially collapse, it is common sense that you will want to get off as fast as possible in order to assess the situation from a distance where you won't get seriously hurt.

Having conversations about your feelings, expectations and insecurities around how a committed relationship functions for you is not a form of control, neither is it a sign of a jealous and insecure woman... it is simply a form of boundary setting, and your partner will either accept your feelings as valid and you will grow closer through understanding and compromise... or they will choose the life where they can have what they want on their terms, and their terms only. There is no 'good guy' or 'bad guy' with incompatibility, but it will be a monumental, soul-sucking waste of time if you suppress your feelings in an effort to be unproblematic and 'chill' with something that makes you feel very much the opposite.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/otbmcc/telling_a_woman_shes_insecure_and_should_get_help/

There was a girl I’ve seen a few times before at this friend’s place but I had never really talked to her outside of this setting. She wanted to hit the beer funnel/beer bong but nobody else would, so I volunteered to do it with her. I was pretty much sober, she was already drunk. We did that together and I figured that would be it. 

However, the girl kept staying all over me after that, wanting to drink more with me, sit near me, etc. At one point we were both right beside one another and she put my arm around her, and kept trying to kiss me after we took like a shot or something. She took quite a few pictures with me and posted some on her Snapchat, and eventually her DD wanted to leave and she left. She kept saying she was gonna take me home with her and I was not sober at all at this point so I understood that wasn’t a good idea and just kept saying I sadly couldn’t. 

She asked me to add her on Snapchat and the next day after she sent me pictures she had taken from the night before. I’m not sure how to move forward or anything because while she was definitely interested then, she was also definitely not in a sober state of mind. I don’t know if I should message her or if I should just leave it alone until the next time I see her? 

For reference, she is about 2 years older than me and we live within 20 minutes of one another, and obviously both of us are of the legal drinking age if anyone cares about that.

He was flirting with me since May this year and asked me out on date ( while saying he didn't believe in labels ) and I refused. Although I was sure I am not ok being with someone who does not want to date me exclusively but given I had a crush on this guy few years back and we have been good friends for a while , I met him starting of this month and he hugged me and was touchy and we ended up kissing.

I knew he wouldn't want anything exclusive so I had low expectations. I refused to be his no label booty call(although he said it would be meaningful but ik he just wants to makeout) and he ended up saying we shouldn't meet and I was disappointed cause I thought we were good friends but in reality he just saw me as another conquest I guess. We had a fight , I blocked him but then for the sake of 7 years of friendship I ended up unblocking and apologising for my harsh words and he did the same. 

But we again had a fallout next week cause he compared me to an ex and apparantly felt I was not super hot and maybe not a girlfriend material for him. This rubbed me the wrong way cause I did ask him if he just wanted to makeout he can be blunt but he emphasised he liked talking to me. I said don't say this again and he again apologised.

I have a short stature (4'10"" to be precise) and he again said some joke on it on text( not his first time) and I clearly told him I don't like it so don't say it. I guess he got offended on my clear draw of boundary. We didn't talk for a day and next day he said he was quitting social media and I felt maybe he just didn't want to talk to me and I was ok with it cause I have deep rooted body image issues and someone continuously hurting me is not ok even though it was unintentional( he should get it by now). Also he said he would call me sometime or I can call him sometime.

3 days later he texts me and tells me to meet. I feel it's ok. We hug and talk and it was a short meeting. No kissing involved. I told him I did not absolutely like jokes on height and he said he can't stay without saying anything on my compact size. I am cute , I am beautiful and super pretty. That time it felt ok but later on I kinda feel disrespected. 

After this meet he tells me he would like to meet me again for longer sometime and kiss me but before that we should prolly talk and get done with our misunderstandings. I give no definite answer but I say yeah we should talk about stuff in person. That's that. Conversation ended. 

Now next day he asked for my advice regarding his academics. I was happy to help and as soon as I was done with it , he told me you know ""I am selfish , I will text you again when I will have some work"". I said ok and ended the convo but i think that was really distasteful. He has never been very active on social media and we talked for max 30 minutes a day but he was the one who used to initiate conversations but now suddenly he is too busy to talk to me without any work. Also on our last meet, he said why didn't I call him( during his 3 day absence) and I said I thought you needed space. He said no he likes talking to me. So this weekend I did ask him if I can call him, he said he had a headache and I can call him any other day after that ( I did not mind it at that time). But now his lack of texts makes the headache thing sound like an excuse. 

So I have been thinking about all this lately and not to mention I am miserable. A person I absolutely adored and thought was my friend first kissed me, then didn't wanna take responsibility that he wanted it, but wants to kiss me again but doesn't wanna talk to me anymore and does not respect my requests. I am devastated cause I feel I have been played real bad. Him just wanting to kiss me for physical attraction was ok but now I genuinely feel even the friendship was a facade.

I really wanna end everything. I don't wanna see him anymore cause I am already so hurt. I don't want to kiss him or meet him but all this I am feeling is making me feel anxious and depressed. So should I tell him what all I have written in this post? Like how cheated I feel and how he didn't care for me as a friend even though I had nothing but his best interests in my mind? Rn I really wanna block him but I am the kind of person who can't end things without closure. But I know he does not care about me. I guess he is too shallow to see beyond my ""not so hot body"". But if I don't talk about this stuff with him , I would stay miserable.

And I never want him to touch me again. I feel disgusted by the thought ( but I have been so lonely these days due to being away from my university since the pandemic started in my country). I wanna talk this stuff in person and end things but I don't have the courage. I just like him so much( as a person and yeah I had a strong crush years back so there is some romantic inclination from my side although I have never told him about it). I just want to meet , say this stuff that has been making me feel terrible and tell him that I don't want to keep contact. But I feel I won't be able to do it. I just want help in approaching this . Tell me what should I say and where should I start. 

Also I have taken advice from this sub before and all the kind people here have always told me get away from him but I still had hope so I kept going back. But I think I am done now. I really wanna end things. It would be nice if you guys can also mention if my thought process on the situation is right or not( ig I just want another hope to cling on ) but deep down I think yeah he has been an asshole. 

Tldr: how to end things with a long time friend who I kissed once but don't wanna kiss him again cause he doesn't care about me and I feel the friendship was a facade to get close to me physically?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/otdnon/how_to_end_things_with_a_long_time_friend_i/

53,otdqed,1627490602,"From Lonely, to Meeting Someone Special, to LDR; Any Advice Helps!","Hey everyone, this is my second post on here and a lot had changed since my last one. Last time I needed advice on how to be more presentably interesting to women, esp through OLD, and was advised to work on my self-esteem and activities more before seriously dating. And now I need advice for a  totally different scenario, but maybe still relevant issue.
Any advice at all would be appreciated.

Quick backstory: I'm (29M) a full-time retail soon-to-be counter manager, bachelor's degree in business, suffered depression since I was 16, had zero relationships as an adult before this month of July started, was a virgin until 5 days ago, decently studied into dating, sex lives, relationships, etc. over my absent dating life. I'm quite passionate and loves to love with my decided partner, very monogamous.

So after my last post, I thought the advice given was good, but I wanted to try and ask out one more woman at my workplace before I shelve dating for self-work. Up to that point, I have never gone on a date with someone, as an adult.

I asked her (35F) out just over 2 months ago, she shot me down, but came back for my number to be friends and get to know me more. We found to be very similar and more attracted to each other, but the line in the sand was she is a Born Again Christian, and I was an atheist. I eventually realized that being an atheist wasn't making me any happier so I wanted to believe and find support in something bigger than myself, like she did, and helped me come back to the Lord. So I became Born Again, and I don't regret it since.

Now that we share the same faith, we grew much closer together and started ""dating"" (we're both infatuated and impressed at each other's character and love languages), but it hasn't been official because my development as a Christian hasn't fully blossomed yet, which she needs to have in a boyfriend and husband. As well her parents have been working out of town, and I need to meet them in person to ask them permission to court their daughter; an important tradition to her and her family. But we've been dating anyways, find each other irresistible, had sex once recently, but it was a mistake in the heat of passion since we were going to save ourselves until marriage. We're working through it, but we trust each other a lot and we're crazy compatible. I believe God has brought us together for a reason.

The challenge now that He has placed is that our jobs and career paths are about to separate us a lot. My new promotion is taking me 20 miles away from our shared workplace, and I'm finally moving out of my parents' house from one edge of a Californian county to another in a month. She will go back to being a flight attendant in a few months and will train in Seattle. She loves flying and traveling the world, but her mild Lupus is starting to drain her of that lifestyle. We're talking about going into an LDR, and it's making me feel sad and frustrated. I've been alone for so long as self-punishment and now that I met someone of real compatibility, we're going to be habitually alone and away from each other. I love physical intimacy as much as emotional intimacy, which doesn't mean I want sex all of the time, but I don't want to be physically alone again just after finding someone special. She believes that physical presence isn't that important when the emotional love and commitment is strong enough. She does agree that the distance would be temporary though. We haven't discussed how long yet.

Any advice would be appreciated. My prayers and trust in the Lord is not strong enough right now to avoid writing this post here. What would you do in my place?

TL;DR : Been a virgin no-relationship loner for 13 years, found someone really special right off the bat, only been together physically for a month, now trying to transition to a LDR. Going back to being pseudo-alone and Idk how to feel about that commitment.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/otdqed/from_lonely_to_meeting_someone_special_to_ldr_any/

56,otdttr,1627490878,Can some guys weigh in on this?,"Why do men take it so hard when they get hurt in a relationship. Not huge chaotic hurt just regular stuff that unfortunately everyone goes through at some point (being cheated on, being lied to, feelings just simply changed) I have a close friend who got cheated on in our early 20s with this girl he only dated maybe a little over a year and since they broke up he refuses to even think about dating or care about people in that way at all (we’re in our early 30s now) He’s a really good guy and put together great personality we’ve always had a thing for each other and openly talk about it and admit it but he’s so anti dating or letting anyone get close to him in that way. Point being why hold onto that hurt of a young relationship for so dam long. It’s not just my friend as I’m in the dating world I’ve ran across this so many times. Guys with the story of being hurt once and just “being done with women and dating” here for a good time idgaf attitude yet wanting more and when they get close to it panic and pull this rip cord. A few you can very obviously see they are hurt and not processing but do desire something more meaningful, my friend being one of them but sit here and stew on this one time hurt. 

I know men get used and hurt just as much as women do, this isn’t a we have it worse than you question here. But women get played, used, cheated on, physically hurt constantly and yet we recover and try again and give someone new a chance to show who they are and don’t just block it all out. Yes maybe we are a bit cautious but to totally shut down? Seems ridiculous and emotionally immature. If you’re not interested in dating at all, okay cool but dont say you are then the second you start to get close to someone pull away and spew the I was cheated on once and it really hurt my feelers blah blah blah. Why hold onto something like that so long and let it keep you from connecting with people in the here and now? You were hurt once by someone you dated? Cool buddy welcome to the club we all have. I would like a male POV what’s going on here. I date men and women and experience this way more with men than women. I’m trying to be more understanding but quite honestly what goes through my head when I hear this reasoning from a friend talking about someone else, or a situation I personally am in my instant reaction is “what weak, immature, beta bitch energy” grow up process your feelings and move forward but I feel that’s harsh and not being understanding of others so give me some real perspective here.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/otdttr/can_some_guys_weigh_in_on_this/
57,oteled,1627493123,I 23F ended things with a racially insensitive man 45M here is what I learned and how I suggest dating outside your race.,"Hello reddit! I am a little heart hurt right now, but truly something that helps me is sharing my experience and engaging in thoughtful conversation through my favorite communities. Let's get one thing clear: I think dating is fun. I enjoy meeting new men and being taken on dates/ taking men on dates. Dating older men is fun for me and I suggest all people play around with a cheeky age gap every now and again. Yes there are some sucky things about dating but there are literally sucky things about everything!

I would consider myself a cute lady. My mom is Brazilian and Puerto Rican and my dad was Jamaican and Grenadian. I look mixed but absolutely identify strongly with my black side. 

I met R (white guy) about eight weeks ago after I finished studying for and taking my MCAT; I am applying to medical school this year. From the beginning he and I knew this was just for fun and we would remain cordial after I moved for medical school in July of 2022. I remain friendly with a solid amout of the guys I date because I am not a bitter person and generally date men that have the same mindset as myself. My best guy friend and I met on the trivia team; we used to fuck like rabbits! Now he is in a great and healthy relationship with a baby on the way and I am excited for him and his partner. They are going to be great parents and I have full confidence the baby is going to have one hell of a full love tank. I digress. 

Long story short R was a white privilege denier and racially insensitive. He believes white privilege is a case-by-case scenario. It isn't. Of course it affects people to different degrees but the bottom line is there are certain ways society treats/thinks about/view white people compared to black people. For example, when watching the news and hearing about all sorts of drug busts, gang violence, domestic abuse, gun violence many members of society envision the criminal being a dark skinned black person (usually a man) before their picture has even been shown. This is one of the many examples of white privilege. It is a privilege to belong to a race that is not thought of as ""default criminal"" by society.

The story that broke the camels back was the story he told me last night. When he was a child his single mother, himself, and his brother lived in a penthouse in Chicago. One day in the 1980s all the diverse neighborhood kids were playing outside in the woods area. R found a lighter and lit a cat-tail on fire. He was worried how fast it lit and decided to put the fire out quickly but it was too late as he inspired all the kids to follow his suit. He inspired a fire that spread across three square miles. R ran home his mother frantically gave him a bath and she dumped his clothes in a garbage across town. Eventually the cops came to ask all the locals questions and the only kids that got in trouble were the black kids.

He acknowledges that this was racism at play but still has push back when I say he has benefited from white privilege. When I try and talk about my experiences as a black woman he always wants to rebuttal, talk about his perspective, say he had hard time growing up too. At the end of the day he just doesn't get it. He would bring up being in the military, being friends with black people (yikes), and living with all walks of life. Ultimately this was a battle I was going to lose every time so I decided to stop giving him my delicious pu\*\*y and my precious time. 

About a week ago we were on a date and he accidentally drove up to the back side of the restaurant. I said ""hey I think that is the back entrance"" and he said ""you mean the ethnic entrance?"" I was taken back because thats a really bold joke to make to your black date. Freedom of speech is absolutely important and I do fancy dark humor but dang! Yesterday we were talking about the current climate and he says ""K, you have no idea how small the LGB and Trans community are yet they take up so much space within military conversation, why do they have to be the star of the show?"" In my head I'm thinking, yeah its almost like gay marriage was only just legalized in 2015 and we still have to deal with the whole don't ask, don't tell kerfuffle.  My best friend is part of the LGBTQ+ community and I always want to listen to and learn from her experiences as a native and black bisexual woman. 

I gave up on R and ended things this morning because I truly think he is too far gone and I don't like playing the ""lets give him a chance and turn him into my little build a man workshop project."" Whats worse is he prefers dating ethnic women because in his words he ""prefers the beauty features of ethnic women."" He even has a very clearly hispanic brown son from a previous marriage, ten years old. 

Here are some tips for dating a person that belongs to a minority group:  

Listen to them and realize that their struggles are not a personal attack and they have nothing to do with you. Educate yourself during free time about the struggles groups of people you do not belong to have to face. It's that simple my dear redditors &lt;3

66,otf741,1627494889,"28 year old guy is obsessed with dating teen girls (above 18), edit his photo's to look younger, and is borderline crazy,what do you think? And how should we (try to) change his behaviour?","So yeah, a bad title I know. But this story/question is just mad. I don't blame you if you think I'm making this story up, this story is totally ridiculous. 

So, we have this 28 year old guy in our discord group and I and some others of that group (used to) know him personally, and ehhhh. He is kinda weird. Not just a level of ''a guy with probably some autism'' but some very extreme form of autism, and we honestly believe even borderline syndrome. He is incredibly stupid (as in he has a low IQ). He lies about basically everything (even tough he says he never lies.....), acts like a child who is 16, is spoiled by his parants, doesn't have a job or any responsibility (he has to work heavy subsidised work and receives governmental payment) can't take criticism, and he outright believes his lies. This guy is living in a bubble of his own lies, like it's his own reality, if if you can prove he is lying with prove and multiple people, he will simply say it's not true and disconnect (and return the next day and act like he doesn't remember) or just say it was just a stupid joke.......

We allow him in our discord server because he otherwise has no real place to stay, and we don't really ridicule him, we just think his situation is sad. However, after he revealed something, we aren't so sure what do to anymore.....

So he revealed he is dating girls from 18/19 years old while he is 28 years old. Now we know he was trying to find a girlfriend for like 5 years, and literary every date he goes to, fails (he is always brag about his coming date, but when that date passed, he always say something like ''nah not my type'' or he refuses to talk about it. And it kinda become a meme in our Discord server. Now this was kinda shocking to us that he says he is dating 18 year old. However, after he once appeared on the webcam we noticed something strange. Every photo he uses has been edited. (I wish I could post them here, but it's probably not allowed on this subreddit) He edit his wrinkles/bags out, edited his skintone, edited his face to make him look like he is an attractive 18/20 year old guy. The reason why he wants 18 year old is because older woman simply don't appreciate him according to himself....... yeah, im not making this up. He also stated he has a uncle who is 50 and has a wife of 40 (never heard of the ½ age + 7 rule) Obviously he has very little success, but for some reason he doesn't seem to understand that his actions brings him into more trouble. 

And we honestly wanted to help him. You know, it is easy to just laugh about it and enjoy his growing despair. But since we're basically his only place where he can stay, we kinda want him to see the light and start improving his life. 

So here are my questions: 

* What do you think about a 28 year old dating 18 year olds?
* What do you think about someone editing his or her photo's to score a date?
* What do you think about someone being obsessed with dating?
* What's the best way to help him?/whats the best place to get psychological advice? 

Similar experiences are also welcome. 

Maybe if I get some arguments/stories from you guys, I can somehow convince him at the very least editing photo's and obsessive dating is wrong. I also wanna know what you guys feel in general about dating 18 year old as a (almost) 30 year old. 

If you want to give a answer, I have to ask you. **PLEASE BE RESPECTFUL ABOUT HIM**. He is honestly not a bad guy, and only acts like this because of his issues. He also has some very good sides about him (which I didn't describe in my post) and we keep him around for a reason. If he was truly a ''evil'' guy we would've kicked him long ago.

And what if there is chemistry, but he doesn’t feel it as strongly. Or he’s playing me. Or…it’s just not a good fit. I’ve been through all that just in the last two weeks. I mean that’s what dating is all about right. Getting to know each other. Video chatting. Loving the sound of their voice. Waking up to their texts. Then. Falling short of ideals…and suddenly that person who was a big part of your life, for three or four days, is gone. Such a roller coaster. And I want to get off. 
I want this feeling for the last time. I so badly want it to work this time. I’ve got that optimistic naive love is blind thing happening. I keep saying I’m not going to wear my heart on my sleeve. 
I know I’m opening myself to more heartache. And I’m charging forward anyway. Like an idiot lol. But. This one is different! I tell myself. I can feel it! 
As always. Hopeful that this will be my last first date. It’s the only way I can keep doing this! It’s draining. 
Wish me luck. I hope to be back with an inspirational success story soon! And I hope you all find your last first date too.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/otfwso/i_love_that_feeling_of_matching_with_someone_new/

79,otgbq2,1627498217,Not sure of my next step,"I (41M) have been dating “Mel” (33F) for slightly longer than two months.  Early in the dating she let me know that she is on the spectrum (Asperger’s).  I read up on it and it doesn’t bother me in the slightest. 
We’ve managed for the most part to go out at least once a week (both of us have our children full time).  I wouldn’t mind spending more time with her but I understand her child comes first.
My problem didn’t start until early this week, I was telling a co-worker about her and pulled up her dating profile to show her pictures off.  When I did I noticed she’d updated her profile pictures with photos she’d just taken. 
When I asked her about this she said “We haven’t put a label on anything and therefore my options are always open in order to protect myself.”.  She went on to say she isn’t talking to anyone else, but she’s also not ready for a label just yet.
Ever since that conversation two days ago I’ve taken a step back.  When we’re on a date the conversation is great, the chemistry good.  The only thing I find lacking is talking/texting, I have to initiate every conversation, and for the most part it’s stilted on her side.  I figured it was her being on the spectrum and didn’t let it bother me, but now that she’s keeping her “options” open I’m starting to wonder.

But for some reason it took me until today to realize that she has never offered to pay for a date or even split the bill. And we’ve been on probably 15 dates. I got so used to paying that it felt expected/normal. She is generally thankful when I pay (I think?), but she doesn’t say it overwhelmingly often, given I have paid for EVERYTHING.

I don’t care about the money, but I suddenly feel like there are many red flags and it just feels so unattractive. I know she makes decent money based on her lifestyle and job, so this makes me feel like I’ve been used.

I don’t think she is doing this in a calculated way, she is a sweet girl who may just be oblivious. But the fact that she hasn’t even OFFERED makes her seem socially unaware, not generous, etc. And it makes me feel like I’m giving/investing in the relationship and she is just simply taking/absorbing it.

I think I should talk to her about it, but we are still in a pretty casual phase of dating and I guess this feels like something I would bring up if we were exclusive/official.

94,othgif,1627501660,Inner turmoil over disrespectful guy friend -- ADVICE how to proceed?,"Hey reddit, so I’ve (25F) been seeing a friend (28M) long distance for a few months now. I say “seeing” because we have said we are interested in each other, but no dating is happening. We mostly text to keep in contact and video once every 1-2 months. 

He asserted early on that he wants to take things a day at time. He is open to a serious relationship, but said he is not thinking longterm right now.

**The problem**

Since we started this whole thing, his interest seems to have dwindled over time to the point where he just seems rather lazy and disrespectful towards me. A part of me thinks that he’s treating me this way because I was “too nice, predictable, and honest with him” which may have killed the mystery and the chase.

Examples of disrespect: He constantly makes fun of me even though I have said it bothers me (he claims he can’t distinguish between jokes and hurtful comments), bailing on me once when we were going to hangout, and sometimes taking several days (5 or 7) to text back without really explaining why he needed the time away.

There’s no animosity between us, he sees me in a good light — like nothing I do ever seems to bother him or significantly rub him the wrong way — but he treats me, what feels like, a toy.

**How should I proceed?**

Our main form of contact is texting every few days. I’m starting to feel sick texting him back, like zero excitement. I don’t want to force myself to text him, but I want to resolve the core problem here, so I put some few resolutions below.

*Bear in mind, this is a friend I’ve had for several years, albeit not the greatest of friends (more fair-weather friend, as I am realizing now), but still, I would to treat him with some respect.*

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Just distance yourself slowly.** Play it cool. Keep in contact. This approach is ok, but sometimes it feels a tad disingenuous when I’m sorta feeling sick texting him.
2. **Try to make things work**. Explain (again!) the things he’s doing that bother me. However, he really doesn’t like when I call him to talk about negative things. He likes when things are light, playful, and easy. This makes it hard on me because it’s like he doesn’t care.
3. **Tell him I don’t want to text for a while and explain the real reason why.** I don't want this to come across as a ""cut you off.""
4. **Text him that I need to taking a “texting break” for a while. No explanation.** 
5. **Turn things around by being more mysterious and seductive.** Get him to start respecting you more. Honestly, this feels like a lot work (why am I the one bending over backwards!). Idk if this would even work at this point, maybe it’s too late.
