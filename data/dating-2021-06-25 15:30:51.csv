0,o7vwqp,1624653089,I'd love to hear some perspectives on plus-sized dating!!,"Hi! I was just curious about people's experiences with plus-size dating. I wanna hear about your experience as a plus-sized person, or what your thoughts on dating bigger people are, and what some precautions you take/red flags you look for? 

I can get really self conscious of my belly, my arms, my thighs...I went on a date last night that was great, and we were making out. He was really athletic and so I had actually blown him off for dates for awhile, thinking someone that fit couldn't be into me. But he was super reassuring and I think into my body?? 

Do guys actually not mind if their date is kinda pudgy with a stomach and rolls?? Bigger people, how do you know if someone is ok with your size?? How have your experiences dating been??",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o7vwqp/id_love_to_hear_some_perspectives_on_plussized/
1,o7w71o,1624653990,How to deal with a situationship that has very unclear emotional boundaries?,"I’ve been seeing this guy for awhile now. We met with every intention of dating,had talks about our boundaries and the future etc. It ended because of a potential job relocation. We got back together and I never talked about it after that.  I was too nervous to reach out or ever tell him I have feelings. 


This relationship is extremely painful to me because the boundaries are just blurred now .  With any other person I’ve been with,it was just sex. No affection or really getting to know each other. But with him, we sit and cuddle and talk for hours. I feel like I know everything about him. We look through his childhood photos,I learn all about his friends back home. we hold hands while we sleep. We play fight,he sings to me to be funny,and kisses my face (like affectionate little pecks) for hours. He kisses my forehead and the top of my head every time we see each other and during sex. Once,we were kissing and he asked me to stop for a second because he wanted to just stare at me because he loves looking at my face. And of course he has to say it in that softer tone that guys seem to do when they like you:(    he also swears he’s not a touchy person so i just don’t get it lol. 

we hung out last night and he was just kissing my lips with little affectionate pecks hundreds of times while we cuddled,and also silly raspberry kisses. I told him I felt insecure about my body and he started acting really serious and was like you look great to me and kissed my forehead.  We were having sex and he was staring at me deeply and telling how he loves my body,he loves my face,and he loves my smile so much. It was hard for me not to tear up and tell him that i liked him.  I was also talking about how one part of my body hurt,and he just stopped and kissed my knees to make it better. It’s weird as hell to me to do this with no type of feelings involved. There’s only been one person who I would sit and stare at them and kiss all over their face for hours with and that was the only guy who did love me. 

It’s extremely confusing to have it like this. On one hand,I guess i’ve never made my boundaries clear after. I never speak up or talk about what I want,nor does he have any idea i want more maybe. But I also think that if he wanted more,then he would right? My family is extremely harsh about this and tells me that most people my age aren’t as stupid as I am. i don’t know what to do anymore.  Maybe this behavior is normal? It’s insane to me that you can be like this with someone but still be too afraid and embarrassed of ever expressing your true feelings.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o7w71o/how_to_deal_with_a_situationship_that_has_very/

We went out for drinks and we both had 4 I think so I was a little drunk but nothing out of control. For me I get very lovey when I drink so if I like the person I find it hard to restrain that. I would hold his hand at the table and rub his leg and then we kissed at the end. It was more me initiating it and he was receptive but  he was more reserved than me. He did at one point say he was surprised I would go out with him because he thinks I’m “out of his league” so it could be too that he was a little intimidated? I don’t think I’m out of his league for the record!

I’m just curious..do you drink much/show affection on a first date like that? I don’t want to give any wrong impressions. I wouldn’t sleep with someone until a few dates when I know/trust them more but I do like to be otherwise affectionate. I also only drink because they are so we end up drinking the same amount.

4,o7wozt,1624655564,Why was I ghosted?,"Hello. I saw a girl eating dinner outside and stopped to ask her for coffee, to which she agreed.

The next day we went for coffee and had a great time. After, I attempted to kiss her but she told me she wasn't ready for that yet. After, I texted her stating it was great time and apologizing for being too forward and she said she also had a great time and not to worry - just that she was caught off guard. 

Four days later, I texted her asking if she wanted to go for brunch that weekend. She said she already had plans and suggested we get together during the following week. I set up a dinner, for the following Wednesday. We, again, had a great time. During the date, she realized that she knew my great uncle through her work and commented that he was a great guy and during the date we texted him saying we were having dinner and that we should all get together to play cards soon. At the end of the date, I didn't attempt to kiss her and wanted to respect her in taking it slow. She commented that it was nice that we could talk about not kissing and it not being a big deal. 

&amp;#x200B;

Two days later, on Friday, I sent her a text of something funny that happened during the date, to which she ""loved"" on iPhone. She then asked me if my uncle ever replied and said ""maybe he forgot who i was haha."" I replied ""He didn't! Maybe he forgot who both of us are....I think he might be out of town or something."" Then I asked ""Hows your Fri Fri going?""   No response. I waited until the following Tuesday and sent her a text asking her out for this weekend, and again no response. I am puzzled by this because we seemingly had a good 2nd outing together and she showed interest by asking me if my uncle had replied...Any help here would be great.

He’s really smart,cute,funny and caring and I think he’s objectively pretty good looking but he doesn’t realize it ,hes tall ,lean and even smells really good 

But hes really insecure like he will often make really mean self deprecating jokes about himself which I can’t help and laugh at because they are really funny. His insecurity is pretty bad though he will literal avoid taking any picture possible and never smiles for the camera because he thinks he looks stupid

He’s also insecure about his body like in his mind because he doesn’t have a model like body he thinks he’s ugly even though he’s really lean I notice this when we for example when we get sleep together he always wears a t shirt  and he will only get changed when I can’t see him (ie he will go to the toilet to get changed or wait for me to go )

It doesn’t really come up when we have ex or and lie naked together afterwards(but that could be cuase afterwards we often have a blanket )

Idk how I can help him out or how to make him feel better?

37,o80ef9,1624668353,"I have tried to stay positive about my dating life, but it is kinda beginning to really get to me.","I  am a 22 year old male, and the most I have ever done is kissed some  people. I have never been in a relationship with anyone, never had sex,  never been on a second date, nothing. For the past few years, I have  been positive about it for the most part. I had my bouts where it kinda  got to me, but I did my best to remain positive, because I realize  dating is just one minor aspect of life. However, I am 22 going on 23  without ever having any sort of relationship and it is really starting  to get to me.

I feel like I have  tried everything. I changed my attitudes about women (I used to have somewhat toxic attitudes about women a couple years back), I  have worked to become a more empathetic person, I have worked on myself  and my mental health, found interests and hobbies and really focused on  them, started working out, started reading, worked on my career, and  while I am relatively happy with those aspects of my life, I just feel  kind of empty when I think of the fact that I am still single and still  struggling to find someone. It feels like its becoming less and less  ""normal"" and more and more pathetic each passing day.

I  have tried online dating, and I had some decent luck matching with  people mid pandemic (never went anywhere because I had a hard time with  dating remotely and didnt want to go out during a pandemic). However,  after taking a 6 month hiatus from OLD and starting fresh with new  photos (previous photos were from 2019 before I started working out, and  I have changed my hair style since) and a new profile, I am getting  pretty much zero matches. I tried getting my profiles reviewed on  various subreddits here, and virtually every comment was along the lines  of ""I dont really see any major problems with your profile or pictures,  and youre actually decently attractive, but here are some small  adjustments I would make."" So, it seems OLD is a lost cause at this  point.

And that wouldn't be a  problem if it werent for the fact that I have virtually no other way to  meet anyone. I have tried finding local events and groups in my area to  meet people in general (for friends and potentially a partner), but  literally all of them are tailored to older people except for like one  or two that I found, which barely anyone took part in. I dont work a job  where I can meet people since I am a loan officer and work from home.  And I dont plan on going to college again since I dont feel like I need  it at this point in my career, and dont want to spend thousands of  dollars just to meet people. I have also tried going to bars, but I feel  so out of place when I am alone at a bar and just sit in silence as  people drink and have fun around me. I am not a super social person and  have a lot of trouble initializing conversation with people. Especially  in that kind of setting.

I dont  know what I hoped to get out of making this post. I guess it gives me  some comfort to write down my feelings somewhere. But god, it just feels  so demoralizing watching everyone around me seemingly have no problem  dating while I still struggle with it in my adulthood. If anyone has any  advice, I am open and willing to hear it, but this is mostly just a  vent I guess.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o80ef9/i_have_tried_to_stay_positive_about_my_dating/

42,o80v0k,1624670132,I'm turning 23 in a few months and I never kissed a girl before. My question is: What's your advice for staying optimistic?,"On one hand, I'm killing it from my own perspective. I go to therapy, take meds, work out, journal my thoughts, eat right, pay attention to style, skincare, socialize with my buddies, I've graduated from university, I have hobbies I love. 

On the other hand, the malicious part of my brain fights me and knocks me down with negative thoughts that have some core truth to them that makes me unable to ignore them. The truth is the following: Asian people have it hard on dating apps, 5'8 men are considered shorter and less appealing, browner men have less appeal, virgin men have less appeal. I'm the singular virgin who's never dated in my friend group and it's a fact that's commonly known by them, as certain as 2+2=4. Guys who never kissed a girl before at nearly age 23 are normally seen as A BIG RED FLAG. 

I'm here to ask the following:

How do I stay optimistic given the facts of my situation?

Are my worries valid?

What do you do to squash the negative thoughts?

How long will it realistically take me to begin my dating life? 

How can I cope with knowing that I've missed out on years of potential romances; and will continue to miss out on these years in my future while I work hard to improve myself to become desirable enough to attract women?

44,o80yu4,1624670546,The woman (18F) I've (24M) been seeing kicked me out of her apartment immediately after sex and I'm not sure what to make of it and how to proceed,"So I've been seeing this woman a couple of times now. Met her on Tinder, she says she's ""looking to get back out there again"". We went out on first date, she's a bit guarded/withdrawn but still make out at the end anyway. She texts me soon after it ends saying she had a nice time etc and hints at wanting another date etc.

We had our second date last night, she's still not flirty but is a lot more bubbly and talkative. I felt we clicked a lot more this time and had better chemistry. She and I go back to her place (single room uni/college apartment) and have sex. Sex wise, it felt like her and I were going at each other like animals; she was quite enthusiastic, her BJs were super passionate.

But as soon as I finish, I mention that ""I don't have to go to bed early because it's a weekend"" (with the intention of staying, cuddling, more sex"" and she says ""yeah you're gonna have to go now....""

She mentioned she was expecting a call from her mum (her mum is a cop and lives 1000s of miles away and calls her often, sometimes every night) and she said it was due to that rather than something to do with me. This was something she told me about on her first date before anything sexual was on the table at all.

Her delivery of that seemed a bit off though so I'm not sure why she kicked me out so quickly. I've never had that happen before, every woman I've been with has wanted me to stay.

It felt like after we were done, she did a complete 180 emotionally. Like she wasn't craving me like she was before and went back to her timid/guarded/withdrawn self.

She did kiss me before I left but I haven't heard from her since I left last night (12hrs ago now), compared to first date when she texted me about 10-20mins after the first date ended.

So I'm quite confused and am wondering what the cause of this could have been. My first guesses are:

* She didn't enjoy the sex
* She was only looking for a hookup and soon as it was over she was ready for me to leave
* The sex triggered something in her
* She's had bad experiences with men staying over and doesn't quite trust me on that level yet.

So what do you think it could be? How should I proceed with her from here?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o80yu4/the_woman_18f_ive_24m_been_seeing_kicked_me_out/

Since monthsaries are basically every month when you start dating,  what would happen if you broke up and got together again?

I remember being in a relationship for a few years with a guy where it seemed to not matter to him that we spent quality time (he would actually turn it down and that’s cause we were living together…and no I’m not clingy), we weren’t able to talk about anything other than cars or anything with an engine (his interests, not mine), he seemed to not believe in compromise unless it was me doing the compromising, I received no affection until he wanted sex, yaddi yadda. Needless to say, I stayed in a loveless relationship.

Then I met this guy who blew my mind away. He stimulated my mind to no end and adored me 100000% and wasn’t afraid to show it to me and the world. Seriously.

So I tried working it out with my guy from way back, and no compromise, don’t even think he was paying attention to me while I was talking to him (as usual). Decided to leave him for the new guy who absolutely without a doubt wanted to be the one to cherish me.

That threw old guy in a panic mode lol. All of a sudden he understands the things I been telling him, the things i literally had been crying my eyes out daily for him to understand. He finally admits i been right all along like i didn’t already know that. He actually fulfilled one of my long time requests after hearing him tell me straight up NO without a thought for months. After 8 years he realized he has never ran his fingers through my hair lmao. Looking at some scars on my body and absorbing them with passion in his eyes like they’re the most precious thing lolol. All of this depth all of a sudden lol I swear. Words of encouragement! Anyway, it was way too late for him. I realized i didn’t love him anymore way before this new guy.

After the new Rick and Morty episode dropped, I read and wrote a bunch of Rick and Morty fan theories. I'm watching and dying over a Chinese costume drama Tumblr recommended. Fanfiction is occasionally a thing. I'm thinking of starting a nerd-adjacent YouTube channel. (I probably won't.)

I grew up in a family where everyone had different intense interests, and sharing and indulging each other's things was a big part of how we bonded and expressed love. (Sorta like The Mitchell's vs The Machines.) I'd really like to be able to chatter about this stuff with my girlfriend.

I asked my less nerdy bff if my nerd-dom was a relevant part of her experience of me, and she said it was.

60,o82fs5,1624676348,Are these red flags or am I just impatient?,"Brief Intro: 

I met this girl one night when I went out with friends. She worked at the restaurant we went to. Super cute w/ great energy. She wasn’t our waitress but ended up helping out with our larger table multiple times and we all shared some good banter. At the end of the night she came up to me as I was going to the bathroom, called me by name (I don’t remember ever telling her my name), and started a quick convo. I was pretty drunk so I didn’t think anything of it, but when I told my friends (50/50 mix of guys/girls) they thought she was into me. We left and I didn’t get her number or anything because I brushed it off as her just being friendly.

Fast Fwd two weeks:

I’m out with some other friends. One of my friends who heard about the story insisted I go into the restaurant she worked and give her my number. So I do that and she remembered my name after our brief interactions two weeks ago, and seemed happy and flustered I came up to her. Give her my number on a piece of paper and we end the convo with her saying she will hmu.

Here is where it gets weird (I think). I’ll list what happens next in bullets so it is easier to follow.

•No text from her within 3 days

•She follows me on Instagram 

•I try to follow back, but she is private. Doesn’t accept my follow request for about another 3 days

•I wait to see if she DMs me after accepted follow. Nothing. 1 Day later I DM her and she replies fairly quickly saying she lost the paper with my number, but remembered my name and last name from the paper and found me on Instagram (Cool)

•Message back and forth but like she takes a lot of time between messages (like 12hrs). At one point she didn’t reply for 24+ hrs

•I double message; I politely ask her if her if she is no longer interested. She says she is interested but she’s not good with messaging on Instagram and gives me her number

•I text her and the same pattern of not replying for up to 48 hours happens. (Like literally she’ll send me one or two messages a day at best)

•Had a date scheduled, but she had to work. She lmk a couple days before that she might have to work and would lmk, but I had to text her the day of the date to see what was good and she told she had to work

•Now we have another date scheduled a week after the original, but the same pattern of time between texts exists

Wrap up:

Her reasoning is she’s super busy, which I totally get, but I feel like it’s a little weird that she says she’s interested but rarely texts me. She seemed totally cool in person, but it would be nice to get to know her a bit while we’re not in person too.

I’m wondering based on your age, does your attraction to people change? 
For example a 21 year old is attracted to a certain type of person. 
But as a 26 year old, is it possible that you’re attracted to a different kind of person?

They constantly want to know why I’m not taking to any girls, why I refuse to bring any girls home, why I’m not dating (insert female friend), and if I’m gay and hiding it. I’m trying my best to date but girls simply do not like me and I’m too embarrassed to say that to my parents. I want to date and I’m trying my hardest but I’m just not what any girl wants.

I usually just say I don’t feel like talking about it but they can’t ever let it go for too long. They always find some way to bring it up. I think it’s because they can’t get it. My siblings never had any problems dating in college because they’ve always been attractive and popular, my parents were the same way. My dad was a tall handsome D1 athlete for gods sake he didn’t have to try and they can’t relate to what it’s like being me. Part of me even feels like they’re just saying all of this because they want me to admit girls don’t like me. It’s not like they can’t see my face and instantly deduce the problem. They know I’m ugly and yet they still want me to tell them why I can’t get a text back.

I live well, go to the gym, am handy around the house,  have hobbies,  attend social groups, have good friends, play video games in my spare time and am overall really easy going. I was going to volunteer this year but am entering into a relapse which is going for my right leg.... So just seeing how that pans out as I don't want to be a liability. 

I'm not looking to remarry or have a FWB, I wouldn't mind a long term partner to come on holidays with me,  go to dinner,  have some fun and I wouldn't pressure them to stay or cling onto them. 

My friends try to match me with guys but I know the conversation will go ""do you work?"" ""Would you have more children?"" and I feel for most guys, I am a red flag parade.

76,o83umw,1624682042,"(M27) Recently out of a LTR -- unintentionally met someone new, overly-excited &amp; probably screwing it up","**Preface:** I was with my previous partner for almost 4 years. It was an ok relationship. Our communication was meh, a lot of bottling up little frustrations and not talking things out but we never really got into any big fights -- we were good about maturely talking things out once they finally bubbled up, it just wasn't often. A lot of personal differences in terms of politics/religion that I didn't vibe with but didn't know if it was really a deal-breaker for me or not. She moved out of state for work and I just didn't see our relationship getting any better in the future given the distance, she agreed so we mutually split. This happened at the beginning of the month. It hurt me a lot less than I expected, I'm wondering if maybe I was kind of subconsciously already over it before we actually called things off... I feel like a shitty person/kinda guilty for moving on too quickly. We're still on good terms and have many mutual friends, I just didn't feel that romance between us any more for the past year or so. I'm trying to reconnect with some old interests of mine and pick up hobbies again to keep me busy.

**Present:** I've been training at a new gym and met a girl that comes in around the same times I do -- we both do Olympic weightlifting. We get distracted talking to each other and joking around for the few hours we're there, a few times she's come to the gym to work out with me alone even though she was planning on taking the day off. We've gone out for dinner/lunch after lifting on a few occasions, spent a day out browsing some record stores and sharing our favorite music. She's all sorts of gorgeous, tons of mutual interests -- I'm *DOWN BAD*, but I honestly don't know what I want or if I'm ready for something romantic again. She kinda seems/seemed like she wasn't super into physical contact so I haven't made any moves to kiss her thinking it'd be better to let her warm up to me as we learn more about each other.

Went out to lunch again today, asked if she wanted to drive out of town with me to go watch some friends at a weightlifting competition this weekend. She's on the fence, as I dropped her off at her house she said ""idk I need some more convincing"" with a smile and walked inside, texted her a plan of actual date shit I wanted to do with her, got left on read lol. 

Kinda worried I've been trying to hang out too often, but she seemed super receptive so far. Zero hesitation even today, so I'm confused as fuck.

I haven’t heard from her in 2 days as of now. To explain briefly, I was trying to lie about my job I applied for at Amazon was no longer available and she was wandering how did I find out about my job being discontinued and I panicked and was trying to explain how I I wasn’t able to get the job. Story wasn’t adding up to her and I admitted that I im not going to lie to her and I chose to not go for that job due to the job position being too far from me. She then asked why would lie to her and I just responded saying I panicked and I thought she would look at me stupid that I would give up that position since it paid pretty decent. I told her I was stupid for trying to lie to her because I shouldn’t lie to her if I’m dating her because I shouldn’t have anything to hide. Now she is very annoyed and pissed I lied to her and does not want to talk to me which I understand and totally deserve it for lying.
 I don’t care if some people may not like her or what ever because I really care about her and have strong feelings for her. Last time we talked/texted was 4 days ago and last thing she said was “I mean, I don’t really know what to say…I still don’t have time to handle or process our whole situation. I’m extra stressed and busy right now because I’m working now and having to study for my next exam, so I just don’t have time. I mean, I miss talking to you too and I don’t want you to be upset or anything but I just can’t deal with things right now…I have to focus on studying” and I replied by back saying “I understand and I know you’re busy so I don’t want to stress you out rn. We can talk later when ever you’re free. I hope though everything is ok too.” 
Am I over reacting on this or did I kill the relationship? Any advice other than an asshole advice would be nice. Thank you to anyone who can help!

(Not trying to pull anything sleezy, I didn't escalate.)

After some minutes, I had to briefly step away, and she seemed to snap out of whatever she was thinking; I came back and put my arm back around her, but she just kinda sat there not leaning into me anymore. I said I didn't think it was a mistake, and she gave me an idk non-answer. I guess maybe this interaction was a mistake afterall, since she obviously had second thoughts about whatever this was.

So now we're back to square one of idk what's what. We went home with conversation that didn't touch on any of what happened.

Do I bring up this night with her? How do I phrase things? This is awkward af.

From our conversations on our last not-dates, she made it clear that she has absolutely no expectations for anything in life except maybe some aspects of work, and is just kinda going with whatever flow. This is because of some immigration issues that are likely to arise for her in about a year. Myself, idk what I'm doing with her either, since I see both pretty good compatibility and am aware of the serious obstacles to staying together. I think we'd both be up for winging it at least temporarily if we can just talk about it: we're both impulsive enough and have previously made it obvious we find each other attractive. Still, neither of us seems to really want to commit to a decision, so are ordinarily keeping a distance.

We're both in our late 20s with grad degrees and have very much type A personalities. Except idk how to approach this situation, and don't think she does either (or maybe I'm misreading).

98,o85vcq,1624691229,How can I start meeting more girls and having options?,"I’m starting to lose hope for dating, and I really don’t want to. I’m an optimistic guy, I want to be encouraged. But I’m 21 years old, in college and haven’t been in a relationship in nearly 4 years. Since then, I’ve either been ghosted, used for attention, or both. I believe I’m being ghosted again now as well, so it’s hard to stay positive now.

I’ve been told by my friends, both male and female, that I’m a good looking guy, so I don’t think it’s because I’m ugly. In fact, I’m confident in myself and think I’m an attractive man. The part that I struggle with is that I don’t know anyone here, and I don’t know how to start meeting people. One of the common answers I see on Reddit is to join a club to meet people. I would agree, but the clubs at my college aren’t anything I’m interested in at all. Most of them are either political, activism clubs or are just related to majors. And obviously dating apps are not good either. 

Sorry, at this point I’m just ranting, which admittedly feels nice, but I’m at my wits end. I know you shouldn’t need a relationship to be happy, but I’ve been on my own for years and it’s getting old and depressing. I’ve bettered myself so much by working out and having hobbies, yet I still feel empty inside.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o85vcq/how_can_i_start_meeting_more_girls_and_having/
