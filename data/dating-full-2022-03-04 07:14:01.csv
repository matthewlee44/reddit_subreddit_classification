as he said, X did try. she somehow found my account on instagram and messaged me a huge paragraph on why i should stop dating my boyfriend and how bad of a person he is.  to sum up what she said, it was basically just her saying that he mentally cheated on her twice, she’s a drug addict now, and she hates her life. i answered in a very mature way and i guess she got intimidated or something, because all she could say back (i wish i was kidding) is “sorry for texting you and all this shit I’m really stupid ur a amazing person and I hope he’s happy with you now” and “ur really beautiful”. she hasn’t talked to me since and that was all the way back in April 2020 (we started dating March 2020). i know she has talked shit about me, regardless of the fact that she doesn’t know me, to her friends because they would put my boyfriend in group chats and he would leave and get added again. his sister is also friends with Y and X, which obviously doesn’t help. she would talk to X and tell everything to my bf. this was a thing for a while, until she let it go (at least from what i know of). 

this is where it gets a worse. Y is obsessed with my boyfriend. i don’t remember how i found out about her, but i eventually ended up finding her social media accounts. i discovered that she has posted LOTS of videos about my boyfriend and even stuff about me. keep in mind that i have never talked this girl. she would say things like “i fucking hate your girlfriend”, “she ruined my life”, “i miss you so much”, “i dream of that time you slept on your chair because i fell asleep in your bed”, the list goes on. oh yeah, i found out that she literally forced herself into his room and fell asleep in his bed so his mom told him to let her sleep and to go somewhere else. this was way before we started dating, btw. she also comes to “hangout with his sister” as an attempt to see him. there have been multiple instances where he’s walked out to the living room in underwear, not thinking any guests are home, and there X or Y is. super frustrating situation and his parents allow it because they’re friends with his sister, regardless of how much he complains. one time, Y was with a friend and her friend added me. i didn’t know that it was them, i thought it was someone i knew. i added the girl back and she texted me something, can’t remember what it is. i said “who are you?” and she replies with “oh shit are you *******’s gf?” and i was like “yes?” and she just said “you’re a dumbass” and i blocked her. then Y tried to add me, but i didn’t add her back. i have no idea how they even found my account, because it has nothing to do with my name.

at some point closely following that, her posts were really starting to bother me and i told him that he has to call her our. he added her back on snapchat and told her to delete every post that bothers me. she kept saying sorry and deleted them, which is why i unfortunately can’t show them anymore. looking back, i really wish i would’ve screen recorded them. it was fine for a while, and then i saw that she started posting more stuff. after that whole thing, i promised my boyfriend that i would block her because it kept getting in the way of our relationship and he thought that if i didn’t look then it wouldn’t matter. i’m sorry, i just can’t do that. i have that sort of personality where i have to know everything that anyones saying about me. i didn’t block her, and just continued to check her pages. when she would post stuff about me, i couldn’t tell him it bothered me, because then he would know that i was still looking. he was really frustrated with me looking at her stuff, so i just decide to not say anything if i see it because i know it’ll grow into a huge argument if he finds out i still check. also, i failed to mention that she has a lot of mental issues. no judgment for that, because i struggle with my mental health a lot too. it’s just that EVERY SINGLE TIME she hears of my boyfriend or sees him, the next day she posts about being at the mental hospital. he told me that this has always happens. she’s triggered by the smallest things about him. 

i saw that she posted another video about him today and made it very clear that it was about him. said his name and all. i looked at her next post and it was her saying that she’s getting sent away because her parents can’t deal with her anymore…. coincidence huh :| . i was trying to think of things that could’ve triggered her, because i didn’t recall them interacting recently. then, i remembered that she follows his mom on facebook. i just met his parents this past weekend for his birthday and his mom had posted a picture of us together. connected the dots, and well, that’s probably why. 

i don’t really know what i’m asking here. it’s just sort of a tough situation because i hate that i can’t stop any of this from happening. she just doesn’t stop. i’ve tried accepting the fact that she has issues within herself and i’ve done nothing wrong, but i just can’t stop thinking about it. i’ve never been a drama person; i absolutely hate any drama. it just bothers me a lot and i don’t know where to go from here. any advice/comments? 

please be nice you guys. thank you!

When we met, things were great and we clicked instantly, and although I had to move away within two months of dating, he insisted we try long distance and it worked great.

Fast forward to today. He is currently doing an exchange semester in Europe and has been rather distant. He definitely still wants the relationship but feels like he only does because the idea of being with me might be more enticing than actually being with me. I say this because instead of actually spending time with me, he is constantly out with people and uses the excuse ""but I talk all about you and everything you're doing with the people here"". On a side note, I am to move there in a month and he still insists he wants to be with me and live in an apartment with me.

He has in the past months on multiple occasions ditched (pre-planned) calls with me for his friends there (who are only girls, he has no male friends he hangs out with). He even barely talks when he calls me, having once even scrolled Reddit while I was talking to him.

Now why do I specifically feel like a trophy? Because he never actually talks about my character or how funny I am, etc when telling strangers about me. He talks about what I do, what I have achieved, etc. The conversation almost always starts with ""tell them about that project you're working o"", or ""tell them how you managed to do x"". He is 29 years old and still doing his undergrad, which honestly didn't bother me at all in the beginning, but is starting to make me wonder now if he stuck on me because I look like good bragging material.

He was so supportive of me moving to Europe as well to do my master's dissertation and told everyone about how cool my dissertation topic is and the people I'm working with and stuff. But when I asked him to start working on his undergrad final project with me once I'm there as well, I got the reply ""Why would I spend my summer months in Europe working when I can enjoy it. I'll just start once I get home"". See, I get that he might just be proud of my achievements but why is it cool when I do it, but he can never imagine doing it? Ya guys get me?

Hi everyone.

I’m just seeking a little advice mostly from women. I’m a 44M and I live in the UK.

My wife and I are separated but due to financial reasons, we still live in the same house. We have two kids aged 13 and 15.

I recently got some legal advice from a solicitor and he’s advised me that it’s best to start seeking divorce asap and then shared assets can be spit which is our house. It can be sold and we split the equity 50/50 or one of us can buy the other out.

In the meantime due to  a lot of loans we have to live in the same house we have separate rooms etc and we do our own stuff but it’s difficult.

I’d love to meet other women or have hookups. 

I haven’t been on a date for over 20 years! 

What’s tinder and other dating sites like? Are they any good?
Women, these days, are you cool bringing a guy back to yours and would it be cool having to pay for most of the date? Is a guy with kids cool or is it baggage? 
I can’t bring women back to mine and I don’t have much money left each month to go out on dates.

I do chat on Reddit with women, but that’s nothing compared to meeting in person. I love women and love the company of women and I get on well too.

Any hints, tips and pointers would be greatly appreciated! :)",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1162806,public,self,44M separated looking for advice,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/t6evau/44m_separated_looking_for_advice/,no_ads,0,,,,,

Now in march months later.
I decided to go thru her phone cuz i have trust issues after all.
And what i found wasn’t all that nice.
She been loyal to me after all, rejecting all the dudes etc.
But in December she told me a girlfriend of hers was sleeping over. So i was fine with that. (We were pretty exclusive i assumed at that time because we spend so much time together.)
And on her phone i found out she was seeing his particular guy she was talking to.
We were only a month in at the time, and we weren’t in a relationship yet. I would call it a situationship at the time. En decemeber we also had a lil vacation planned.

But I need to get backstory. So there was this boy who messaged me a few times on Facebook and finally one day I answered. We talked for a minute and I told him I had never been on a date before in my life. So he said he would take me to the arcade and I agreed. It was a fun night. We kissed and he asked me to be his girlfriend that night. I thought that was a bit soon so I said no ask me again later. We went on many dates after and hung out and was on the phone constantly for three weeks straight. He asked me to be his valentine. One night he even called me drunk and admitted he was in love with me and was falling for me. I liked him a lot but I didn’t love him yet. All throughout this he wanted my location on because his ex of three years had cheated on her multiple times and he had just gotten out of that relationship. Anytime I was driving in a weird place he would call me and be like where are you. I kind of liked it because it felt like someone cared. Fast forward through all the dates and falling asleep on FaceTimes. We decided to rent a hotel room because we cannot hang out at our own houses. We cuddled and I gave him head for the first time lol. The next morning he was still super lovey-dovey but I decided to turn my location off randomly because I felt weird about it. He immediately texted me and was like why and I just said I liked my independence and I didn’t want it on anymore. It became an argument so I turned it back on. You seem distant all day I even said OK I want to be your girlfriend now because I was just trying to fix the situation anyway I could. The next morning he texted me asking if we could just be friends because he was worried his insecurities was going to ruin the relationship with me and he really wanted it to work. He said we would just be friends for now and that in a couple months we would be together. I don’t know why I got defensive but I basically said OK can I talk to the guys then? Because you can’t expect to hold onto me and to let me go at the same time. He got really mad but we fix the issue or so I thought. The next day I saw a girl tagged him on Facebook saying something about your snoring was cute on the phone last night. I texted him asking if he was talking to other girls. He immediately blocked me. I texted the girl and asked who she was. She said they have been talking for a week which is way before he said he wanted to be friends. But to be fair we were not boyfriend and girlfriend technically. He unblocked me said this is what you wanted now that I’m doing it you’re trying to ruin it and re-block me. He had me blocked on everything so I went to his house which I know is a little bit crazy but I was very calm and told him I was upset and I will goes around comes around and that he was acting like a dick. And we haven’t talked since then rly. Why was he willing to block me so fast and move on? Is he a bad guy or was this all a miscommunication?

I love him so much and he also loves me deeply but I don’t think our friendship will ever be the same again after he came out. 

I am 25, I am straight, attracted to women and had only ever had sex with them. 

Now to Seth, he is 25, and very recently told me he was bi.

I met him 2 years ago, we met through a mutual friend. Over the last few years we have become really close. The last 6 months have been intense, he moved in to stay with me and I feel like we grew a usual 10 year relationship into that short period of time. I have never spoken to someone in my life as much as I have with him. He knows all my deepest darkest secrets. We have been vulnerable with each other, shed tears infront of each other. We feel comfortable telling each other we love each other. 

At some point in our friendship, we hugged every night before we went to bed and we will tell each other how much we loved each other. Every single night! He told me he enjoyed it and wanted to do more. Slowly we started holding hands, we cuddled a couple of times, when he was on shrooms, he kissed me on the cheek and I believe one time I got drunk and I did the same to him. I wasn’t fully comfortable doing this but I love him so much, I felt I would try to make him happy.

The issue is, I had no idea he was bi. These hugs, all the affectionate touching stuff we did, the times we went to eat, the bars, essentially made him fall in love with me. 

2 weeks ago, he came out and told me he was bi, although he hasn’t ever had sex with any other guy, he also said he doesn’t want to have sex with me. Why was he telling me this then? He wanted all the cuddles, holding hands and the romantic shit to continue. I felt uncomfortable doing that during the first 2 months that I tried so I told him I would rather not. 

He told me he understood, however he needs to work on himself and let the feelings die out. He plans to take a few months (3-6months) away from me. And he said when he comes back, we will still be best friends but he wouldn’t really do 1-1 stuff with me. As in, he would always want one of our mutual friends around. He fears those feelings will come back if he spends too much 1-1 time with me. 

I don’t want this to happen, I love him deeply, think about him everyday, he changed my life and my life is orders of magnitudes better ever since I met him. He is the best person I have ever met. Outside of my family, I don’t think I have ever loved someone this way. I love him, I truly do, just not in the way he wants. I want our friendship to remain the exact same way but I don’t think I can do what he is asking for. 

Am I selfish for not wanting to let him go? I have begged him to stay. He says i am being selfish because he’s hurting everyday. He says he will be back in 6 months but that is long and not speaking to him regularly for that time will have a toll on me. 

Is it really a choice of either I let him go or he stays and I try to show him love in that way OR is there a solution where our friendship remains the exact same way but he doesn’t have those edges to cuddle, hold hands etc. anymore. 

TL:dr My best friend (25M) who is bi, is in love with me and I don’t feel the same way. I love him but just platonically. He is trying to take a break from our friendship to work on his feelings. Am I selfish for not wanting this to happen OR do I have to try and be affectionate with him, what should I do",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1162806,public,self,My best friend(25M) told me(25M) he was bi and loved me.

To put it simply, my best friend is bi. I love him so much and he also loves me deeply but I don’t think our friendship will ever be the same again after he came out. 

I am 25, I am straight, attracted to women and had only ever had sex with them. 

Now to Seth, he is 25, and very recently told me he was bi.

I met him 2 years ago, we met through a mutual friend. Over the last few years we have become really close. The last 6 months have been intense, he moved in to stay with me and I feel like we grew a usual 10 year relationship into that short period of time. I have never spoken to someone in my life as much as I have with him. He knows all my deepest darkest secrets. We have been vulnerable with each other, shed tears infront of each other. We feel comfortable telling each other we love each other. 

At some point in our friendship, we hugged every night before we went to bed and we will tell each other how much we loved each other. Every single night! He told me he enjoyed it and wanted to do more. Slowly we started holding hands, we cuddled a couple of times, when he was on shrooms, he kissed me on the cheek and I believe one time I got drunk and I did the same to him. I wasn’t fully comfortable doing this but I love him so much, I felt I would try to make him happy.

The issue is, I had no idea he was bi. These hugs, all the affectionate touching stuff we did, the times we went to eat, the bars, essentially made him fall in love with me. 

2 weeks ago, he came out and told me he was bi, although he hasn’t ever had sex with any other guy, he also said he doesn’t want to have sex with me. Why was he telling me this then? He wanted all the cuddles, holding hands and the romantic shit to continue. I felt uncomfortable doing that during the first 2 months that I tried so I told him I would rather not. 

He told me he understood, however he needs to work on himself and let the feelings die out. He plans to take a few months (3-6months) away from me. And he said when he comes back, we will still be best friends but he wouldn’t really do 1-1 stuff with me. As in, he would always want one of our mutual friends around. He fears those feelings will come back if he spends too much 1-1 time with me. 

I don’t want this to happen, I love him deeply, think about him everyday, he changed my life and my life is orders of magnitudes better ever since I met him. He is the best person I have ever met. Outside of my family, I don’t think I have ever loved someone this way. I love him, I truly do, just not in the way he wants. I want our friendship to remain the exact same way but I don’t think I can do what he is asking for. 

Am I selfish for not wanting to let him go? I have begged him to stay. He says i am being selfish because he’s hurting everyday. He says he will be back in 6 months but that is long and not speaking to him regularly for that time will have a toll on me. 

Is it really a choice of either I let him go or he stays and I try to show him love in that way OR is there a solution where our friendship remains the exact same way but he doesn’t have those edges to cuddle, hold hands etc. anymore. 

TL:dr My best friend (25M) who is bi, is in love with me and I don’t feel the same way. I love him but just platonically. He is trying to take a break from our friendship to work on his feelings. Am I selfish for not wanting this to happen OR do I have to try and be affectionate with him, what should I do",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1162819,public,self,My best friend(25M) told me(25M) he was bi and loved me.

I have a few good conversations and some 1st dates per year and they aren't stressing me much because I know that in most cases, nothing will come out of it.

But I feel a huge tension after the 1st date, when I feel that a woman I like may eventually be into me:

- I know that it doesn't happen that frequently (1-2 times a year). So I do want it to work and I am afraid to loose this rare opportunity 

- I miss sex, love, cuddles, intimacy, and feeling I am attractive... I don't express this frustration in my everyday life, I even try to suppress this feeling. But when I feel there is a distant possibility to have sex and/or be loved, I really feel how frustrated and tensed I am. My mental is assessing if the possibility is real and overthinking about the best way to secure it and my body is literally shaking from the accumulated tension...this stress partly disappears when the woman says she likes me and fully once we had sex.

- I am always afraid to scare the woman or to be seen as a creep when I want to be physical or express my desire. Sex was a taboo in my education and if I am very open-minded about it now, I still feel I behave wrongly when talking about it with women I flirt with. (this taboo is not existing in a relationship,  just when I don't know the person wants me).

He asked for my number, and the same has continued on whatsapp. Tbh i think because i’ve been stuck at home with not much to do i’ve noticed how long he’d take to respond (usually at night). Ofcourse being busy and a working adult means less time to text which i also prefer because i’d rather get to know him more in person!

When we met, things were great and we clicked instantly, and although I had to move away within two months of dating, he insisted we try long distance and it worked great.

Fast forward to today. He is currently doing an exchange semester in Europe and has been rather distant. He definitely still wants the relationship but feels like he only does because the idea of being with me might be more enticing than actually being with me. I say this because instead of actually spending time with me, he is constantly out with people and uses the excuse ""but I talk all about you and everything you're doing with the people here"". On a side note, I am to move there in a month and he still insists he wants to be with me and live in an apartment with me.

He has in the past months on multiple occasions ditched (pre-planned) calls with me for his friends there (who are only girls, he has no male friends he hangs out with). He even barely talks when he calls me, having once even scrolled Reddit while I was talking to him. He has also explicitly said he has no plans when I asked him what else he was doing with his day and yet hung up from a call with me after 10 minutes because he had something to do. I'm starting to feel like the effort is one-sided, but he definitely does not want to leave me

Now, why do I specifically feel like a trophy? Because he never actually talks about my character or how funny I am, etc when telling strangers about me. He talks about what I do, what I have achieved, etc. The conversation almost always starts with ""tell them about that project you're working o"", or ""tell them how you managed to do x"". He is 29 years old and still doing his undergrad, which honestly didn't bother me at all in the beginning, but is starting to make me wonder now if he stuck on me because I look like good bragging material.

He was so supportive of me moving to Europe as well to do my master's dissertation and told everyone about how cool my dissertation topic is and the people I'm working with and stuff. But when I asked him to start working on his undergrad final project with me once I'm there as well, I got the reply ""Why would I spend my summer months in Europe working when I can enjoy it. I'll just start once I get home"". See, I get that he might just be proud of my achievements but why is it cool when I do it, but he can never imagine doing it? Ya guys get me?

Now I don't know how to bring this up to him without sounding condescending but at the same time, I do not want to feel like I'm being treated as an object rather than a person by my partner.

I know they are a relatively slow mover and have had some past traumatic relationship experiences that have caused some abandonment syndrome in therm. So it's now been over 3 months. We had a blow out a couple of weeks ago that required us to take a week off and decide if we should continue seeing each other.   


Last monday he told me that when girls hit him up he tells them he's ""talking to someone"". I guess I'm the only person who didn't know what that meant. I said what does that mean exactly? He said it means exactly what it sounds like. So after going home and doing some online research and asking friends I realize that he's saying we haven't even gotten to the dating stage yet. So 3+ months later and he still thinks of me in the ""talking to someone stage""? I know he moves slow but wow. Also how many people want you to take them on vacation and help them pay for things when you're ONLY in the ""talking to someone"" stage??   


I guess  I'm going to have to ask him to clarify this. If he says that yes we're not in the dating stage yet then I think I should let him know that I don't think paying for vacations and helping pay for things etc is something I do for someone I'm not even dating.

Maybe only a woman can understand what's going on in another one's mind:

In general, I (*27M*) never had any success with OLD, but in July 2021 I met this really nice girl (*24F*). In fact, she was the only one who replied out of a couple of matches.

It's been now over 8 months, and we still haven't met, only texting via WhatsApp. I just recently told her I like her, and also that she is the first I have ever said this to (t*his is true and the reason is at the end, below the line*). I was expecting either she will block me or just reject me, but she said she likes me too.

However, the main issue is, from the beginning, she is slow at responding. Not just a few hours slow, I am talking about days slow. There were times when I wouldn't hear anything from her for over a week or two. I thought maybe she isn't interested, so approximately 3 times, I gave her a way out and said if she doesn't want this to continue, that's fine by me. In response, she apologized and said she will try and that she is slow at responding in general, not just to me.

The thing is, I don't mind waiting considering she has a lot on her plate right now, but all I am asking is barely takes 5 minutes to respond. If she really likes me as she said, I can at least expect a quicker response.

I know it is never a good idea to get attached to someone without meeting them in person, but I guess this is what happens when you've been single for your entire life. Based on our texts, I can say she is a really nice and good person and this is what I've fallen for.

I am not desperate or looking for a hook-up. I consider myself nice and honest, and would never say things to someone that might even remotely hurt them. The only reason I am afraid to confront her or directly ask her to reply quicker is not to annoy her. 

\-----

I have been *forever* single mainly for the following two reasons:

1. Until last year, I was mainly focused on my studies and career. I come from a lower-middle-class family, so it was important for me to improve this, at least for my parent's sake considering they gave up all they had for my education.
2. The above point made me socially anxious, plus I am shy and introverted around strangers, so it's difficult for me to talk to women. Therefore, I turned to online dating.

Now, I think I lost that period of my age that would have made me at least somewhat successful at dating, instead of the current situation where it is becoming difficult to find that particular someone.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1162816,public,self,Need advice about her behavior,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/t6jqin/need_advice_about_her_behavior/,no_ads,0,,,,,

So I F(19) have met this seemingly wonderful guy M(25) at this highschool for adults in my country in Europe. We’ve had two classes together in one semester last year and we really clicked. He’s not from my country and has lived abroad most of his life. He claims to have left where he originally lived because of his dad being a politician and him and his family being harassed to the point of where they’ve had to get new identities and move away from the country. 

However he also claims to be on the national team in a sport and representing the country he fled from because of his family’s safety was in danger which doesn’t make sense. He has the build of an athlete in the so-called sport so he does train

I really like him and want to believe him but as I told my parents about him they said they got a really bad feeling about him. They say a person who lives under a new identity don’t just tell someone 6 years younger than them who’ve barely known them for half a year. 

Also he has nice cars (cars are really expensive in my country) and my parents think he is drug dealing or fighting illegally for money or something.

How can I like make sense of this but not in a way so he notices I’m vary of him? We text and call each other when we can (he has just begun in med school)

I knew it was time to take a break because a few things were happening: 

* I was getting frustrated that I was no longer receiving the kind of matches I was 3 months ago. I was bored with who I was seeing out there and trying to engage in conversation with. I don't mean to sound judgmental and holier than thou, but it really started to feel like the algorithm had no one else left to show me, so it was showing me a lot of basic-sounding profiles, low effort profiles, and/or the ones I simply wasn't attracted to, and in any instances where I got match, that same energy could be felt in people who barely carried conversations, and if they did, they felt very boring, had extra long pauses between responses, disappeared or faded away. 
* The profiles I was seeing and getting likes from were also getting further and further away out of my radius somehow, and that was actually the biggest issue across my experience from the very beginning: My radius was set to 25 miles, and yet, many of my likes and matches came from women usually over an hour away in Boston, which isn't a total dealbreaker, but definitely takes more consideration. When your matches don't have cars, still live with roommates, or aren't willing to meet halfway for the first date, or work weird hours, it's just not going to work.
* It really felt like I was trying to make something that clearly was no longer serving any purpose work, and growing anxious because of it. I was starting to feel like it was a direct reflection of my own worth/value.

It is of course a defeating feeling. I think I did my best out there, and I put in A LOT of effort and energy to try to meet someone.

For our next date he asked if I wanted to come over to make dinner, play games and talk. But he also made it clear that we can go out and take things slower than we did the night before.

I was away for 6 years (abroad for college) and I recently came back to my country (4 months ago). I have 2 bestfriends here. They both went to the same college. Bestfriend 1 actually met her now boyfriend in college, they've been together 6 years now. She did meet his friends when they 1st started dating but she fully integrated the group around 2 years ago. It's literally a group of 10 to 15 guys. Bestfriend 2 fully integrated the group around a year ago. When I came back, my two bestfriends invited me to hang out with them and the gang. I've now hung out around 4-5 times I'd say with the group (a lot more times with the besties obviously). 

So uhm, a couple hang outs ago, I talked with this one particular guy. It was just conversation but it flowed really well. And then the last 2 times we hung out with them, he sat next to me and we talked a lot. I feel like there's something going on. The last time we all hung out was like 2 days ago. And when we were about to leave, he said ""hey, I don't see you as often, you should come by more whenever we're at the (bar they usually hang out at)"". And like he gave me the biggest hug. They're all huggers in that group actually but this was the 2nd hug he was giving me as my friends and I were saying goodbye. And idk, the 2nd hug felt kinda different. 

Now my dilemma is, I don't know if I should go for it if the guy were to ask me on a date or smth. I don't know if the guys are off limits. I know bestfriend 2 has had a friends with benefits type of situation with one of the guys from the group. It did end and noone from the guys know, just me and best friend 1. It didn't end badly and they still all hang out together. But I'm scared that, in case I go for it and for whatever reason it ends badly, I might affect the friend group (especially my besties relationships with them). Though technically I'm an adult and I don't get disrespectful when relationships end, I'm more of a ""let's be mature about this"" kind of person.

So yeah, should I go for it if the guy asks me out? I'm kinda crushing on him and maybe it's just a feeling but I feel like it could turn into something more. Or maybe it's just a crush and it'll pass? I don't wanna create any weird vibes in the friend group too, especially as I'm just a new addition (I literally don't even know all the guys by name, they are so many 😅)

TLDR : met a guy a couple months ago when I was hanging out with my friends, I feel like something has been happening between us since a couple hang outs ago, not sure if I should follow through though since I'm new to the friend group.

I really like her. But it's painful not seeing her...



I really would like some sort of positive hopeful thoughts. I want to make things work. But I feel like there's little I can do. 😞 The more I push, the further she seems to go away. I don't want to upset her. 



In the back of my mind I'm also thinking, meeting people is *really* hard. If this doesn't work out, I don't know how long I'll be alone for, and that hurts just as much. 



I've been known to have a negative mindset by my psychologist. I exaggerate problems in my life a bit, and that gives me anxiety. I should be more optimistic, because optimism leads to motivation and positive actions. Positive actions leads to good outcomes.

We had a great time, laughing alot, sharing stories, and even got some banter and light physical touch before the end of the night. We hugged very tight when we parted. No kiss. It was a genuinely good connection and i felt drawn to him that night, but held back alot. We both repeatly said we wanted to see each other again.

He isn't on his phone alot, isn't on social media and warned me he often forgets to check his messenger. So he gave me his cell number at the end of our first date. I asked him out for the second date 4 days later, by text. He says he really has his hands full due to family obligations, and offers the following week. I propose we meet on friday, he says ""that sounds great!"". We text here and there, he mentions our second date plans. Im getting excited.

Fast forward the next week, thursday: i sent him a flirty  meme via messenger and wrote to him ""im excited for our second date! What do you have in mind?"" He only read it the morning after yet didnt respond. (My gut feeling was already going *sad trombone sound*)

Friday: on the morning of, he sends me a considerate text asking if we can reschule, as something important has poped up in his family. Of course im a bit sad, i had been getting excited for the past 2 weeks to see him again. But I respond with understanding and empathy, family is a priority to me as well.

Do guys/people often use ""family emergency"" to ""politely"" decline once they've changed their mind/lost interest?

Im neurodivergent, very naive and dont always understand human behavior (especially guys). Im thinking i may have proof in his texts that he indeed does want to see me again.

With our busy schedules (and perhaps him not being as into me as I was into him) we only hung out a couple times a month. Eventually I told him it was no longer working for me and that I was now in a different place. He expressed he was still not looking for a serious relationship. So I walked away. He didn’t seem to care but then again he was never very emotional so maybe that’s just him.

We had so much in common. We were both heavily into the same music (went to a concert together) and big into similar outdoor activities (biked together). He was up front about “not wanting a relationship” so there is no hard feelings. Just disappointment I guess which is my fault. 

What I’m wondering is can a man simultaneously like a woman but not want a relationship? I’m just confused how we could have so much in common and yet he still seemed so fine when I asked to end it. He said he has had 2 long relationships in the past and did not enjoy living with them. He said he doesn’t like giving up his freedoms. But part of me thinks he would be willing to give some of his freedom up for the RIGHT woman. I guess I’m just left a little wounded, which was a lesson learned on my part, but I’m grappling with how two ppl can seem like they’d make a great match and yet one of them just is so emotional absent.

There’s a lot to unpack here so apologies if this ends up long. Basically me and a girl in work really hit it off. She’s funny, incredibly kind, caring and thoughtful, she’s smart, we have a hilarious time together and we share a lot of common interests, not to mention she’s stunning. I have zero dating experience, and dating coworkers can be messy, so I’d been very hesitant to act on anything and tried to just push the attraction away and act normal around her, not thinking it would ever go anywhere and that anything I thought was between us was all in my head. As time progressed though I knew that I sensed a flirty vibe growing between us, teasing turned to being around each other all shift, which turned into messaging outside of work, which turned into flirty, sexual jokes, which turned into hugs, a couple of times of holding hands, being more emotionally vulnerable with each other and a couple of kind of half-joking suggestions from her that we grab a drink together sometime. While I still tried to ignore that to keep things simple, people around me who I told about this told me she was clearly really into me, that I would be absolutely insane not to take up her offer in a serious way and that I had nothing to worry about, and that I was letting my anxiety and lack of experience stop me from something that could be really good.

By this point I’ve fallen quite a bit for her no matter how much I’ve tried to just get her out of my head, so about a week ago when she suggested again we grab a drink together for like the 3rd time in her passive way, I replied more seriously rather than joking around about it, and we made concrete plans to do something this weekend when we both had our shifts and knew what days we had off. I was incredibly excited and she seemed pretty into the idea too.

Apart from that we had a work’s party last weekend and one of our coworkers who she’s really close friends with was clearly all over another one of our coworkers, and he announced that they’re dating to people when they were talking to him. The girl I’m into was pretty upset over this and it kind of came out that a while back now her and the dude she’s friends with had been sleeping together and stuff, but never properly dated. I suppose being so close with him, having slept together, all the unresolved feelings, etc., got to her and she was upset that he had found someone else, and probably realised she isn’t over him. It was a whole load of drama; she’s been trying to act like she’s okay, even on the night in question, but she’s clearly pretty upset over it.

Ever since that it’s been weird for me. Nobody knew I’d asked her out and so I’ve just had to sit and bite my tongue while people talk about this drama with her and some other dude. Since then we’ve still been fine with each other and it’s certainly not awkward or anything, and I’ve been trying to just have a good time with her when we’re around each other and try take her mind off it, but I really don’t know what to do now.

She hasn’t brought up the date idea again and neither have I, and she’s not opened a message from me from days ago even though we’ve talked irl and stuff. I think she probably feels awkward about me knowing all this and having got the ball rolling when we probably shouldn’t have and she clearly wasn’t ready. I did talk to her today and asked how she is and to be honest she’s got a shit ton of other stresses on her plate apart from just that too; as I was leaving work for my few days off we got talking about how she is and how I wouldn’t be in for a few days, and she said she hasn’t even had a chance to sit and look at where she has time off cause she’s just been completely run off her feet with a lot of shit. Which, from all the stuff she told me, is genuinely understandable and I didn’t want to say anything else or follow up on that and put any pressure on her. She’s having a pretty rough time.

But I suppose all this gives me time to think and collect my thoughts, and decide where I stand here. I’m kind of in limbo. I haven’t been this into someone in years. I truly felt like it was going really well and now I can’t help but think there is something there, but the timing is just absolutely terrible and the added drama that would ensue from us going on a date would be a little too much for either of us. I tried my best to just ignore whatever’s between us for a long time and it feels like just as I act upon it it’s like it’s all blown up in my face. 

So, what can I do here? All I can do really short-term I think is give her space, not put any pressure on her and try be a good friend to her (since we have become pretty good friends anyway) and have fun with her and be there for her where it’s possible, but I don’t know what to do about how I feel now. I tried so hard not to let myself fall for her, but for a moment it just all seemed so simple and easy and clear. It felt like it was all clicking into place, but the idea of dating someone who’s very clearly not over someone else, all while having to work with them all, is obviously a disaster waiting to happen. And beyond even that, I care about her a lot and it hurts me seeing her upset over all that and the bunch of other shit she’s got going on, she seems pretty overrun by it all, and it feels good just to be able to make her laugh when I can. I just need some second opinions on what would be best here for both of us. Should I give up? Move on? Wait? If she does decide to bring the date up again, should I go on it? If I don’t, what should I say to her? My mind’s been all over the place with it all and I wish I could just switch my feelings for her off now, it would be much easier, but that damage is done now I suppose.

I’ve (F22) been dating this guy (M25) for about 3 months now. Everything was really good, I thought how lucky I was to meet someone as nice n fun as him. He texted me every morning every night and we’ve hungout every week. I’ve met his mom n friends, he told me he wouldn’t introduce me to them if I wasn’t important. He’s called me his girl multiple times, finally I asked him last week what we are, I’ve been very patient and thought we should at least talk about it. He basically said he was happy w where we’re at, likes to take things slow, and I’m important to him and that was that, I didn’t really get a response about the future. Also, that same day I said how it’s confusing sometimes bc we’re great in person but now he doesn’t text me as much and he said he’s busy and not really a texter, which is fine. But after that he stopped trying to text me at all, laggy responses/ short/ not responding. He hasn’t talked to me in 5 days now (he did say he wasn’t feeling well last time I talked to him but still has been posting on ig story). We didn’t hangout last week and I’m just telling myself it’s over. I don’t know if I’m overreacting. It sucks that I’ll prob be the one to text him first again bc at this point I don’t want to feel like I’m the only one trying to be w him, and don’t really know if I’m like overstepping boundaries bc he isn’t my bf. But It’s only been 3 months and he’s acting like this suddenly when usually people are all excited and head over heels at this time. I don’t know what I did or if I pushed him away by asking, if he’s really busy, or if he’s just playing me (which is what my family thinks). I don’t want to make excuses for him.. I’ve been very chill and myself this whole time. We’ve never argued, and it’s all very sudden cuz I thought we both liked each other.

i’m seeing this guy, who’s 23 years old, i told him that i am 18... didn’t seem to have an issue and neither did i, but before he knew about my age he guessed that i was around 27 years old but then i came across people from the internet giving their opinions about how 20 something year olds shouldn’t date 18 year olds, if it wasn’t for the law they’d go younger, you’re being groomed, like i get it, but i personally don’t see an issue... though i felt weird after hearing people’s opinion and i kept thinking to myself maybe he’s some sick freak, some pedo that decided to date a young girl

The question in title should be rather self explanatory but I’ll do my best to give an idea what I’m looking for. My environment, especially when it comes to children is rather conservative in a manner which women are supposed to have kids. My friends, my acquaintances, my family and their friends (e.g. paternal and maternal friends), they all look forward to have children. At worst, some of them have the looks of it. My background is muslim, although most of them aren’t religious, the rather conservative ideals are soldered in them. Which it doesn’t make it easier for me.

Before I go further I have ZERO interest in having a kid thus I have no intention to change my mind on this which is rather sad because I had turn offs from those when they have plans on having a kid if they happen to find their « better half ». But I want none of it. 

I’m not sexually active if I’m not a virgin so I didn’t bother having vasectomy. 

The question may sound like « How do y’all get a gf » when your simplify it. Except, in my case the list gets narrows severely as soon as I apply the « childfree » filter to the point which there are literally no options. 

I’m fairly certain many of CF men/women have the same issue so I do hope the answers I will get help them as well.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1162824,public,self,What should I do as a childfree man if my social circle if full of people who want children?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/t6q0rp/what_should_i_do_as_a_childfree_man_if_my_social/,no_ads,0,,,,,
