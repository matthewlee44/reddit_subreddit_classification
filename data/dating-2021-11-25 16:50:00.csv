3,r298s7,1637882494,Would dating someone who smokes cannabis be a deal breaker in your eyes?,"I've been seeing someone who smokes cannabis occasionally throughout the week. I don't smoke to be honest, although if I am with some of my friends, I will sometimes indulge if I've always been drinking. But if I had to be completely honest, I have smoked weed like three times this year, and two of them were at a music festival/road trip. I don't mind if she does, but I do know sometimes she claims she does it for her ADHD/anxiety, (she says medication may her feel absolutely like a zombie). Which, I'm sort of the fence about, because while I think that is a fair response, I also think relying on drugs in the first place is a bad thing.

I enjoy her company, she's a very sweet girl, she is very loyal, submissive, but I honestly think if she stopped smoking she would honestly be happier.  I'm considering giving her my commitment, but after finding out this I don't know what I should think. I have no right to tell her to quit, it's her life. But while this isn't a turnoff or deal breaker, it sort of makes me wonder if you would also do things unhealthy for our relationship or things that could be unhealthy for me.

We have gone on dates once a week for the first month but this next month we won't be able to see each other due to school and also him leaving for home for the holidays. It will be a whole month of communicating via text and calls once in a while.

When I see him I am super stoked and it feels hopeful, but having such large gaps in between when we see each other is hindering my ability to form any emotional connection to him. We text and once in a while chat on the phone, but it feels like a long-distance relationship and I am starting to question if I can even build anything with him having such a huge gap at the beginning of our dating experience. He lived only about 40 mins away. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am thinking I should just end it. I don't see myself developing feelings at a normal pace with so much distance and not seeing each other often.  We probably won't have time to consistently hang out until Jan 2022. And by then I have a feeling everything will die on my end because we haven't spent enough quality time together.

My dating life can be considered a series of unfortunate events... one after another...

1. Married to the guy I met when I was 19, oh that ended up 10 years after with a restraining order and a daughter who hates my guts for leaving her ""perfect daddy""
Then fell madly in love with  a girl who just crushed my heart 
And basically after that it has been relationships based on sex, where there is no emotion just sex, oh and they last for years, but just sex.


I'm at a point  in my life where I don't  need a bf/gf (I make my own money and have a good life), and explicitly say it, and more than anything I need a friend.
But for some reason I end up bumping into the same type that only wants sex and I'm tired of it (I love sex) but meaningless sex I just as good as playing with my toys.

So seriously considering celibacy and just buying 3 cats and becoming a crazy cat lady.

She talks about the long term and how she wants me to visit South Africa with her next year. Also, she said she had informed her dad of me. We have had sex a few times and all that.

Those are all good things and then only 4 days ago I found out she has blocked me from her IG stories. I found out through a mutual friend. I am trying to shake these thoughts off, but I can’t! I feel truly offended that she has done that, especially after I have treated her so well and paid for most of the stuff. 

There is another issue which I have noticed but ignored it - she has arrived late on every occasion (like 30 mins late).  Last time, I was sitting alone in a restaurant waiting for her before she arrived and said she lost her card and that she was sorting that out.

I’m suppose to meet her tomorrow evening, but I only feel compelled to go because she bought theatre tickets online. I want to bring this up with her, but I feel I would seem stalkerish and that won’t do me any good.

29,r2bsst,1637890893,I seriously fucked up.,"I feel like my life is made up of terrible choices lol. So I dated this guy (M22) and it ended up being a rebound to get over my ex that broke up with me a week prior. During the relationship with this guy I was a terrible person, I was still in love with my ex and couldn't tell him, and just emotionally hurt him a lot. So I ended up breaking up with him about 3 months in. We started then just hooking up and then when we hooked up one time, I said something terrible that our relationship was never real and I never had feelings for him. We stop talking for a bit (for obvious reasons), and during this time I finally was able to completely heal over my ex, get over some past trauma, and just get my shit together. I started working out, got a job, continued school, happy and in a way better mental state. When we were originally in a relationship I was in the worst mental state, severely depressed, selfish, agitated irritated (mainly because I could not get over my ex at the time). So I became better and reached out. 

We hung out last night and I realized I do have feelings for him and I do care about him, something I was unable to do when we were together (I was depressed, suicidal). But I think he's done with me and I don't blame him. He has only seen me at my absolute Lowest and I was just such a bad person, which I knew what I was doing but couldn't help it, and so he thinks of me in such a terrible light.

So there it is, I seriously fucked up. And I'm too scared to tell him how I feel about him because I mean I treated him shitty and there is NO reason for him to even keep speaking to me again. I wasn't able to form this emotional connection before, but now I am not empty, etc. so I'm able to care and feel.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r2bsst/i_seriously_fucked_up/
30,r2bt2g,1637890919,"As someone who's NEVER dated, how the hell do I get into this stuff?","Hello there dating nerds! As the title says, I've never ever dated in my entire life. I've been in two relationships so far and both didn't work out. I'm now 20 years old, few months to go before I turn 21, and honestly being single sucks ass. It gets easily lonely, I won't lie. I've always told myself I'll just let things happen naturally, I'll meet someone, get to know them and hopefully it'll lead somewhere. I realise I have a lot of time left of course but like I said before, it sucks. 

I've tried dating apps in the past and usually ended up just taking them off my phone the day after because I have no idea with them. I set my profile as honestly as I can, say what I like and shit like that, but I don't know how to move on from there. Starting conversations feels so much scarier on apps than in real life, and everytime I look through matches and all that, there's just no one that catches my eye. I'm not a particularly picky guy, I'm just looking for a decent human being who enjoys some of the things I do and hopefully kick things off from there.

I think what makes me nervous is that the conversations don't feel as natural as they do irl. I'm talking to this person with a goal in mind, which is to go on a date eventually. So there's pressure to just keep things going, not let the convo get dry af, and then there's actually meeting up in person. What if it's just insanely awkward, from me or them, and then I'll have no idea what to do and panic.

I have no clue where or how to start but I'd love a bit of advice on this. I don't get the impression that a lot of dating apps are that great these days, but I'm open to suggestions. And how do you handle going from purely texting to meeting the person?

We go and I am extremely nervous as this is the first person I had actually felt feelings for in the past 4 years and first real date I have been on in a long time since Covid, fast forward to me getting drunk and her giving me her number at the end of the night as we go our separate ways. 

         We go on a few more dates in the following weeks, and one Sunday evening we are hanging out at my place and I basically Hit her with a DTR and to ask her to be my gf. She says yes and we talked some more and I felt so connected blah blah blah. She shared her future thoughts and plans but that was really the last time I would get it even. 

        For the next few months I would then go out of my way to be with her or help her family or whatever it maybe, solely focusing on her and trying to build a relationship with her. She is a wonderful woman and does so much, I just wanted to be there and support her and hope for one day maybe she would let me into her mind again. She is a person who loads her schedule up to a T and not have much free time at all, which is something I didn’t truly understand either which also leads to the problem. 

          I went to her white coat ceremony, was her plus one to some weddings, made cute dates, helped her family in countless ways and was 100% there for her. This just adds to my confusion of why I was there in the first place. One thing I struggled with in the relationship was intimacy, and she was clear from the beginning that she wanted to wait until marriage for sex and I understood. Yes it was difficult for me especially when all my past relationships have had sex to rely on strengthening our bond and relationship. But I knew what I had to do and wanted to be there emotionally to build that intimacy instead. 

        This is also her first relationship and I understood that as well, but just wanting to be there wholeheartedly and not for the wrong reason to look to the future. I only create relationships with those that I can see long term after. Fast forward a few months and I notice she started to become distant. Short in her texts, or she was very vague in her responses of where she was at or doing. I got to see her once a week really and it was a serious struggle for me when it felt like I was a burden or not even close to a priority on her list of things. 

       I was already struggling mentally but I would come to a point and break to tell her how I felt. This would then come in short responses of how “I’m not ignoring you, I’m just busy and I want to give you the response and time you deserve so I will respond later” or other bullshit. She would never be truly honest with how she felt with me and she took the easy way out one day when I was venting to her about how I felt. At the end of it she says “it sounds to me that I can’t be there for you or what you need” which really in my head I think it’s not whether you can or cannot, it comes down to the very fact whether you want to put in the effort or not. And very clearly in that moment, I wasn’t worth it to her in her eyes even after all the emotion and change I had gone through, she hadn’t batted an eye. 

       Through all the mental struggle, breakdowns and panic attacks, deep down she didn’t care about me or what I was going through. I just really struggle to understand why I was there for her in it all or why she kept me there to just throw it all away when I was looking for so much more. I know the energy and effort wasn’t reciprocated, I just don’t understand why she would string me along and act like I was a certain prospect. 

         Especially the way she ended things with the “you’re a wonderful guy and I hope we can be what each other needs one day” and all the other false hope jargon an ex could feed you. It’s been a month and she is still all I think about.  I just don’t understand.

37,r2ccar,1637892672,"Let me tell you about the policeman I’ve been seeing, it has been good. But he barely answers me on social media!","I’m F20 and he is M28, we have already talked about our age and neither of us care about the age difference. He said he thought I was mature, and I told him I prefer older boys. From my experience, the boys at my age, are just not mature enough for me at all, at least the ones I have been with earlier. I’m done with bullshit, so I met this man and he seems to be smart and independent, that’s what I like. 

So it started when I was at a nightclub with some friends of mine. I sat down in a sofa with my friends, he sat next to us. The seats were limited. He started talking to me, and later we danced together! The sexy kinda dance too! It’s over a month ago. 

Now, I didn’t get his contact info back then, I’m not the type of girl to go with a guy home, so I went back to my friends. Some weeks later, I was at the club again, I saw this policeman staring at me the whole time. When I went outside, he approached me and talked about us dancing, and that’s when I understood where I had seen him. So I asked for his snap, and we talked a little. He said we should go out for a drink soon. We both got work, I have two jobs, among one of the jobs, I am a security guard, and he had noticed me working at the same nightclub. He had really been observing me. And I think it is a plus that I’m a guard too, because we both care about the same things and is sort of in the same field. 

So we didn’t see each other for a little while, then last week, I was at the same nightclub with some friends, (note; there is nothing to do in this smalltown) I just go to be social, and I haven’t been really drunk either. So I went outside, and he was working on patrol, driving the police car. He saw me, and stopped the car, just to go talk to me. He said we should really hang this week, and maybe he would go out drinking so we could meet on this upcoming saturday if he wasn’t hungover from the work christmas party they are gonna have. 

After having him on on snap, and not really talking that much, I kind of lost hope that he was interested in me. But then, this week, we actually went out on a coffee. He followed up with what he had said. He picked me up, we talked for 3 and a half hours, and it went good. He said he wanted to meet again, and I got the feeling that we were a good match, and I think that thought was mutual.

Now after that, I have been wanting to talk to him on snapchat. He has earlier said he isn’t that much active, and that he is going to get better at that. Snapchat is the only social I have from him. Yesterday, he didn’t snap me the whole day, and then I snapped him this morning, he snapped back. Later I just noticed that he is active on the snap map, but he does not open my snap. So i figured, I should just ask him, I sent him «Are you actually interested in me?» 

And he hasn’t opened the snap even though he has been active. I don’t know about you guys, but when I am into someone, I’d like to talk to them during the week. Especially since we aren’t able to meet that often because of work. I haven’t been bothering him, not spamming him or anything. Just simply waiting for him to talk back. 

All I can do is think about him, but I don’t understand why he often doesn’t contact me, when he is the one that has been approaching me. He said on our coffee date that he really doesn’t open up to anyone, and also that he does not approach anyone, along other compliments. So it was clear that he was into me. 

Could it be that he really is that busy? He really just does not use snapchat this much? His snap score isn’t the biggest, but it is larger than others too. Why does he go on snap without answering me? Do you guys think that he is interested in me? I will update you on what he answers on the snap I sent, but as for now, I’m losing my mind!!!

Did I friendzone myself or am I being played

I am on mobile that is extremely glitchy, sorry for the grammar

Hey, I’ve posted and deleted this in so many subs, but I think this sub is the best place to ask if I’m being played or reading into it. 

So when i was abroad I met a guy let’s call him “Greg” we were from the same country and became friends through a group of people. When we were living abroad we never had any sort of flirtation or spark that lead us anywhere besides friendship. Fast forward two years he just moved to my city and we’ve been hanging out frequently, but not as much as I thought and I believe this is because we started hooking up. The first night he arrived we went out drinking and got caught up in stories about where we traveled and he tried to kiss me, at first I freaked out because I didn’t want to wreck our friendship but after my mini melt down and Greg being very drunk he started saying let’s see where this goes and pointing out every detail about me (the sweetest comments about things most people wouldn’t notice) , I obviously kissed him and as the night progressed I stayed at his place. The next morning I cracked a joke about our friendship and he said “ yeah, just friends ;)” which I didn’t read into as we had just hooked up for the first time. Me and Greg continued to hookup for a few more weeks before we just stopped hanging out for awhile. He blew me off several times so I gave up. Fast forward a month we started hanging out again and it was friendly until one night I invited him with me on a day trip to my hometown to  hangout with my friends, everyone was having such a good time and Greg was being extremely affectionate, my best friend pulled me aside and asked if we were dating to which I said no. That night on our way home we had a blast spending time together and he posted photos of us on his story, his sister called him and he answered and introduced us. When we got back to his, he invited me up and started joking about how he has dated people taller than him ( I’m 6’ and he is 5’8 ). At some point his best friend even brought up how he cares about me as a person and how we are “friends”

HERE is where I am confused:

-We have brought up not wanting to be in relationships 
-Through all of this I was open about me dating  people 
He will sometimes and VERY randomly comment on how we aren’t dating 
-I expressed how I was jealous over something and he said he’s experienced jealousy towards me as well. So I brought up needing space and not hooking up. ( because I’m afraid to lose him ) 

I am no longer dating and he knows this, but he did mention how he is talking to his ex now

Idk it just like caught me off guard because I didn’t even remember that and it made me wonder if there’s more there.

I’m just wondering, from a guys perspective, what is up here? Am I just being overly optimistic thinking he could have feelings for me? We say “I love you” but it’s not like romantic, and will talk on the phone or FaceTime for hours but again, not in a romantic context.

49,r2dsiv,1637897490,Do I still have a chance?,"I (21M) had a crush on this girl (21F) for about 2 months. I met her at a party and slid into her dms and asked for her snap and she gave it to me. However, after I got her snap, I found out from a mutual friend that she had a boyfriend so I texted her infrequently just to get to know her better and talked to her at parties, but did not flirt with her. After a month of knowing her, I found out that she broke up with her boyfriend so I began to text her more frequently and flirted with her a little bit. For example, I asked her what she was gonna be for Halloween and she told me and I said that it was a boring costume for someone so interesting and she saved it in Snapchat. I was at a Halloween party with her and I flirted with her and put my arm around her and she flirted back with me because she put her hand on my chest for a few seconds, was comfortable with my contact, and shared a drink with me. Many Redditors agreed that she was flirting with me. 

I decided to ask her to dinner as friends because she just got out of a relationship and didn’t want to rush anything and make her feel uncomfortable. She said she’d get dinner with me, but added that she’s not looking for a relationship right now. I said that I understood and we’d get dinner as friends and she agreed, but the day before the dinner, she texted me and said that getting dinner together was a bad idea because we have different expectations and that we don’t get along that well. After she rejected me, I cut contact with her for two weeks except saying hi in passing. 

Then at my friend’s birthday party, I talked to her and had a casual conversation with her for 5 minutes and planned not to talk to her for the rest of the night. However, when I walked out of a room, she was standing nearby and walked up to me and started playing with my hat for not reason and I asked her why she was doing it and she said why wouldn’t I be playing with your hat. During this conversation, her face was really close to mine and we were making deep eye contact. My drunk ass really wanted to kiss her, but I decided to go for a hug and we hugged for a good 10 seconds. Then, I came to my senses and realized I should be moving on and walked away. Problem is that I’m finding it really hard to move on. 

Was she just using me for attention or just looking for a hookup and got scared off by my feelings? Is she attracted to me or is she only flirty because she’s drunk? Why did she say that we don’t get along that well, but flirted with me and initiated touch and conversation? How do I get over her? Sorry for ranting, but I just wanted to get it off my chest. Also, I understand people might see me as the bad guy for going after a girl who just got out of a breakup, but I would rather get rejected immediately than wait around for her so that I can move on.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r2dsiv/do_i_still_have_a_chance/

57,r2eyvt,1637901602,Don't use self-improvement as a means to avoiding dating. I chased after it as much as I could and it didn't work out.,"Long-winded post. tl;dr at bottom. 

I remember as a kid being terrified of courtship. I was pretty skinny and nerdy, so I never thought someone could be attracted to me. Thus, my school years went by and I watched all my friends dating and approaching girls so easily. And it blew me away how they could do it like it was nothing. It was like this strange art that I couldn't understand. Because in my mind, I would need to become good-looking, rich, smart, and popular and then at that point would I be worthy to ask someone on a date. 

When I graduated high school, I became sick of the life I was living and I decided to chase after that perfectionistic mentality. And I feel like I got as close as I could:

Right after I graduated, I left the USA to volunteer in Africa with some service organizations for a few years. This seems crazy, but it was a pretty solid program that I really enjoyed. I won't dive into too much detail, but I was supervised and trained by locals in the culture and dialects right from the start which really got me out of my comfort zone and fluent in Portuguese. 

When I came back, I started university and did really well in my undergrad and did a double major in mathematics and neuroscience. I also gained 50 pounds from dieting and training boxing/jiu jitsu.

At this point, I knew I looked a lot different from when I was a skinny/nerdy high school kid and I started getting attention from other women. I would go on dates here and there, but I would flake out or avoid any kind of intimacy, because in my mind I was still some weird looking kid that still had a long way to go before he was worthy to court any women. So I kept intimacy on the back burner of my life. 

The next few years I got together with a computer science buddy  and we created a small tech project that flourished into a solid business model. We made some great money before I sold off my ownership and went my own path. Now I am 25 years old and I am currently pursuing a PhD at a really good program. 

This probably sounds super far-fetched and I don't blame anyone for not believing this stuff. But getting to where I am now makes me think about myself as a young kid who was dreaming about the day that they would achieve all of that stuff and then finally be worthy of intimacy and dating. 

I will say that I feel like I have gotten as close as I could to my childhood dream at this point, but going on dates still terrifies me. It's something I still avoid in many ways even when girls ask me out. When I do go on a date, I am just a nervous and insecure wreck. All confidence and belief in myself just vanishes. Sure, I could live in a foreign country and learn their dialects, build a tech business from the ground, become in top shape, etc. But dating? In my mind, no way. 

Just the past few dates I did go on with different girls all ended the same: I can tell she seems interested at the start, but after a while of me being so stiff and uncomfortable around her she is forced to move on. It's kind of like a self-fulfilling prophecy at this point for me. 

So I'm sharing this not to get sympathy, because I am currently working on overcoming these issues with professional help. But I've become really surprised at how much my mindset plays a role in making or breaking dating. It takes me back to the friends I had in high school who could build relationships with confidence. They were far from perfect people, but the fact that they were bold, respectful, and outgoing really showed that they didn't need to be perfect to be worthy of dating. It just wasn't that big of a deal to them in the first place and because of it their relationships flourished. 

On my end, I went as far as I could with self-improvement, but it was a tool of avoidance for a much simpler problem to tackle. So don't make the same mistake I did. It took me a long time to realize that I was going in the wrong direction with my view on relationships. 

Maybe I am making a big deal out of it than it needs to be, but I see so many people that are far from perfect in awesome relationships. So I hope you all can learn a bit from me and go easy on yourselves.

62,r2fktu,1637903773,I got ghosted,"I (20/F) met a guy (22/M)  on tinder and we talked for a month and saw each other about 4 times. We lived about 2 hours away from each other so we didn’t see each other often but we were texting 24/7 and FaceTiming here and there. I thought he was really into me, he cooked for me, he would tell me stuff like “I was an angel” and that “I made him feel calm”, etc. The last time we talked I FaceTimed him while I was at a party, everything was fine. He confessed that he had a crush on me that night and then later on one of my friends came to me super drunk trying to talk to him on FaceTime and I hung up abruptly just because I was scared she was gonna say something stupid. There’s no excuse for why I hung up so suddenly even if I was drunk, but I did text him that I was sorry right after and he said “it’s fine no worries, have fun at the party”. I texted him the next morning when I was sober and apologized again, I got no response. I texted him again later that day apologizing again for hanging up and asked if I had done something wrong so we could talk about it or that if he just didn’t want to talk to let me know and I’d totally understand. No response. I haven’t texted him since then but I was feeling super hurt and lied to so I removed him off my socials after 2 days of silence. Now it’s been almost a week and as the days go by I can’t help but to feel super confused. I want to reach out again but I’m not sure if it is even worth it.

Despite long term trauma therapy and medication, I feel bad that I don’t actually want to be in a long term relationship. I like dating, casually. Mostly free months up to a year but after that I start losing interest. Not sure if it best I just have short term “flings” (I enjoy passionate intense romance, I just don’t enjoy the same person long term) to be true to my feelings or learn to overcome this feelings and find one person to be with. I know I can’t causally date forever, as we age it’s harder to date by default. I’m childfree, too, which may play a huge part in my desires. Looking for feedback and wisdom. Don’t want to come off like a jerks, just a self-aware mentally ill person looking to figure love life out. I don’t want to be lonely, I hate it. But I know the feeling of unconsciously sabotaging LTRs after they start getting serious is also taking a toll on my mental health and love life. I don’t lead women on, I am upfront that I don’t and can’t have kids and I don’t see why to marry.

64,r2fmul,1637903982,Is it normal to not be attracted to anyone unless I know them well?,"Honestly, I (22 M) have struggled my entire life with this. 

Ive never dated anyone (although ive gone on plenty of dates with the same people yet let them fizzle out each time for the same reason as the title), and I have to constantly remind myself that I should be/need to be dating. 

The problem is I *always* end up falling head over heels for someone who is a close friend first and foremost, and it really sucks. We get very close then I begin to feel real physical/romantic attraction to them rather than surface level noticing of someone I know may be my type. It’s very frustrating because I cultivate a healthy friendship with a girl for years at a time, and I become extremely distressed once it gets to the point that I realize I’m into them. 

At first, I felt like I was becoming a ~nice guy~ because I couldn’t understand why those feelings wouldn’t be reciprocated; although when I realized I may be behaving that way, I went to therapy to learn how to better deal with such unreciprocated feelings/other anxieties. Now, I know for sure that’s not the case as I was recently rejected by one of these friends and felt no overbearing stress because I knew that’s not what our friendship was. 

That leads me to the question…how do I like ~go on dates~ with the same mindsets others do? I mean I’ve been on quite a few dates this year but they’re like a chore and so boring because I don’t really *care* about them. How do people usually motivate themselves to date? If it’s just how I am and I will continue to fall for friends im well aware don’t think of me that way, how do I even do that? I can’t just always be feeling heartbreak over losing a close friend due to my own feelings. I mean it’s happened 3 times in a row now, and just feeling like I lose a close friend is hard enough, but it comes with added guilt of feeling like she deserves to have a close friend who doesnt end up wanted to be with her. And, of course, me feeling like there may be something about me or what I’m doing that prevents reciprocal feelings…",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r2fmul/is_it_normal_to_not_be_attracted_to_anyone_unless/

68,r2fwpo,1637904995,How can I ask my friends to support me?,"I'm a single woman in my late 20s. Dating/attracting interest has always been a real struggle for me, and sometimes it gets me down and feeling like an undesirable potato and also scared for my future as my friends start getting married and settling down. I'm following all the advice on paper - joined a social hobby group, on dating apps and following all the usual advice there, accepting every social invitation, trying to be proactive about talking to guys in general... but just not having any luck.

I don't like talking to friends about this too much (especially my coupled friends) because I know it's hard to support me through this; most of the time they don't really know what to say and I get like \*shrug emoji\* or some joke about how hard dating is before quickly changing the subject. I feel bad for bringing up how I feel since I don't want to dampen the mood.

I feel like I could really use some more support from my friends, but honestly, I don't know what I can reasonably ask of them since I know it's just a difficult situation. So, I guess my question is, if anyone else is in this situation, how do your friends support you? Or if you had a friend in this situation, what would you tell them/be willing to do for them? (Fwiw I do have a therapist, but her ability to help me is also limited and I don't spend many sessions talking about dating because I have a lot of other stuff to work on in therapy that I also don't share with my friends.)",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r2fwpo/how_can_i_ask_my_friends_to_support_me/

71,r2g2yn,1637905629,Been 8 years since anything serious.,"Currently I am a 29 year old male. I have had 2 serious relationships in my life so far. The first was when I was in highschool. She was later diagnosed with bipolar disorder. The second girl was in college. She had borderline personality disorder. After some soul searching following the end of the second relationship I decided I had a type. The type that likes to quickly flip from emotion to emotion. Something about it always got me in my feelings, perhaps like an addiction.

  This was bad for me, and I decided not to date seriously for a while. I did have a casual relationship with someone 3 years ago. She had depression. I have never had a relationship with anyone without a personality disorder. I want a healthy relationship. I want to find a lover, partner and friend. I am a romantic at heart, not that I am the best at showing it as I tend to follow rational and principles over my heart. I have tried a hookup. She was hot, it's just not for me.

  The world has changed. People in my dating range have matured. So reddit, I ask you what does a healthy relationship look like to you? I know people have different views on this, so please vote on comments below if you agree. Or comment what you would want. If you could let me know what age you are when you comment, I think that would help.

75,r2gkec,1637907341,Girl from Dating App,"So I've been watching tons of videos on this matter and came to this conclusion. Women are too picky. Men are too simps. 

Women are looking for a prince on a horse with financial stability while they post arse pictures on dating apps. Where men don't do jack sheet with their lives and choose to play video games all day without purpose. 

Do you have a dating app? Feels like you can just swipe through people and hope you get a good husband/wife from that. But we all know that both genders talk to at least 10 people on it lol dirty as hell.

Storytime:

I met this chick one time on a dating app, went out with her, and both had a great time. We exchanged numbers and socials. But all of the sudden she went ghost on me. I was being a little beach and freaked out about what went wrong in my head. But then it clicked. She mentioned in one of the conversations that she's too busy all the time, but when I asked with what, she just replied ""I'm just busy"" red flag? Prior to that we had long conversations that never stopped, we talked about anything really, we laughed, we talked serious and silly topics. Sometimes she would be online but chose to not reply. She mentioned multiple times that she lives alone with her dogs and cats and usually just watches TV on her free time. It almost felt like she just wanted attention from a dude whenever she was bored lol The last message I've sent her was, look it's getting too late, if you wanna hang out again, hit me up and we'll plan something out. She seen it but no response.

Then after a while I started working on myself and giving my hobbies more time instead of basically chasing. I posted my work on socials and got great responses from my friends. Then as it seemed she started posting pictures with random dudes in restaurants, which she never did. As a joke I liked one of the pictures and commented ""he must be a great father of yours"", which I got laughs from people. At this point I moved on, worked on my projects, and to my surprise started receiving texts from girls from high school that I used to know. And went with couple to hang out and actually enjoyed my time. Point is, when I stopped concentrating on people and putting them on a pedestal, others would start concentrating on me. Just because I found a purpose to be happy with myself. 

For the girl, I still have her as a friend on social. Why? I'm not sure. We haven't talked at all. I don't seek no ""revenge"" or interested in minding her business. But I see her looking at my stories and such, which she never did before, I was surprised. Do I want her to text again? Kind of. Just to know the reason, but actually don't mention it. But do I want to just move on? Yeah. I guess we'll see, it's all about the time.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r2gkec/girl_from_dating_app/

There’s a guy I’m fooling around with that goes to my college. He’s the first guy who’s caught my eye since my s/o passed. I’ve mentioned this to him before, he’s aware of my situation. Thing is, we claimed to be FWB at first, but the last time I went over to his apartment he asked me to be his girl (I got excited, I felt like I secured his heart as cheesy as that sounds) and then he instantly backed off. 

I felt so stupid and vulnerable and taken advantage of when he acted like he didn’t say a thing about being exclusive. He knows I like him. And I think he likes me too. We always have a good time together. I’m confused and dating is scarier than I remember. Maybe he’s scared too. 

Should I cut him off? Or pursue something because I actually feel something for this guy.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r2hxdh/widow_here_im_afraid_to_date_again/
94,r2i3l0,1637913285,Guy didn't want to take my virginity,"Recently I went on my frist date with this guy I met online, he was super charming and we hit it off. On our second date the time I spend with him was amazing as well, we kissed alot, but I got to know that he has slept with 25 women, had 4 serious relationships, the most recent one lasted 6 months (and he still has a picture of himself and his exgirlfriend up on Facebook). I didn't mind it, he was always open with questions I asked him. I also let him know even before I met him that I was a virgin and he was absolutely fine with it, he even said he could ""help"" with that. But once we had met in person we got to know know each other more. On the third date I said I did not mind losing it to him, even though he was gonna be leaving for another city soon, he was very keen said we should set a special date, insisted that I buy the condoms since it's a rite of passage, said he would be like a mentor to me as it has so much experience. But once that date came close (literally one day before) he said that he thinks that I'm going to regret it, and then went on to say he is also afraid that he might get attached,  then he said that condoms tend to always slip off his dick. I was left so freaking confused why he suddenly was backing down. I mean he is allowed to but I was just a little surprise for a guy who came off as super sexual and Kinky he did not want to have sex. So ended everything there, since he thought it would be for the best ""for now"" and he is sure that I'll find someone else that I would love to do this with.

95,r2i58g,1637913467,"Man doesn't offer himself to help with dishes, Red flag or not?",I have been seeing a guy for 2 months now and so far everything is going well. But last weekend we went for dinner at his sister's home and she's great and adores her brother. But something that bothered me is that he didn't bring her anything not even wine or dessert and after dinner I offered to help her with the cleaning but he didn't. And it's been bothering me. I think it's basic manners to offer help as a guest after dinner and bring them something.

96,r2ibjl,1637914151,Am I wrong for saying no in this situation?,"I (22) have been seeing this girl (21) for less than a month. We have only been on three dates because we started seeing each other just before the final exams. Today I was supposed to pick her up from her house and come to my place where we would hang out. About 30 mins ago she texted me asking if I can give her and her dad a ride from the city to their house, and then wait for her to get dressed and we go to my place. Bare in mind that they can take the train/bus back home which would take ~30mins, and that she had told me they can take the bus if I can’t pick them up.
I politely said I can’t, not because I didn’t want to meet her dad, not because I was too lazy to give them a ride (I mean I live at the city and I was going to go to her house to pick her and come back to my place). It’s just because I’ve never met her dad and I felt uncomfortable meeting him that way for the first time. So she told me they would take the bus but in a way that shows she is upset. 

So am I wrong for saying no to her request?

97,r2icvl,1637914307,Redditors: what are your biggest annoyances with dating apps / sites?,"For me, my personal pet peeves with dating apps are:

1. Bots and fake users
2. Extortionate prices (£30/$40 per month is basically price of a gym membership!)
3. Having to pay to see who likes me
4. Not understanding why I'm not getting enough interest
5. Bugs on the apps
6. Seeing too many low-quality profiles (cliches, group shot as main photo, etc.)

98,r2id0t,1637914323,"Straight guys, how many of you have ever gotten so excited that you were a little too aggressive in bed?","This has happened to me more than a few times. The guy will be perfectly nice, but then in bed he gets overly aggressive.

Sometimes it is clear to me that he’s watching too much porn (such as if he spanks me without asking, or chokes me) and I immediately dump this kind of guy.

But some men get so aggressive that they are pinching or sucking my nipples too hard or are just generally too rough. When I ask them about it, they will say they just got too excited and will apologize and try better the next time.

Recently, a man who is genuinely respectful of me and doesn’t hurt me pushed my head down his dick so much that I gagged and even when I pulled away, he kept doing it.

I felt so upset by this that I plan to talk to him about it, but a male friend suggested that he might have just gotten really excited. That doesn’t make it okay to do without my consent, of course, but I’m wondering how many men actually do have these terrible mistakes and get overly aggressive.

This guy has said sorry when I say “ouch” and always asks what I need to feel satisfied in bed. He is generally very considerate, so gagging me with his dick really threw me off and I’m feeling pretty sad about it.

For context, many men tell me they see me as beautiful or even out of their league. Handsome, desirable men often have shaky hands when getting me a drink or ordering food. I’ve never been dumped into ghosted. I’m always the one to break up with them.

So maybe it is possible that he just got way too excited? We’ve dated almost a month and there is a level of comfort. Still doesn’t make it okay that he didn’t check if I was okay with it… and we will be talking about it…. But I’m wondering how common this is.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r2id0t/straight_guys_how_many_of_you_have_ever_gotten_so/
