I'm a 23 Male. I matched with, let's call her R, ok Bumble and slid into her DMs cause I honestly thought she was gorgeous and interesting and didn't want to lose out on the match expiring. We've been talking consistently all week except when we're busy at work or asleep. 

We planned to go on a date tonight after she hangs out with her girlfriends for a birthday. She seemed really excited to hangout and go to dinner. I told her that I'd pick her and asked for a time and place which she said yes to. That was a 3 hours ago.

I'm just having a sense of panic. I totally get that right now her friends are the priority, not a guy she met online. I sent another text about 1.5 hours ago, reminding her. 

I have gotten anything since and want to give her a call but feel like it would feel desperate.

We started talking, he flirted, I flirted back, we exchanged numbers and have been talking since. (He lives in another state.) He mentioned he was visiting home (where I am) and wanted to take me on a date. Then told me that back in highschool, he had a huge crush on me, but now, he can‚Äôt believe how beautiful I am now.

Wednesday he came back here for family and Mother‚Äôs Day and possibly go to school here soon. However, we exchanged a few messages on his trip to here, letting me know he was really excited to take me to dinner, and also see his family, his phone died, then he msged his arrival, and I responded.

Then yesterday he texted hi, I responded, and nothing, didn‚Äôt even open my message till I sent good morning today.

Ugh!!! I fucking hate this shit. I was dating a man I REALLYYY liked. He made me feel something I haven't felt in a while and when he kissed me I would melt and I've never felt that before.

A few days after our first date I got upset with him when he wouldn't be honest about his past FWB even when i asked him straight up. He basically made me feel like I was dumb for assuming the woman who was trash tweeting about him was the one he was talking about when he told me he ended the FWB thing because he was ""tired of the drama"".

He came back a few days after me leaving him alone saying he missed me and had a long talk about it all. I asked him if they would ever be FWB again since it was a ""on again, off again"" thing and he said no. Ok, cool. Resumed dating.

Tonight I just feel like that mess isn't over. 2 days ago he expressed he was in a depressive mood and so I gave him space. We didn't speak for the entire day yesterday but I made sure to ask him how he's feeling last night at 9. He didn't reply for the entire day today and I'm cool with it because, hey, focus on your mental, take your time. But imagine my surprise and hurt when I log onto twitter tonight and see he's tweeting and interacting with that same FWB tweets but couldn't even bother to say ""yh"" or ""nope"" to my text.

I practice not taking things personally and letting things flow but wow is this bothering me. I know I'm not the problem here and everyone has their someone so maybe he isn't mine but wtf bro, I liked this man. Now I'm gonna have to deal with him running through my mind for the next 3 days because that ex FWB of his can be so messy and I hate drama so I'd rather remove myself.

15,n84eg6,1620527300,(24M) How do I apply an abundance mentality towards women I feel a genuine deeper connection with?,"So I'm a 24 year old guy and I believe fully in the idea of developing an abundance mentality, so I'm always actively talking to lots of women. I've found that this helps me from getting too invested too early, putting all my eggs in one basket, and from having outcome dependence.

However, in my experience it's not often that I feel a genuine connection with a woman. So while this definitely helps with talking to women in a general casual sense, I'm at a loss as to how to apply an abundance mentality to women I've actually made a connection with. As while I certainly have an abundance of women to talk to/flirt with/go out with/FWBs, I don't have an abundance of women I actually click with in a deeper sense; so when I do meet a woman I click with, I feel those ""scarcity mindset/oneitis"" type feelings start to creep in.

I didn‚Äôt even get my first kiss until i was 17. I‚Äôm not religious/cultural &amp; I‚Äôm definitely NOT waiting till marriage, but I do want to wait till I find someone special. It doesn‚Äôt have to be years, I feel like after a few months i‚Äôd know if i was ready or not. 

For my background I have dated one guy on &amp; off for 5 years (age 19-24) but a lot of it was long distance &amp; we dated other people while we were in our ‚Äúoff‚Äù phases. He‚Äôs just the only one that i‚Äôve actually cared for. We almost decided to have sex before ending it but decided not to since we both knew things were gonna end, tho we couldn‚Äôt say that out loud. 

Anywayyy.. that ended 3 semesters before i graduated college so I decided to just focus on school as i was an engineering major &amp; worked full time so i really didn‚Äôt have time to be dating actively anyway. I just talked to guys here &amp; there. I‚Äôve had a very crazy life &amp; it‚Äôs only recently calmed down so dating was just not my priority. 

So I graduated Dec 2020 &amp; took some time settling into my career &amp; new apt. Now i‚Äôm ready to date but am stressing out over the fact that i‚Äôm a virgin &amp; don‚Äôt know how that‚Äôs going to work. When i was younger &amp; dated &amp; guys found out i was a virgin I usually would either get ghosted or they‚Äôd fade out. idk if that was just cause they were younger too &amp; were just looking for sex. Or if most guys really just don‚Äôt want to take that on. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that big of a deal but I get really nervous about it and it usually stops me from joining a dating app. 

I‚Äôm a pretty attractive person so whenever i tell people i still have my V card they‚Äôre always shocked so it just makes me more nervous. 

TLDR:::: my life has been crazy &amp; i graduated from college &amp; suddenly realized i was a 26 yr old virgin trying to date..

32,n85tsk,1620532447,"Why is it okay to talk about the fact that Asian/Indian men are disadvantaged in dating, but if you bring up the fact that it is primarily because most women only want white men, that is offensive?","Dating is a zero sum game. There are a finite number of men and women in each city or area. In most places there are more single men than more single women because there are more men in general and also many women end up sharing the same guys. This is not my opinion but simple fact.

It is also a fact that there is a dating hierarchy for men which goes:

1) White men at the top

2) Hispanic men second (no surprise, they are half white)

3) Black men third

4) Asian/Indian guys last

This is not a hierarchy created by magic, Hollywood, or out of thin air. It is a hierarchy created by women and their dating preferences/requirements.

I have noticed it is no longer taboo or controversial to talk about the fact that if you are an average straight Asian/Indian guy you will likely have a very poor time dating.

Yet if you bring up the fact that this happens because most women are so fixated on dating only white men, that is still taboo to discuss.

How does that make sense? If there are finite number of men and women and most women want to date one race of men (white), then by definition, that is what creates the disadvantage for another race of men.

It's also interesting to note that men don't have apply the same racial hierarchies for women. In dating studies, white, Asian, and Hispanic women do equally well. Only black women do worse, and they still do better than even the whitest men. So it's not an ""everyone does it"" thing. It's specifically women's behavior.

Will this ever be okay to talk about? Or are we supposed to pretend it's not the reality forever? Is the problem that we might offend a woman to point out the truth and that in itself is taboo? 

I don't see anyone having a problem pointing out men's issues in dating. If a man does or says something offensive and someone posts about it they are guaranteed thousands of upvotes. Yet if you talk about anything negative women are doing, you will likely just get banned.

Can we acknowledge women's role in creating this system or not?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n85tsk/why_is_it_okay_to_talk_about_the_fact_that/

I go to school and she texts me ‚Äúare u here?‚Äù I say yes and she says ‚Äúwhere?‚Äù I say near the PE area. She comes over here and we sit down and talk. I start my move by giving her this little white blossom and handing it to her, she gives me one back. We talk until I go in for my class.. after class she comes back because she needed lead for her pencil and I said I don‚Äôt have any but she still came and yea so we talked and all.. we walked around the hallways till the next bell rang. We hugged (hugged when we said bye before gym class) and parted ways since I am unscheduled. I leave feeling so shocked honestly. I‚Äôm really bad at signs but she really wanted to talk to me. I go home and honestly I‚Äôll put it very bluntly. I doubt myself so much, especially in relationship stuff. I‚Äôve learned to not do it anymore but this is the first time I‚Äôve actually began to feel like I love a girl in a while (last was really uhm.. it really fucked me up for no reason super weird).

This is how it was about a year or so ago but it also feels a bit more different.

39,n86vxd,1620535994,Dating in Pandemic,"We have a total lockdown in our city and situation is not improving. There are no chances of going out on a date for the next couple of months or so. Hence I meet new people through online dating. I am decent in banter and I get them off from dating apps quickly onto messengers. Now here lies my confusion: How should I approach the conversations given the possibility of a date is not immediate?  


When women give their numbers, I observe they have a high interest in going out on a date. They invest in the conversations. I have also observed from the past, **too much investment** on texting or calling on phone without the possibility to see each other, leads to familiarity and hence the interest going down from the other side. Hence now I invest my time in myself, building new skills etc. I am not as available as I used to earlier. Now I find, my availability have also been complained about and thus leading to rejection. How should I balance this? Meaning how much time should I invest in someone over phone, given the possibility of seeing each other are zero for the near future? Too much investment on phone leads to familiarity or offers of friendship being thrown at me; and being not too available(the process is usually a good talk once a week and just one small banter thrown in between) leads to complaints.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n86vxd/dating_in_pandemic/

I'm planning on trying to talk to her and hopefully build a relationship with her this summer, although I don't exactly know how I'm going to do that.

My plan as of right now is to dm her and claim someone told me she lives in my neighborhood, and use that as an excuse to ask her to hang out sometime and go from there. While I'm not completely confident this would work, I feel it is my best shot at getting to see her in person this summer, and would like to hear your thoughts and feedback on this plan. I'm open to other suggestions as to how I should get the ball rolling, and am really hoping things will work out this summer.

(Just another note, it'll likely be a few weeks before I actually put my plan into action. I'm currently in the middle of my lacrosse season, and have very little time to try and date someone right now, so I will be waiting for 3-4 weeks when my season ends so I have plenty of time to talk to her and spend time with her.)",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n86yo4/i_m16_like_this_girl_f16_who_goes_to_my_school/

I've been seeing a guy for a couple of times a month for the last year and a half. We've never dated officially, every time I expressed I wanted more, he said he wasn't ready for a relationship (we met a week after his break up after 6y relationship). I tried dating different ppl, sometimes for a couple of dates, sometimes for a month, but I always ended up spending time with the guy, we called each other from time to time, we can talk for hours and we like spending time together. For a year we also slept together, but since September, when I said I wanted more and he refused, we stopped. I decided to respect his space. I didn't want to lose what we have, but I forbid myself to write or call him and we only talked when he contacted me. Last week we hung out and he stayed at my place until 2am and when I didn't want him to go home, he told me he started dating someone and they are in a relationship. I would normally let him leave, but this is a fourth guy in my life, who told me I'm great and loves spending time with me, but couldn't be with me and then just got in a serious relationship with someone else and stayed with them for years. I understand that that's completely natural in a dating world. Im just slowly stopping believing, that the problem is not me. We talked for two hours with the last guy and he was telling me how much he wants to stay in contact and the only reason we're not together is the timing/concept of our meeting. I don't want to do something I will regret later, but he wrote to me 3times since that evening and I can't bear to even reply to him. I had to block my last ex because it was too painful for me and I guess I'll have to do the same thing here, sometimes time is the only thing that helps. I know it's important to keep trying and looking, I just feel like I can't do this again, because it's gonna be the same shit all over again, if I don't change something. And I don't know what to change and I sometimes I feel like there's something really off with me and noone's telling me. Was I supposed to push him more? Was I supposed to cut him off sooner? I know I can't do anything about how people see and feel about me, what exactly do I have power over tho? I exercise and run, I'm in therapy, I'm in school and I work, I love my friends and I think I could make all the guys I loved laugh. I guess there's nothing else to do than keep going, I'm just tired of feeling like someone's clown for a good time and never being seen as someone's choice.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n8ab0v/its_me_not_you/

66,n8acsg,1620550755,A co-worker (25F) who rejected me continues to message me (27M) and I'm not sure how to move forward,"I (27M) went on a few dates with a female co-worker (25F) a couple of months ago. 

The dates went well, but because of our situation at work (there is a policy against people in the same team dating), she decided that she wasn‚Äôt prepared to take the risk of our co-workers finding out about us and that she only wants a relationship that she can be fully open about. Although I would have been prepared to keep it on the downlow, since I am looking to change jobs over the next few months (she doesn‚Äôt know this), I respected her decision.

After this, we agreed that a lot of the things we were doing (such as the flirting, messages of a particular nature, going for our lunch breaks together) would stop, but otherwise we would stay friendly.

For the first few weeks, this all worked well. We would have the odd message exchange outside of work, but it never went beyond the sort of messages you would send as friends. 

This has all changed over the past couple of weeks, though. She has started messaging me several times a day, before and after work (almost always initiated by her). She is sending me selfies. Her messages contain things like ‚Äúmiss you‚Äù and ‚Äúyou‚Äôre amazing‚Äù. She is constantly asking me what I‚Äôm doing, and she left me a drunk voice message last weekend in which she said I was the type of person she could see herself marrying. She also says I‚Äôm often the last person she speaks to at night. Beyond that, there is nothing particularly flirty about her messages, but the sheer volume of them is at a level I would only really expect of a woman I was actually seeing or in a relationship with.

The situation has left me struggling with how best to move forward. I still have the feelings for her that I did while we were dating, and I‚Äôm fairly certain from the way she‚Äôs messaging me that she still likes me too. However, I am also wary of the fact that it was her who made the decision not to take things further, and I feel like if she has had a change of heart, then she has to tell me that. I just have that nagging doubt that if I try to pursue things again, we will end up in the same situation a few weeks down the line where she says that she doesn‚Äôt want to risk it because of work, and all I‚Äôll be doing is setting myself up for more hurt. Another part of me wants to move on completely, but if I freeze her out and stop talking to her, it‚Äôs likely to cause problems at the office.

Maybe something really bad happened, maybe I'll get a text later on saying that he was hit by a car or something like that on the way to meet me and then I'm the asshole. But I'm smart enough to know that chances are more people get stood up than get hit by cars. 

I feel like shit. And i feel like an idiot. I feel stupid for letting myself get excited, I feel stupid for already liking him a little, I feel stupid for imagining what it'll be like to go on a date.

And I feel especially bad since this was going to basically be my first ever date. And the first time ever meeting someone is the time i get stood up. So right now (an hour later) I feel like I should just give up on the whole dating thing because clearly it's a waste of time and no one gives a shit. I know ill feel differently later on when I've calmed down but right now I feel pretty melodramatic. 


If you're going to meet someone and something comes up or you're running late, fucking tell them. If you wake up and suddenly decide for whatever reason that you don't want to meet that person, *fucking tell them*. The little bit of awkwardness you'll feel when politely telling them that you'd like to cancel is nothing compared to how shitty and embarrassed they'll feel when you just decide to not turn up. Dont stand people up. I dont care what you think they did wrong, I don't care how into you you think they are.

72,n8ca9f,1620559467,My partner won't let me post selfies online,"Over the past few weeks, my partner has expressed concerns over me posting pictures of myself on Twitter, but not on Instagram or Snapchat, because my Twitter account is public (though it only has around 300 followers). Every time I post a picture on there, my partner tells me to take it down because my partner is ""uncomfortable"". One day, after a fit of frustration following me posting a picture, my partner said, ""Just do whatever you want."" Keep in mind, just a few days ago my partner told me to post a picture to my Snapchat story (which, albeit, is private) to show everyone how much more attractive I've gotten.

Yesterday, I posted a picture of myself on my Twitter for my birthday. My partner saw yesterday's picture and got enraged, saying that I don't respect the fact that posting these pictures hurts them and makes them extremely uncomfortable. I then responded by saying posting pictures of MYSELF is my choice and a reflection of my autonomy. My partner replied by asking how could I not give up this one thing because it's hurting them. I brought up the fact that this comes off as controlling. My partner agreed, but attempted to justify it by saying it's the one thing in our relationship that is controlling. 

I've tried to compromise by telling my partner that I'll keep my Twitter private for as long as the pictures are up (they're never up for longer than 24h anyway). My partner simply replied that I can't ""force"" them to make a compromise because they've made too many compromises in the past (my partner used to attempt to control where I went and what I wore, until I told them it made me uncomfortable and then they stopped and are now referring to this as a compromise). 

Finally, my partner brought up the fact that I'm controlling in the way that I don't want them to speak to their ex (who they cheated on me with and are still in love with) so we can focus on healing our relationship and so that they don't fall in love deeper with their ex. My partner said if they could give up talking to their ex, then I could give up this one thing for the sake of our relationship.

81,n8dvyi,1620565612,My worst partner ever,"So this story is a little long. Before COVID-19 i had a crush on a guy. We would briefly talk before and after class. Just for a minute or two. One day he said we should do something together and I was really excited. We got each others phone numbers and texted a little. One day he just stopped replying however he wold bring up things in person that I would text. We went our separate ways and I didn‚Äôt see or hear from him in about 6 months however I was not able to get him off my mind so I asked him out. That didn‚Äôt go well at all as he told me I barely knew him and all I knew was his name. So a big no. I felt hurt for a do and moved on with my life. About another 6 months pass and he texted me and apologized for how rude he was rejecting me. He also asked me out for coffee, I was thinking what was the worst that can happen, we had coffee and it was fun. He was cool. After we schedule another date. The day of that came and he left me standing in the park, he thought it was the next day so we rescheduled. The second one went amazing and we kissed and left it on we want to see each other again so we made plans for in two weeks. A few days before I checked in we were still good to go. The the day of the date came and about an hour before he told me that he had a family emergency and rescheduled for the next day. The next day about an hour before he told me he had a doctors appointment and rescheduled for two weeks and told me he couldn‚Äôt do it sooner because he was studying for finals. The day of the date came and I had moved my schedule and turned down a sift at work to go on it. But he wrote me about two hours before and told me it wasn‚Äôt going to work out because we were both to busy. I was shocked to say the least as the day before we said we were both looking forward to this. I told him if he wants me to wait that is fine. He said that we can keep checking in but for now he doesn‚Äôt think it can. I wish just then and there he would have said it can‚Äôt work instead of wrapping it up in business. Now I understand I am busy, I run a Business full time and work a part time job well having an internship. But at date two I am not going to change my entire schedule for someone. So a few weeks go by and I can‚Äôt get over this person. I still think that there are feelings left for him. So I wrote him and said I was sorry for how busy I was and that if he would like to do something again to let me know and that if this is over that is fine. At this point I just wanted a straight answer, nothing wrapped up in other reasons because my mind will spiral then. He wrote me and just said, I understand. I asked again if he wanted to do something, no reply. Another week passed and I wrote again saying that I would like to know if he wants me to wait or if this is over. Deep done I had know it was over since he cancel the second time but I just wanted a straight answer. And boy did I get one. He told me that he tried to be as nice as possible to protect both of our feelings but I didn‚Äôt get the hint. And that to please stop texting me and good by.

(I don't know if this matters but I speak Japanese, he doesn't speak English.) We went back to my apartment and watched a movie. We made out a little, ordered late night Dominos pizza and he slept over. He asked me about my previous relationship, and he told me his. Found out he was cheated on in his last relationship back in high school. Felt like he was trying to be open with me. He then hung out at my place until noon the next day and I made pancakes for us. We had a chill morning.

When he left I figured maybe this was just a one time thing, until he messaged me asking to go to karaoke together. We ended up going to a cafe and then doing karaoke. We held hands out and about and we kissed in the karaoke booth. We even sang this really famous Japanese love song/duet together called Uchiage Hanabi Êâì‰∏äËä±ÁÅ´ (great song btw lol). Didn't feel like a fling. 

We set up another date to watch a drama at my place and when we met up at the station, he took my hand and even did the whole thing where he walked on my left side so he was walking on the side where cars drive by. We watched a bit of the drama, I made us tacos, and things seemed great. He stayed over again and we ended up having sex early in the morning. TMI: I was a virgin (by choice üôÉ) and it was good (surprisingly no pain) and he stayed again until around noon the next day. 

My birthday was coming up the next weekend and he was all ""we should do something special"" and I we were planning on going out to a cafe or something. He then found out he got requested for work (his job wasn't the typical Mon-Fri 9-5 job) so we could figure something out as like a belated birthday. 

My birthday came around and he texted me Happy Birthday and then the next day or so - radio silence. We use the LINE app here so I didn't know if he blocked me or just hadn't read the message so I checked Instagram and it no longer showed him following me nor me following him and his account was now privated. 

I messaged him and he gave me a really BS apology saying he found someone else but really enjoyed our time together, etc. Does this sound like ""bad timing"" (ie me being the second lead - if this were a K-Drama lol) or did I miss a warning sign? 

I had tagged him in one post from when we went out to eat at the cafe and I just wonder if he is a sleaze who had a girl and just wanted to get with a foreigner and she happened to find out about it or something...

94,n8f9xr,1620570380,What does it mean when the person you're dating asks to post you on their social media," Ive been dating this guy for 2 months...things have been going well. We haven't had the ""what are we talk"" yet, but we went on a mini vacation this week and during we rode bikes in the hills He asked if he could post a video he took of me to his instagram page. He rarely posts on his instagram and even more rare to post on his page itself (he isn't that big of a social media guy). Is he making it official?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n8f9xr/what_does_it_mean_when_the_person_youre_dating/
95,n8fccj,1620570592,Is it ok to block my ex out of nowhere after getting back in contact?,"Long story short I'm getting to know someone new that I kind of like, so I just blocked my ex on whatsapp because I want to really move on. Previous to this, we where in NC for almost 6 months, and about 3 months ago he contacted me again. We kept in contact talking about silly things here and there, but nothing major. 

I felt like I was clinging to him breaking NC as a sign of us getting back together, but I asked him to hang out two weeks ago, said he was busy and never contacted me again, so I think that's not a possibility.

Besides, this new guy is very sweet and I feel I need to get rid of my ex forever if I want to be happy with this guy as long as we stay together. 

I can't help but feel guilty anyway. I didn't tell my ex anything, but I feel like I'm doing something wrong.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n8fccj/is_it_ok_to_block_my_ex_out_of_nowhere_after/
96,n8ff0m,1620570828,I'm (23F) wondering about dating a friend (26M),"I've always heard hitting on or dating a friend is pretty much a cardinal sin. What about exploring possibilities with not so close single friends? I don't want it to sound super utilitarian but it sounds like he sees dating/relationships similar to me.

I met him in uni back in 2019 when he had a girlfriend and we were friends. The when his relationship ended later that year I got a boyfriend. Recently, we had a call to catch up after sporadic texting for the last several months. I told him how i was seeing a guy for 4ish months and called it off. He asked the reasons why and how I was feeling about it. When talking about dating in general it seems we've both bad the same issues of dating people who don't fit our communication styles at all. 

The rest of the call was more lighthearted and we laughed a lot. Sort of left me wondering why we've never dated eachother.I know the reason is because we were both in relationships and then covid but no idea if this is an insane thought

97,n8ffb2,1620570853,How should i ask if i have feelings for my friend(?)(long story),"Hello, i recently started to feelings for my friend, first of all, i even don‚Äôt know what to call this relationship or situation. I‚Äôve known him for about 4month now. And ,, started to sleep together for a month now, once a week on weekends.
as i‚Äôm living in a shared flat, i visit his place.
It started with drinkijg and conversation, it ended up on his bed.

And it‚Äôs still happening just yesterday.
We cooked dinner together, we watched movies together, conversation about future, dreams and so on.

(I‚Äôm not sure if you could understand what i‚Äôm sayingüò≠)

Then since last week, i started to wondering ‚Äúwhat are we? What am i doing?‚Äù

1 month could be very short, but i somehow like him, just the way he is.

I tried to push myself to not to put much feelings on this relationship and this person.
But now.. I‚Äôm kinda stuck. 

The thing is i‚Äôm leaving soon for 8 month from now on, to work in a remoted area.

Should i keep it as a secret or should i initiate by asking something to him..?

This is miserable and shi*ty as hell, i can‚Äôt stop crying. I‚Äôm old enough.. i‚Äôm not a child anymore:/
I really don‚Äôt like myself having feelings for him.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n8ffb2/how_should_i_ask_if_i_have_feelings_for_my/
