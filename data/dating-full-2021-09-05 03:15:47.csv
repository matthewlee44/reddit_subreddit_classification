Met a girl at my retail job about a year ago. Started talking to her and she started joining me on my breaks at work just about everyday we worked together. She immediately caught my interest as in my experience girls who are not interested do not go out of their way to talk to me or take breaks with me

Over the next 6 months i started to get to know her better in time we spent talking on our breaks. These talks would usually end up going 5-15 minutes over our scheduled break time once we got to know each other better. 

She started asking me more personal questions about my life, interests, and school. Alot more personal questions than ive ever had with any other co workers. She would ask about my family and follow up on the things I told her. 

She told me a lot about herself as well and always seemed excited to sit down and talk with me. She always wanted to know what I was up to on the weekends and told me she wanted to go to some museum once the pandemic was over. 

She even mensioned to me that she was single on valentines day and asked if i gad any plans. Then proceeded to randomly tell me that a few coworkers hit on her but she wasn’t interested. I changed the topic as i was un comfortable. 

 After about 6 months i finally got up the nerve to ask for her number. She gave it to me with no hesitation.  Texted her the next day and we texted back and forth about 6 times until i got distracted and didn’t get back to her until the next day. Texted her the next day and had to go to bed early and left the convo. 

The next day I texted her but got no response… thought i was ghosted but then texted her a day or two after and she texted back  I then asked her if she wanted to go out on a date to which she said she didn’t think she could because she had a brother with health issues and may me vulnerable to the pandemic. I thought this was her way of rejecting me. 

I told her i understood and I wouldn’t talk to her anymore. I understand how awkward it can be to be asked out and I didn’t want her to be un comfterbal. She said I didn’t need to do that as she really enjoyed our relationship. She told me to treat her the same and said a few other things that confirmed she understood I asked her out. 

Didn’t talk to her or hear from her until I saw her at work next. I tried to avoid her but that was impossible once she sat down with my on my break. We talked for an hour and the topic of that never came up. I didn’t know where I stood or how she felt about the whole thing. I decided i just needed to get over her

I texted her a few days later and asked her if it was ok if she could not talk to me at work because I needed to get over my feelings for her. I also told her I thought she was a cool person and was my friend, but I just needed some time but id like to remain friends. 

She told me that she was into someone else and I tried to convince her to shoot her shot because i thought we were just friends at this point. She agreed to being friends and I thought everything was fine until the next time i saw her she seemed very upset. 

It was not my intention to hurt her in any way, i just didn’t want her to feel uncomfterbal or anything like that. I texted her that afternoon and said it was ok if she wanted to talk to me at work again but i got no response

She seems to be aware and knows when people are hitting on her. She seemed used to it so idk why she wouldn’t just tell me she wasn’t interested. 

I went up and tried to apologize to her the next time i saw her but she wouldn’t even face me and said she just wanted to be vague. 

Today I was sitting in the break room alone minding my own business then she sat down across the room. My friend called me and after 30 seconds of talking to her on the phone, she gets up and hurries out of the break room. Just kinda weird.

TL;DR: met a girl and thought we clicked. Asked her out and she told me she couldnt at the time because of a vulnerable family member(before vaccines) and I assumed she was lying.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,989105,public,self,Did I perceive this as a rejection because of my insecurities?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pi5mt4/did_i_perceive_this_as_a_rejection_because_of_my/,all_ads,6,,

So constantly on social media from mainstream ones to ones like Reddit, I always see just hate thrown between men and women when it comes to dating. I often see men talking about how they can’t get a date, how women pass up good men to get used and abused by jerks, and that women use guys that they know like them for emotional support while only actually being attracted to bad guys.

On the female side, I see women talking about how guys use and abuse them, emotionally manipulate and gaslight them, and how pretty genuine awful most guys are. I also see a lot of girls talking about how low the bar is for men so they really have to settle for assholes because theirs no other option.

I see both of these sentiments common in even people up to their late 20s so I know it’s not just my age group.

I havent been with a woman for 3 years 40+ 

had to get over the ex (still not over her)

 then financial troubles (got into debt moving to the ex's town, couldnt find enough work. I will never follow my heart again. he is stupid. so couldnt date because you need money to date. you cant go on walks or eat ice cream every date. you need money to date.

&amp;#x200B;

the last 15 months with covid, I lost my career and had to work as a night security guard which broke me mentally/emotionally. I was also too embarassed to tell any woman I did this fora job. its like going from store manager to washing dishes. . its a hard mental blow.

&amp;#x200B;

now im chatting with a few women at once (never had an issue there) and one whos taken interest and that ive taken interest in. now im getting frozen feet

&amp;#x200B;

1 shes super tall. like 5'11' amazonian tall. and 2 she is 10 years younger. I almost always dated my age or older. and I never dated a tall woman. my friend told me he felt emasculated when he did. I hope Ill be ok, but I never have so cant know till its go time. 

&amp;#x200B;

more the issue is Im trying to pace myself with going out. it costs money and this month we have less work and I need to move so I cant be spending excessively.  


wanting so badly a relationship, but not being in it for a long time, it now scares me when its go time. I went on 2 dates but I had a lot of work (money)and I felt very confident. this month I will struggle. and yes you need money to date. the women want to go here and there and here and there costs money. thats fact. 

&amp;#x200B;

how do I tell her without telling her that I can only date once a week going out to restaurant or outing? I need to pace myself. I was in this situation where the women wanted to go out 2-3 times a week and my wallet got thin very quickly. I panicked and just broke things off because of this.  and once you start dating, you cant tell them youre going to pause everything because the wallet need to reheal. it just keeps going. 

she is free to meet often (her work gives her free time) and she knows that my career is going to be slower because this month there are many holidays so less work, so I cant tell her im super busy with work. im quite free. and especially in the beginning they want to be impressed. instead of whipping out my wallet, what if I juggle for them. would that be good enough entertainment for a date?

But sometimes not always. Sometimes that tiny inner voice inside us tells us we don't.

And we try to ignore it but its there in our subconscious &amp; its a quiet voice yet its causes huge consequences &amp; so much pain bc its what causes us to doubt ourselves &amp; let fear creep in &amp; then we end up ruining potential relationships.

I'd never received love the way I should have growing up. Coming from a broken home, as much as I wanted real love, I always ended up in abusive one-sided relationships. I could never understand why if people think I'm beautiful, why I couldn't feel it deep in myself? 

And why did I not believe I deserved love?....Bc my family never made me feel loved or worthy. They always made me feel like a mistake or an inconvenience. They also made me feel like I wasn't good enough bc they were ""fair skinned"" &amp; I was mixed with olive skin....my own relatives made me feel this way. 

It wasn't until recently after a v painful breakup, I just had enough of being used, mistreated, and lied to. I found a good therapist &amp; was determined to get to the bottom of my problems. While I'm nowhere near ""cured"" I have gotten to a place where I'm no longer attracted to men who mistreat me. I'm also no longer repelled by men who treat me right bc I'm not thinking he has some ulterior motive like it happened to me in the past. I don't feel as threatened by men &amp; guarded &amp; I don't know why I did before? Maybe my upbringing?

I went out with a guy recently &amp; he was real nice, a gentleman. He just did all these small things I never realized were important to me that say so much about how to be treated like a lady. We didn't end up dating but it set a blueprint for the kind of qualities I want (even more) in a partner.

1.  My first date was a couple weeks ago and I thought we hit it off over the messages.  We agreed on a time and place for a date, I confirmed with her about 45 minutes prior and she confirmed back.  Got there and no one showed up.  Sent a message at 15 minutes.  Silence.  Sent a message at 30 minutes.  Silence.  Was about to get up and leave at 45 and she sent a message saying, ""You're sweet ❤️ Nothing that you need to worry about.  Just dealing with some personal stuff right now, non of it related to dating.""  We talked some more after this and got the sense she was super self centered and I have no interest being with someone toxic like that.
2. Hit it off with another lady, conversation was really flowing and I was feeling good.  6 hours before the date she said she's looking to get together just as friends.  (Prior to this, everything was flowing with romantic interest).  Then right before I was about to respond, she sent another message saying that she wouldn't be able to make it any more because a family thing just came up.

We met in person, but I had to move across the country to my hometown because I have financial issues I need to work through.

We really hit it off. I've never liked anyone more than I like him. I'm even the one who asked to be in a relationship. When we talk, I feel seen and heard, and as if I've always known this person. He's very empathetic and intelligent, and I find him to be an inspiring influence in my life. This is a drastic difference from my previous relationships.

However, I have a lot of issues that I'm becoming increasingly aware of. I've been working on self awareness over the course of a year, but since meeting him it's like there's a spotlight on my brain. I see TONS of issues I have. 

These issues are: 1. Liking him so much, and being long distance, I feel much more clingy than I have with previous partners. Suddenly I'm back in 9th grade and pining for someone. This looks like high anxiety, being afraid when hours pass with out a text, going back and forth on the idea of giving gifts, second guessing everything I do. This has been the easiest to manage, and he and I have even discussed it. Once he reminded me that he really is interested in me, most of that worry left. When it does occasionally creep up, I remind myself that he already expressed his interest in me, and it subsides. 2. Realizing to what degree I've been allowing previous trauma to run my life, which I need to fix as my entire life is in shambles because of it. I have an estranged husband who I have not seen or communicated with in years, but I only filed for divorce last year and I'm in the middle of it. It took me so long to file because the thought of possibly having any interaction with my legal husband sends me into fight or flight, and anything bureaucratic stresses me out to the point that I avoid it entirely. On top of this I have an expired driver's license I'm working on renewing, but need my marriage certificate for it (husband kept that on purpose to continue his work towards a greencard), yet need a license to get the certificate. 3. I'm totally broke. I'm paying bills this week and might not eat. I do have a job, but it's awful. 

I told my bf I was divorced, because in my heart I am. But legally is a different story and I need to be honest about it. I need to be honest about all of this. And I think that I'm a giant walking red flag. He doesn't deserve to be in a relationship with someone who has so much to work on. He deserves to be with someone he can build life with who is capable of taking care of themselves, and I'm not there yet, even though I want to be.

I hold you in such high regard, you are so worthy of loyalty and respect.***

***When we got together all those months ago I remember thinking how did I get so lucky, how can someone accept me with all my mess and trauma. All my ideals about relationship and partnership had been shattered and I was doing my best to pull it all together thinking that I don’t want to miss out on this rare gem that I couldn’t believe existed and was keen on me. At the time I didn’t realise, but looking back I unintentionally created a place in my mind that I jammed all my deepest hurts and didn’t allow myself to keep chipping away at it all.***

***I think there were times I knew I was struggling but I was avoidant in fear of tearing open the wounds again. After going to the show last weekend and in a matter of 2 days having 3 stressful encounters + the river one the week before, it was all just too much and it ruptured something inside of me.. I went to church Sunday morning in search of some respite and ended up in tears down the front after the service and had old mate ben praying for my healing. I knew right there, but again tried to fight it. I need to overcome these trials in my life, and I need to do it alone. Its not fair that anyone should have to carry the weight of my trauma. I know I said that I wanted to be a team and that we can overcome things together, and believe me I meant all of those things! But as life goes on we learn, grow and change. I know that if I don’t confront myself in this part of my life ill drag this mess with me and anyone that I’m in contact with for years to come. I can’t and I won’t do that to you, I value you too much!***

***I appreciate every bit of joy you have brought into my life and if this is where it ends I will not look on this with a negative eye. This has been one of the most beautiful encounters a man could ever ask for!***

***I promise to give you whatever time or space you need.. and I will totally respect if this doesn’t sit right with you. But once things settle down a little I would like to meet somewhere to talk things over. I will continue to pray for you and for your future. I hope you can forgive me for what has happened and know that I will always care for you!''***

2 weeks later i didn't hear anything further from him and sent a desperation message stating i will wait for him etc. He replied with\*:\* ***we will meet up and talk soon when were both available (he was in the midst of moving). Another two weeks later he reached out and asked if i wanted to catch up for coffee within a month, week, or so whatever is good for me.***

I didn't reply so he sent another message stating '***if i dont hear from you, i will drop your stuff to your house'***

I replied and said ***'you can keep the stuff or donate it and i don't think catching up for coffee is a good idea but hope is well'.***

(This is the time where i saw that he's been liking all these girls bikini/sexy on instagram)

He replied with: ***I guess this is it for good then, i know you will achieve anything in front of you!***

I didn't reply. Nekk minute we are all in lockdown and 2 months after No Contact he reaches out and says"" ***I don't expect a reply but i just wanted to say i hope you are safe and hanging in there with such harsh restrictions***.

I reply and say ***i am safe and well and hope you are aswell***. I didn't get a response back.

As a man, what should I do about being below average looking and being around 5 feet tall? It used to bother me when I was a kid but it doesn’t as much anymore. I go online reading women’s comments on social media and they all discuss their turnoff about a short mans height.

I tried Online dating as well, I match with a girl, get along with them, they ask me for my height, I respond and the next day I’m blocked/deleted or “we should be just friends”.

I need some good advice, no hate for me believing what I believe, I will not push my ideology on you. (I don’t hate women btw)

I’m single and never had a girlfriend, but I had a few friends that were girls, they are honest with me and say if I was taller they’d be willing to date me, I’m lost and don’t know what to do.

I asked not that long ago to have a talk about what we are and what we want. I told how I feel and that I would like to be official. His response was he likes how it is now and he is not ready for anything more. 
I tried to find a solution/compromise but he didn't know. 
He asked me what changes I would like to see in the relationship (whatever we have). And I told being more consistent and being there for each other (sometimes he has been hot and cold). 
The response was he is not able to provide more than he has. And told me he feels pressured and need some space. Which I obviously gave and respect because the last thing I wanted is to do said thing.

I’ve had some one night stands from Tinder, but that’s it. I haven’t dated a lot but I’m working on that and in the past 2 years I’ve had two dates. 

The first, I went out with a girl from Tinder. We had two dates and though I was confident in a friendly respect, I was pretty shy when it came to more intimate things, so we never kissed. After the second date she said she just wanted to be friends. I was extremely upset by this and it took me months, nearly a year, to get over the rejection. This was despite the fact that we had only spoke/dated for 3-4 weeks max! 

A few weeks ago, I asked a girl from work out. We went on one date, kissed twice (but I could tell she wasn’t too into it), and the next day she texted me saying we should just be friends. It’s been just over a week since she said that, and I still feel really upset by it. It just makes me feel like I’m never right for anyone, and if someone does eventually like me, it’ll be because I had to settle after everyone else I was interested in rejected me. This seems weird to me because I only spoke to this girl for about 2 weeks before our date? So again, not even one month’s worth of investment. 

Im texting a girl from Bumble right now and she’s really attractive and nice, but I still keep wishing the girl from work would message me saying she changed her mind lol. 

How do I stop taking these rejections so hard? I keep thinking about how things could have been if the last girl had liked me, and feeling bad about it.

I suffer from GAD and have pretty bad abandonment issues. I literally freak out whenever my friends (whom I've known for years and know would never leave me) don't answer their phones. I'm in therapy (for this and other stuff) but it's a slow process.  


My issue is - my anxiety goes through the roof whenever someone is not answering my texts. And since I know that isn't normal, I wouldn't like to bother other people with it, so I really don't want advice such as ""well, tell them you need more communication"" because that would be asking another person to tend to my irrational fears.  
I'm currently in a casual ""relationship"" (casual things are not for people with anxiety, but I'm really enjoying it most of the time and don't want it to end), meaning we both are free to see other people. However, as much as I'm rationally okay with that, it seems that emotionally I'm not. Since whenever I don't hear from a guy I start imagining how he's with someone else and he likes her much better than me and he'll want to end thing with me and fade me (nice guys don't ghost, they fade lol) and I won't even get it, so I'll keep reaching out, losing my dignity in the process. Then I get a text such as ""busy day at work"" and I calm down lol.  


What I came here to ask is not advice on the relationship itself (I know a lot of people will tell me I'm ""obviously not okay with casual and need to leave"", I respect that opinion, but in the past I have often sabotaged very nice things out of irrational fears and no, I don't want to leave the relationship, I want to learn how to relax about relationships). The definition of a relationship doesn't change my anxiety - I've had the same problem with guys who were very committed to me and never gave me any reason to suspect something bad will happen. So the problem is - me.

My reaction was ""whoa that family must be insane! Like, can't we all just sit down calmly and eat a piece a cake?"". Perfectly innocent you're thinking. Wrong. Perfectly granny-like and unappealing. He made a comment about it revealing my inner boomer (I'm in my 30s) and joked that it wasn't sexy. 

The only problem is that it's true. Less than a month later he dumped me. I know he didn't dump me over the video, but he did say that it was (partly) because we couldn't have fun. It's absolutely true. I'm not a fun person. I don't have enthusiasm for life. I don't enjoy anything really. And no one wants to be with someone like that. It was an 18 month relationship (my first relationship) - he tried hard but he just couldn't put up with me any longer. 

In the past men have always dumped me after a few weeks citing that I'm ""a really nice person"". Now I realise it's code for ""you're so boring and not like normal girls"". Before anyone suggests that i change, i am who i am, i can't artificially manufacture a joy for life that doesn't exist. All i want is to be loved and this has really clarified that no man is going to put up with me. My heart is breaking.

One was planned and one was unexpected. The first date I met on a dating app. We met for drinks at a bar. He was very handsome in his pictures so I was a bit worried I was gonna get catfished. Luckily, I didn’t. He was very tall and I like tall guys and he could keep the conversation going. 

After a few hours, the date ended and when the bill came he suggested to split the bill. This was the first time I’ve had to split the bill on a first date. On the inside I was kind of shocked because it seems like the date was going well. I agreed even though I felt a little confused and then as we stood up to leave he hugs me and then leaves out. Not waiting for me and not walking me to my car. Maybe he didn’t offer because I was talking about my experience with creepy guys hitting on me at work. Or maybe he didn’t pay or walk me out because he wanted to come home with me and hook up. I can’t tell. And in no way am I entitled to not paying and I always offer to split initially. But the guys I’ve went on dates with in the past always insisted on paying. 

Anyways, as I’m walking out a guy sitting at the bar waves me down and starts complimenting me. He starts calling me beautiful and complimenting my outfit. I’m trying to leave but he keeps talking to me and the guy I was originally with is long gone. He starts asking me what my name is and where I’m from. Usually, I would brush it off and keep going but he seemed harmless.

I was feeling a bit weird after the first guy didn’t pay so when he offered to buy me a drink I said yes. We talked about school and work for about 30 minutes before the bar closed. He walked me to my car and we exchanged numbers. He’s from another state so I don’t think we’ll ever meet again but that encounter was really surprising. And I consider myself a bit of an introvert so the fact that I even went on 2 dates is out of character for me.

I saw this cute girl in one of my classes and her vibe or something attracted me, seems quiet like me. 1st day of school I thought to myself meh she probably is just some girl that I think is cute like other girls in my other classes but then I think about her specifically and now I feel like I should probably do something now but I have no idea what to do.

I really want to talk and get to know her but idk if I can because of seating arrangements because of Covid and I'm pretty sure I can't just sit next to her or else the teacher will just call me back to my seat even if there is free time, also I never see her outside the class nor lunch or I probably haven't payed attention.

I feel like there were many situations where she gave the impression that she was interested in me. Even though I wanted to ask her on a date, I either had a lot of work to do or couldn't meet her due to quarantine restrictions in my country. The last time I saw her during one of those meetings, we spend some time apart from the group and talked for some time when she told me she was going to study abroad for 6 months. We texted a little bit aber that about casual topics, inside jokes, etc. and then I asked her how her preparation was going and that I really enjoy spending time with her and that I want to meet her to grab some food before she departs (3 weeks later).

She replied with some issues she had in her preparation and how stressed she was because of that. Then she told me she would also like to meet me one last time ... and the other group members.

I immediately perceived it as a rejection that she does not want to go on a date with me but only wants to meet me in a group. My best friend (who doesn't know her) also advised me to simply move on and ignore her texts and being ""hurt"" I agreed with that. The next evening I met another friend and at some point we talked about women, dating, ... and also brought up this topic. In his opinion, she probably understood I was asking her out but didn't want to date me right now. Even though she didn't actually say 'yes', she didn't say 'no' either. So I thought about it for a while and changed my mind from ignoring her texts to offering some support and replied 2 days later. I just told her she shouldn't worry too much about these issues and things are going to be alright. I didn't bring up the date.

However, She didn't even open the chat for like 4 days and left me on read afterward.

I am a 26(M), and my Girl was 27(F).  We have known each other as students from our college. She was my senior, but we never were friends during those years. She is a beautiful girl, and I was interested in her during those years. 

We met after our college finished, and after persistently roaming around her, I asked her for a casual relationship(since we both were damaged through several relationships). 

We were exclusive, and over the period of two years, we started developing feelings towards each other.

The past few months have been hard for us. I moved out of the country, and she repeatedly said that we could see it through. However, I had my doubts as she wouldn’t have moved for at least another year.

She said that we should see other people, but I became a clingy man and always told her I want her but never really got into a relationship. I think I have relationship/commitment phobia.

I shared my feelings with a friend, and he pushed me to tell her. With a bit of a request, she said yes. However, after two days, I chickened out. She said she would not trust me again, but we kept in touch for a few months. 

Recently, she told me that she has moved on. She cherishes what we had, but now this is becoming toxic for her. The past few months have been eye-opening for me as well. I realized how fucked up a hypothesis I have on life.

I did beg her not to go away, but she has made her mind, and she is asked me for space. I went a little loony at times when she ignored me and told me that she is seeing someone else.
