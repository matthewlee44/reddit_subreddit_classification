0,qjgtt3,1635649734,Followed up with me 2 months after rejecting me,"About 2 months ago I (24m) went on a date with someone I met at work (27f) - we work for the same company but aren't direct coworkers. This was a perfect date if there ever was one but ended to my surprise in rejection (didn't see this coming given the quality of the date). She basically said she thought we shouldn't pursue anything romantic since we work together. We go our own ways.

Fast forward to present, I get a message from her out of the blue saying she felt she had been flippant in her rejection of me and that I deserved more of an explanation. She just went on to say she had negative experiences previously dating people from work and was sorry for leading me on.

I must admit I'm a little lost here. I don't understand - I had closed the book on this situation and moved on. Why is she messaging me so far down the road? Why is she even still thinking about this if she's not interested? How do I even respond?

3,qjh765,1635651147,I(25f) recently broke up with my ex(25m) because of his paranoia,"So me and my ex, I'll call him F, were together for about a year. Things were okay for the first three months or so, but after he had a life altering moment which I won't describe here for the sake of privacy, he started to change.

I tried to support F the best I could during this time. At some point his mental health was falling apart and he started to act a little paranoid. It was expected, since a major life shift happened. I let it go, excusing some of it as stress.


Unfortunately it started to get a little out of hand between us. F was paranoid that I was talking about him negativity between my friends and family. I assured him this wasn't the case but it kept becoming a topic after I would ask him why his mood was so poor.

The next level of paranoia comes with him explaining to me in an accusatory manner that I was sleeping/flirting with his friends. I had met this person once (he introduced us) and that was it. And I definitely hated this person's guts so no, wasn't into him lol. There was also mentioninv that he thought I was sneaking men into the home at night when he wasn't there. Also untrue. At some point he even went through my phone in front of me, looking at my conversation on SM etc.

If it was only a one time thing I think I could have managed, but it became a thing that happened like twice a month or more. And it would always end with us both crying because he wouldn't believe me, and he was frustrated with everything.

At some point he got upset with me because I was liking a certain persons posts on social media and that turned into a big fight over ""respecting"" him. They weren't abnormal posts, and nothing that would make someone think it was inappropriate to like these posts.

The last straw for me is when we became long distance because of my career. I was busy for a couple of hours so I forgot to text him back. He tried to call me but I was busy so it went straight to voicemail. He was upset, and asked me for a photo of my location. While I agreed for the sake of not starting a fight, I was extremely mad and uncomfortable with this request and for me it cut very close to the lines of abuse.

I asked for a break the next day. We eventually broke up because he couldn't take it. I left a lot of details out, but I think what I've shared is enough.

As I write this - my doubt of my sanity is slipping away but I still feel like somehow I fucked up. What do you think about this? Was there something I could have done differently to change the outcome of this relationship based on his strange behaviors?

Tldr; ex bfs paranoia and controlling behavior caused us to break up - how should I have handled his mental health problems?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qjh765/i25f_recently_broke_up_with_my_ex25m_because_of/
4,qjh7nm,1635651200,dating trauma,"i am a 15 year old homosexual male, and this past day just got me enough and traumatised.

i started opening myself into seeking relationships since June of 2021 (i planned it to be until i am 18 but i felt i really need it and i am ready for it) because i felt really lonely and sad and i need Somebody to love me and i realised that i love myself enough to open my options for a bit in seeking relationships.

i have dated quite a lot of Men. at first i did multiple dating but now i came to only date or be courted by only one because i think it's not right for me.

Since i am just new, i a newbie at these things. Although, there are things that made me learn, understand, and experience when i started seeking relationships.

what really made me traumatised since yesterday is that i had too much of the pain i get multiple times.

a lot of Guys just literally went so Romantic like they're talking to forever but sooner or later, they will just go away and abandon me. i had too much of it that made me traumatised.

Since i am in the same-sex male dating sphere, it is hard because most or at least many, of the Guys i encountered just primarily want fun or online hookups after all. this is why it's hard in the homosexual dating sphere.

For now, i feel needing to find Someone to be with me but also, ironically, got traumatised that i don't want to seek anymore for now. i really don't know what to do, since i think i might have what they call ""Daddy issues"", which is hard for me since as a human, i also need to experience compassion and care, which is not present in the community and environment that i am in.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qjh7nm/dating_trauma/

11,qji7ut,1635655255,"Got intimate with girl I know, at the club, she left home with another guy","This is a bit long, so please bear with me.

Alright, so I'm pretty torn about this and not exactly sure how to feel. Last night I went clubbing for the first time with friends from a college club. 


We met up beforehand to pregame and in that time I got drunk and started getting touchy with one of the girls there who gets buzzed. I'll call her Lily for the sake of this.


 Eventually, we go to the car as a group to take a drive to the club. In the car, on the way to the club, we get a lot more touchy and start kissing. Once we get there she takes my hand, leads me to a spot where we dance, and kiss some more. We part ways for a bit and I hang out with the guys from the group. She comes back around to find me, and leads me back to the spot, where she grinds on me and we kiss. At this point we are very drunk.  



After that, we wander off again and I chill with the guys. This time, she comes back to us and happened to bring a guy with her, who's also intoxicated. We'll call this guy Sam.


Sam was trying very hard to get her home. Apparently she knows Sam from meeting at the club before, but he seemed like a complete stranger to me, judging by his behavior. 


I was very suspicious so I told him to back off, and she insisted that she knew him.  I told her that I wanted to make sure she wasn't taken advantage of. 


Then she tells me that she'll be fine and some other nonsense(she was literally fucking cross-eyed while talking to me at this point). I said whatever and I walked with the girls back to the car, while the guy followed. 


She was stumbling and shit so me and one of the girls had to carry her back. We get in the car and they want to drive to Sam's place to fuck, so I just tell the driver to drop me off by my car, about 20 mins away. 



During the drive, Sam, still drunk, starts heavily flirting with Lily and the other girls but the way he spoke was fucking slimy. He was saying stuff like, ""Hey Lily, remember Tom? Tom is so hot, right? Yeah, you're going to get with Tom. You like his lips?"" She was drunk as fuck and being agreeable. Then he calls his buddy and says he's bringing along 3 girls. 
And this entire time, I'm uncomfortable as fuck and looking in digust. 


The driver finally drops me off and I ask her if she actually knows the guy and his intentions, since he seems so sketchy, and she says yes. Then she asks if I'm upset and I just say that I wanted to make sure they're safe. Then I leave to get to my car, and sleep the alcohol off. 


It's been 2 days and I've been thinking about it quite a bit today. We're not in a relationship but what Lily did rubbed me the wrong way, given that she was being intimate with me beforehand. I have to see this group of people again, excluding Sam, and I don't know how I would handle it with her. Do I just act as if nothing happened or what?

Relationship Advice

1. I met a girl and the first time I saw her I thought she was the most beautiful girl I have ever seen in my life. Honestly, I could not believe she was even talking to me. We spoke online for a few months before our first date.
2. After our first date, I thought she was the one. All the years of working and suffering finally paid off and it was all worth it.
3. I found some  deal breakers about her past. I thought about it for a while and realized it didn't matter, that's who she was but not who she is now. If anything I respected her more for it.
4. After a few nights together, she requested no condoms. She had an IUD and I accepted, my thought process was if she would get pregnant I would do my best and she would be my family.
5. I really believe we can understand each other better than anyone else due to similar trauma and help each other grow. She is good at everything I'm bad at and vice versa.
6. We spent the next few months dating and my goal was just make sure she was happy. I'm doing well financial and with work so trying to make her happy was more of an honor that anything else.

Fast forward a few months, she breaks up with me saying she doesn't like my personality and does not see it working out intimately. I was shocked but she wanted to stay friends. We spoke for a bit and then one night I founded she slept at someone else's house. I blocked her the next day but she called me one last time. I told her to forget me.

I'm not sure it was the right move. She doesn't want to date but I really think she's the one and I don't want to move or settle for someone else in the future. Any advice?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qjij93/male_25_me_female_27_her/

I came with my immediate family and have loved living here since. I met a guy on Tinder and we really hit things off. We both moved here from GA, we’re both half Mexican, really family oriented, and just a bunch in common. We have been talking for a couple months and have not had sex but we have exchanged pics (before we found out). I have never met someone in my life who I have felt more compatible with and I really thought at first that this was my person. I finally found someone who treats me like I deserve. What we have is electric and this is the first time I’ve ever felt like this about someone. Here’s comes the big drop, he noticed that his grandmas brother had commented on one of my pictures on IG, provoking him to ask how he was related to me. Upon further research it turns out that his grandmas brother is one of my dads 10 aunts and his uncles that my dad never knew. I have an absurdly huge family. I had some of these family members on my social media but never even knew how they were related or anything about them. We shared no mutuals friends. There was no indication we were even remotely related. I moved here from across the fucking country, away from everyone I have ever known. Somehow I managed to start talking to a long lost fucking second cousin. Now here’s my dilemma, what the actual fuck do I do? I have such strong feelings for this man. I really saw myself having a future with him. I am falling for him. I don’t want to stop talking to him. But I can’t help but feel wrong for wanting to continue a relationship with him… I just found out today and I have been a wreck over this.

I'm out of college and don't know anyone outside of work (mostly because I've been playing it safe because of Covid) but also because I'm more of an introvert. 

Of all the dating services, where do you find the most luck for something that isn't a hookup? Or do you spend your time shared across all the services?

i usually wouldnt mind but this has been happening again and again and again and it made me feel lonely and sad, since we can’t really spend time together. i was looking forward to meeting him all week and whenever he cancels i just feel sad. it made me question is it wrong for us to meet? does he not want to meet me? why am i still in a relationship with him if he doesn’t have time for me?

41,qjkop9,1635666302,Does my friend still likes me?," 

I met this guy three years ago and I instantly found him attractive. We had the same sense of humor and many things in common. I met him through an ex-friend of mine. We were from the same College. I was 17f and he was 20m. I think he saw me as a kid. He did called me a pretty girl but he was trying to make me feel better since I was feeling sad. He also posted a pic of me on his social media, but he is sort of a photographer. Two year after that, I went through a rough patch because I moved to another country. His understanding and our constant banter made me fall for him just way harder. December 2020, another friend convinced me to confess my feeling to this guy. I did over text on Christmas Eve. I told him I didn’t expect anything because I lived far away. He told me he liked me back and he wished me well. We didn’t speak about it after that. We kept on talking as we usually did. Nothing changed. But I felt some type of ownership. Not like I thought he was mine. More like we both liked each other and in other conditions we would date each other. I wanted to know if he still liked me months later. I told him I found it funny we never talked about it ever again and he told me something like “what do you think what my deleted messages are about?”. I got nervous, so I changed the subject. I really like him, and I deeply care about him as a friend. . We mess with each other but it's just playful banter. Recently, we were talking about an ex-friend of his that broke up with her boyfriend. He used to like her so I asked him if he was still talking to her, would he try something with her? He said, laughing, ""of course"".

I guess I feel stupid because I want to know if he still likes me. I am visiting soon for 2 months, and I am going to meet him, but I am not sure if I should try something with him. The thing is I would love to date him, but I know long-distance relationships suck. Should I do it? Or is it just a mistake? I just don't want to regret.

All 3 of them were really trying not to cum, like they genuinely tried to hold back but couldn’t. They’d stop inside me saying “hold on I need a minute” or something, but still proceed to orgasm. I don’t understand what’s wrong with me?

I’m 25. I’m not overweight but not skinny either - about average. I groom myself well, have good hygiene. I’d like to say I’m considerate and patient sexually.

Obviously female influencers follow ideal beauty standards so its not a shock, and I need to follow those standards as well.

I'm F26 and have never gotten male attention in my life. I'm thin but it doesn't help when the face looks awful. I wear 1-2 products of make up, more products doesn't really help. I'm one of those that look worse with a full face. I've thought about getting fillers in my cheeks and under my eyes, to get a more round face. Also thinking about getting hair extensions and fake nails, my nails are short and people might think I'm a lesbian.

With the amount of porn, only fans, influencer things out there it is NOT enough to be an average/below average looking woman anymore. Men want the filled cheeks, filled lips, thin waist, hair extensions, fake nails, model look now.

She was best friends with one of my good friends on that exchange trip (that's how we met)- and we got along pretty well and oddly enough had a lot in common. At the time though, I was dating someone else so I wasn't interested. We met up a few times in a group at uni back in Australia after exchange. The last time I saw her was 3 years ago when we got dinner with a mutual friend (also a girl). She looked beautiful that day, and I probably should have asked her out immediately after that, but internally I was having a tough time at work and suffering from depression, so I never acted on that thought. We lost contact after that.

I've been on dating apps in the last 3 years and I probably never met anyone as good as her. Shes got a great job, really attractive and is a genuinely nice person. I don't know her that well though and I have no idea whether she was ever attracted to me (she did say something about my long eyelashes back on the exchange trip if that counts).

So, my question. I don't know the best way I coupd find someone without having to go out and meet people face to face, since I'm terribly shy. What are the best apps to find a serious partner? What advice can you give someone officially starting to look for a partner?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qjmlfs/how_do_i_go_about_dating/

He has so many incredible qualities. But he suffers with depression and anxiety and, as a result, smokes weed and drinks alcohol every day.

I've told him that he drinks and smokes way too much and that it wont be helping him with his mental health. He said he knows and that he wants to reduce it. But every time I bring it up he gets really upset and says he's doing his best.

We haven't got to the stage where we decide whether we should be in a relationship, we've not had the conversation yet. Do you think it's ok to ask him to stop drinking and smoking (he's clearly addicted) if he wants to become a more serious couple?

Nothing really happend for a long time and I have given some hint in the past. Due to the pandemic we havent seen eachother and we moved to diffrent places.

During the party we talked and played games, later almost everyone at the party went out to the hottub. Later my crush joined and everyone just sat there chatting until my crush sits next to me. She kisses me on the cheek and says ""nice"". After that I put my arm around her and we kinda just sits there. 

We sit in the tub for another hour and she starts to make out with me, still saying ""nice"" everytime we stop. She grabs my hand and puts it on her breast (still alot of people in the hottub) and we kind go at it. Eventually we start to touch eachother downstairs and I slide a finger in. We are still going , she tells me not to stop, people around us. I whisper in her ear if she want to go inside and she tells me to wait. We are legit going at it in the pool for about two hours. 

And then it just stops, no more kissing, no more touching and we are only four people left in the pool. Two guys and two girls, and the girls bring up sexuall harassment and how fucked it is and then my crush says that she has been lightly harassed before and almost all of them have been some sort of friend. I  lose my mind, did I do it too?

Today Im so confused about what happend, I kinda want to text her and ask her about it, or kinda tell her it would be cool to hangout some time but it makes me feel like Im just trying get some...

Before club people asking if we are BF/GF and she answers with “idk”. I know she is really into me and texts me hearts and also wants to just spend time cuddling the whole night after sex.

Anyway, we take taxi to club together and about 2 hours in I’m walking around and find her hardcore making out with a girl. I go up and ask out what’s going on and she says she says she wants to go home with that girl. I told her we were supposed to go home together and she said that she really wants to go home with that girl. Anyway, I step back shocked trying to think what is going on. During that time she goes back to making out with this girl. So after about 5 minutes I go in and say “listen I came out here with you. I’m not ok with what you are doing. I think it’s crossing the line. You can do whatever you want but I’m not ok with this.” Right away she says she’s really sorry and that she’s glad I set that boundary. I said I’m going to leave and ask if she wants to leave too. She does and so we leave together. I was ignoring her on way home but she kept telling people I’m her man. 

We get back to her place and I figure I’ll smash because why not. Then next morning talked about it saying it’s disrespectful and she agrees. She feels bad. Anyway, we cuddled for a bit, smashed, and then I kissed her goodbye.


1) How bad is what she did? We have never talked about what we are and never had an exclusive talk.

2) How to proceed from here? Would you still see her and forgive? Or keep as only FWB to smash?

This past week, he was low communication, supposedly lost his phone and then found it. He had made no plans because he was “too busy “ to think about it. He had a week and a half, mind you.

Well, Thursday he finally says “how is your day” and I gave a brief reply, I was at work. Didn’t hear from him again until Friday morning which was drooly fave emojis. I quite honestly had no clue how to reply to that, so I didn’t.

Yesterday came and went, and not a peep.

We texted quite a bit over 3 days, he seemed like a nice guy and everything was okay - he shared a lot about his previous relationship and about some of the girls who liked him but whom he didn’t like - he replied very quickly and there were no guessing games. 

He asked for my insta and we followed each other, and he grew cold immediately after. Perhaps I don’t look good enough for him? But 1. my photos are pretty outdated (at least 3 years ago) and I’ve had quite a bit of a glow up since  then 2. I wasn’t the prettiest girl around but definitely still pleasant looking, I had friends commenting that I was pretty even though I didn’t look like I do now 3. He honestly really isn’t good looking.  

I guess I feel quite confused and upset by this experience - it has never happened to me before and I guess I trusted he’d be nicer than this… but perhaps I’m just being bitter. I’m also quite upset that I’m affected by someone else’s opinion of me - when he shouldn’t even matter.

85,qjprje,1635687769,What are your thoughts on celibacy/abstinence?,"So my family has a history of sexual trauma/abuse while also being raised in a highly repressive sexual atmosphere mixed with the religious stuff. I was exposed to sex at a very young age and from then I guess I would consider myself hypersexual. After I officially lost my virginity at 18 I was off to a slow run into my early 20's where sex was like something I felt I had to do to keep a man, and at times I did feel liberated and enjoyed sex as an adult. A really huge turning point for me was an age gap relationship I had where the sex was very good, but I felt manipulated and used. From then on I had sex here or there, but for the most part I've been abstinent for the last 4 years or so. I also worked in highly sexual environments as a stripper for the past 3 years and then a webcam model for a about 2 years. During this time I virtually had no sex, because I wanted to prove something to myself I guess and I also didn't really trust myself. I chose to get out of the sex business to live a ""normal"" life, and date, but still abstinent, and I don't feel pressured to have sex, but I do want it. I'm not a fan of casual sex, but I do want some kind of casual/beneficial sexual relationship. Realistically I don't think I can just share my body with a person and that just be that. If I know myself I will want more.

Ok so fast forward to this weekend. Friday I randomly met a man, and hung out with him friday and we had some sex play. He was high on cocaine and his dick didn't work do I let him give me oral and masturbate me. I kinda wanted sex, but the feeling was confusing. A part of me feels like I'm going to ""mess up"" my abstinence as if I'm on drugs and relapsing and then theres the ""no strings attached"" thing that I just can't get jiggy with. I could probably screw him twice until I know I'd want more. I also want to get married one day and have grown to subscribe to the ""no sex before marriage"" thing which seems to help me weed out the guys only wanting sex, but I also want sex sometimes. I kinda still wanna screw this guy lol but he's got a hectic life too with the cocaine habit and stuff.

It was nice, she told me she likes plants, and I have an allotment, so we talked a lot about different kinds of plants. She was really into medicinal herbs etc which I'm not really, but it was interesting. The date went well. Until we left the cafe.

We weren't in a countryside area, just a town, but it was one of those pretty streets which have little trees along it. After we left, she suddenly stopped, closed her eyes, sighed and said:

""The trees whisper words which we can never understand.""

I was a little taken back and unsure what to say. So I just awkwardly laughed, and then things went quiet. When we parted ways she seemed a bit off-ish, and when I got home she text me saying she 'felt very unheard at that moment.'

I explained it caught me a little off guard. And while I liked plants, I wasn't really into the idea of talking trees, but if she was that was cool, it just came out of the blue and I didn't know how to respond at the time.

She then went on a rant about how the earth needs us to be it's voice. How she will speak for it and how she can teach me to do the same.

When I questioned that she said ""We can never understand"" she went on to say that not all words are verbal and that we were texting right now which proves that.

I replied stating that she said we can't 'understand', not that we can't hear.

She then replied there are other ways of connecting and that my plants are likely calling out for me to hear their unspoken words.

After he stroked my cheek, called me beautiful with a cute grin, I reached in and gave him a big tongue kiss. When the kissing noice was made, he gasped froze, then went back to doing it. I asked if he was ok and he said he doesn't like the kissing noice.

After that he ate me out/fingered me, and it was absolutely incredible. He let out the sexiest grown when he put it in, and I loved how he held onto my hair and our eyes were locked onto each other for most of the time. After, he cleaned me off with a towel, put some cloths on me, then I fell asleep in his arms, and when I woke up, he made me breakfast.

I'm afraid that I kind of rushed him into sex, but don't want to tell anyone he was a virgin because he told me to keep that low key.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qjqgd9/did_i_rush_him_into_sex/
93,qjqh7x,1635689988,Growing up Hispanic is predominantly white area.,"I’m a Hispanic male who grew up in a predominantly white area. Growing up I got attention from girls, probably as I was the only non white boy in all my classes. As I got older and started dating I would have some white women tell me they had a thing for Hispanic guys. This never bothered me. I told a friend about this and they wondered why I wasn’t offended that I could be possibly seen as a fetish. This really never accrued to me. It’s ok to have preferences correct? We all have things we like in a person. What are your thoughts?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qjqh7x/growing_up_hispanic_is_predominantly_white_area/
94,qjqm3p,1635690409,this girl I like at work,"so on and off for 2 or 3 weeks there's been a bit of flirting going on, she's been striking up convos about random things that arnt work related.

she's brought me coffee, donuts, repeatedly keeps asking me her full name. was very interested I was going out on Friday and kept saying it was a date. 4 days later I went back to work her first question was how did the date go(so clearly its on her mind).

few days after that she started teasing me she has a date, it's her 20th with this guy( clearly a lie and tryna make me jealous, I mean who dates 20 times and isn't together yet)

so on Friday i was gna make a move, but we got really busy and I didnt wna rush it.

this week I'm going to make a move, iwas thinking of sending her flowers at work tmoro, I'm not there and sign it as anonymous. 

 and then gauge her reaction on tuesday/Wednesday and make my move. what do we think of that",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qjqm3p/this_girl_i_like_at_work/
95,qjqrv1,1635690884,"At my age, don’t we just want to find someone to have great sex with who we don’t mind spending time with?","I (49F) just started dating after a 25 year marriage.  The last few years were sexless.  I have had my children and I am close to being an empty nester.   I’m dating men my age and they seem to be in a similar stage in life.   
I have always been a good girl.  Moral and mindful of others.   But, my thinking has changed.  I want to try these men on for size (so to speak).   I am forward and communicative.   Still mindful. If things work out, I’d like to have sex on the 2rd or 3rd date.   
Only had one man get to the sex part. We didn’t work out, but we have similar interests.   We remain friends.  

My other experiences so far:
I have made plans with two men who have canceled on me at the last minute.   
One man ghosted me.  
One man told me all about his medical problems on the first date.  Including how he ruptured his prostate in a “bike accident”.   (That was a big heck no!). 


I suppose I just have to broaden my dating pool.   But, so far, it’s been a disappointing experience.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qjqrv1/at_my_age_dont_we_just_want_to_find_someone_to/
96,qjqvui,1635691224,He kissed me…now what?? HELP,"I should start this off with saying I was in a long term relationship for a decade so I am SO out of practice. 

I (34f) am talking to this guy (36m) who is my best friend’s, husband’s, best friend. We have been talking for a little over 2 months and have seen each other almost every weekend, multiple times per weekend for over a month. I was trying to figure out if he was just looking for a friend or if he was interested in more. I made an earlier post for any one interested in the back story. 

Well late Friday night we are watching a movie and he randomly asks if I have a boyfriend, to which I reply no. I then asked why. He said because he wants to kiss me and then asked if that would be ok. Before we did, he explained that he has wanted to for a while, which I thought was sweet. I said yes and we ended up making out for a bit. I am smitten and all I want to do is tell him such and tell him I want to see him. But I don’t know how forward I should be. Should I let him make the next move? Or should I just be the bold woman I am and tell him straight up? I don’t know what to do next….help!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qjqvui/he_kissed_menow_what_help/
97,qjqwnk,1635691295,Is she actually in to me or is she being like her self?," 

Hey guys, last week I was competing at a swim meet and a girl I like, lets call her Mary, sits near me on the bleachers. We go to the same high school and exchange greetings in the hallways. We talk a bit and at some point she looks at me in the eye for like 3 seconds, sticks her tongue out, and looks away. I felt like I was acting creepy cuz i was looking at her in the first place. I compete in a race and come back to her sitting next to where i sit. A dude on the team sat in her seat so she moved, but right next to me? Or am I just being weird. We talk more and look at each other in the eyes again. One time when we talked she touched my arm. The next day she sat next to me again and our legs ended up touching each other because of the crowded space. I didn't realize until a few minutes. As we were bunched up together she leaned on me and said how we were cramped like peas in a pod. I chuckled.

And yes I'm providing lots of details because i never pick up on any signs. She is the type of girl to talk to a lot of guys, which is why im skeptical on whether or not she is normally like this or is actually flirting.

any response helps, i can't stop thinking about it and i need some clarification",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qjqwnk/is_she_actually_in_to_me_or_is_she_being_like_her/
98,qjqwv8,1635691313,"Frist breakup ever, help me plz!","I'm (M24) in my frist relationship ever and its been two months. I want to break up with her (F24). I don't feel the spark anymore and looking back we might have rushed it to make it an official relationship. Now for the hard part: how to bring a breakup? (its my first breakup ever....)

I imagine it would be best just to go over to her and enter with the usual (little peck on the lips) and hear her out about how her day went. Then sit her down and tell her there is something I want to talk to her about and tell her I want to break up. Hear her out, answer some questions I feel comfortable about to answer and then leave.

99,qjqxkc,1635691380,Is this normal nonverbal behaviour from a 35/M? I'm 31/F,"Hi everyone,

I have posted previously, but I really just want an opinion on a rather specific behaviour. I have quite an obvious and severe hand tremor. It's called essential tremor. I went on two dates with a guy, and he explained after the date that he was very uncomfortable. I explained what they were, and that they weren't degenerative, but this didn't change anything for him. I function independently and live alone.

The guy I went on dates with did not make eye contact during the dates. After our second date, I asked why, and he said it was because of my tremor. He didn't want to make me uncomfortable while I was eating, he didn't know where to look, and he didn't know how to help me. He said he can't control how he feels. I was quite upset. The thing is, he didn't really look at me for the entirety of the date, except for when he moved on top of me to initiate intimacy.

He ultimately ended things because he said he didn't like the way he made me feel. He also said he doesn't want to adjust his life to my tremor, it may get worse, and the treatment I am having to correct the tremor may not work.

Would you consider making no eye contact because of a physical disability normal behaviour for a 35-year-old man? I have questioned autism, but I'm not sure. I don't have much experience dating, so I'm interested in the opinion of other, more experienced daters.

Many thanks!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qjqxkc/is_this_normal_nonverbal_behaviour_from_a_35m_im/
