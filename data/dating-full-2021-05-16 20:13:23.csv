I (20M) have a friend in college (20F) who is pretty introverted but has eventually become comfortable with me. 

She was talking about how some guys always look for sex and what not while I was listening to her. At one point in conversation I said “cuddles and hugs&gt;sex change my mind” (I don’t care about sex as much as other men do) and she went crazy in agreement. Apparently she was too shy to tell me that she loves cuddling and would love to have a “cuddle buddy” and I told her that if she wanted to cuddle while we’re out and about somewhere then she can go for it and I won’t mind. Since then it’s been about a month and we’ve hung out like 3 times and we’ve hugged each time. I don’t have any interest in sex but I do love cuddling and I want to go over to her place to chill and possibly cuddle but I don’t know if you can even ask someone to do that.

I begin to see the flags as, let’s say yellow flags, and those flags are a valid concern but can “easily” be mitigated. The issue is I’m going into a relationship already cognizant that there are things about this person I want to change. The relationship instantly becomes me putting in effort to change someone who either never wants to change themselves or expresses wanting to change but not currently ready to change. I end up disappointed in my SO and exhausted by my efforts to help them make changes and the relationship quickly deteriorates. 

This is so unhealthy and, in retrospect, I can always see why the relationship was doomed from the jump but - I just get this impulse to take the jump. It always feels like “true love,” and I always tend to think I’ll regret it if I pass it up.

Most of them, fortunately, were just strangers working their ways through asking all the girls on IG for nudes. I couldn’t care less to say no or just block them right away. But when they make conversation, when they’re all sweet. That’s when it gets impossible. 

So this guy I’m currently chatting with is really sweet. He doesn’t ask for too much, they’re rather mild things. But I am uncomfortable taking these pictures, even if it’s just on Snapchat and he’ll get to see them only for as long as I want to. I don’t know if it’s just me, but I personally feel a little less worth, objectifying myself just to hear how much he likes seeing this. I can’t help it. It’s not about the compliments he’s giving me. It’s about the things he says he’d do. I’m not completely innocent in this. Still, I feel uncomfortable. 

Sometimes I actually have the courage to be an adult and just tell him that I actually feel uncomfortable with it. I would assume he’d get the hint and back off. But he doesn’t. I’m not sure if he actually knows why this is uncomfortable for me, maybe I’m not being clear. I feel like he thinks I’m just self conscious about my looks. I am, but that’s not the issue. 

I sure am not the only person experiencing the pressure to give these kind of guys what they want. I just wish I knew how to stop this. I don’t want to push him out of my life.

We have always connected and got along really well and I consider her one of my best friends. We live in the city and started hanging out more after I broke up with my GF at the beginning of the year. Our interactions became more frequent and flirty before I realized we were both interested in each other as more than friends. I ended up asking her on a date, which went really well and ended in her staying the night at my place.

Fast forward to the present moment and I am trying to figure out what to do next. I think it's safe to say that we are both romantically interested in each other and want to see this through. I also realize that dating your best friend is a high-risk/high-reward situation. It's also slightly awkward. For 7 years our relationship has been platonic and now that's changing. She makes it easy but the transition from a friend to a romantic relationship is different.

My current plan is to ask her on another date and see how things go. On the date, I also want to have a talk about where our heads are at, what we're looking for and to make sure we're on our own page. Normally, I would never have a talk like this on a second date, but when its your best friend and there's an established connection, I think we're better off having that conversation than potentially being on different pages and hurting our relationship. Do you agree or am I better off just letting things play themselves out naturally? I will add that we had a similar talk after our date but were both pretty drunk so want to do it properly.

Any other advice on how to navigate this process would be much appreciated. Whether it's do's/don't, stories from personal experiences, or anything else I may not be thinking of - any and everything is appreciated! I want to make sure I'm very intentional and thoughtful through the whole process because our relationship means a lot to me.

I’ve been really struggling with dating since I was a teenager. I’m 20 never had a girlfriend, or been romantic with any woman. No woman has ever been physically attracted to me. I’ve been the guy friend that’s like a brother to a lot of girls and have been close with a lot of girls, but I get shot down by every girl I talk to. Even the girls that my friends try to set me up with run for the hills when they see me.

I’ve started doing the online dating thing and I’ve been on it for a year and it’s not done anything but show me how undesirable I am. I rarely get matches and when I do they almost immediately unmatch, never respond, or stop responding after 3 messages.

I’m at a point now that I just swipe right on everyone and take whatever matches I can get. I usually just match with girls I’m not attracted too in the slightest and have very few things in common with.

Recently sat down to think about how my dating life has gone the past few years. It seemed to be I was really good at attracting the guys that just wanted sex in the beginning. Then, it transitioned to attracting men who were looking for more of a caretaker type partner.

Basically, in the beginning of my dating journey I subconsciously thought all I had to offer someone was sex. When that passed, I thought all I had to offer was advice and guidance. 

Now, I'm sitting here thinking what I could possibly offer to someone in this part of my life because I do think it'll make a huge difference when I start looking.

I am a 34 year old man. That’s fine.

This isn’t the way I was hoping it would be at this point. But it happens. No one gets to experience everything. But everyone does get to experience some things. I’ve experienced my portion and it is what it is. I don’t deserve or earn this by doing anything. You just get what you get and that is it.

I’ve spent enough time invested in this though and I don’t think I can do it any more. I doubt sticking it out will change anything anyway.

No one owes me anything but I guess this ended up surprising me. I was sure when I became a doctor that that would be seen as a valuable profession in a date. But the reality is I don’t get to assign what professions are attractive and which are not for someone that is seeking a date. Or if where someone works even matters at all. I can only speak for myself. It surprised me that this essentially changed nothing but no one owes me a relationship because of what I do. That’s for sure.

I hoped that someone out there would find my hobbies and skills, the fact that I’m a vegetarian, my exercise routine, my travel history, and my lifestyle exciting. Or at least interesting enough or enough of a match to be good enough to give it a shot. But that’s not guaranteed. People are interested in what they are interested in and excited by what they’re excited by. If I’m not their cup of tea, that’s fine. I’m not gonna be everyone’s cup of tea and they have every right to find someone that matches them well.

I get along really well and people are generally really surprised that I’ve never had a girlfriend. Though, to be honest, what other response is that revelation going to induce from a friend. That doesn’t necessarily mean much. I think I am very cognizant of the degree that I am giving and taking in a relationship and think I make an effort to keep things fair. Lots of people say I’m “friendly” and “nice” but I think most people could be described that way. Other people are free to see me as they see me, to interpret my personality according to what they see in me. I don’t get to tell them how they feel about me. So that doesn’t earn me any kind of objective value either.

It seems clear, surprising to me or not, no one has seen in me a good match for themselves. I don’t get to dictate that. But they have spoken. That seems like it would be a pretty unlikely circumstance but it seems to be where I have found myself.

And there’s nothing wrong with that. I probably wouldn’t have been good for them. I don’t deserve anything from them. They know what they want. So it is what it is.

But I don’t think I can invest anymore of myself in this process. So this might be it. For a while at least. Maybe for good.

This is an account in which I was able to better understand true choosing signals from a false one. It will be helpful to you in your pursuit of finding your mate.

Here’s the story .. true story.

So I was loading my groceries into my car when I noticed a middle aged woman standing near the trunk of the car next to me. I was partially attracted at first glance, however the vibe I felt about her was disinterest. It seemed she was solely concerned with loading her groceries and leaving , she even appeared a bit irritated. I said to myself that I would not choose to pursue but that I would sneak a few glances to better judge if approaching would be feasible. Before I knew it she was walking past me to put her cart away. We locked eyes and she said “hey how are you” , I responded with the same and then also added a flirty “have a good day”. We both entered our cars and sat there next to each other. As I pulled off she rolled her window down. A sign she wanted me to say something ? I had some trash in my car and a baby seat so I wondered why would she be interested in a single dad slob? But I pulled back into the parking spot , rolled down my window and I said “ this Israelites crazy , but are you single ?” She laughed naturally as her face lit up and responded happily “ no I’m married but thank you it’s very flattering”. To which I responded “okay I know it’s crazy but you know sometimes I can’t tell which signals I’m picking up, have a good day” I didn’t feel rejected which is nice. I think acknowledging that this was going to be crazy before hand and getting straight to the point really helped avoid feelings of rejection. I took it as a chance to better learn choosing signals and calibrate my sensors for attraction. Sometimes people just want to be flattered and their not actually interested or available. I think the only way to know for sure is to ask.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,778267,public,self,Choosing signals my personal experience at the grocery store,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ndzr12/choosing_signals_my_personal_experience_at_the/,all_ads,6,,,,,,

But at the same time, I feel it's part of human nature to wish we got to experience certain milestones or experiences in our life before we actually did, and I’m sure that goes beyond dating/relationships as well, such as even career, job and finances, other areas in life, etc.

I will admit, I sometimes have feelings of resentment or feel bitter whenever I see teen couples and early 20’s couples, or just 20-something couples, because I’ve been single for most of my 20’s and all of my teens as well. 

I didn't really get into a relationship or start dating until near the end of my mid 20’s and the relationship didn't last, only lasted a couple of months, but I repeat to myself just to raise my self-esteem that it was a breakthough, milestone in my dating life, it was better than nothing.

I know this also relates to couples who met their best partner, got into their best relationship until late in life, they will say things like ""I wish we met earlier or 10 to 20 years earlier"".

I recently had a months-long situationship end and it has led me to be mistrusting of men's intentions.

This man was very successful, a bit shy, sweet, conversational and conventionally attractive. I was still on the fence if there was a physical attraction though. I think because of my recent breakup I may have been a bit quick to judge. But things were going well at dinner and he started asking about my morning plans (a bit of a yellow flag for me) and then invited me to come back to his place for a night cap (note it was only 9:30pm). Because of still being a bit hurt from the last guy I didn't feel ready to agree to ""spend the night"" with him yet and had just recalled how butthurt some men have been when I've gone back to then tell them that wasn't an agreement for me to have sex.

Anyways I politely declined and he walked me to my subway stop and waited with me until the train came. I totally thought I gave him the opening for a kiss but he didn't take it. We just hugged and I left. I texted him that night that I hoped he understood and that I'd still like to see him again. He replied back that he was really attracted to me and enjoyed our time together but was worried things were heading to the friendzone which is why he offered for me to come over. Now I interpreted this as because I didn't agree to go home with him that I was not interested. I replied that I appreciated his maturity and that I wasn't sure yet if we had romantic chemistry but that I was open to another date. He then said that he didn't see how another dinner date would change things but it was great meeting me. I told him I had been attracted to him and had wished he had kissed me goodnight but that I understood and wished him the best. He replied back this morning saying he wished he had and it may have made a difference and asked if I wanted to come to his apartment soon to hangout after work.

I may be too much in my head but I waited a couple hours and then replied that I thought the moment had passed for us unfortunately and that I didn't want there to now be that pressure on us to make a kiss happen but I thought he was a sweetheart and would make someone very lucky.

Introduced myself to a girl i saw at the store i work at. She started sitting across from me on my breaks. I started talked to her. We started talking about school first, then transitioned into more personal topics like family. 

Started to become an everyday thing. She would always find me when i took my breaks and initiated the convo. Always had her full attention. She was always smiling/blushing. I could tell she was nervous this put me at ease because i was just as nervous. 

Started asking each other more personal stuff. Weekend plans what she does in her spare time. Shes new to my area and said she doesn’t really do much but work and school. 

She mentioned she was single three times to me but i was to scared so i changed the topic right away. She also told me some others had expressed interest in her but she wasn’t into them. Changed the topic from this again. 

Finally asked for her number and she gave it to me without hesitiation. Talked for a few days with her being pretty engaged so i asked her to hang out. 

She said she couldn’t because she had a family member at home that was vulnerable to covid so she tries to not to go out that much. I assumed rejection because of the insecurity that she was to pretty for me. 

Told her i wouldn’t talk to her anymore but she told me i didn’t have to do that as e really liked out relationship. I agreed after some convincing. 

The next time i saw her at work she had her hair and makeup done and just looked stunning. She found me on my break on my break and we talked for an hour. 

That night i texted  her tgat she was a great person and my friend but i needed space to get over my feelings for. She said she understood and told menot to worry about her. Now she will not talk t me.

I met this guy on Hinge about 2 months ago and we’ve been almost inseparable (online). I haven’t met him because I am living in a different country for the time being until June when I will be back in his same city. 

The guy sends me love songs, pictures of everything he does and even pretends to be mad at me because I didn’t talk about him to my family, as if we were something more. 

Turna out I decided to travel for the week to where he lives, not because of him but because I have a business there and was visiting family. So i suggested we could FINALLY meet. I was arriving Thursday (May 13) and had an open ticket just in case things turned out ok. I told him and he said that he was busy that weekend because he had to travel to Orlando with his family on Friday and was coming back Sunday, so he said we were SURE meeting on Monday. 

The day i travelled came and i had heard nothing from him. I got to his city and just thought he might be busy or something so I didn’t text or anything. On Friday I reached out and asked him if plans were still up for Monday and he said he wasn’t sure because his family changed the day they were leaving to Orlando and he might be coming back Monday. I just told him to let me know. 

Literally like 5 minutes after we texted he added an instagram story and I obviously checked it out, and all of a sudden the story was nowhere to be seen, neither his highlights. The idiot thought i wouldn’t notice he had blocked me from seeing his stories. 

Anyway story keeps getting worse. On Saturday I was visiting a friend and she showed me a guy she had matched with on Hinge. IT WAS HIM! big asshole was texting with her. So i told her the whole story and she said she would obviously block him but first she asked him what he was doing on the weekend. The guy was never going to Orlando, had a dinner with friends on Saturday at his house and even invited my friend for lunch on Tuesday. MF

He obviously blocked me from his stories because he didn’t want me to know he stayed the whole weekend in Miami. 

So I am not sure what to do! Should I confront him? I am not sure about this option because i will give him too much importance. The second one is just disappearing and never answer his calls or texts again. Or as my friend suggested, she could set up that date on Tuesday and never go, so he feels like the asshole he is. I am not really the type of person that seeks revenge but rather cries her eyes out when her heart is broken. I am super sensitive and emotional person but this dude really effed this up! Like BIG TIME! I’ve never met someone so immature and imbecile! 

Btw he is 31M And I am 29F.

I met him through a dating app - Hinge to be specific. We chatted for few days/weeks. We kept on planning to meet but there's something that always came up. In the end, he decided to picked me up from my place right on the spot so we can finally meet.

I felt that we had a vibe. He's a gentleman tho that made me attracted. But I am well aware that he's not looking for a serious relationship due to his business and last toxic relationship. So, we vibe, we talked, we laughed and everything is going smoothly. And yes, after that night, we had sex. After that, we watched a movie and he booked a Grab for me to get home.

During our talk, he mentioned that unlike the other girls, they want to have an emotional attachment first before sex. And that really hits me hard. Dunno if its a compliment or amazement, idk. I was like, ""oh yes, I am not this kind of woman"". Its just that, for me, we had the vibe together that made me feel attracted and comfortable with him.

So fast forward, consistenly for 3 days after that night, he kept on messaging. Recently, I guess he is busy so I just tried to send a message once to check on him but I saw that he keeps on staying online but he's not opening/reading my message nor replying. I felt that he is intentionally ghosting me.

I was kinda hurt, a bit. Maybe felt insulted or what. And I guess there's something wrong with me. Maybe I gave my body too fast that made him off or something. I really don't know. I think there's something wrong with me 'cause I give sex too fast that makes guys less interested.

I guess I am afraid that group 1 are also the ones they respect and group 2 are the ones they don’t respect. Like it’s that simple. Any time respect is “showed” to anyone in group 2, it is actually just an act for proprietary reasons.

That’s like the universe of my nightmares. Not sure why that idea disturbs me so much.

But I guess it’s not true. Maybe group 1 is just special and gets *more* respect than everyone else. People in group 2 may get some respect but they just will never be respected like the people in group 1.

Basically the idea that women decide how valuable and worthy a man is by whether they want to fuck him or not. And everything else is an act. That is an idea that makes me really uncomfortable.

That is until the next morning when he expressed that he was actually uncomfortable with it because he didn’t want to get attached so soon which I completely understand but now I wonder if he thinks I’m kinda weird.

Then I’ve noticed how I’m way more affectionate and compliment him often but I don’t get any of that from him and it could be because he’s just not that type of person but I wonder if it’s because I’m making him uncomfortable?

I can’t meet a girl. Like I know where you go. I know what you can join (sports leagues, improv groups) and I’ve done that but I haven’t met anyone I genuinely like. 

I also go out quite often (once a week for dinner and a drink) around me. I get dressed up, look nice and I say to myself that I’ll talk to one girl sitting alone during the night. Just one. 

But here’s what happens - I sit down at a table by myself watch tv and talk to no one. There’s a group of 3 girls sitting across from me right now but what do I do? Go up and say what? There’s so many other people sitting around us like that will attract so much attention. 

My cousin has manages to have four girlfriends in ten years and meets them through work, through friends of friends.   My friend group is a group of 4 guys and we don’t have any females in our group.   We go out and talk sports. BTW, we’re not nerds. We’re all decent looking and oddly the worst looking (IMO) has a girlfriend.

I would mistake this for love when it wasn't.

I met a guy on Hinge last August. We became fast friends and it didn't take long for him to unlock the initial feelings of attraction and deification. 

But he is a recovering alcoholic and is not ready for a serious  commitment right now. I asked him if he could see us possibly being together when he becomes more comfortable with the idea of dating. He told me that he is not sure and doesn't want to make promises like that. Now, I may be naive but even I know that that's code for ""not interested."" I hold no I'll will against him. After all, it is not his fault for not loving me in a romantic light and he does not not owe a romantic relationship. So, I left it at that and never mentioned my feelings for him again. And besides, my heartache is not his responsibility.

We then continued on as friends and acted like nothing even happened. I thought the feelings would pass eventually but nope. They have only gotten stronger as I got to know him better. I no longer see him as an 'angel' or 'the ideal man''. I see him for him. I see him as an introverted, conservative, and blunt man who loves creating things and is extremely passionate about music. I see a man who has been through a lot of shit but is slowly taking the steps needed to better himself even though it is a struggle for him. I see, a man who has such deep self-loathing that he doesn't even like celebrating his own birthday. And that's unfortunate really because to me, there's nobody better than him both on the inside AND outside. It makes me want to do what I can to comfort him and it makes me feel more protective of him. 

The fact that I am starting to see him as an actual  person.... makes it even harder for me to move on and it makes the situation more painful for me. I would take a bullet for this man, give him the world, and he's pretty much all I think about. And what's worse....I think I'll him love until the day I die (25F) and I don't think I'll be able to love anybody as much I love him. I don't think I'll find anybody who i feel as comfortable with or find a

.nybody who makes me feel as happy as I do when we hang out alone together or talk on the phone. But I know this closeness is going to end one day because he will eventually fall in love with someone else and she will be a bigger priority than me. Knowing that that day will eventually happen, is literally making me cry at the mere mention of it.

I also ask myself every day why I am not good enough for him....because I honestly think we would be the best couple if he did love me back. But unfortunately, that is not the reality I am living in.

Met a girl at a bar a couple weeks ago. We hit it off pretty well, but we were both really drunk.

Told her on a Friday night I was going to x bar on Saturday and that she should come because I wanted to get to know her better. She responds not sure if she’ll make it but maybe. Saturday night comes along and she hits me up again saying she is gonna go. I had a change in schedule and couldn’t actually make it. Told her that and told her next time definitely. 

It’s been 2 weeks and I haven’t heard from her and haven’t hit her up again. 


Did I blow my chance with her or should I give it another go?

Thoughts?

Any opinions would be greatly appreciated.

Bit of a ramble, btw.

So, basically, I started working a new job about a month ago. A few weeks in I started casually talking with this cute girl at break one day, didn’t really think much of it. A few days later, one of my coworkers adds me to a group Snapchat and the girl I talked to friended me a few hours later from there. 

I decided to start snapping her directly (cause she is hella cute) and we talked back and forth a bit each day, nothing crazy, just small talk to pass the time. After about 4 days, she sends me a goodnight snap at 10:30PM in her PJs. This was really out of the blue, so I kind of thought it was accidental. I gave a pretty barebones response and heard nothing back. 

The next day, I send her a snap in the morning, like I normally do, and she opens it and doesn’t respond. We talked for a few minutes in the middle of the day and then I snapped her one more time before work ended, and again, she didn’t respond.

The next morning, I snapped her one more time and decided that if she doesn’t respond I’ll just stop talking since she’s probably not interested. I don’t hear anything back all day, so I just plan on not talking to her over Snapchat anymore.

Then at about 7:30PM she sends me a snap that’s a selfie of her and there’s a filter that says “shoot your shot.” I’m kind of stunned but I can’t really reply as I was swamped with work and didn’t get any free time until 3 hours later when my shift ended. I messaged her when I got off and just said that I finally got out of work and asked what’s up?

She didn’t open it that night (which was last night) but she opened it at 7:00 this morning and I haven’t heard anything since.

Part of me thinks she’s hinting to back off and I’m just not reading them. Other people say I’m reading into it too much. Any advice?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,778643,public,self,Mixed Signals?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ne4luk/mixed_signals/,all_ads,6,,,,,,

I guess here’s a little bit about me.  

First of all, I am introverted... which is definitely one of the reasons why I’m never compatible with anybody really; I sometimes feel uncomfortable with people, but not to the point where people think i’m mute. I used to be like that, but i’ve come a long way to step out of my comfort zone and communicate with people. I can generally keep a conversation going with people, I’m just not energetic/explosive or outgoing. 

Additionally, I have big dreams for myself, and I expect something similar coming from the guy. I’m currently finishing up my third year of engineering, and I would say I’m quite ambitious. Maybe I shouldn’t be so quick to filter out guys, but listen up because i’m about to mention my main problem. 

I experience guys just liking me for my body my whole life; I don’t even know who to trust anymore. Guys never seem to want me for me, all they want is to have sex. What I find crazy is that it’s not even that I don’t GET guys, it’s that literally all guys who have approached me irl or messaged have been entirely interested in me for my physical appearance. I get more guys dm’ing me than in person, but i have been told a 3-4 times that i’m intimidating in person, maybe that’s why guys dont really try to get to know me? I’ve came cross 2... TWO guys who genuinely cared about me and liked me for me. 

I find it very concerning, almost upsetting.

Among other things. But those aren’t as bad as the dandruff. He’s so sweet kind and affectionate. Maybe even too affectionate. Which I never thought I’d say. I love affection. But that’s probably because I am so thrown off by the dandruff. Don’t want it on me. 

Our dates have been ideal. In every way except my attraction to him. I feel like I would enjoy his presence if it just weren’t for the dandruff. He also has bad breath and needs to exfoliate. His breath wasn’t so bad the last time, but that’s probably because he was drinking beer and idk that always seems to help with bad breath. Or atleast mask it. He also needs a trim. I like long hair but his damaged ends go on for inches. I could deal with that. I could help him with the exfoliation. I used to give my ex skincare products and he liked that. Who doesn’t like a nice little self care gift? But I can’t gift him head &amp; shoulders. Not without humiliating him. I have ocd. It really affects my mood. I can’t stand knowing his dandruff  is everywhere and all over me. On his bed. Went home and it was stuck to me. 

We’ve only been on 3 dates. I’m not even sure if I would like him if the dandruff was gone, he trimmed his hair, and treated his bad breath. I told him I just don’t feel anything. And that I’m sorry but any girl would be lucky to be with him. And it’s true he’d treat them well. 

He said he’d “die to be with me”. That he feels good with me. And he really was so happy and excited spending time with me.  😓 I hate to disappoint him.

Pass the time pleasantly until she leaves. I don't mean sex, assume its a first time date and you don't know each other that well and you don't feel like talking. Something pleasant for her but doesn't involve much talking between you two 

Let's say from the circumstance that telling her ""let's go out now for a walk now/I'm busy/Oh I gotta do X/let's head out now"" might be too obvious that you are trying to kick her out or she doesn't want to go outside b/c of the weather. Say you do want to see her again 

I dunno, some kind of game that she won't say no to most likely? The first though I had was chess or checkers. And the second thought I had was plenty of girls would be annoyed by the guy telling her to play chess w/ him for the remaining 15 minutes or w/e of the date before she has to drive home

Sure, I think he’s good looking and attractive, but when I think about him, I think about all the good that he’s done for our students, or thinking and hoping that he will have a successful football season in the fall, or hoping that he wins more championships long term. 

Or hoping the best for him and that he is able to go on one of his trips he told me he was excited for this fall. 

My point is, when I think about him, it’s not in a way that benefits me, or forcing him into a relationship with me. 

It’s completely and utterly selfless feelings of wanting the best for him. 

When they were away on a team trip this weekend, I didn’t feel jealous or miss him a bunch. Instead, I kept checking every hour on how his team was doing. 

Is this abnormal or bad that I think these selfless thoughts about him? I’ve never had that happen with a guy before. 

Sex and stuff like that just isn’t the first thing on my mind.
