I am going on a first date with someone i met on my friends’ wedding.

My relationship before this (5years) was pretty abusive and my ex was always on the phone or texting me unless I was in the silent treatment periods. The guy I am texting now is not like that even a little bit. He is very busy due to work and social life (he told me, but my friend also told me), so he texts me or once a day or sometimes keeps a few days apart. He starts, because I am a bit shy and feel like maybe I would burden him. I am 29, but my ex was my first bf, so I am veeery nervous and excited. 

He lives in Germany and I live in the Netherlands. He asked me suddenly if I wanted to meet in the middle and go for dinner together. So I assume it is a date? 

Few questions on how to prepare and dress:

He is my height and I don’t mind, but would it be weird if I wear a bit heels? For me it is not a problem, but I don’t want to make him feel uncomfortable.

I was thinking of heeled boots, long skirt and a cardigan. What do you think?

Also I haven’t texted with him for 2 days now and should I text him whether he found a hotel already and that I am excited?

All of this just makes me miss my husband more. I’d do anything just to hold him again. He would always compliment me and take me out once a week.

For context, we had been texting each other a week/week and a half everyday 24/7 before we went out but we had officially met 3 months prior to texting. We live in different cities so when i came to his town i told him about it and we organized a date (side note: i didn’t go to his town for him, i have relatives there that i wanted to see). Long story short, the date went well. We even made out which is not something i usually do on a first date but it was a heat of the moment type thing. Anyways, at the end of the date he drops me off at home and i tell him to text me when he comes to my town (he goes to school there). A few days go by and i don’t hear from him at all. I was a bit confused at first but then i just thought that maybe he didn’t have as much fun on our date. I didn’t text him because i figured that if he didn’t have fun i might as well leave him be. By the 4th day of him not contacting me, i had plans with one of my close friends that knows him well and asked if maybe they knew what this was about. They said that it probably had something to do with me telling him “to text me when he comes to my town”. From my friends perspective, they think that by me saying that he probably understood it as “i don’t have time for you right now so text me when you get to my city” which i find pretty absurd because that is not what i meant at all. Regardless, now i am unsure of what to do. I most likely won’t be texting him anytime soon because there is still the possibility that he just didn’t enjoy the time we spent together.

We quickly became friends and we got along pretty great. I thought she was into me and I thought I made it pretty obvious that I was into her. I asked her out and she said yes, but she didn't want to go out until she was vaccinated because she was immunocompromised. (It was also a really busy semester as well.) We still texted each other pretty frequently for a few months until we eventually had what I thought was a lunch date over the summer. We had a good time overall, but then she kept blowing me off every time I tried to set something else up with her afterwards. And I'm embarrassed to admit that I tried more times than I probably should've. I was very hurt and confused because I had grown to really like this girl, but she had started to phase me out and I couldn't understand why.

I reached out again much later to apologize because I felt bad for bothering her so much and not taking the hint that she wasn't interested. Didn't make any excuses for myself or give some long winded explanation. Basically just a short and sweet ""I made a mistake and I'm owning up to it"" sort of deal. Then she replied and opened up about how she only ever intended for us to be friends and she got freaked out and kept me at arm's length when I implied that I wanted to be more than that. She said she felt guilty for the lack of communication as she didn't want to upset me and felt like she made things worse. We talked for a bit, I acknowledged my mistakes in the situation, I said that I hoped we could still be friends to which she agreed, and I think we parted on good terms.

I'm glad communication was made and that I got some closure even though I probably didn't deserve it. Only time will tell if she's actually willing to be friends, but I can't help but feel like an idiot because of this whole thing. I just feel dumb because I wasted most of my summer pining over a girl who was never even interested. I excitedly told a lot of my friends and family about her because I was so convinced that she liked me and that something was going to work out between us.

I  (M22) have been friends with this girl (F21) for about 1 year. We share  a lot of common friends inside a large group who drink together every  weekend (she's best friends with my best friend's gf) and have been  going to the same parties and to the bar together on numerous occasions.  I'm mostly hanging out with my boys so it took some time before we  started really talking to each other at the gatherings (I mean more than  just a few polite greetings).

First  ''unusual'' thing that happened was last winter. While I was at work on  a friday night she dm'd me asking if I was coming over for the little  party at my best friend's house and that she really wanted to see me  there. But once I get there she has already left, leaving a message  saying she's sorry, that she was too drunk and had to leave. I  unsuccessfully tried to keep the text convo going.

Then  nothing special in the following months, at that point I know she at  least notices me so I start being more friendly and talking to her more  when we bump into each other, but nothing happened for a while.

For  the past month tho, for some reason we have really started talking more  and having great chats when going out, now she's always looking for me  at the bar (saying stuff like ''I lost sight of you'' and grabbing my  arm), which is kinda cute, and it seems like her friends leave us alone  on purpose so we can hangout together. So things kinda grew on their  own, we've started talking about doing something alone together (for the  record we haven't explicitly talked about having sex so Im not sure yet  where she stands on that). She was supposed to come see my cat last  night (we were both drunk) but later that night she kinda flaked out  saying she had to wake up early and it would be unreasonable, but asked  me about my plans for the next day.

So  tonight I had an opportunity to be alone with her while smoking a  joint, away from the other friends (she came looking for me saying it  was her turn to share her weed), her vibe is always friendly (truly a  ''one of the boys'' type) so it's hard for me to set the mood to make a  move, but even after we were done smoking she stayed with me, so I  started making more eye contact, getting a bit closer to her face...but  then her phone rings and it's my roommate asking me to come back helping  him with something (it was actually important and I never answer my  phone) since the gathering was at our place. Instant mood killer. We go  back to the backyard, finish drinking and say goodbyes (normally she  just shakes hands with the boys but she gave me a big hug and ''see you  later'', she always seems a bit more touchy with me than the other guys  these days)

I would normally see  those things as some signs of interest and I think she's in my league,  but she always talks about (to me and to other people) how she wants to  be single forever and live her youth. So I guess formally asking her out  isn't an option? But since she's down to do something alone with me  next week, should I make a move? I mean I wouldn't mind having a lowkey  fwb thing with her but I don't know where to start, I've only slept with  girls I was dating.

tl;dr  : Female friend in my group of friends I've started to get closer with.  She's showing some signs of interest (willing to meet me alone at  night, actively trying to find ways to hangout with me, being a bit more  touchy with me than with the other boys) but also signs that make me  question myself (very friendly vibe in person, often talks about how she  doesn't want a boyfriend and never had one, tends to be a bit flaky).  We are supposed to see each other alone next week, should I make a move?

Hoping for some advice please. I'm in a very messy situation right now and partly it's my fault. I'm a f 31 and my ex partner is 34. We were together for 10 years and still live together. Things had been bad for over a year, and he cheated on me with several women amongst lots of other issues. I ended things with him officially about 2 months ago and he is desperate to find another place to live, but finances are not great and finding rented accommodation is very hard in the location were in. So he sleeps on the couch, I sleep in the room. He's due to move in with a work friend mid September. 

For about 6 weeks iv been talking to a guy. Here's the messy part: the guy is technically an old friend of his. Not a really close friend but my ex would consider them to be friends from back in the day and we all hung out regularly. We always got on and there was chemistry between us. Nothing ever happened back then. We were planning to meet up in a few weeks time. 

Today this guy sends a picture of me and my ex from two years ago. This picture was only uploaded by my ex's mum as she was the one who took the photo. He also liked a photo of my ex today which I thought was very really odd because they haven't spoke in years and also because me and him have been talking. It just seems very weird. 

I asked him where he got the photo and he refused to tell me and said I was over reacting. I told him it was my right to know because it's a photo of me! He threatened to block me and called me crazy. I told him he was the one who was crazy for going through my ex partners mums account number 1 and number 2 he liked a picture of my ex from today! He never responded. 

Am I over reacting? Or am I over looking some serious red flags here? We get along really great and I was never planning to have a realtionship with him, it was just meant to be some casual fun. But I dont understand why he went looking for my photos or why hes liking my ex's photos out of the blue.

My last serious relationship ended as I fought for my life in an ER bed. My ex, put me there. I had him drive my car as my fibromyalgia was acting up and I didn't trust myself to take a small trip. I woke up a month and a half later with a trach in my throat unable to speak, tied to the bed because apparently I kept trying to pull the feeding tube out, 10 broken bones, my digestive tract reconstructed- a very long path ahead of me. Thankfully I had no memory of what happened my Parents were there, I had an estranged relationship with my father so that had me confused. Anyways I was run over by a pick up truck. I am lucky to be alive. And I have done the entire recovery for all of this alone. He left me there fighting for my life. I had to relearn walking, talking, swallowing, going to the bathroom- all the things that come naturally to humans. So yeah fighting so hard to live and rehab it didn't really sink in to me that I was newly single. Two years into it I tried to see a new guy but he was entitled thinking I was with the other bum he deserved to be with me and I felt no spark it was just not worth it. So I told him nah I cannot do this my recovery is most important. Plus he lived 5 hours away it just wasn't going to work. Last attempt I spoke to the dude over a year online and never met in person I was like well this is going absolutely nowhere he was only 45 mins away but did not drive so it would have been all up to me and just no I am not a take charge type of person while I am still rebuilding so I let that one go too.

But it's been four years now of non-stop recovery. ALONE. I've had family there but all the friends that were there in the beginning people are trickling away. Even family is turning on me. And I feel like I just need that extra support that is not a friend or family. 

However I'm 14 years sober so Bars are out.

Two of my 3 serious exes were met at work. Work is out as I am disabled. I can walk again, however my endurance only lasts so long. 

I mean I could try facebook dating again- BUT I am on a hiatus from there because like I mentioned above for four years I have been working nonstop on my body- I never took the time to take care of myself mentally and all that trauma and PTSD is no lie hitting me like a truck. So I am avoiding facebook and what people THINK are huge deals in their life when really I've been through the ultimate wringer. 

I'm in a small town in Upstate New York.

I know all the guys I grew up with and they are also not options.

I cannot deal with someone with a kid because I am also a kid again. 

I love to read, sports (except basketball), I used to love rock shows but big crowds with my PTSD are a no no right now, Marvel Movies.

Then if I do meet someone how do I tell him about all my past trauma and get comfortable about being around him and allowing him to touch me?

TLDR below. 

This happened a few months ago..

I met “Michael” while in Hawaii. I was remote working on Oahu and we matched on an app. I also matched with his roommate and best friend (although I didn’t know it at the time), “Jordan”. 

I went on a single date with Michael and had a wonderful time, even though shortly before the date we all figured out the two guys were both messaging and planning dates with me. We kissed, and then when I got home I told Jordan that if he didn’t want to still meet up, it was totally understandable (I didn’t tell him that we kissed, it was my first communication with him after Michael told me Jordan and him realized there could only be so many girls on the island with my rare name and background). 

Jordan says he still wants to see me and we go get dinner later that week. Tbh it was a bit of a dud, I personally thought. He was incredibly reserved, not shy, just *silent* but confident. I drank a bit too much sake and when he kissed me, the way he kissed me, the fact that I hadn’t slept with anyone since my breakup with my only boyfriend… I don’t know what exactly happened but one thing led to another and we hooked up in the back of his car in the parking garage. It was incredibly hot. 

I see Jordan two more times a couple weeks later, just to hook up. It was honestly, to this day, the best sex I had in my life. I never heard from Michael again and assumed Jordan did his bro a solid and told him we hooked up. While I liked Michael and likely would have reached out again if he wasn’t friends with Jordan, I felt too ashamed to try my luck. Jordan eventually leaves the island to go back to the mainland and I don’t really ever hear or think of him again other than when I’m alone and horny (lol). 

A few months later I’m visiting the Big Island with a group of my friends and I come across Michael on another app. It was super surprising and I impulsively swiped right. We match, and hang out the next day. 

To summarize:

* he told me he didn’t want to know about Jordan and I (I find out later Jordan never said a word beyond “the date went well” and he thinks we just went on one date and that Jordan, at least, is not the kind of guy to sleep with a girl on the first date) 

* I end up sleeping with him the third time I see him 

* I go back to Oahu and we miss each other (physically, mostly) so much that he moves his business meetings around and extends his stay on the Big Island. I return just days after leaving 

* Michael goes to NY and tells Jordan he saw me on the Big Island; Jordan, as you will see later, says nothing of note

* I finish out my stay in Oahu, and he invites me to visit him for July 4th since his roommate (Jordan!!) will be out of town

* when I’m in NY he treats me like I’m his gf, even though I don’t want a relationship and he doesn’t either - he has *massive* commitment issues and tbh, after my past physically and emotionally abusive relationship I have gone from a relatively securely attached person to someone who is extremely avoidant to getting attached, this behavior makes me want to pull away, but I also enjoy the brief moments of communion I experience with him - we go on dates, I meet his friends, etc. It is, after all, only 4 days that we are together 

* Michael asks me to stay one more day, the day that Jordan gets back. I tell him that’s not a great idea and I don’t want to be running out the door like a bat of hell before the sun is up to avoid Jordan (who was returning early from LA to celebrate Michael’s birthday) 

* this triggers Michael to probe, and eventually he point-blank asks me if we slept together, and I tell him the truth, yes, I did 

* Michael is understandably upset, but tries to deny it saying “everyone behaved perfectly logically” and he also says “in some ways (he) wished (he) knew earlier but he’s also glad he didn’t because we wouldn’t have likely gone on all those wonderful adventures together” 

* Michael is busy with work the next day and I am super uncomfortable by the whole situation and just want to flee. Michael insisted I tell him before I leave so he could come back from his office two blocks away and say goodbye properly. I didn’t really understand the “big deal” (he said goodbye as he walked out the door?) but mostly I just keep thinking this was just supposed to be for fun, and this wasn’t feeling very fun anymore

* I consider leaving for the airport and messaging him only once I get there 

* I change my mind, because I think that if I want the option to see him again I shouldn’t leave like that so I message him I was going to leave in an hour and a half and he comes back 

* we have a discussion about Jordan since it’s still the elephant in the room. He says in his mind it has functionally changed nothing 

* I tell him I considered leaving without saying goodbye, and this is when he does something that shocked me and completely overwhelmed me 

* Michael tears up. I ask him if he’s upset and he says yes. I ask why and he says it’s because if I was willing to do that “you don’t view this (relationship) the same way I do”

* I ask him to clarify - I tell him, in my mind this has an end date, it’s meant to be fun, I had no idea if I was ever going to see him again anyway, and that was that 

* he says that he understood and agreed that this has an end date, but that he viewed us as more than just fuck buddies, to him I was more than just someone he hooks up with 

* I don’t know how to process what he’s saying but I apologize because I do genuinely care about him as a person. We have sex, he walks me to my uber, and I fly off to see family across the pond 

This was probably quite minor in the grand scheme of things, à totally “reasonable” conversation, but it left me emotionally exhausted, and I didn’t want to talk to him for almost week after this incident even though he would reach out, though less often than before, which I initially chalked up to his bday celebrations. I would reply but not really engage, which I know is on me. I just… didn’t / don’t want him to get the wrong idea.

Ever since this incident, however, he’s been a bit less warm, and tbh I initially thought it was because of the whole Jordan thing but he kept making jokes about me “leaving with my scarf waving out the window in the wind and not saying goodbye” (a combination the wording I used to describe potentially fleeing from his Manhattan apartment at 4 am to avoid seeing Jordan that we both found funny and the near decision that upset him). Eventually we met up again, and while he asked me less questions about myself than he used to, he invited me to his triathlon the following month. I worked up the courage to ask about it because I still can’t understand what I did that was so upsetting. 

Me: “It was a thought crime, essentially”

Michael: “no, it’s as if you were thinking of killing a person, got the tools for the job, killed them and *then* said, ‘oh I only thought about killing them.’”

Me: “that makes literally *no* sense. In that analogy it’s as if I thought about killing someone and went ‘actually no, not today’ and *didnt* kill them at all”

This analogy of his, that the fact I was willing to do it, but didn’t, makes it sound like In his mind, the fact I *could even consider* leaving without saying goodbye was enough to hurt him. Does this sound right? Tbh I tend to self-sabotage my relationships / friendships so I am trying really hard to understand what happened here. 

I like Michael a lot, but I feel really broken and unable to provide more - in fact, I thought he was the perfect match for my current situation as he has never really had a relationship for longer than 1-2 years and has voiced he struggles with commitment for different reasons than I currently do. So I just don’t understand the problem. I’d like to keep him as a friend when this is all over, though I understand that is likely impossible. 


**TLDR - my FWB has pulled away emotionally I think it might be my fault.

I (23f) got a call from my best friend (23f) that my girlfriend (21f) sent her a text. 

My best friend isn't super fond of my girlfriend because of how she's treated me in the past, but my gf and I have since resolved the issue and we're doing fine now. My best friend isn't rude to my gf, but she also doesn't make an effort to have a friendship with her. This doesn't really bother me since my best friend lives 1k miles away, and they've never even met in person. My best friend is nice to my gf, like if we're on the phone and she knows my gf is around my best friend will always say hey and engage my gf in the conversation. It's a really cordial relationship, but they don't have a relationship outside of me. My girlfriend has never expressed any disdain toward my best friend or expressed to me that she wants to get to know her. 

Yesterday my best friend told me my girlfriend text her. My gf sent a long paragraph apologizing for how she treated me in the past and saying she was sorry that my best friend had to see me deal with so much ""emotional and mental hurt"". My gf said she hoped my best friend could forgive her and that they could eventually build a ""genuine friendship"". It was a very well-intentioned text; there was no malice behind it. My best friend responded saying she didn't think an apology was necessary since I'm already over everything, and that was that. My best friend was really uncomfortable because she knew I didn't know.

Here's the weird thing: I never gave my gf my best friend's phone number, and my gf never told me she text my best friend. My gf has complete and total access to my phone; her face is programmed into it and everything. We both have total access to each others devices because sometimes it just makes things easier. I don't go through her phone because I don't feel the need to. Until yesterday, I trusted that my gf wouldn't go through my phone either, much less take someone else's contact info and reach out to them without telling me. Though there was nothing rude or mean about the text, I'm still rubbed the wrong way about everything. I feel very paranoid; what else has she gone through? Who else has she spoken to? I haven't talked to her about it because I don't know how to feel. I don't even know how to start the conversation. 

On one hand, I could just let the whole thing go and pretend I don't know. Nothing bad came from the situation and it was a really nice text. On the other hand....what the fuck??? Should I be upset?

Being myself just openly exposes my depression, anxiety, my bitterness, my anger, my grief and sadness and ultimately my pain. I can actually be a fun, easy going person, I can be somewhat funny but when I'm upset or sad or feel flustered, all of that completely goes away and people will just end up seeing me being angry, showing insecurity and feeling extremely vulnerable and thus feeling like I'm being judged for it. I'm immature, petty, spiteful etc  


Everybody says that you shouldn't take yourself too seriously, but I take myself seriously because I'm not some fucking clown that exists to make others laugh or feel better about themselves by having someone to laugh at.    


Everyone always just tells you to be one specific type of guy because it's socially coded as the most socially acceptable, you have to be ultra confident, assertive, funny, the life of the party, fun to be around etc. Not everybody can be or is this type of person, we can't just conform each other to transform ourselves into that one very specific personality type that society is absolutely fixated on.  


Well, I'm not that type of person, I don't want to be that type of person. I'm fucking sad all the time, even when I'm smiling or laughing, I have pent up pain and trauma that just lingers and never goes away. Nobody cares, I'm a guy so I just have to suck it up, fake it 'till I make it and act like those 20 years of total emotional dogshit didn't matter and didn't affect me when clearly it has.  


Whatever quality or positive traits I do have don't matter, nobody sees them and nobody gives a shit. Nobody cares if a guy is sensitive or in touch with his feelings, that's all trash. People only pay attention to men when they can get something from them or when they play the role of the guardian, the protector, the stability, the life of the party that brings the fun and the positive energy. Nobody gives a shit about men if they can't do that and play that role

Or.... would it be weirder to *not* tell him and just have him randomly notice, later on, that me and his relative follow each other on Instagram? 

Also, am I reading too much into this or did he tell this grandma/aunt/whoever about me, because otherwise how would she know my name and why would she be following me? (I haven't commented on his posts or anything.)

Sorry if this is a dumb question, but I have zero dating experiences prior to this, so I’m very new.

Me and her have been on two dates (arcade and bowling) and we’ve also hung out I’m with a larger group of mutual friends a few times. So far the most we’ve done is hug goodbye. The other day we were texting and she said that said that her “love language” is touch so she’s been trying to do more of that, but she didn’t want to do too much. I also mentioned that I try to not come on too strong (regarding touching and stuff) but she said that I don’t have to worry about that at all. 

I mention that because I definitely want to start being more open with her and “touching” her more. We’re planning on dinner and a movie Tuesday, so I need tips. I’m picking her up, but I won’t be able to get out of my car when doing so (dorm in the middle of the city). Should I hug her when we arrive at the theatre? Or would that be too random? How would I go about putting my arm around her during the movie? It’s a horror movie if that means anything. When we are walking to get dinner afterwards, should I hold her hand?

Well, I now have a success story I'd like to share, hopefully it will inspire or motivate some of you reading this if you're in a similar position to the one I was in.

I had previously pursued two girls, but neither scenario ended very well (though if I'm being honest, it was probably for the best, I realize in hindsight I probably wouldn't want to be in a relationship with either of them anyway for various reasons I won't get into). Without re-hashing too many details, basically the first one led me on and then friend zoned me. The second one initially told me 'yes' in person, then texted me the next morning backing out. Aside from those two scenarios, I had no experience asking anyone on dates. I always chickened out because I didn't know how to approach girls. I was homeschooled for most of my life so it took me longer than usual to develop sufficient social skills. 

Anyway, I finally got my first success. I asked a girl out over the phone recently that I had already known for a little while. I was very nervous, but after the last two rejections, I just didn't care anymore about rejection, I decided I was going to be a man and pick up the phone and call to ask her and just deal with whatever happened. She said yes (!!!), and we went out twice. So after years of not dating at all, I can finally at least say that I have been on dates, which is a VERY good feeling in its own right. Unfortunately, after the 2nd date, I think we both realized there was not enough of a connection. The first date there seemed to be, but the 2nd one.... I dunno, something just seemed off, and I think we both sensed it. Neither of us had much dating experience (I had none, she had very little), and that probably did not help matters. She was the one who told me she'd rather just remain friends after the 2nd date ended, but truth be told, while I would have been willing to go on a 3rd date just to see, I kind of felt the same way for reasons that are too difficult to describe, I just didn't want to say it and basically allowed her to beat me to it.  So I think our time together went as far as it could. I still enjoyed myself though and considered it to have been great experience.

While that isn't the end result I'd hoped for, and while I'm afraid that I will have to keep searching for someone in order to finally be in a relationship, I still wanted to post this to share my experience, because I used to be petrified of even asking girls out. Now, I feel comfortable enough to just do it. My advice to my fellow gentlemen of reddit would be to keep trying and not give up. At least put yourself out there and *ask.* If she says no, then it's probably her loss, and you wouldn't want to date someone that won't at least give you a chance anyway. If she says yes but one of you (or both of you) realize after a few dates that you aren't compatible, then hey, at least you were trying and gained some valuable experience in the process. Nothing wrong with that. 

I was 'sheltered' for years growing up and used to be horrible at talking to girls, so trust me, if I can do it now then so can you! Just have confidence in yourself and in your abilities! The right girl will eventually come along and take notice! I truly believe that *will* happen to me some day if I keep at it, so no reason the same can't be said for any guy reading this.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,977599,public,self,Finally Went Out (Success Story),0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pdn1tf/finally_went_out_success_story/,all_ads,6,,,,

Met in tinder - 2 dates - i came in too hard and strong. She was like uhh were goin too fast at first. Then im not ready for a relationship and blew me off. I said ok and walked away. A month later she texted me hey out of nowhere. 
 I went for a coffee a week later. Then made plans at my place for the second time. Had a good time and indoor Olympics happnd. Next day she left and as she was home - she was like - Why goodbyes are the hardest - Its hurts so bad. I was like damn. She got something for me.  So she moved to another city aftr 3 days. I knew abt that and thats why the goodbye thing came in. 

When she reached there. We strtd texting and talking more .. actually she did all that part - she texts me 3 times a day and calls me when i say im free. 
 
So one day she strtd talking abt other guys she stayed with .. i was like okayy.   (Make me jealous lol ) didn't say that. I just acted normal.  I Said they can entertain you when youre not w me. Then i hang up aftr some talks abt her day . Wht she did.. a guy asked her numbr when she was in the mall. Blah blah.. you knw 😂

Later that night she texted me again. ..... 

I kinda woke up in the middle of the night.  Kinda felt a lot of things. I was kinda overwhelmed with things goin on with my life and i like this girl soo much and distance came in betwern us. 

I STILL DONT KNOW WHY I TEXTED - I MISS YOU SO MUCH.

Aftr that ghhostedd..

Slow replies. 

Takes 11 hours to reply. She has her phone always with her. 
 Gave her space for 3 days 

She replies. But late late. Really late. She is online and still doesn't reply. Posting pictures and doesn't reply. 

Soo.. kinda saw this coming and texted -  let me when i free i will call ya she said in an hour. . And fuckin i slept and forgot to call her. 

Later i texted - you free. She put me on seen. 

I was like...okay .. and then i said i slept and give me a call when free. 

6 hours later .. she was like.. yhh my work is far away from my place.. blah blah i couldn't find time to call you. But i will call ya tmrw. 

Its been 10 days now. Nothing.

I know,this feels like a stupid question to ask. But anyways,I’m a senior in college who likes some a few years younger. He’s 19,while I’m 23.  In my opinion, I don’t think the age difference is that big,but it does seem to be somewhat taboo amongst some of my female peers. I had friends who’d never even date a guy one year younger,which I thought was strange. But I generally assumed most guys wouldn’t care -an attractive women is an attractive women,right? Plus, I have known men who were actually into it and found it an ego boost to have an older girl into you.

Anyways,that was until one of my guy friends completely blew my confidence and told me that good luck if I ever thought a guy a few years younger would date me. He’d just have sex and leave,based on my age. Then he said statistics prove that men don’t want older women and that he’s just trying to tell the truth ,etc. It made me feel horrible,and kinda ruined a lot of my confidence when it it came to my plans to ask this guy out.

Realistically, dating apps are out. Anything with less than a 0.1% rate for just a date is something I want to avoid. I have no doubt it would destroy my self esteem.

IRL poses it's own issues because everything I've been listening to in regard to how women experience just going out in public and dealing with men, makes me want to avoid bothering anyone since I don't have the social competency to know when I'm making someone uncomfortable and I don't feel like I should bother anyone as they're doing their own thing. I'm autistic and I'm not very self aware, so to save from being a fool, I just don't really interact with people if I don't have to...

I just can't really see an avenue to take since I don't want to make anyone uncomfortable and bother them and dating apps just don't work for the vast majority of men given the incredibly low rates to just get a date.

&gt;Oh yeah well you werent really friends. Youre probably evil or misogynist.

Im  friends with many women. Ive never once been told this by anyone or  upset a woman. They generally say Im fun and quiet at first but they  enjoy talking to me and initialize conversations etc. Or my favorite

&gt;Just lower your standards

I  never had standards and neither do most ugly guys. I got a dm after  some girl saw my abs on instagram.(just go to the gym bro) I didnt know  what she looked like. She shows up and is ugly as hell. I dont care and  show no response whatsoever other than the smile and greeting I do  whenever I meet someone new. When she is close enough to see my face she  quickly says shell "" see my around"" and leaves. I never see her again  and she ignores my later texts(I already know youre going to say I  overtext but no I sent 1 or 2 then gave up) asking to hangout. I was  once called ugliest guy in the room and the room was full of ugly guys. I  always see couples and when I walk alone I get worried looks or glares  from women or overhear them say ""theyre no cute guys here"" immediately  after staring at me or something about my hairline. I only go out with  friends now since that seens to stop that from happening. At college  every week I hear women discuss mens looks amd never once have I heard  anything about personality. We could exchange anecdotes all day but Ive  read several well designed papers that I can link - women care about  looks as much as if not more than men in every well-conducted unbiased  study. Any advice that isnt the same old? Also I paid for sex on Monday,  it was awful and only confirmed that I dont want it(I just wanted to  try and see what it was like for my 20th birthday). I literally just  want a girlfriend - not like friends I have in college that ghost if I  even hint Im open to dating but someone I can hold hands with and spoon.
