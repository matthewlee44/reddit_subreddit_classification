Check out the r/ladyboners sub, what do pretty much all the men they post have? HAIR. Its not rocket science people. 

There are studies confirming young women do not like the bald look. Only 16% of women aged 18-24 find bald men attractive. It's 25% for ages 25-34 and 44% for ages 35-44. 

https://www.primandprep.com/do-women-like-bald-men/

Those are horrendous odds for young men. Even men dating women in the 35-44 range have 56% chance of being rejected just based on hair. Not to mention face, height, salary ect.

Using celebrities like the rock, vin diesel ect to encourage balding men is disingenuous. These men are rich and famous. This plays into their appeal. They also have good head shapes which not all men have.

Let's stop discounting young men posting here saying it's over. By all accounts based off of stats and first hand experiences, it very well may be.

I've known this guy online for 5 months and he's part of a group of friends (we all do Discord voicechats together everyday), but it's only been two weeks or so since we started talking privately. This is because he noticed I wasn't feeling well and I found it cute when he tried to cheer me up by changing his status to ""(my name) is the best"". So I want us to be closer because he seems nicer than I thought, as friends for now but who knows.

Anyway, lately, we've had a few one-on-one voicechats that we didn't plan but just happened when the group talked over us and we'd need to go on another voice channel to hear each other. There wasn't any deep talk or flirting, but we were having good laughs or he'd open up about his family problems, and there were zero awkward moments. At one point we started talking about animals and he asked me if I liked flying squirrels, I said yeah sure, and he started sending me every flying squirrel pic he found on google image. I felt confused but I sent pics of my birds in exchange and he loved them.

His behavior towards me changed a little too, originally he wouldn't care about me that much in group voicechats, but now if anyone even slightly pokes fun at me (not in a mean way ofc) he vehemently defends me and demands apologies. It stuck with me, because he's usually the one who pokes fun at his friends. 

Also this morning I woke up and found out he sent me another cute squirrel pic. At 6 am. Which means he thought about me when he woke up.

Thoughts? Also if you're a guy, are you likely to send something to a girl right after you wake up if she's just a friend to you? I don't have much experience so please don't make fun of me haha

Those are horrendous odds for young men. Even men dating women in the 35-44 range have 56% chance of being rejected just based on hair. Not to mention face, height, salary ect.

Using celebrities like the rock, vin diesel ect to encourage balding men is disingenuous. These men are rich and famous. This plays into their appeal. They also have good head shapes which not all men have.

Let's stop discounting young men posting here saying it's over. By all accounts based off of stats and first hand experiences, it very well may be.

I had previously matched with this guy before and even exchanged numbers, we had messaged a bit but even at that time he seemed aloof and as I recall left me on read and we never connected in person.. fast forward several months we match again on bumble, I had sent him a "" Hi"" and I actually didn't really notice what happened with that until one day recently I got a ""rematch"" and it was him, he said he took some time off the app etc. And we exchanged numbers again, he never even really acknowledged that we had previously chatted/ exchanged numbers but I went along.. he text a little more than he previously had and seemed to want to meet, I suggested a park close to my side of town because I figure he should have to drive and make some effort! Well, today we met, he's shorter than I had anticipated.. and he had a beard which didn't look bad but also wasn't in any of his pics. The walk around the park was nice, I didn't feel he was trying very much in the way of making conversation but he's a Leo ( astro sign) and I figure they can be a little serious so I just gave him the benefit of the doubt with that.. it was a short walk, I was having a hard time picking up on his vibe which is rare because I'm really good at reading people. We approached our cars and it seemed like he wanted to hang out a little more and I was still trying to feel him out so I said "" we can walk the park again if you want or it's Friday, we can go grab a beer there's a cute pub nearby"" he said something to the effect of  ""well you past the first test, okay sure"" I noticed some hesitation about getting a beer even though he said yes, I inquired and he said "" well it's because I'm trying to cut down on drinking but okay a beer is fine"" and I said "" oh, we don't have to get beer.. we can just walk the park again"" he declined and said we can get the beer, he tried to suggest going to his side of town ( by where he lives) and I'm like ?? but we're already on this side of town lol so he agrees and we go to the pub. I know you guys will hate me for this but I let him drive which I normally never let anyone drive me, he wasn't driving erratic or anything just kinda.. bad so either he had been drinking already earlier in the day or he's just an awful driver. Anyway we get to the place and he's polite but just kinda serious, not very laughable.. he's engaging in conversation but not really. I was asking this guy about what kind of TV shows he likes to watch and telling him what I like to watch and explaining how I like to watch crime shows and I enjoy the psychology behind it etc. Then things went left, he asked the strangest question.. he asked if I have any sexual fantasies of murdering during sex?! I was like noo lol that's terrible! I told him where intimacy is concerned I'm a passionate person and view that as a spiritual and loving act..then he discloses he's into some bondage/ bdsm stuff but "" not zipper mouth coverings"" or something like that lol I said okay.. good to know but I'm thinking why are we even on this subject on a first date! We were talking about our OLD experiences, he was pretty tight lipped and acted like he never had a bad date except for when he was catfished but didn't even consider it a bad date wtf lol we talked about tinder and he was really advocating almost for people to sleep around as long as you know who you're doing it with, "" like an interview"" lol he said that.. and it kinda felt like that's how he was acting,, like you act in an interview. Anyway,, not directly after this conversation but towards the end of the date he's asking if I want to go back to his place and watch a movie.. I'm like uh, I just met you two hours ago.. I don't think that's appropriate. While we wait for the check he said "" I need a massage"" and I said "" Oh yea? That does sound nice actually"" lol and he asked when the last time I had a massage was.. cringes! ANYWAY, so he drives me to my car and I'm thinking on the car ride back "" did he honestly think I would f*ck him for buying me a beer and a quesadilla?"" LOL I put some watermelon lotion on in the car and he liked it, he was holding my hand and kissing my hand and even kissed me! I told him to message when he got home and he did, he just said ""Home"" and then said "" I enjoyed our time together today 😊""  umm.. okay great, he hasn't unmatched me on bumble but idk I guess I think if a guy is looking for more than a hookup and he's really into you then after a good first meet up you would say more? Or say it's not a fit? So what's the deal reddit, did he just want to get laid? Is he just keeping me on the back burner to try again later? He's not looking for anything serious right?

Let me explain. Whenever I've gotten close to actually getting a gf I always feel scared and in over my head because I'm afraid of losing my privilege to look at other girls or just because I get cold feet. I've talked to my therapist about that and he says that I should go on dates but modern dating culture is just trash frankly because all you do is ask stupid, superficial questions and probably wish you were with friends or freer on that date. I also have the tendency to lose my attraction for girls when they become my friends and I have a lot of female friends and I have feelings for none of them. In terms if what I see myself doing in the future, I just want to travel across Asia nomadically and learn all the languages(im going to start learning Japanese, Chinese, and Thai soon and I want to learn many others including burmese and Indonesian) and live my life as a nomad and I've been interested in reading about them since I was 10 and I've been interested in Chinese culture and possibly living in Asia since I was in middle school and I'm also an anarchist. Anyway, I've always also been really clingy but as I've said, I always get scared when I'm about to enter a monogamous relationship due to me thinking im going to lose my freedom and I frankly don't understand how someone can love the same person for years and years because wouldn't they get boring for them? Idk but I want to experience life and not settle down and my god I don't want to get married and have children. I also think I may be non monogamous since I have always liked more than one girl at once and because I'm scared of losing my independence to look at other girls(I like a lot of different types of girls too so it adds to that) or just live freely. I also like doing chores by myself and I don't like other people's help and I frankly don't think I could have a relationship now due to it being a prison and me having to constantly compromise when I want to live my life as close to 100% how id want because life's too short to bend the knee to others.

It is not a party school, but it lives like a rich party school. I didn’t get into the party school life until I turned 21 (completely different person with a completely different life philosophy before 21), and then, I started out and realized I liked it and I enjoyed talking to girls and I want to have some romantic relationships or some sort of intimate relationships. 

I don’t know how many times I’ve repeated this, but I’ve never been in a relationship, never been on a date, never kissed a girl, and never had sex before or had any sort of intimacy, besides the awkward hugs (don’t say they can’t all be awkward, cause guess what, they have awkward vibes and I’m mirroring positively and confidence). 

I go out, I groom myself in the best way, and I get myself pumped with positivity and think about talking with genuine intentions when I find girls that seem open and receptive, and I go talk to them. But the approaches or conversations always go to fail. It’s always three lines maximum and then they say their piece or do their piece. They either say “I have a boyfriend” but then flirt off with another guy, they say “I’m a lesbian” to get me to go away, or they have friends that do it for them, or they plain-off ignore me or turn the other way. And also, as always, they just always give off body language that they’re not interested (arms crossed, negative facial expression) I respect that and I turn away. I don’t take it too seriously, but I seriously wonder, for God fucking sake, what the fuck is wrong with me? Am I just not their type? Am I really ugly? Am I really just someone that they don’t see anything? Am I that bad that I can’t have a genuine conversation and create any sort of attraction? I may not be a great flirter, but I’m trying. I bought programs on how to talk better, learn how to be receptive when it comes to women’s minds in conversation, I’m trying the best I can. But the worst part, I can’t even get anywhere. There is nothing that gets me to having a great conversation. It’s hi, hello, and bye. It literally sucks. 

I try to prevent the thoughts that my height, my social standing (non-Greek), my race (asian), my skin color (light brown), or even just thoughts of bias stereotypes of guys come in the way of who I am, but I can’t help it. It seriously sucks. I’ve wasted my life on a lot of shit or focused on school, and for once, I want to not be alone and to talk girls, make intimate connections, have fun, and do all the fun stuff. But it just doesn’t happen. It really sucks. I spend most night crying myself to sleep and giving myself Ultimatums (suicide or success). I can’t help myself. I know people say focus on school, focus on the right stuff, but it just made me worse at life. I have nothing good going for me.

I had two relationships and although the first one was amazing when it comes to the girl, her parents were terrible, were fucking up her life and I was anxious because of them and cried almost every other day. We were together for 10 months and after a lots of shit (like death of her father) we had a nasty break-up which was traumatazing for me because of her psychopatic mother, which I knew was crazy for a really long time a should break up with the girl sooner, it would be much better for me. 

And my second relationship was a fuck up at it's finest. I am a non smoker, don't drink too much, don't like cats, am not into BDSM that much (I like some basics, but nothing more)...and she smokes like a pack a day, drinks 5-7 beers a day, has a cat, is really into BDSM and to top it off, she has a bipolar dissorder and depression. After two months she cheated on me (she actually almost cheated on me once before), I found out, fucked up the break up (left her place at 4 a.m. even tho you are not allowed to be outside between 21 p.m. and 5 a.m. in Czechia due to covid and texted her from my home when I got there at 6 a.m.). And I forgot to mentiom that she's my classmate (she's 23) and the guy she cheated on me with is about 43 y.o.... 

So I was just stupid, ignored the huuuge red flags (even my parents telling me both times that this is not a good idea) and it did not help my depression and anxiety...).

(TLDR: coworker tells me she is in a very bad relationship. She shows me some nudes of herself. I kissed her and then she kissed me. Now I feel bad and I can tell she felt a little guilty. What should I do?) Last night I was doing homework and my coworker (her last day of work is tomorrow) called me and said she wanted to just chat. Which is weird because we haven’t ever done that before and we are work friend but we’ve never hanged outside of work before. We were chatting and she was taking about how crazy work is when she casually mentions that she doesn’t want to go inside her apartment because she doesn’t want to see her boyfriends face. I poked at this and she says she sick of him so I said if she wants I can pick her up and we can just drive around and chat. She text her boyfriend if this is ok and he says fine. We were driving when she broke down and told me she is in a very toxic relationship and that they both abuse each other physically. I pulled over and we chatted and I basically told her that they need to stop and find a way to either fix the relationship or she should brake up with him. She said she’s tried but for reason she can’t be alone and move out and he won’t move out because he doesn’t work and he relies on her to live. Then we started looking at the photos on her phone and just laughing having fun but she kept showing me picture of her in her underwear and bra. Then she started showing me picture of her nudes casually. I started getting really horny and petting her a little. Our eyes line up and I slowly leaned in and we made our a little. Then I said sorry and she said it was fine. We start talking about work again when mid sentence she just leans over and starts making out with me. After we chatted and I could tell she was nervous and feeling guilty. I felt bad because I want to help her with her relationship but now I just became the dick that kissed a girl in a relationship.

Then she says this:

Listen I'm scared to hurt you yeah I'm having fun with you very much and it’s feels amazing being with you
But I feel so opaque
My heart feels sealed and locked

When I ask her what she means, 
She says that she wants us to keep meeting and see what happens but I has the fear it will take her long to fall in love.
It turns out It's from the past and it's really unrelated to me.
She said that her heart is afraid of being hurt again, disappointed, broken which is why she is having those problems.

From my experience i struggle to pickup on signals because each women i've came in contact with has majority acted the same, most women around me are held back and sometimes i feel they slightly nervous. I used to think maybe they think i'm ugly or weird to them so they get embarrassed/nervous around me.  I've had a few different types of reactions when locking eyes, ones where they look away sharply/look down, ones where they smile in a weird way maybe flirty idk or maybe they think i'm weird.

It's like i can't put my finger on it but i can most of the time feel some tension or a nervous feeling in majority of these women maybe i come across as a creep idk. 

\-Does it mean anything if a women looks at you in a curious way. Lets say your in a room of 10+ people around a table nd a women curiously looks at you without any other meaning to look that way or is it simply bollox brush it off stuff.

\-I get it often where i'm in situations where women will be caught looking at me but never seem to say anything which leaves me thinking they just wondering why i'm so weird.

\-Whats best way to deal with the situation when someone locks eyes with you and u catch a vibe? Best thing to do without coming off as a right creep?

I would let it bubble up and just jump to conclusion because I wasn't willing to have one second of discomfort to talk about it then and there. I learned after repeated failures in dating that something as simple as communicating could easily change the direction of things.

However, it has to be a two-way street or it's never going to work. This is my deal now, I've learned to be healthier with the way I communicate. However, I'm noticing a pattern with the people in the dating world. When the topic of communication comes up, they're all for it, yes communication is great, I eat communication for breakfast. Then when it comes around to the communication part, I feel like I'm the only one communicating and the other person got stranded on an island.

*Silly but very stupidly real examples:* 

**Scenario 1:**

Date: \*calls me during a meeting midday\*

Me: Hey, sorry I missed your call. Was in a meeting, do you mind if we move our phone calls later in the day? I usually have meetings at this time.

Date: Oh, sorry I had no idea. I'll call you later next time.

Me: Thanks for understanding!

&amp;#x200B;

**Scenario 2:**

Me: \*calls date during a meeting midday\*

Date: Hey, I'll call you back later. 

Me: Sure, no worries.

(Next time it happens)

Me: \*calls date during a meeting midday\*

Date: \*Ghosts me\*

Me: Everything okay?

(Responds a day later) Date: Yup

\*Tension builds up and I have no idea why, thus leading to ghosting\*

I’ve (F29) been seeing this guy (M30) for over three months now. Within three weeks of meeting we decided to get off the apps and just see each other (his idea). About a week ago we had “the talk” and established we are a couple. 

Now. I start to feel the ghosts of my last relationship catching up to me, and my trust issues are starting to resurface...

He seems like the best man. He honestly hasn’t done a single thing to make me question him... other than owning a cellphone. Other than me spending the night at his place and him getting up for work at 6 am, and me noticing his snap score go up by 2. 

Automatically my mind goes. Who is he sending good morning snaps to at 6 am....

I’ve also noticed at times he seems secretive with his phone. Sometimes he will say who texted him (I’ve never asked who he’s communicated with). The other odd time I feel like he shifts his position so I wouldn’t be able to see. 

I spent 8 years with a man that gaslit me, talked to other girls behind my back, and lied directly to my face, even after being caught in a lie. At 30, I’m not looking to be wasting any more of my time. 

It is early in this relationship and I hate the idea of having to question who he’s texting. I don’t want to scare him off. And I also realize these trust issues start with me.. I’m feeling stuck on his to approach this situation.

I feel like this topic is brought up a lot, but here's another one. I (20M) have known this girl (20F) for over a year. We started out as friends and became closer and really good friends. After the first quarantine, we started talking loads more, messaging, snaps, phone etc about everything. I eventually told her I liked her, and she said she felt the same, but for now we should stay as friends and see where the future takes us. A few months later after that, she got a boyfriend. I wasn't hurt or upset, but I felt a bit down, but eventually, more or less, got over it. We saw each other a few times towards the end of the year and it was great.

She broke up with her boyfriend and it all started between us again, and I didn't try to force anything, if anything I felt it was her who was trying to rekindle whatever we had, and I liked it. At this point, it was another quarantine and we were in different countries, but we once again were very close and playful/flirty with each other, more-so than before and it felt really good. Despite some ups and downs, overall, I felt it was something special between us, and we both felt the same way as per what she was telling me, and what I would tell her. Eventually, I felt things start to change a little. She was a bit different sometimes, but still very close and all, so I tried not to think much of it. Still telling each other nice things and goodnight messages and cute words every now and then.

I then find out on a post she made, she's back with her ex. I don't think I need to comment on what I felt. Of course I never thought she owed me anything, because even though she apparently had the same feelings to me as i did to her, we were still just good friends and didn't want to rush into anything, but the things that were said aren't something normal friends say to each other, and naturally I would feel hurt and upset.

I was upset and eventually talked to her about it, and we cleared the air a bit because I thought that it was the right thing to do. She said she was sorry and sorry that she didn't say anything before. I told her she shouldn't apologize and I'm happy for her and at the end of the day I want to keep being friends, but looking forward I think we should just stay friends, nothing more.

Even though I don't want anything more than a friendship with her anymore, I can't say I'm over her at all. I don't want to be with her anymore, but the thoughts and emotions and the memories overwhelm me sometimes and just think why? The thought that I may have been used as a rebound or whatever really hurts, even though she says that wasn't the case and it wasn't fake at all, because she 'knows how it feels' and would never play with someones feelings.

Things were okay again, I saw her and we were cool and good friends, and I was trying my best to be normal and a friends, and it did feel natural.

A few weeks later (very recently), I told her for some reason I want to get over her, and I was an emotional wreck when telling her and I think I handled it very badly. But she said she's sad she can't help me, and sometimes blames herself which isn't fair (that is the last thing I want her to do). She says she knows we used to talk more in the past, but she said 'things have changed, and she's trying to focus on other things, and that she didn't make me like her, and she was acting normal with me'. I totally understand her, but she wasn't being 'normal' with me, we were flirty with each other a lot, talk about everything and admitted feelings and thoughts for our future together were there.

I found myself too weak to say any of this to her, and decided to just tell her i wanted to just tell her I want to get over her, so we can stay friends for the future and that's all, and proceeded to tell her that I'm always here for here etc.

I don't want to feel the way I feel for her anymore, I don't want to date her anymore, if possible I just want to be friends and feelings to go and that's it, but the hurt and sadness and remembering is sometimes too much. She said she understands why I felt a bit hurt when I found out she had gotten back with her ex, so I think she understands why I feel a bit hurt, but I don't know or even think it matters. I just want to get over, I don't want to cut her off, but maybe that's me clinging on. I don't know what to do anymore.

Part of me thinks I just need to wait until I meet another girl who is actually right for me, and actually fall for someone else to help me realize that I was stupid to cling onto this girl for so long, but I don't know how long that will take or if it will happen.

Some days all I can think about is how I'm a complete failure in the dating department. Not for a lack of trying mind you. When I was at university I joined social clubs as people on reddit said that's the best way to meet like minded people. I was too nervous to approach any woman there out of fear of coming across as a creep, and so nothing happened as no women approached me.

I've tried every free dating app under the sun but never got a match. I've even been clubbing numerous times in a attempt to maybe just dance with a woman but no luck.

I work out daily, I have hobbies, I have pets and I have friends. But still the thought of being lonely and touch starved gets to me. I wish I could just move on a forget about romance and intimacy but it's impossible. I just don't understand how the vast majority of guys find getting their first kiss so easy. My law degree is easier than this shit.

She and I bonded pretty fast and got to ask each other a lot of questions and talk about everything in life and we connected pretty good. When it came to like asking about relationships and dating and all that, she and I both mutually agreed that “we don’t date based on physical looks alone and also value other stuff” etc etc. I really was happy to hear that from her and things were going fine from there. Then randomly after we exchanged face pics of each other she got sleepy and tired she told me she was going to bed and stuff and then next morning she disappeared completely and didn’t even text me “good morning” as she usually does and didn’t even read my texts on iMessage or anything (still shows as Delivered). As of today she still has not replied to any of my social media messages or phone texts.

The last I checked, she and I exchanged pics of each other before that and she saw my pic then decided to slow down her replies I noticed. Is she ghosting really because of lack of physical attraction? Or because she seems like a natural ghoster for no reason?

I work in very close proximity with two coworkers who are older and more susceptible to covid, as well as seeing my older parents very frequently. I really only go to work and the grocery store but I don’t want to completely close the door on dating. 
I am willing to meet up with people if an emotional connection is established/ there is good conversation. But it seems like people just want to meet up right away and ghost me when I say it’s not something I’m comfortable with until we get to know each other a bit better.
It’s kind of a red flag to me, safety wise, if someone is eager to meet up after less than a day of stilted conversation. How many other people are they meeting up with etc? Are they really being safe?
I met someone online last fall and agreed to go on a masked walk outdoors after he assured me that he is very cautious when it comes to distancing and mask wearing etc. We had good chemistry over text and things seemed good.
We met up and he didn’t bring a mask but we had enough room to socially distance while we walked and I still wore my mask. He made some comment about all his coworkers not wearing them  and not being good about distancing. It left me a little leery but I know that I’m more on the cautious side than others.
Well, to top of the cake, he tried to kiss me at the end of the night (while I was wearing a mask LOL) I swerved the kiss and told him I didn’t think it would work. He was perplexed and upset :/ but I don’t think I was being unreasonable. It made it seem like he was lying to me about being safe/prioritizing safety and it kind of put me off OLD.
I just matched with a guy a day or two ago and conversation was nice! We didn’t really talk about much of substance but he asked me to hang out today. I told him that I wasn’t comfortable meeting up until we had talked a bit more and he said we can talk in person.
I don’t really know what to do. It makes me wonder if I’m better off waiting to date until I’ve gotten vaccinated or my coworkers/parents have gotten vaccinated.
I feel like I might be unreasonable and over cautious but I’m young and healthy and feel like I would be asymptomatic and just unknowingly spread it to everyone I care about who could actually get really sick. 
Is there a better way to navigate this? Should I just quit OLD until things are looking up? Are there people out there willing to digitally date until a connection is established?

It is just that those girls in high school are still going strong and are still the most desired, and I can't help but think that everyone is shallow.

I don't have much of a date life since guys don't like me, and since they don't like me and reject me I don't like them either but dating sounds like fun if it is with the right person.

I’m not sure if this is the right place for this question but I wasn’t sure where else to ask. 

What is considered sexual assault? 

I had a situation with a guy i was dating a couple years back that I keep on thinking about. It wasn’t until months after I’d stopped seeing the person that I realized I might’ve been sexually assaulted? 

But I feel like I’m not allowed to say it was assault because 1) I wasn’t raped 2) I saw him afterwards 3) Lots of things were ‘mutual’. 

When I say I feel like I’m not allowed I just mean when processing the situation, (I’m still processing), I just don’t know what to label that memory as. Honestly, sometimes it’s really hard to even think about. I hide behind humor when talking about it but I dont know, considering I can’t even think about it maybe I should take it more seriously? 

Two situations happened: (I’ll keep it short):

He wanted to kiss but I didn’t want too, so he wrapped his arms around me and pulled me in and I tried to push him off but I couldn’t because he was too strong. (he was bigger than me, taller than me, older than me, and stronger than me). But I eventually gave in because I didn’t know what else I was supposed to do. He wouldn’t let go. 

The second thing that happen, was we were outside and he exposed himself to me from behind. Without my permission. It was scary and I didn’t know what to do. It was one of those ‘frozen in fear’ moments I guess? Because I didn’t want people to see and for him to get in trouble. Which I know now wasn’t my responsibility to worry about. It’s over now and I’m fine (I guess).

The thing is at the time I didn’t think anything of it. I guess I chalked it up to an accident? &amp; I did see him afterwards. It wasn’t until months later that I realized maybe this was wrong? 

Also, I’ve been physically, emotionally &amp; sexually abused in the past and I think sometimes my brain doesn’t process ‘trauma’ properly? I’m not sure if that’s a thing.

as time went on she became even friendlier, flirtatious, arm touching, complements, comparing me to how I'm better than these other guys . ( I'm not but hey her words). 
 
I thought nothing of it, until I was added to the work group chat, she took my number from there and private messaged me, we got talking.

we spoke regularly for a week, her responding very quick, long responses, night time, day times, mornings you name it she was messaging, sending lil videos and voice notes.

she was flirting, she openly said she loves talking to me.

randomly from tuesday/wednesday her message intervals grew slightly, n became shorter. but then
on Thursday night she messaged me saying she missed me at work, I  played a April fools joke on whatsapp saying I'm keeping, she was devastated and said she's gna miss me so much. 

told her it's a joke, she was relieved, sent me a tiktok video, I responded back with a nice tiktok video.


she read it Friday morning, since then no response, she wasn't online a whole day, been online a few times since, reD the group chat and still not responded.



what do I do, iv waited almost two days, please don't say leave it if she doesn't, iv now fallen for her, I cant get her out my mind.

iv read plenty online where they say hey if she's not responding in two days she's not interested....

but I didnt initiate this, she did! iv not let my guard down for 3 years since my last break up, trust me when I say I didnt want this to happen...

should I text her? does she want me to chase her or back off? is there no reward in persistence?

Our online convo has been amazing.  He says all the right things.  We exchange pics and videos.

However, this has been going on for a month.  We made arrangements to meet and then he couldn’t because of his children’s schedules had changed.  I completely believe him.  But no future plans have been made.  And he even said he really enjoys “the pace”.  Which I agree,....with to an extent.  

I have been so neglected that I just need someone to genuinely touch me.  I don’t want to rush him either.   I have started to romanticize the relationship without even meeting him.  I wouldn’t even care about this if the convo wasn’t great but he has checked all the boxes that I’d want in a partner.  

I told him today that I am romanticizing the relationship and I’ve placed him on a pedestal without even having my needs met.  I said I need to create space so that I can lower my expectations.  He understood and said “I’ll be there when you’re ready, I don’t want to let you down in anyway”.

I went on my first ever date today! I'm \[M\] in my late 20's and have severely lacked confidence in the past, but I've been working on myself over the past few years (Working out / careers gains) and have gained a lot more confidence so this a pretty big step for me.

The date went fine with pleasant small talk but it was pretty clear after 1 hour of walking and talking that we mutually didn't connect on that level. However she seemed like a really nice genuine person and her brought dog which made things really easy, she also did a good job of keeping thing flowing when I was struggling to find the next question haha.

I was thinking of sending her a message thanking her for a nice walk. I might also throw in something in like ""Thanks for a nice walk today. I'm pretty new to all this but thanks for making things easy for me, you are dead easy to talk to, hope I wasn't to awkward, still working on that haha"".

Just curious what you guys think about this message? A female perspective on this would be much appreciated! thanks",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,695330,public,self,messaging to say thanks after unsuccessful date?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mjdy42/messaging_to_say_thanks_after_unsuccessful_date/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,
