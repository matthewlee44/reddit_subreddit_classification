So we start casually dating, and then she meets somebody and they start dating. He fades away, and then she meets another dude, and they start dating. She says to just be patient, and trust the process.

I'm super annoyed at this, but I'm just going to play it cool. I feel like I'm just being strung along though, and that what if this new guy fades away, and she meets a different guy and they start dating, and then they brake up, and she never decides to make us exclusive?

&amp;#x200B;

Then what really makes me upset is that I watched her kid the other day so she could rest because she was feeling sick. I walk in on her talking on the phone to this other guy she is dating. So I feel like I'm being taken advantage of, and that she should have been resting.

She jokingly made a comment about staying home and watching our future children, and even as a joke, it bothered me.

2. She might have a problem with alcohol. I‚Äôve noticed that our first few dates revolved around lots of alcohol, which isn‚Äôt usually the case for me‚Äî not a big drinker or partyer. She usually drinks more than me. And she recently got trashed at a party and drunk-dialed me, which made me uncomfortable. I did some light internet stalking and found her Twitter, and every other tweet was about getting drunk or partying. 

The dilemma: 
She‚Äôs kind, thoughtful, attentive, and affectionate; she makes me feel special. The physical chemistry is great too. It‚Äôs nice to share intimacy. Dating is hard, and I‚Äôve finally found someone I enjoy being around. HOWEVER, there are red flags.

**tl;dr: aromantic, lonely, zero friends, don't want to date in the traditional sense, depressed?, want friends, how? help**

I'm aromantic. This means that while I do enjoy and seek out sex, I do not feel romantic attraction towards other people. That being said, I do feel strong platonic feelings towards my friends. I currently however do not have friends.

I am 28 years old. Somehow I had friends in high school. I went out of state to college and all 4 years were miserable since I had no friends. NONE. IN THE ENTIRE 4 YEARS OF COLLEGE. I am introverted, nerdy, and I feel like I do not get along with most people. I'm nice, but I don't ""click"" with a majority of people. I feel like they're too extraverted, or we don't share the same vision of fun. I feel this is why I don't have any friends. It's almost as if everyone is going left and I'm the only one going right. It's been very very hard to make friends.

Given that I didn't make a single friend in the entire 4 years of college, and currently have no friends in my graduate program, I feel that I will always have no friends.

I know already I don't want to date in the traditional sense. I don't want a boyfriend, I don't want a husband, I just want a friend. I want someone I can trust, I want someone I can laugh with and share funny stories or pictures. I want someone to vent to. I want to also be there for someone to vent on. I want to be there to support someone. I want to be able to swap secrets. I want to invite someone to do things. I want to have this type of friendship with someone.

But, I don't even have any friends at all. And the older I get, the more people will be interested in dating me versus just being my friend, or people will already be paired up and not have an opening for the type of friend I want. It's already happening. People in my graduate program who are coupled up are spending more time with their partner than their friends, and of course they are, it makes sense, but that means there are less available people out there for me to just be friends with to the degree I desire. I really just want one friend. Kind of like a partner, but without being a partner, just being a friend.

And I feel that the older I get, the more certain it is that I will forever be alone since everyone will be partnered up and there will be no one left to fit the friend description I want.

I don‚Äôt know if I'm depressed, and I won't say if I am or am not since I haven't been diagnosed. But what I can say is that having no friends for the past decade has severely impacted me in almost every aspect of my life. I don't like laughing by myself. I don't like being happy and having no one to share it with. I have searched up similar posts on reddit about being lonely and am usually disappointed since the poster says that they have no friends other than a husband/wife/family/one friend. I legitimately have no one. And I see that this will just continue for the rest of my life. What kind of life is that, to just wake up miserable every day and know that there is no one there for you, no one to laugh with, no one to do anything with, no one to talk to after a rough day, no one to care when it's your birthday, no one to even care if you're alive, just no one. I don't even have anyone to put on my emergency contacts.

I guess I'm asking this subreddit: what can I do? I want to ""date"" for friends, but how do I do it? I don't get along with most people. I guess you can say I get a general ""sense"" within a few seconds of meeting someone that determines if we're going to get along or not. I'm usually right. It's like they give off this electricity that I'm instantly attracted to and I know we'll get along. If it's a mutual electric moment is another story. I do have acquaintances, but they aren't actual friends. I don't talk to them outside of school, and even then sometimes it's just a nod. I certainly don't trust them and I could already tell we're different enough that we wouldn't be good friends. I know friends don‚Äôt have to be identical to me, but it'd be nice to have a friend where at least my version of fun is their version of fun, so we can have fun together. But these acquaintances are too extraverted or we don't have the same idea of fun. They're nice people, but not what I'm looking for.

Also, please no one say that I'm actually not aromantic and am actually looking for a boyfriend but just not calling it that. I know what I am, and it took a lot of thinking and self-realization to get there, so please don't disregard that.

Last thing: I did try to make friends with someone who I felt that electric connection with. It was a guy. I am a girl. You can see where this is going. I asked for their number, they gave it, I said no pressure if they didn't want to hang out. Of course they never texted me back. I feel like I really could have been friends with this person, but he probably thought I was hitting on him and wasn't interested, which isn't what it was at all. I also invited someone else over to play video games. Again, this person declined, and I think it was because he also thought I was interested in him and he already had a girlfriend. But I'm not interested in them like that, it's not even possible for me, I just want friends. Also, I tend to feel that ""electric"" connection I'm talking about with guys, like 99% of the time it's with guys, and I think it's just because the guys around me have more similar interests to me than the girls around me.

So, even when I am trying to make friends and stretch out a bit, it still doesn't work, and it makes me feel worse like I have a neon sign over my head saying ""AVOID"" or ""FREAK"" on it. Not that it's relevant, but I would consider myself average looking (face=average, body=above average). Maybe this is useful information for you to know. It's happened in the past at least where I've attracted a guy and I thought he wanted to be genuine friends but really he just wanted to get in my pants.

4\~ months later I reached out as I was in her neighborhood and asked if she wanted to grab a coffee/tea and she agreed. I was happy to meet and talk to her in person as we chatted for about an hour and went our ways. Few days later and several attempts of me asking if she wanted to hang out or grab lunch, she had reasons that kept her days busy so we didn't meet up afterwards. I stopped trying assuming that maybe she wasn't interested after the first meet. I wouldn't say she is making an excuse to avoid me, but its possible that she is busy and i just had bad timing. 

A month went by without any conversation as I didn't know what else I could talk about other than the small talk. As she never initiated the conversation, surprisingly she reached out 2 nights ago asking ""How goes it? Getting bored of this \*city\* yet?""   
As she asked the question I was able to follow up with additional chit chatting as we haven't spoken in a month.

I asked her today if she was doing anything and she said ""cleaning"". So I followed up with if she wanted to grab tea today, but she said maybe next time. I get it, sunday is typically chore day. I typically do my laundry every sunday. I guess for her, sunday could be cleaning day.

As much I am interested in getting to know her and really wanting to be in a relationship with her as i've been out of a relationship for quite some time, it doesn't seem like she has much interest in me yet or it could be she is also introverted.

We went on four dates. The dates were fun, yes but I didn‚Äôt get a spark or anything. I never got that excited feeling when he‚Äôd message me and didn‚Äôt get butterflies. I get that you don‚Äôt need a spark but it was just an awkward feeling between us. On the 5th date, we went on a hike. We came back to his truck and he wrote in big letters ‚Äúwill you be my girlfriend‚Äù I thought it was so sweet but I panicked because it felt too soon and said yes because I didn‚Äôt want to hurt his feelings which was STUPID of me. *I KNOW THIS*

Now I‚Äôve still been seeing him doing bf/gf stuff. He IS a great guy, caring, thoughtful, wants the same things as me. We hike together and go on adventures. He has great qualities. Yet I find myself getting annoyed by his weird quirks and his social awkwardness. I find myself annoyed at his humor, how he‚Äôs shorter and weighs less than me (it is my preference that the guy is taller, don‚Äôt hate... I *try* to move past it). I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong with me. I should be excited and happy that I‚Äôm with this guy but I don‚Äôt feel that way. 

I now find myself not enjoying when we kiss because he doesn‚Äôt use tongue at all. I tried to teach him and he still doesn‚Äôt know how. The sex isn‚Äôt that great and I feel like he tries too hard to be into what I like. I can tell he‚Äôs very submissive (the comments he‚Äôs made suggests it) while I like really dominate guys in bed. When he tries to be dominate, I can‚Äôt take him seriously at all. 

I‚Äôm a really independent person and he seems to be clingy, to me anyway. Our 1 month anniversary, he asked me if we could live together in September when his lease is up. He said he wants a place with a yard for his dog, and that I also want a place with a yard for my dog so it would be perfect. But I already live at a house with a yard for my dog. He said we could get a place closer to my work and my favorite gym would be nearby. I felt like he was trying to convince me that it would be a good idea. I FREAKED OUT!!! 

My friends said that he just knows what he wants, and that the time is right for him but obviously not right for me. I feel like he‚Äôs rushing this because he just turned 29, and he said all of his friends are married already...

Ill start with a little context I‚Äôm 25 and I have been lucky enough to travel a lot. I‚Äôve been to every state, backpacked ireland switzerland and turkey and my current job i travel anywhere east of colorado every weekend doing events. This weekend took me to Missouri. 

Get to the hotel its much nicer than I‚Äôm used to and the girl at the counter is mad cute. Straight my type she‚Äôs got this librarian vibe going on i really dig it. I walk up to the counter involuntarily say ‚Äúthose glasses are the dorkiest but cutest things i‚Äôve seen.‚Äù She‚Äôs giggling, theres these two older ladies next to us doing this polite argue over who pays for the room i say something to them and they laugh this girl is now giving me the anime eyes. She says something like ‚Äúyou travel a lot?‚Äù And i play it a bit low saying ‚Äúi been a place or two‚Äù our eyes are locked now she cant stop giggling she‚Äôs playin with her hair a bit. I‚Äôm in my heading thinking ‚Äúfuck if this were any other context im taking this girl on a date right now. We‚Äôre going somewhere anywhere.‚Äù


Go up to my room come back down to grab dinner. There she is coat in hand leaving for the day she‚Äôs talking to her coworker. I see her smile say ‚Äúhey‚Äù and leave. I hear her say bye real fast and those heels clattering against the pavement as she runs up to me and says some shit about the weather. I turn she‚Äôs giving me those same anime eyes and in my head ‚Äúdate now. She comes on date now.‚Äù And i kinda ask some questions screening it then i go to say it. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm grabbing some food you can come‚Äù and my mouth says ‚Äúaight i‚Äôm heading out bye‚Äù


The sheer look of disappointment. I swear man i will never forget it. I was kicking myself in my mind finally tried to salvage it ‚Äúyou work tomorrow?‚Äù And she lit up a bit told me exactly what times and gave me her name. I never saw her again.



She should be mad at me she did everything she could and i dropped the ball. I wasted the opportunity to meet an amazing girl and she a guy she was clearly into: ruined a romantic comedy weekend for the both of us.

Perhaps I still just need to meet the right person and when they come along I'll start cracking jokes and making fun observations and feel amazing. Although maybe I haven't met the right person because I haven't been doing those things.

So a bit of background information, my bf and I have been together almost 5 months (both teens almost young adults) and we‚Äôve been having a few issues here and there but I don‚Äôt exactly want to leave him even if we argue more than I‚Äôd like. With this recently we got into an argument because he likes to stream but even with us living in the same timezone it is typically not during good times for me because I was either working (before my injury that forced me on medical leave) or I was just tired and/or not in the mood to watch. I do typically try to support and watch him but I really haven‚Äôt been able to set time aside to watch it because I‚Äôm usually busy. The argument started a few days ago when I was over his house and he started streaming (I believe he had about 3 of his friends and me watching him at the time) and I was watching him play but I took the time to check my phone since he rarely lets me use my phone without getting upset that I‚Äôm not focusing on him enough or peaking over my shoulder even though he blocked any guy friend I had prior to us being together. He got mad because I accidentally missed him winning the first match and didn‚Äôt say ‚Äúgood job babe‚Äù or anything (yes his exact words basically). While I get it‚Äôs important to support your s.o‚Äôs in what they like to do, I wasn‚Äôt trying to be rude or anything and I thought it would have been enough to let him play games instead of lying with me and watching a movie and although I‚Äôm not a huge fan of games like he is I tried to show interest in what he likes. He said he‚Äôs gonna quit streaming since I ‚Äúdon‚Äôt care‚Äù about what‚Äôs important to him and ‚Äúit doesn‚Äôt matter‚Äù when he does something he enjoys. Again his words not mine. 

So after that ramble here‚Äôs the important piece that happened last night. I was feeling down because of all the pain I‚Äôve been feeling lately and with the info that I‚Äôm a female you can guess what also is happening and  I don‚Äôt really open up much but I decided to give some hints that something was wrong. He got upset that he didn‚Äôt get a goodnight text but after giving clear signs I was upset he just said ‚ÄúOtay‚Äù (his cute way of saying okay for those of you who don‚Äôt have ‚Äúcouple talk). I decided to just go to bed without saying another word because I was just being ignored by that point. When he told me he feels like I don‚Äôt care I apologized numerous times and tried to make it better so he doesn‚Äôt feel that way, which some people have told me it sounds like he‚Äôs manipulating me into doing what he pleases based on previous behavior and it only comes up when we argue never any other time.

So my question is, why would he just blow off me showing I‚Äôm upset about something if he claims he does so much for me to make me comfortable and he says he always puts me first? Is it fair that after I accidentally made him feel like his passion doesn‚Äôt matter that he does this?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,779149,public,self,Kinda venting but kinda just looking for advice...,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nebuse/kinda_venting_but_kinda_just_looking_for_advice/,all_ads,6,,,,,

Is there a chance that she might like me back?

Backstory: some colleagues and I go running every week and before Christmas, one of my female colleagues, we are fairly close and I can say that we are friends outside work too, had invited her twin sister, let‚Äôs call her A, to join the run club as they had plans for after that. I didn‚Äôt have much opportunities to talk to A because obviously we were running and they didn‚Äôt stay much for drinks after the run but also I‚Äôm fairly shy and need time to feel comfy with the people around me. But anyway she still tried to show me her plants and her DIY and seemed to always engage with what I had to say in the group conversation. It‚Äôs safe to say that I quite liked her. She seemed really nice and down to Earth person, with lively personality. She‚Äôs a doctor and also I found her quite attractive. Even I find her more attractive than her sister, with who I work, because A seems to have more mature features. 

After the run I followed her on Strava and she followed me back almost immediately and since then she would give me kudos without a fail to every activity I record. I even once tagged her in a comment of my activity making a joke about her half marathon time and how I was trying to beat it. She replied again quickly and her response was quit positive.

I have been thinking about her a lot since then and last night I had a dream where we were just going somewhere as friends and at some point I finally kissed her. 

I really want to get to know her better but I‚Äôm thinking that following her on Instagram might be too much and even how do I take it from there if she accepts?

So what I did was we had to fill class register each morning, so by looking at the position where she sat in class I could determine what her name was by the time it got to me by counting the number of people it had passed through. I then wrote this name down. I waited in eagerness for the evening to come so im back home so i could search it. 

I searched throughhhh all over from facebook to insta till I eventually found it. Instagram is handy too cause if you know someone who has had close contact with that girl, you can easily go through their follower list to find  that girl. 

Another way of finding people is using zoom(our classes/labs are mixed now some on zoom some in person) , taking down all the names and eliminating the ones that are unlikely and searching ones that are possible on google. Doing this can lead to you finding their twitter/instagram handles and it honestly feels satisfying and worth the tedious amount of time it can take

So my boyfriend has a Reddit account. Just so y‚Äôall know I don‚Äôt care if he watches porn or anything like that. Because I do too. But recently he I was searching something through his safari tab and I saw a only fans link. The thing is I don‚Äôt really care as much but I don‚Äôt feel like I am desired the way that I make him...He doesn‚Äôt ask me for nudes or anything like that. I have just sent the amount of random(mind you his excuse that I told him last year that I wasn‚Äôt into it) but I sent him pictures two weeks ago, a week ago and even Sunday so I don‚Äôt know why that is excuse for him now. Well I asked to see his read it and he fought so hard for me not to see it and he said that I was going to look stupid because I wasn‚Äôt going to find anything. Little does he know I have a Reddit account to and I know about the history tab. Well I saw that he was up voting a bunch of videos&amp;
Pictures for them to send to him. And he showed me his browser history and he actually clicked on those. His excuses that he didn‚Äôt get any of them but the problem is is that he did it and clicked on it with the intent of it might happening. And I know that he does not want me to do the same so it hurt my confidence in my self-esteem twice as much as Had already felt like he wasn‚Äôt really fully attracted to me. Mind you I‚Äôm not an ugly person at all. But he doesn‚Äôt really try as much as I do. And I want to tell me have sex is if I initiate it. Like I‚Äôve been with him almost all week and he has been looking at shit like this for the past two or more days. Like I was with him Thursday and he had no really really much want to sleep with me. And I confronted him about it and he said it wasn‚Äôt like that. But Friday he was looking at all these and wanting these photos...And he just told me that he just gets horny during work...But I don‚Äôt get why I can‚Äôt be that way with me when I‚Äôm around.

I'd expect the younger girls be more flakey.

I have a job that pays decently but it‚Äôs not as much as I would be making if I was in the field I went to school for. To top it all off I still live at home, because I‚Äôm saving up to move out of state, it doesn‚Äôt make sense to throw away money renting a place here *and* I was born with a mild physical disability.

This is an oversimplification but in my opinion it boils down to three main things 

1. Looks
2. Finances
3. Personality 

Any combination of *at least* two of these things is enough. Though when you‚Äôve only got one and it‚Äôs third on the list, it‚Äôs not going to get you very far. 

Obviously, if the physical attraction isn‚Äôt there on at least some level all you have is a friendship. I don‚Äôt fault women for wanting to be attracted to their partner. This is a big reason why some of my dates have cited they don‚Äôt feel a spark.

Putting my own feelings aside looking at it objectively I don‚Äôt bring much of anything to the table when it comes to wooing a woman. So even though it hurts like hell it‚Äôs not surprise no one has wanted to pursue a serious relationship with me.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,779812,public,self,What Women Want,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nemw1a/what_women_want/,all_ads,6,,49223cde-abc9-11e9-b518-0ee41f1cd37e,dark,,

We make eye contact a few times before it was my turn to load my groceries and I was pretty sure she was interested in me. 

At first when we greeted each other I wasn‚Äôt in the mood to talk but I remained warm towards her. 

Then when I started mingling with her and having a light conversation , her energy started to come across very different than I had imagined it was before the conversation. 

I walked away confused and I‚Äôm wondering , and am I overly confident or am I a victim of mixed signaling.

Even if you‚Äôre ugly like me, a handful of them will look good.

2) When you get a match you‚Äôre attracted to, ask her out relatively quickly. My rule of thumb is basic ice breaking chitchat, ask her out for coffee, then ask to exchange numbers to make it a plan. Once you have her number, solidify that date.

3) First date show up early looking like your best self. Be 100 percent honest on your date. If you‚Äôre a loser, already know how you‚Äôll answer tough questions. Remember, relationships are built on trust so if you live at home with mom, and she asks, be honest (worded in a way that you‚Äôre working on it.

4) Hug your date right when you meet her. This breaks the touch barrier right off the bat.

They start seeing past their beauty to their ugly actions, their ugly personality, their ugly worldview. And they see clearly for the first time. They see the magnificence of Versailles for what it is. An image used to control others for their own benefit.

But the truth is everyone does that. Everyone uses beautiful images and beautiful words to control people. Then everybody has an ugly side of them too.
