I (26M) have a had a lot of time to grow this past year + after ending an abusive and toxic 5 year relationship at the beginning of 2021.

&amp;#x200B;

Took me a while to really develop my worth from the ground up again, but I'm really happy with the progress I've made this year. Losing weight, quitting smoking, improving my diet and gaining a lot of life long friends in a short amount of time. My creative endeavours of producing and photography have never been better, I've created work that I'm beyond happy with in a short period of time, shit that used to take me years. The progress that I've seen has seriously made me happy. I have more interesting stories from last year than I ever have had in my life previously and I am honestly so grateful for it. From almost being stranded 1600 km's from home, unprovoked fights at the movies, first time trying psychedelics, Vegas as a whole. Seriously in like a 8-12 month span I really feel like I fucking lived. I hold a pretty decent job as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now here's the thing - and I've always been like this too - I'm dog shit at dating and I genuinely get stressed hooking up for the first few times. Out of like the 6 girls that wanted to hook up only 1 actually happened because I stopped the rest right when it was about to happen. It takes me a while to build up the courage for this stuff. I've tried online dating for months and hardly get any interest, or won't bother to stay interested or try to even initiate a conversation over text. It's the beginning that I'm horrible with. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 6'5, I do get compliments when I'm out, my friends always tell me I could pull girls but it's not my thing. I think I may be a bit standoffish, always have received comments from girls like ""I always thought you were intimidating, but you're actually really nice."" I think I'm just a pretty serious guy and it comes off like that. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried online dating for a while now. Tried paying for subscriptions. I really feel like I don't get too much interest as a person. I've been told that it must be my profile, I've taken recommendations from other girls, friends etc. Most recommendations I've been given suggest that appearing very generic is the way to go, and I've seen it work in real time with a few buddies which is a little discouraging. It's just not who I am. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just have a lot of niche interests like record collecting, photography, art book collecting, vintage electronics &amp; video games, shit that I just haven't seen in a partner. Which is honestly fine! I would never expect someone to share the exact same interests anyways but it does feel like it leads to a disconnect sometimes.

&amp;#x200B;

So now I have a date coming up, with someone who I think is 21, someone that I actually don't text at all, can tell she might have some similar interests with film and maybe music... But that's all I'm going off of. She's cute. I asked her out, she said yes, I gave a time and date and that's really all... 

&amp;#x200B;

Already though I've been running through situations in my head where she thinks I'm either weird or off-putting and honestly I think I put too much emphasis on being accepted by girls when on paper I don't really care what people think of me.

&amp;#x200B;

Should I continue with the date or call it off? Can you shake me back to normal and call me an idiot for thinking of cancelling on this pretty girl?

This is something I've been wrestling for a while, and really had no idea how to go about it anymore, so here I am. (**TL;DR** below)  
Basically, there is this girl that I began talking with early in the school year, like around September or so. Shortly after I began to grow feelings for her alongside becoming closer friends. By around October we were pretty close, we hung out and did things together. We got along extremely well, probably one of the people who understood me the most in a while. All the while it felt like she was into me as well. It was just through small things, she sat close to me, our shoulders or legs would touch each other; didn't break eye contact; genuinely enjoyed hanging with me. She gifted me a bracelet she made for Christmas, I gave her a CD and some earrings in return.

It was around the third time we did something, around early January, that I was confident to ask her if she was interested enough in going out with me. She turned me down and told me she was lesbian. It was something I suspected would happen, I only took the shot because I remember her talking about being pansexual. She's a very sweet person, and I'm happy that she still wanted to be friends. Of course, I was still depressed for a bit. After that night she sent me a long text, apologizing and empathizing with my situation. 

Fast forward a bit, Valentine's Day. By this point, I still held small feelings for her. Nothing intense, but I couldn't get over her that easily, even if I couldn't get with her. She gifted me and our DnD group flowers and made another bracelet just for me. Originally, I had wanted to get her a set of dice but decided to get the whole group a set just so I could try and extinguish my feelings just a bit more.

(almost done) A month later, our school hosts a delayed Winter Ball at a nearby country club. Two friends and I joined her group for the event since we were all close. I went in expecting nothing to happen in the way of romantic progression, I would just be sitting with my friends, we dance for a couple hours, get food after, then its done. I didn't want to miss the night of fun waiting for 'something' to happen. But something did happen. 

Around 8:00; my group and I had just finished dancing after about an hour and a half, came back to our seats to relax and catch out breath. I was fine until I sat down, I felt like I had just been hit in the face with a sack of bricks. Apparently it was visible in my face, she comes up to me and tells me that she's going to take a step outside and asks if I want to join her. Me, needing some fresh air, accept. We went out onto the balcony, and looked out into the night. We just talked a bit, laughed and joked, sometimes even eavesdropping on others who stepped out and talked about drama. 

Point is, we just enjoyed each others company. We were out there for about an hour. There were multiple points where we heard some song playing from inside. I would ask her if she wanted to go back inside, to which she would reply no and said she wanted to stay out for a bit longer. There was even a point when we could hear Cotton Eyed Joe playing, and upon asking the same question she booty bumped and did the grapevine (For those who don't know, the grapevine is a move part of the Cotton Eyed Joe line dance). I followed after that and we danced for a bit. 

Another thing that happened that really caught me off guard: She was complaining about her dress, the straps were loose so she had to keep readjusting them. After I commented on how that must be annoying, she asks me if I could help her fix them. Now this may not sound like much to most of y'all, but for me it was something I would never expect a girl to ask me. Flustered, I adjust the straps trying not to touch her skin. She giggled the whole time, maybe in response to my embarrassment.   
All of this stuff I've never seen or heard about her doing this with anyone else, so I know she definitely holds me a close friend.

**TL;DR:** Been very friends with a girl for months, after many events I'm confused to if she likes me romantically or not.

**Main question here is:** Am I just misreading signals of very close friendship or could these be possible hints of romantic interest? Has she maybe given thought to the possibility of us dating or is she still lesbian and I'm just a fool who's way in too deep?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1163767,public,self,Confused about her feelings towards me,0,[],0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/tf8b7e/confused_about_her_feelings_towards_me/,no_ads,0,,,,,,

Previously we spoke for 3 months and we met off Tinder, we've had awesome conversations and we connected on a deeper level. Anyway, last week we went on our first date and everything was awesome on both sides.

Unfortunately, since 2 days ago his text were very short and distant. I've asked him if he's been alright, he says he's fine. I've always been vocal on the topic; if he feels he's losing interest I'm not scared of rejection and I just don't want my time wasted. He previously told me ""I want you"" and I'm trying to take his word for it, but his actions aren't adding up for me (this was before 2 days ago, after our date). I've distant myself, I don't message him as much anymore, and it seems like it's normal to him. I feel like he's trailing me along.

I do think he might be seeing multiple women, since he's always out having dinner, making excuses to why he's out late, rather than sticking to the promise of him calling me that night. I do enjoy talking to him and the bond that we have, we did make plans to see each-other next week. Although, I have a feeling we might stop talking before then. I was thinking of just not messaging him tomorrow, and seeing if he messages me.

I'm not sure if I should just stop contact, wait it out, continue to be distant, show interest, or talk to him about the mixed signals I'm getting.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1163768,public,self,Mixed signals?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/tf8gy1/mixed_signals/,no_ads,0,,,,,,

Jack went to the bartender and asked if any of us wanted anything. I asked him if he could get me a water.

I sat down by myself on the couch as Jack got it for me. He gave it to me, and I had a couple of sips. Jack sat down so close that our butts were nearly touching. He put his hand around my waist. I had to use the restroom, and he offered to come to the restroom with me, but I said I was fine. I don't remember much after I stood up from the couch. I know that I wasn't able to walk on my own after using the bathroom, and Jack and another girl helped me. Jack said after I was gone that I was beautiful and that he wanted to hook up with me. John got mad and said he couldn't hook up with me because he liked me. The next day, everyone told me what John said.

I asked John if that was true that he liked me. He denied it, and said that he had a girlfriend, and that everyone else must've bought it up a joke. I told everyone what he said, and they were shocked. They had no idea that he had a girlfriend. He never brought her up. I know he got really mad at them for telling me, but it’s his fault for telling them in the first place. He cut off contact with me. 

I know they broke up about two months later. Ever since then, he’s been watching my social media and TikToks. He’s always one of the first people to watch them, so he has to be looking at my stuff almost everyday. For example, one time, I retweeted a Star Wars meme.

I’ve always thought I’ve been pretty intelligent for my age. I don’t exactly want to say how old I am, but the early high school stage kind of gives it away. I feel like I’ve been thinking about dating people and trying to talk to girls for a very long time. But first, let me explain my situation.

I won’t be using real or any names for confidentiality reasons. My school has had two dances this year and I’ve have been fortunate enough to attend both. In the fall I went to one with popular kids, but I wasn’t really good friends with them, so I felt out of place. In the winter we had one and went to somebody and it was practically set up through my parents and her parents because they are friends. This friend group I went with perfect. Boys that I’m cool with, some of them I’m really close with. The group of girls are all pretty too. Once again, I know one of the girls through my parents and we are good friends. The other  girls I know the names of, I’m pretty sure they know me, but I’m not close with them by any means. The 18 of us were sitting as a group, all of us were talking, and it was great. 

But the problem I have is finding a way to hang with these girls on the regular, maybe the same time all these other boys do with them. My best friend is actually really good friends with them, and even hangs out with them every now and then. The main reason why I’m asking this is finding out how I can hang out and with them and become friends with these girls. Should I do it through my best friend? We hang out with them together? I know I have good humor and I’m not an ugly kid, so I know I would look like a good piece of ass. Bottom line, I’ve had crushes and plenty of these girls at one point, and I want my name to be heard. Just getting the fun started, and I need to know how.

After almost a year of casual dating and Friends with benefits situation I realised what I long for is a relationship. I want to be close with someone not just physically,but emotionally also. 
The last time i had casual sex was  a month ago and I ended up feeling really empty after the session. I decided this was it for me and decided to focus my time on dating seriously.

So, I met a guy and we started talking. Things have been going well with us. We are on the same pages regarding all the big picture things in life and overall it's been actually refreshing talking to a guy who is actually not trying to talk to me just to get me to have sex with him.

We had our first date two weeks ago and it was amazing. Whatever chemistry we had online (through calls and text) it easily translated in our date too. There was no awkwardness or anything like that. The whole date went smoothly and after the date I felt more closer to him. 

Now because of my job, i only get both Saturday and Sunday off every alternate week. We both stay with our parents (we are from India,and it's a common situation here) and with chores and work it does get hard sometimes to carve out time for each other. Also we both live almost 2 hrs away from each other so the question of meeting for a couple of hours after office is also not a comfortable scenario for us.

This coming week, it's going to be a long weekend in India ( Due to the festival of Holi) and I was actually looking forward to seeing him. But unfortunately,he told me has too much work going on and he won't be able to meet me. 

When he told me this,i felt really dissapointed. It's been almost two weeks since our last date, and actually this whole week he has been really busy with his work so we have not talked much also. I actually miss him and I feel really sad that i can't do anything about this. I am ready to travel somewhere near his place to see him too,but he is busy so there is nothing i can do.

Now the next week i will only get a Sunday off, so that means our next date will probably be in April. I totally understand him being busy , but i also hate feeling like this. I don't like waiting for him to call me or text me,or just make plans with me. 

Also,this is one of the reasons why i was refraining from dating seriously because the missing and longing for a person can get overwhelming.

We usually do video chat occasionally just for chatting and fun with my other friends.

So for last few weeks my feelings and my dream keep popping up about her more often and I couldn't suppress my feeling so until about a week ago, I texted her that I want to do video chat in private just two of us and I confessed to her that I do really like her because I do want to take care of her as well because she did told me and my friends that she had bad relationships in the past which it left her hurt so badly. I told her that I would be a better man for her because I'm not that stupid to hurt her unlike her past relationships and would want to make her life happy once again.

The only one problem is that she has a kid from her ex and currently living with that ex (but not sleeping in same bed nor same room) because they are co-parenting with a kid. And she lives in Wisconsin (just moved from California) while I am living in Tennessee, long distance might not work in most cases but I just can't help it myself. Also I don't mind being a step-dad myself if this goes well.

I absolutely think it was the right choice. She’s very sweet, super cute, fun to be around, and while it may not be the beeeeest sex I’ve ever had, it’s still really good. 

Here’s the thing that’s really tough though: we live on very difficult schedules. I work overnight as an executive producer at a radio station (9PM-5AM) which is already kind of a pain in the ass but I love my job so I’m not really complaining. She’s still in college, is living at home, and works weekends at a grocery store. She lives far from me (she goes to school in the city I live in but her home is a train ride away), is one of 6 siblings and doesn’t have her driver’s license so she depends on her mom’s schedule for getting home and such. She’s only in the city when she has class and that’s a fairly short window during the day…after I’ve been up all night. 

Now, what we’ve been doing is usually on a Tuesday or Friday, after she’s done with class, she comes over to my house and we have some fun, or maybe we go out to lunch or something. I come home from work, take a 4 hour (ish) nap and then after we hang out I go right back to bed until I have to wake up for work. It’s a pretty good system for now, but I want to be able to see her at a time when I’m not tired after work. The problem is, with her working weekends and depending on her mom to get her places, that limits our options. 

How can I talk to her about this? I like this girl and want to put in the effort but the disjointed sleep is really tough. Any advice?

Here’s the context of our past:
Prior to covid, we had started talking to one another after I asked if he shared the same feelings as I did towards him. He said he did, however because I had not been in college yet (1 yr difference) he was not sure how it would work out. He also told me that he was currently struggling with depression from school that would possibly make it difficult to focus on a relationship at the moment. Additionally, he said that because of his struggles it would be difficult to be in any relationship during college, but they maybe after college if I am still open that we could try again. After he told me this I thought it was over for our relationship, however we still found each other occasionally talking as friends (which I still enjoyed because he has a good heart and humor). Our conversations were mainly started by me though, and I felt that it was difficult to maintain a conversation as he is on the quieter side. We also attend the same church so I saw him weekly.

Fast forward to now (1 year later) I ended up choosing a college in SoCal, which happens to be 40ish min away from his college (don’t worry, it’s cuz my other college choices failed haha). During the first semester my other church friend (who attends the same college as me) went to visit my crush because we were pretty close in proximity. It was at these hangouts that I realized my crush’s depression was pretty serious, however after winter break he has gotten much better. 

Anyways, right now (second semester), my crush wanted to treat me to dinner for being there for him during the first semester. I asked him if it was okay to drive such a long distance, and he said it was fine. At the dinner he further told me what he had been going through, and even was comfortable enough to let me know that he did have dark days where he even considered suicide. He told me that going to therapy helped him in so many ways and that he has been much happier and healthier. Despite this, the rest of the dinner and hangout was very fun as he was very excited to tell me about new hobbies and stuff he wanted to try out. I feel as though we were more comfortable in each other’s presence and in our conversation than the past.
My crush also told me that he was actually driving from his aunt’s (around two hours away from my school) to pick me up for dinner which shocked me. He said he found driving a way to calm his anxieties, and that if at any time I want a ride he would come over and take me anywhere. I told him my roommate has a car, and he said he insisted if she’s not available. On the way back I told him about this fun place and he said that “we” should go next time.

This is here to help the women out since I see profiles about wanting security and stability. I won't say where I work but I work for a bank and this applies to both men/women. The flashier the lifestyle, the more unstable the finances - typically speaking.

If you're looking for financial stability in a partner - look to see if how he treats his car. Is he driving a work truck, reliable commuter car, is he taking care of it? Does he live in a 4 bedroom house or an overpriced apartment in the downtown core? Or is he living cheaply with roommates?

Women/men in general I've seen go for the flash while looking over objectively well off people because they think flash = money.

If you're looking for financial security in a man do not look for STATUS symbols. Look at his car, the more expensive typically means more payments. An expensive house doesn't necessarily = broke but if he's in his younger years it means he is likely living paycheck to paycheck vs the guy in an apartment...

I don't believe in judging people for their money in terms of their income but I personally look to to see if a person's somewhat financially responsible and won't torpedo my lifestyle - even if I have zero interest in their money

It is said to be the herbal version of Percocet) He couldn't keep our deal so I lowered it to 3 weeks. And he still can't keep his deal and we fight about it. I cannot lower the deal again because that shit it expensive ($100 a kilo), plus ITS AN ADDICTION AND HE DOESN'T NEED IT! I never asked him to quit, just have some moderation.

But I was in love and thought I could put up with it. He really wanted a quad, we went out looking and I suggested a 2 seater so we can both ride. He wanted a fast one. I told him he could have the quad he wants but he needs to give up chewing. He agreed and I was over the moon. 2 weeks later when he was still chewing I confronted him and he told me ""you didn't actually think I was going to quit, did you? I told you whatever you wanted to hear so I can get the quad I wanted, I've been wanting a quad for a long time blah blah blah"" I was so heartbroken, I felt a fool. I stayed with him. Back in November 2021 we started seeing a therapist because I couldn't take it anymore. In December I gave him an Ultimatum, me or chew. 2 weeks ago I caught him chewing and decided to give him a another chance. I begged him to quit and asked him multiple times if he understood that if he chews again, that he will lose me. He kept telling me he understood. 2 days ago I caught him chewing again. I have come to accept that is who he is and that I will never be happy as long as he has his addictions. But I'm 2nd guessing myself. I'm in so much pain that I'm lying to myself that this time he'll change. I love him so much that I don't want to leave him, but I also know that he WILL go back to his addictions and I'll always feel this way. I would have mental breakdowns in the shower because I always feel 2nd to his addictions and wonder why he can't change for me if he says he loves me. I dont want to feel like this anymore. He told me he couldn't believe I was throwing away 8 years all because I can't get over his addictions. I know I'm not painting him in the best light rn but he truly is a great guy. He has given me so much and has taught me so much and is patient with me and is helping me for the better. But even though I cherish all those wonderful things about him I can't get over his addictions. Maybe I want him to be this picture perfect husband and he can't be that. Or maybe he's brainwashing me to think that I'm blowing this out of proportion and I shouldn't feel this way. The thought of us reconciling and nothing change makes me feel like I can't breath. I can't go on with him and I don't want to leave him. He doesn't hit me, hardly yells at me, and for the most part is a wonderful husband. Am I making the wrong choice here? How can I fix this? He told me he would actually quit this time, but I can't take his word for it. He's lied too many times to me. I can't trust him. What if hes right and I have a problem? And there are plenty of couple who live happily with one of them having addictions. And if i can get over this i can be happy too. I'm in absolute turmoil. I don't even know what to believe anymore.

I wrote him a letter as closure for myself and to apologise on how the situation was handled and I shouldn’t of took his depression personally etc. He sent me a text to thank me and said how it was such a lovely gesture and how there is no hard feelings etc. 

He then blamed me for the break up and said I had barriers up (I really opened up to him on how I’d been treated before) and said how it started to affect him, then he had a go at me for not asking how he is and how he is used to it.

The next morning he sent me a voicenote to say he will ring me and talk and he isn’t ignoring me. I messaged him back and 24 hours later he still hasn’t read the message even though he’s been online.

My friend Jessica and I met on tinder last year and we decided that it's best that we stay friends at the time. I have to be honest , the only reason why I didn't want to be in a relationship with her is because of her weight . To give you some perspective, she 5'2"" and looks like she weighs about 200 pounds . To her credit, about a month ago she told me that she has been meal prepping and she has started to go to the gym a couple times a day. 


  During November of last year she had to move out of state to take care of some family issues. Ever since slwe have met eachother, me and her would always text eachother every day and recently she revealed to me that she is coming back in town next month to visit for a few days . 

When Jessica comes back to visit , me and her are going to a night club together. Whenever we talk about her coming back to visit , I start to feel attracted to her for whatever reason. I know with her current situation, a long distance relationship wouldn't work for us. 

My crazy idea is to ask her if she wants to be my girlfriend for a day when we go to the club. I know this seems really weird and crazy but I'm only saying this because I have been feeling attracted to her and to be honest , I want to do boyfriend/ girlfriend things like hold hands , cuddle , kiss , ect .

We honestly had the best time, we chatted for hours to no end, we had so much in common and there was certainly chemistry and physical attraction. I told him I had just gotten back together with my ex and I had to respect him. But for some reason I couldn't stop thinking about him and decided to let my ex go, our relationship was already on its end and it was for the best. Both of us actually made the decision. 

This guy then spent lots of time pursuing me, chatting to me, being funny and I felt something different there. Usually when guys hit on me, 90% of the time I don't care. But I did with him. I had such a fun time that night and I wanted more. He has this feminine, artistic, musical side to him which I love and connects with me in such a way I didn't have with my ex boyfriend at all. I broke up with my ex and told him I wanted to see him, and so we did. 

We met over the weekend and spent an amazing time drinking, dancing, chatting and then on the last day we slept together and we had sex and I just felt like we clicked. We weren’t drunk on the night we had sex, we were just watching and movie and talking. I told him I didn't want to have sex with him at first and he respected me. I did have a feeling that after sleeping together he would be distant. But we did agree on catching up again soon. When we woke up he left my house, he said: I can't wait to see you again on Saturday. (this Saturday that will be coming) 

And then the next day he didn't text me... but that was ok, we don't have anything so kind of expected. On the second day I posted something on instagram and he replied, and I thought that would be the start of a new convo and I tried interacting and making questions a bit, but he was really bland and cold. Whereas before he would always try to be funny, chat and get to know me. The sexual tension certainly died down, I really wanted to have sex with him and after that I felt less ""curious"", but I still have interest in getting to know him more. 

Please don't take this as a desperate post or that I'm crazy to be in a relationship again. I am happy to begin this journey being single as I feel like I haven't taken care of myself these past months but I also had a good time with this guy and even though he might not have felt the same, which is fine, it's still confusing that he'd want to see me again but kind of be short and distant during the week. 

This might just be a classical case of him lusting or idealising someone. I'm 28, I've had all types of relationships, from intense, to love-bombing, to slow and calm, to just sex... I know not to get my hopes up or idealize anything, but he came out as this guy who said he didn't want to be led on if I was with someone else so to me it didn't seem like he just wanted sex.  

But since I was fully honest with him about my ex partner etc I was expecting him to be honest as well? Like why reach out if you have no intention of talking to me anymore or seeing me? Or maybe be honest and say you don't want to see me anymore? 

Lol I know I'm overthinking. I feel silly because there were moments where we’d cry-laugh and I never even had that with my ex.

Hey, I hope everything has been well with you. So obviously when we talked about meeting up the timing ended up being terrible for me. But it’s better now if you are still interested to meet up. My number is 12235, text me if you want to grab a drink or something.

It was fun, electric and intoxicating. And dangerous. That night I spent the night at his place, adn I had done this before and nothing happened. I just saw him as this erratic friend. Things evolved and we had sex. It was until I realized midway he wasn't wearing a condom.  I had missed a day of my birth control and got a little freaked out. I rarely have sex and he saw that , and asked me a bunch of stuff and I ended up telling him about these assaults I had . He held me close and said it was ok. The next morning though he was distant and wanted me out of the house quickly. Although he called and asked if I was ok, I mentioned I needed to get Plan B but he wasn't very concerned about it. I was leaving for a trip in two days and we were supposed to see each other that morning. I texted him and he said something vague about hiking so I called twice to clarify. By the next morning I was freaking out a bit, and feeling used. I called him twice again and asked if he could help pay for plan b. He t3exted me a long message saying he needed space, respect his boundaries and he couldn't take me texting and messaging so much and he wasn't relationshuip material right now.

But I’ve recently started trying properly and it still seems like looking for a needle in a haystack! I’m 28F and I’m a bit worried I’ll be single forever at this point.

I’ll meet men (OLD mostly but sometimes IRL) and then either the timing is wrong, or there’s physical chemistry and we get along but there’s just something’s missing, or there’s just no physical attraction even if we have great chat. Or worse, they’re festooned in red flags even if there’s attraction so it’s like run, don’t walk. And even though most times I’m actually on the same page with my reservations, it still hurts a bit after, yet again, something fizzles after a few dates for whatever reason.

And then I look at friends who always seem to find new partners really easily, and wonder what I’m doing wrong. 

In my insecure days I used to think it was because of not being attractive enough, but since then, I’ve realised that actually I’m probably conventionally attractive (not a supermodel, but cute/pretty). And I don’t have this problem in other interpersonal areas, like I make friends super easily, and people always tell me I’m easy to get along with, so I’m guessing I’m at least somewhat likeable.

Kinda need someone to confirm it.

I(19m) caught up with an old friend(19f) through a dating app. We hadn't talked in about 6 years when I left my secondary school.  


We went to Snapchat to catch up, and were talking all day long for about two weeks. Snapchat has a ""best friends"" ranking, and we became mutual #1 best friends- so I knew she was at least talking to me comparatively more than other people. There never really was a new conversation, we kind of just continued one long string of talking, and if we fell asleep would just reply the next day.  A lot of video snaps instead of just text over a picture. It was engaging conversation lol. 

One day, she asked me a question that kind of implied she was waiting, so I asked her if she wanted to go out somewhere that weekend. I offered a movie and bowling (small town, not really much else to do) and she was happy with it. The next day, she kind of invited me to visit her at work (she works at a store I go to semi frequently), I mentioned I needed to buy some new clothes. And that seemed great, she hugged me (I wasn't expecting it, so I used only one arm. Feels childish to fret over but I am at a loss.) , said I smelled nice, we walked around and talked and then she had to go do her job more.  


About 4 hours later after that she cancelled for the weekend, said she had to babysit her siblings. We hadn't even set a set day yet, but she said she wouldn't be able to this weekend. Well, that Saturday comes and there's a full day without her sending me any messages. Next day said she wasn't feeling well, we talked again, but she stopped responding once it got to about 7PM. Left me on read the next morning, so I initiated conversation later in the afternoon. We talked, but again she stopped responding at roughly the same time. She also has removed me from her private story.   


I texted her once, on that Sunday, if I said/did anything weird when we saw each other. She said no and laughed about it. I texted her again on Tuesday after talking for a bit, if she wanted to reschedule. She said she had to work straight for the next week because of a trip she has next week. Which is true, the trip. I asked her if everything was still good and she told me of course.  


But, it definitely doesn't seem like it. Our texting has decreased a lot, and I can see that she is still active - posting on her story and stuff.

After typing this, I realize it reads like a psycho who is overthinking, but this situation is kind of weird. I keep giving her the ball to end it if she wants, but she is either too nice to be straight with me, or I'm overthinking it. Any opinions on what's going through her head rn?

I broke up with my ex of over 1 year 1/2 because he went back to school in august and we were fighting a lot due to long distance. He was a college athlete &amp; finishing up his last year at a new school I wanted to suprise and visit him so I booked a flight and told him and he got mad because he wanted to discuss which dates I could come so he would be free to see me. I was hurt by the situation &amp; also was hurt because I said I love you back in august and he never said it back after a year of being together!!! I truly thought he would’ve and so did all of my friends.. so with all of this being said I had enough and said this isnt working and we broke up in September. We didn’t cut off all communication until January. He came back home for Xmas break and I wanted to meet up for closure he was hesistant based on our history and didn’t want all feelings to come back since he was only here for a week. We spoke and eventually made out but he would not sleep with me. He winded up crying to me saying how tough his sport is and how he’s been going through a lot which is why we haven’t spoken that much . I asked him if there was anyone else since he’d been sort of distant and wouldn’t sleep with me, he swore there was nobody else. Fast forward to January I find out he is seeing this girl from his school and she’s posting it all on social media, when she found out I knew who she was. I was heart broken because he completely lied to me when he saw me by saying he wasn’t seeing anyone. I ended up blocking him on Instagram in January , and then Valentine’s Day comes around him and her both block my 2nd Instagram and he blocked me on Snapchat. I’ve never been more hurt and idk how to handle it. I want to reach out but I feel it won’t get me anywhere. She made a story post yesterday saying I miss my boy, and he reposted on his story saying miss you more. This honestly broke me. I feel he’s in a rebound relationship bc he moved on so quickly into a brand new relationship, and legit this girl is the complete opposite of me . He comes back home the end of April for good!
