4,qyxkbr,1637509359,Struggling with long-distance feelings; has anyone been in this situation?,"So I caught feelings for someone who lives across the country. We had flirted a little before we were both roped into a business competition together by a mutual friend and we started texting while that went on.

I asked her out for a virtual date the other day and we had to have a rough conversation. She said she feels the same way but she doesn’t want to do start a long distance relationship, she had one not that long ago that ended badly. She really likes me too and we both feel the same way but she doesn’t know if she’ll be called out to visit or live we’re I’m at (her company’s HQ is in my area, she’s currently remote).

She also doesn’t want me to fly out to her for a date cause she would feel guilty, she didn’t want to elaborate. (My friend pointed out in a follow up convo that she would probably feel a lot of pressure if I did that which I totally get). We essentially decided we would “see how things play out”.

I do like this girl more than I have anyone in quite some time and am just dying to get to know her more. I’ve been on quite a few dates lately and had been dating 2 consecutive people before her for a bit and neither really had that spark. Idk how rare this is, or if I just like the idea of her.

I [f23] have a friend [m26] that I’ve known for four years. We just started getting close around last year ish and soon we had a FWB situation going. I was (and still am) a virgin but I was comfortable with him and while all we did was oral and touching and things like that, I had hope with could get to a point of actual sex. But at some point I caught feelings and told him and he rejected me, kindly though and said we should stop being fwb but still be friends. 
After not talking for a bit, we’ve been talking almost daily for a month or so. We are very flirty during our hangout and he seems to insist on wanting to see me a lot. I didn’t want to think too much of this…but..I had also been going through some issues and just really wanted to feel desired, as dumb as that sound. So after our last hangout, which was last Wednesday, where we were having a good time and kinda touchy (like literally him rubbing my thighs a bit and me brushing my hands against his pants and shit) and him saying he wanted to fuck me….I asked yesterday if he wanted to meet up this up coming and fools around and he said he’d let me know cause he has to think about somethings. While it’s not an outright rejection, I felt my heart go to my stomach and I woke up this morning like I wanted to puke. I feel awful
The thing is also…I’m still a virgin and he has a a history of hookups and fwb. He’s not a dough bag player but he does enjoy sex and has good experience with it. He talks about and sometimes talks about the girls he’s been with and that just leaves me feeling inadequate, which is how I feel now. I feel like I’m getting mix signals or I’m just misinterpreting everything. Either way, I feel awful.

41,qz0qiz,1637518280,How to subtly show interest in a guy?,"A couple of months ago I (20F) moved into a dorm, where I share a kitchen with a group of people, and we do all sorts of things together. I’ve gotten a crush on one of the guys (it started when I talked to him alone for a while at some point), but ever since then I’ve been quite awkward around him. I speak to him frequently, as we live together, and we go to some of the same parties - but I’m now scared that he knows that I’m interested in him, or that he simply dislikes me.

Conversations this past week have been slightly awkward, and our conversations quickly die out - and we didn't speak at the last party at all. I tend to hide my feelings by kind of ignoring the person I’m interested in, which I realize is a toxic trait - but I’m so scared of rejection or by being laughed at. I think that might be why the awkwardness has started, because he can sense that somethings off in my behavior towards him.

I don’t believe him to be into me in any way, although I of course daydream about this awkwardness just being because he’s ‘shy’… But really? He sleeps around a lot and doesn’t seem to have issues with women, so it’s quite unlikely that I should somehow have made him nervous. It’s not because I think he’s out of my league like that, but then again… Even if I made my attraction towards him just the teeniest bit obvious, what difference would it make?

But *god* is he attractive, and every time I speak to him the ‘crush’ just gets worse? I frequently get small crushes on people, but I’m rarely interested in anyone like this. I just feel so stupid for being so interested in him, because I feel kind of creepy - but I can’t get him out of my head, which is something I haven’t experienced… like ever? He’s intelligent, funny, kind, spontaneous and has a lot of different interests - and he’s really cute as well.

So… Yeah, my question is. I’m considering trying to get out of my comfort zone and just try to make a few ‘subtle moves’? I know it’s probably never going to become anything, and I’m terrified of showing any interest - but I also hate how I have no control over my own reactions. So, Reddit, what would be a way of subtly showing interest, without making it too obvious that I’m into him? I don’t want him to think badly of me, and I don’t want people to feel bad on my behalf... I don’t have that much experience with ‘making a move’, as I’m used to guys trying to get my attention first, but I’m living with this guy, and I’ve gotten this god-awful crush anyways so might as well give it a shot you know…

I'm looking for something long term and it even says so on my bio. 

Friday night I match with a really cute looking girl the next town over and we almost immediately make plans to meet up Saturday due to both wanting to get off tinder ASAP. We met for drinks and had a great time, conversation was flowing really well and we were both into the same kinds of music and films (both on the more niche side of things). 

After a few hours at the venue she suggested we go for a walk along the river and she wanted to show me something not far away. We both go and geek out over this really trivial thing. She asks what I'm looking for on tinder and then says she is just looking for something casual. I'm a bit heartbroken but she asks if I wanted to make out. 

I walked her home whilst we stopped every now and then for some passionate kissing and then very briefly into a small bit of woodland for something a bit more. The night ended outside her house (didn't go in for to housemates) we kissed again and said goodbye. I text when I got home to say I had a good time and if she was interested in doing something casual again, I'd be up for it. She agreed and I said I was in town early next month for a thing. 

Honestly I was on cloud nine all the way home. I've never done anything like it before in my life and it really surprised me at how spontaneous and fun it was. However the next day I'm really confused and a bit sad that it was just a one off thing. I don't feel dirty it used or anything like that. But just weird as quite liked that girl and would want to pursue something more, but I know that just sounds stupid after what was essentially a ONS.

48,qz1awo,1637519873,"I miss her and feel lonely, what should I do","I was in a relationship with a girl about 6 years ago, we were only together for around 4 months and things were going well until I found out she was engaged.

One of my friends found out and when I confronted her she denied it but I found out it was true after seeing him on her social media so I deleted her off everything even though she tried messaging me just before her wedding.

She eventually ended up getting divorced a year in to her marriage, that was around 5 years ago.

Around last year we got back in touch and we got back together as she seemed to have changed a lot, but a while in to the relationship she revealed that she did have quite a few boyfriends before then and that she had slept with a few.

I was understanding and things seemed to be going fine after and we even planned for marriage, but then I noticed how much of a rush she was in to get married and how she said she always misses me. But lately we have argued a lot and she has really wound me up to the point where I didn't want to speak to her, she knew I wanted my space but to get my attention she ended up blocking me off everything.

When I asked why she blocked me she said she didn't want me to have access to her if I can't commit to her, even though she has a lot of random guys on there! She eventually unblocked me.

My own family wasn't happy about my relationship as my mother wasn't keen on her but I eventually persuaded her to accept (I realise now how stupid I was).

A few months later, I noticed her being open again about other guys but instead of saying anything I stayed quiet. When she asked why I was quiet, she insisted that I can talk to her about anything so I told her that I wasn't happy with how open she is with other guys, she then went on to say how she didn't want to be with someone that is insecure as her ex husband was the same.

I was quite annoyed at this point as she has said herself in the past that she is insecure too and she always had mood swings and emotional issues due to her endometriosis which I was always understanding of, it hurt that she couldn't be understanding of my mental health. So then she went on to complain about me not committing to her, at this point I had enough of it and said that if she wants to end it she should do it now so she went ahead and blocked me off social media.

She didn't block my number but now I have blocked hers so she can't get in touch with me. I told my mother that we had broken up so she shouldn't get in touch with her mother to sort wedding arrangements, at that point my mom informed me that she rang her mom a couple of weeks ago but she said that she was busy and and that she would ring back later which she never did.

I was tempted to unblock her and have a go at her for saying that I was the reason things weren't progressing. But I though forget it, I no longer want anything to do with her anymore.

Hi, everyone... apologies if this is a long one.. TL;DR at the bottom :)

Basically I recently moved country for university (September 2021) and I met this girl with whom we immediately had this connection. At the time it wasn't based in anything beyond just friendship because she said she is a devote Christian who doesn't date non-Christian men and I am agnostic. Despite this we became closer and closer and ended up spending a lot of time together.

She had put boundaries in place for us to stop anything untoward happening feelings wise but as the weeks went on, she was the one not sticking to these boundaries like she could with other guys.

Fast forward to today and things are messy. We've both know we're not dating or in a relationship but we also are not just friends because we say we are too emotionally attached and connected. Just recently we actually ended up cuddling and kissing despite her saying from the very beginning that she doesn't do that with guys she's not in a relationship with and she had only kissed one guy up to this point.

I have feelings for this girl but she says that she doesn't have romantic feelings for me but she obviously feels extremely close with me. I'm more looking for opinions on whether or not this girl is in denial about her feelings or whether she can have all these thoughts and behaviours while still not having romantic feelings:

* She kissed me when she never does with guys she's not in a relationship with and continues to have a strong desire to do so
* She wants to be physically close to me, to fall asleep in my arms, cuddle me, even though her doing those things causes her to have a bit of an identity crisis just like with kissing
* We talk for nearly the entire day some days and whenever we call one another the calls can last long into the early morning, over 6hrs
* She says that I'm the one she talks to the most now out of all her friends whether they're Christian or not.
* She says she feels extremely safe around me and knows I'll protect her and that she's extremely comfortable around me, enough that it's even surprised her
* She will quite often tell me how special I am and how much she values and appreciates having me in her life
* She cares about every little thing I do, wants to know about my interests and my day and whatever else even if she normally wouldn't have an interest. She actively takes an interest in the things I enjoy and remembers small details about them and myself.
* If I needed help or anything at all, she would drop whatever she was doing to help me without hesitation.

Obviously this is really confusing for me considering she says she doesn't have romantic feelings for me and that she will only marry a Christian guy for various reasons, one of which being because it seems right and she wants it.

I would normally understand if she was a lot more standoffish but her actions and words don't match up with these statements and I just would like to know everyone's opinion on this..

Thanks in advance!

**TL;DR Girl likes cuddling with me, kissing me, being in my presence, says she's incredibly emotionally connected with me, talking with me for hours on end into the early morning, wants to spend time with me, tells me how special I am not only to her but in general, will do anything for me yet tells me she doesn't have romantic feelings for me...

59,qz25ql,1637522234,I want to give up on dating,"I am a 28F and I'm starting to reach that age where I see everyone else settle down.

Meanwhile, I seem to have absolute shit luck when it comes to dating. Just in the last 2.5 months - so much has happened that has really discouraged me. First, I had a guy I had been on a couple of dates with (whom I had known before) tell me that after a few dates, he thought we were more 'friendly' than romantic. I was interested in him, so I was a little bit disappointed when it ended.  I found out recently that he started dating another girl either before or right when we ended things. Nevertheless, it was only a few dates, so it's not too hurtful but still a little bit of a blow to my ego. At the same time, I can't help to wonder - how  did he find someone so quickly?!?! How is he so lucky haha

Then, my friend and I ended up reigniting the fling we once had. I've always liked him but I never let myself want anything more from him because he never gave me a reason to want to be vulnerable with him. Eventually, in the last few months, we started spending more time together but he still told me he didn't want to be in a relationship right now. So we went back and forth a lot about what we were, only to decide we were going to be platonic for now. 

And during this time, i met a super nice guy who liked me and wanted to continue seeing me, and I tried to give him a chance by going on 4-5 dates with him but no matter what, I just wasn't feeling it. 

I don't know why I cant seem to get it right. I know a lot of times, it's about luck. But I'm starting to feel like if it's all about luck, maybe I just don't have any and I'm screwed. 

I've historically been pretty optimistic about dating. I know these things take time and sometimes, there's a lot of frustration that goes into it, but these last few months have really discouraged me. It's almost like the universe is saying ""we're going to present you with all these guys you would be interested in but guess what? you can't have them."" I know it's a terrible attitude, but HOW do I not get discouraged?

At first, it was just anxiety. I told her (33f) I didn't feel comfortable. We tried again later, and I got hard.

Then came the second problem. I have only had sex in LTRs for years, and so I got used to no condoms. She wants me to wear one (understandably), and it made me lose my erection after a minute (maybe) of sex.

I am very attracted to her.

I communicated everything to her. She seems understanding but has previously stated how important a ""strong erection"" was to her.

I can definitely get hard, but I'm having trouble staying hard.

She's really amazing, and she said everything else has been going really well, and I could tell her was disappointed.

I did focus on her a lot and use my mouth and hands. She enjoyed it but clearly wanted that penetration and physical closeness to me.

I admitted I'm also much more orally focused but still enjoy sex and was willing to work on it.

I should mention that I'm also a bigger guy, and that can make certain positions difficult although I'm losing a lot of weight. I know this isn't why I'm having trouble though because my blood pressure is in check, and I've never had this problem before even when I was bigger.

I ordered some cock rings and mentioned toys, but she is not experienced with these things, and I'm not sure she was interested.

I communicated (maybe even over-communicated a bit) as much as I could, but I need solutions.

I am going to get a medical work-up done as soon as my insurance kicks in from work (new job), but I need some temporary solutions to satisfy her in the meantime.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qz29tp/i_37m_had_performance_anxiety_for_the_first_time/

It was so embarrassing when he left without saying goodbye becase all my friends like him.so much and we're completely shocked when he did that.

Side question. I asked if I could kiss her, it seems polite to me but is it normal or relevant to ask?

We set up a date and all is well, until the day before or morning of said date. Then, the woman texts me saying something along the lines of ""I have to cancel because I just don't feel well.""  (Of course, my first reaction is to assume she must have gotten physically ill with something, so I send a message that I hope she gets well soon, etc. etc.)  Then, I'm corrected and told, ""I'm not really sick with anything... I just have anxiety issues right now."" Usually some explanation about feeling mentally exhausted follows, or talk of migraines and needing to just ""take a nap"".

The thing is? My own daughter struggles with some mental health issues like anxiety/depression, so I've definitely lived through this. But she's gone to see therapists and psychiatrists/psychologists most of her life due to struggles in school and so on. I didn't expect to run into this with so many adults in their 40's who I've met and had long conversations with, who really seemed pretty normal otherwise.

Is this something others are running into now too, perhaps as a side-effect of the COVID situation over the past couple years?

I'd be the first to admit I struggle a bit with some of my own issues, including the realization I'm definitely on the ""spectrum"" as what would have been diagnosed as slightly Asperger's. But I do everything I can to tell women I'm meeting for a date that it's ""super casual"" and nothing to stress out about. You want to wear the comfy sweatpants and sweatshirt you've got on? Cool! (I'd rather not make a simple, fun date into some big ""production"" anyway.) I want our going out to be fun and a way to get RID of stress of whatever routine a person is stuck in, you know?

79,qz3na4,1637526501,"I can't get a relationship, only FWB, and I don't know what I'm doing wrong [22F]","I'm 22f, in last year of university, training to be a lawyer. For reference I'm attractive, slim and intelligent. I'v been on and off dating apps, had success years ago but in the past couple years the only guys who are interested in me I just don't click with or fancy at all. the ones I do like, they want purely friends with benefits/fuckbuddies/one night stands with me, or ghost. No one wants to commit or have a relationship (I had 2 relationships when I was 17-19, and 1 relationship a year ago but he was 12 years older than me).

I have a theory that the fact I have mild Aspergers doesn't help. It means I can't differentiate between 'good' and 'bad' men very easily, and I believe people at face value. Socially I'm very competent at conversation and you probably wouldn't be able to tell I'm autistic until you'd spent a while with me or were knowledgable about it, but I'm bad at flirting or picking up signals, I'm unable to read between the lines or understand mind games. I can come across aloof and complex and I don't mean to. I'm also hyperlogical, very rational and not massively romantic, and I think men can be intimidated by how independent and career-driven I am, and my interests. So I think they see it as too much effort to go any further with me. My inability to give away signs that I have feelings and slightly flat tone of voice/muted expressions doesn't help at all. I don't understand dating, I don't understand what I'm doing wrong or what sort of men I should be going for.

I have fallen into the trap of casual sex too many times and it leaves me miserable, feeling used and dirty. I was sexually abused as a child and this makes it very difficult for me to be emotionally intimate with someone unless I really trust them. I find physical affection difficult but I do try and I can manage it. In some ways hookups are easier and less complicated than a relationship, but I really want a loving relationship.

If i meet someone I like, the first date will go really well. then the messages fizzle out in subsequent days, and a second date doesn't really happen. They never tell me what I've done wrong. They sometimes say they have commitment issues. Sometimes if they're older they'll say we're on different life paths (so why lead me on?)

I'm feeling so hopeless. I know I'm only 22 but all my friends and peers have boyfriends and some of them are (again, at the risk of sounding arrogant) much more dysfunctional than me! I have been on so many dates (1/2 a week) the last 6 months, only resulted in hookups, ghosting or men I'm not into.

82,qz3smw,1637526919,Why are women so reluctant to simply describe what they find attractive in men?,"If you go on the freelance website 'Fiverr' and search for Tinder, you will find services advertised for by women which offer to give advice to you for improving your dating profile, including selecting and editing your best photos as well as a few hints and tips for a better profile or opener. Over the past week I've actually spent around £200 on two of premium offers among them, partly out of curiosity, partly out of a desire for genuine improvement and partly because I like having the peace of mind of knowing I've done all I can to improve my chances.  


What was most interesting about the feedback I got (which was brilliantly direct and candid I have to say) was it was so different to the advice you commonly find here no reddit or in the general mainstream.  


The two women in question (though perfectly polite and friendly)  
1) Made no bones about cropping any taller friends of mine out of photos, and indeed selecting photos which made me look generally taller (I'm 6 foot so not bad but can quite easily find myself as the shortest or second-shortest in a group of three or four people).   


2) Highlighting my jaw line and even my Adam's apple   


3) Emphasised not looking directly at the camera for photos, as psychologically women interpret this as a man 'looking for approval' which is very off-putting to women.  


4) Recommended I use one of my shirtless photos (I go to the gym regularly and I can say without conceit that my body and certainly chest is above-average.   


There was of course, some mainstream and non-controversial advice around using photos of me doing cool things like skydiving to show my life as exciting and photos of me among female friends to  show me as sociable, but I don't think its an exaggeration to say that no women on Reddit or wherever one might find mainstream advice for men would ever advocate the four things I've mentioned above.  


Of course, if they did, then there wouldn't be women on Fiverr advertising this kind of candid advice for a three-figure sum.

86,qz4100,1637527593,"Terrible fourth date, not sure how to proceed.","F 25 dating M 28. So I had gone on 3 incredible dates with a guy I met on a dating app. He paid even when I offered, walked me home, texted after, and we had great convos and lots in common. He invited me on a 4th date at the beginning of this week for the weekend. He doesn’t really text me in between dates. I won’t hear from him for five or six days and then a couple days before he wants to meet up he’ll reach out. This is unlike any guy I’ve ever dated in the past. Also, I found out that he recently got out of a relationship within the past year that he was very serious about. He even lived with the girl. I wish I would’ve known this before going on a couple dates with him. 

Anyways, last night was going well, we met up at a bar and then went to a club and afterwards he asked me if I wanted to get a bite to eat. I told him yes and we left the bar to go find something. After a bit of walking he said “well I don’t see anything good, and to be honest I’m not very hungry, why don’t we just go to your apartment.” 

I told him I would rather do something like go see a movie or even get dessert and he said “then let’s keep walking”. He didn’t stop once and was walking very briskly. I’ve never been in the situation before, and I didn’t know what to do. All of the restaurants near me were closed. 

Eventually we got to my house. I asked him one more time if he was hungry and wanted to go back to the bar area and he said “no, let’s just go inside”. I let him come inside, but I didn’t want to do anything and I honestly didn’t feel comfortable with him coming in but I didn’t know how to say no and put my foot down. He came inside and immediately took his shoes off and I sat on my couch. 

I haven’t purchased a TV for my living room yet as I haven’t lived here for very long. He asked if I had a TV in my bedroom and I told him yes, he walked into my bedroom without any sort of comment or discussion and I asked what I wanted to watch. Like he owned the place. I sat on top of my bed. He proceeded to take his shirt off and go under the covers and turn on a sitcom. I stayed sitting on top of my bed because I was so incredibly uncomfortable. He proceeded to invite me under the covers and started touching me. I kissed him but I didn’t wanna go further. He kept pressuring me anyways even though I wasn’t reciprocating and eventually I told him to stop. 

I told him that I don’t know where this is going and that we haven’t discussed any sort of intimacy yet so I was very caught of guard because we hadn’t done anything besides making out and also I don’t want to sleep with him if he’s still sleeping with others. He got super defensive and told me that 4 dates is way too soon to know he wants to be exclusive. I told him I don’t want a relationship necessarily I just don’t wanna sleep with him if I’m one of many. Especially going forward because it seems like this is progressing, or at least it did. I told him at this point I kind of had figured if he felt the same way he would want to stop seeing other people at least intimately. 

He told me if that is my outlook on things I’m going to have a tough time dating. We got into a big argument and I felt terrible. I also had drank too much, so my responses were very emotional. I even cried in front of him. I feel so bad. I invited him to spend the night and wanted to talk through it and he told me that he didn’t want to leave but he didn’t wanna talk about it until tomorrow. 

He couldn’t sleep, so eventually he left which really set me off. He woke my dogs up and they started barking like crazy and I knew that was going to happen which is why I didn’t want him to leave but he did anyways at 4 AM. I apologized to him for everything that went down but he reassured me that he would talk to me again but that he needed to go home. I don’t know if I believe a word he says.

I’m not sure how to proceed from here. I texted him this morning apologizing for getting so emotional and for having a glass too many because I normally don’t drink at all which is probably why it’s such little alcohol got to me. He hasn’t responded. I’m so embarrassed and he made me feel ashamed for putting my foot down and not wanting to sleep with him. He made me feel like I was crazy for what I asked about if he was seeing others. I still like him and I would like a second chance. He doesn’t need to only see me, I just don’t want to sleep with him until that is the case. I think that is fair. I don’t think I worded it properly when I told him this last night and he misunderstood and freaked, thinking I was trying to strong-arm him into a relationship. How can I fix this? Did I say or do anything wrong during this that I should’ve done differently?
