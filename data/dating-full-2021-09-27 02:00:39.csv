Essentially, I started seeing this girl long distance.  I live in the Atlanta, Ga, and she lives in Charleston, SC (about a five hour drive).  We would meet every two weeks or so and text daily.  We had some great times.  We would meet up on the weekends, go do fun stuff (hiking, rafting, museums, zoos, you name it), come back to the hotel and have great sex.  Initially, it seemed like she wanted to make things more serious, and I didn't want to rush into it, due to the distance.  She agreed that made sense. But we started to get a bit romantically attached.  

One of the last times we met, she said she had started talking to someone else.  It obviously bothered me, and I got a little upset, but conceded that since we weren't official, I had no reason to be upset.  Afterward, she said she felt bad and she would stop talking to him.  Then in a recent conversation, she indicated she felt ""disconnected,"" and that she wanted to spend more time with me, but couldn't, and it sucked.  In the convo, I construed one of her comments to mean she was talking to someone else again.  I said, essentially, don't tell me you're not going to do something, and then do it.  The next morning, she had blocked me on social media and SMSs don't seem to go through.  I left my last voicemail that morning.

My first guess as to what happened - things got more serious with this other person, or she otherwise decided to pursue someone else because of the distance, or because she liked them better.  I just hate that she ended it that way.  She could have just been honest, I would have understood.  Now it's as though she would have rather it never happened, like I wasn't even real.  I can't even honestly discuss it with my friends, because it just makes me sound like such a loser.  Like, that's all I was to this person.   I'll get over it, I just feel so empty and alone right now.  I've started back on dating sites, and have ""gotten back out there"" (meetups, going to bars), but nothing has materialized yet.  *Sigh*

While on the dates we always have a lot of fun, and it does feel like the chemistry and attraction is there. But there are some red flags that have been bothering me lately.

**Red flags:** 

\- I tend to ask most of the questions that drive the conversations

\- We tend to talk more about her and her life because of that, but it's not like she never asks me things

\- She admitted early on that it's hard for her to develop feelings for people when dating

\- She hasn't been exclusive with someone in the past 5 years, but does say she is looking for a meaningful relationship at this point in time and does want to be exclusive with someone

\- I'm usually the one initiating texts, phone calls, and dates

\--

With all that being said, I do really like this person, and things do generally feel great when we are together. Am I right to think those bullet points above are all red flags? Am I an idiot that is just going to get hurt when I try to take things to the next level?

Was I wrong.

I’ve been exclusively talking to this girl for the last month plus. Things were great and we were really vibing. Being a single mother leaving a shitty relationship, I was trying to be supportive and understanding. We were clicking super well. 

Last week she text me saying she wasn’t fully over her Ex (not sexually interested but just not over him) and maybe we need to step back and almost stop
talking. Not an emotional guy but at this point, i had completely fell for them. I cried on my way home, that fucking hurt me like I never been hurt before. Later on we had both expressed how much we enjoyed each other and how we never clicked with others like so. I was hesitant with her text so I wanted her to clarify and we agreed on slowing things down but still growing together. Things didn’t really slow down  though some days would be lovey and the next was little off but she made plans for us this weekend so I didn’t really think anything was truly wrong. Plans fell through and my anxiety was super bad. I was so emotional sick so I texted her how I was feeling and acknowledged how we always talk and she shouldn’t take away from her Sunday but I felt like a wreck and missed her. (We’ve been super communicative and supportive with any problems/thoughts so this wasn’t too crazy to text) 

Things went south QUICK. Angry text from her saying I was wrong and she doesn’t understands how I could feel that way. Saying don’t text her. 

I responded calmly trying to explain and answer but it snow balled. Every step I try to defuse just made it worse and more angry. 

She ended tonight saying she isn’t in a relationship with me and I shouldn’t expect responses. She’s a single mother that was in an abusive relationship. Good luck. 

I did my best to understand and be supportive. Gave my full attention and listened to her. I just feel so lost. I never expected texts from her, she numerous times said she can’t wait for me to be her boyfriend. This felt like a family I could be apart of. I have a soft spot for her and her child but now I feel defeated.

We went on 3 dates and have been talking since early june. Had a great connection. 

I felt like I kept getting mixed signals after the 3rd date so Finally last week I told him I liked him as more than a friend. His exact words were “you are a super dope person and I like you a lot but it’s hard for me to see us in a relationship because of our schedules (I work nights and he works days rn) and you live so far away (45 minutes).”

I told him that was fair and but that I had also planned on moving to days soon anyways and will likely be closer to his area next year when my lease ends. And that is all true and has nothing to do with him. Just wanna work days and I’m trying to be closer to my family.

I added at the end something like “I say that to also say that it’s not worth pursuing if only one person sees value in it so I think we can just remain friends and I’m going to continue to date other people.”

And that was the jist of it. Now he’s been messaging me more than ever. Every single day. Same time every day almost. When before I told him this he had become very spotty with communication and leaving me on read a lot. 

He responds to my snap stories frequently. Sometimes complementing my looks and the other day after I mentioned a restaurant I liked he said that we should go there. 

Do you think he’s genuinely just trying to be friends or what??? I mean I know he has plenty of female friends and he’s a super friendly guy so it very well could just be that. But I got a vibe when I mentioned I was gonna be dating other guys that he was a little jealous although I could be misreading that. 

I feel like my feelings for him (while still there) are pretty at bay right now and I like having him as a friend cause he’s really a great person.

That got me thinking: I personally don’t chase. I find it kind of immature honestly. I feel that if a person says they want to get to know someone along the romantic side, and the other says they want to feel the chase, that they aren’t interested. To me, the woman isn’t the prize, the mutual respect and adoration in a valued relationship is.

Which led me to looking up divorce rates. People divorce for a plethora of reasons, and this is just speculation, but if 51% of women file for divorce, and 49% of men file for divorce, it’s safe to say that 100% of these relationships failed because the other person wasn’t happy with their partner.

But what percentage of those relationships started with chasing the partner to validate that they were worth the other’s time? 

What’s the correlation between chasing and value? I don’t think it’s really consistent. To me, all it shows is someone’s inability to see their worth, and stop chasing someone who also is unable to value them.

I’ll make it worth your read :)

Im a 33 year old male and I’ve been casually dating mostly via dating apps for the past 6 months after getting out of a LTR. Three months ago, I went on two dates within a week’s span and come find out the two girls I went out with know each other and are friends. I only saw both of these girls once and we agreed it was casual and wouldn’t go any further. I didn’t click with either of them on deep level but I did sleep with both of them. The notion of them being friends certainly made it less than ideal but no harm, no foul. The next paragraph is where things get really strange and the sort unfolds…

A month later, I meet a new girl (also via a dating app). We got to know each other via texting a week before our scheduled date. From the few few messages, we discovered how many common interests we shared and had a great first date. We clicked so well on both a physical and emotional level and both knew we wanted to continue seeing each other. A random conversation the following day turns up her talking about two of her friends by name. The names of the girls she’s talking about happen to be the same names of the two girls I went out with a month earlier and are in fact the SAME girls. My mind is blown at this point and know I can’t not tell her as she would eventually find out.

After telling her the news, she was in shock but not completely devastated as she acknowledges I had no way of knowing and it’s purely one large coincidence. We continue going on dates and getting to know each other better but under the condition that she wouldn’t share her finding with her friends and keep it only between us.

Fast forward to today, we’ve been seeing each other for two months but in secrecy from her friends knowing. We both want to be in a relationship but she feels very uncomfortable coming clean to her two friends I met prior and telling them she knew I knew them but still proceeded to continue seeing me. She knows she needs to tell them but doesn’t know when is the best time.

The moment we started talking we connected. It was great. We video called almost every night. This started as a flirting thing only, we both had the clarity that we didn’t want anything emotional from each other. But recently I started liking him, and seeing his behaviour I thought he did too. Maybe he does, I really don’t know. Side note: it’s only been a month.

Now the issues are: 

He lives about 10 hours away from me by car. I’d been in 2 long distance relationships over the period of 6 years. And I cannot see myself in one more. So even if this guy liked me back and we had something serious going on, it would be long distance. But I don’t know if this guy is worth giving a shot because I haven’t met someone like him in a very long time. We also don’t have a certain future plan yet; meaning that he or I might not stay in the same place, our careers are not settled yet. I am a kind of girl who looks for permanency. 

Another issue is that the common friend, my roommate and his best friend, she is kind of possessive about him. They both claim to be friends only and that they have no romantic feelings for each other what so ever, which I believe. But I feel like she feels a constant need to prove that she knows him better than anyone else will. So if the guy and I were to be in a relationship, she would get worse and make herself more annoying with all the things she’ll say. For example, every time I say that he did something, or that he has this certain quality in him, she starts making it her own story and narrates it saying, “oh yeah, I know; we did that together; he’s like that only; he’d do this; he’s not like that”.

9/22 started texting with this girl on Hinge. Her pics were pretty zoomed in and she had gallons of makeup on. She posted one pic where I could tell she had a few extra pounds on her but who cares. (You’ll see why I mention that later) I was mostly on there to just make friends and if anything else happened, then cool. It said that on my profile too. 

We hit it off immediately in the craziest way. Have a ton of things in common and things that we felt connected us. For example, she has a hand tat and I have a thing for those lol. It’s red just like the tattoo on my wrist. We both got them earlier this year. We both got a left nose stud in 2017. There was a lot of those stupid, meaningless lil coincidences but we liked it. We like the same sports. We think exactly alike. Etc. She gave me her number quick. And we had incredible conversations over the past few days. We then spoke for the first time (1st time with our voices I mean) and it was on the phone for three hours early Saturday morning 9/25. I’ve never spoken with a girl for longer than like 20 minutes on the phone. We had phone sex during that call which I had never done before either. 

We had super deep conversations, like super deep. She even shed tears on that phone call because we spoke about very personal things. We said relationship things to each other. Not “I love you” of course but definitely things that’d be pretty insane to say to someone before meeting in person. I can’t even remember specifically but we were in deep and we both kinda hinted that we are moving too fast without explicitly saying it. But what can I say, I genuinely felt like I was already beginning to fall for her and she felt the same. We both had never connected with anyone like this. 

During the phone call she kept saying things like “We’ll see if you still like me in person.” I straight up told her that I was gonna kill her lack of self confidence and that she had no reason to worry. 

Anyways Saturday night 9/26 she came over so we could hang out in her car. We didn’t plan on doing anything. She just was gonna come over for like an hour so we could watch the sunset at a park near my house. She didn’t come inside because I live with my mother and adult sister. Now here’s where I’m about to sound like a total fucking asshole and I’m completely aware but I’m young and dumb so please just go the fuck easy on me lmfao. 

She’s a way bigger girl than I expected. Like even the pic of her upper body where I could tell she had a few extra lbs that I mentioned earlier didn’t seem like a clear representation of her actual body. I have an ok body because I recently lost nearly 50 lbs but I’m not that desirable to most women by any means so I ain’t judging. My arms look decently lean and you can see my collarbone and stuff like that but I still have a sizable gut without a shirt. I look decent with a shirt on and women are more attracted to me than they have ever been and my confidence is high but still, a LOT of women wouldn’t be down to fuck someone with a gut the size of mine which is why all my pics on dating apps are full body or close to it and some even without a shirt. I hide nothing. 

Anyways, yeah. I’m just not that physically attracted to her and I kinda think she knew what she was doing. She completely hid what she truly looks like. I was a lil shocked when I saw her but still wanted to make her feel beautiful and still feel like I’m starting to fall for her as a person. I was very touchy and flirtatious and we kissed a lot and then we had raw sex in her vehicle lmfao because she kept bringing it up and really wanted to hook up. She even said she felt guilty after for being so pushy about sex. 

Anyways I feel like it’s too late to back out of this now esp after we fucked but long term I’m just really not interested. I know what you’re thinking. Why did you kiss and fuck her then but idk we already had a connection and I really didn’t wanna make it about looks. But even parts of the sex were kinda gross. I smelled and tasted a lot of sweat. I sound like a horrible man I know. But at the same time I hide nothing on dating apps. I immediately tell women I live with family and don’t have my own car and that gets me immediately rejected. I show clear representations of my body and that gets me rejected. I hide none of my face etc. I wouldn’t have been interested in her romantically if I knew what her body looked like and that’s so ugly I know because the connection we have runs fucking deep and it shouldn’t matter. 

I don’t want her to be out of my life because the connection we have is that real. I honestly need to work out so I kind of gently want to tell her to work out with me because I need to fix my body too. I’m already down to 170 but I need to lose the gut I mentioned. If she stays this way, I’m not interested in a relationship though because the physical attraction isn’t there even a little bit. 

Anyways I feel like if I’m super honest on dating apps and get rejected all the time (and even get my feelings hurt by it at times tbh) she shouldn’t have been able to hide what she actually looked like to get me interested cause I’d never do that and have never even attempted to do it.

**Don’t make your search for a relationship the center of your life.** Concentrate on activities you enjoy, your career, health, and relationships with family and friends. When you focus on keeping yourself happy, it will keep your life balanced and make you a more interesting person when you do meet someone special.

&amp;#x200B;

**Remember that first impressions aren’t always reliable,** especially when it comes to Internet dating. It always takes time to really get to know a person and you have to experience being with someone in a variety of situations. 

**Be honest about your own flaws and shortcomings.** Everyone has flaws, and for a relationship to last, you want someone to love you for the person you are, not the person you’d like to be, or the person they think you should be. Besides, what you consider a flaw may actually be something another person finds quirky and appealing. By shedding all pretense, you’ll encourage the other person to do the same, which can lead to an honest, more fulfilling relationship.

## Tip 2: Build a genuine connection

The dating game can be nerve wracking. It’s only natural to worry about how you’ll come across and whether or not your date will like you. But forge a great connection.

**Focus outward, not inward.** To combat first-date nerves, focus your attention on what your date is saying and doing and what’s going on around you, rather than on your internal thoughts. Staying fully present in the moment will help take your mind off worries and insecurities.

**Be curious.** When you’re truly curious about someone else’s thoughts, feelings, experiences, stories, and opinions, it shows—and they’ll like you for it. You’ll come across as far more attractive and interesting than if you spend your time trying to promote yourself to your date. And if you aren’t genuinely interested in your date, there’s little point in pursuing the relationship further.

**Be genuine.** Showing interest in others can’t be faked. If you’re just pretending to listen or care, your date will pick up on it. No one likes to be manipulated or placated. Rather than helping you connect and make a good impression, your efforts will most likely backfire. If you aren’t genuinely interested in your date, there is little point in pursuing the relationship further.

Some other really close guy friends who I’ve had in the past and who I thought of in a strictly platonic way have ended up confessing love for me, and it has ended in me rejecting them and then them cutting me off. This was so disheartening because multiple times when I tried to have male friendships it would end like this- really started demotivating me to pursue opposite gender friendships - I lost my other best male guy friend for 6 years whose friendship I cared so so so much about.  I can’t even put into words how much I valued it and now he won’t talk to me after I said I can’t be more than friends with him. So with this past experience it kinda makes me mad at myself/scared to be realizing what I stated in the title, but it’s getting to the point where it’s impossible for me to stop thinking about. And I don’t know how to go about it, when to go about it, if anything should be done at all. I don’t want to ruin a friendship so great if he doesn’t feel the same. My friendships with males usually give them a deep sense of respect for me. When they get to know me as a friend first they can really see clearly how cool and chill I am so becoming friends first works in my advantage. 

I’ve been best friends with this guy since high school and after going through life for a little while I’ve gotten a little clearer idea of what I’m looking for in a partner. He is exactly it. He is so awesome to me, I couldn’t have a greater sense of respect for him. We are super alike in terms of what we look for, levels of independence and intelligence, sense of humor, and our general outlook on life. I am already tight with his family, I have gotten to know him so well over the years. I usually stop liking guys once I get to know them better (that sounds mean but picking a partner is hard) but with this situation I don’t think that can happen- I already have gotten to know him for so long and have a deep respect and love for him. He is independent and so am I and I think we would just enhance each others lives rather than drain each other in any way, we are the same amount of chill and can both really see the beauty in life. I really don’t know what to do about this. But I don’t feel like I can go forever without knowing what could be…. I want advice from people who have found true love. 

One more side note is that he has basically never been with girls intimately, I really don’t know why and neither do his other friends and I don’t feel like pressing the subject- but maybe I should. He doesn’t open up about that area of his life. He really really does not seem gay at all to me, he’s very desirable and well liked by girls and guys alike. me being a victim of past sexual trauma allows me to understand what it’s like to fear intimacy- it used to be a big issue for me. Fear isn’t necessarily an issue for him I know I can’t assume that but I truly feel that if it was an issue, if there is anyone he could trust to be honest and open without judgement with it would be me, I have nothing but good intentions and so much love and infinite respect for him. Have any guys out there ever been in a flipped situation? Would you want the girl to make a move or say something?

When we got together she was a very pretty girl I was immediately attracted to her. The relationship was healthy until about a month in. Things started to get sexual it was normal at first nothing that was bare skin to skin but spontaneous things like she would sit on me with a skirt on and move back and forth or we would get under some covers and press our body’s against each other. This continued for around 2 to 3 weeks nothing abnormal. Then things got more intense and I’m not an overly sexual guy I never had the mindset when I hung out with her that I was going to have sex with her. One night we were alone and we started to kiss among other things then she reached for my pants unbuttoned me and in seconds we were on the verge of actual intercorse for the first time. then just out of nowhere she said “stop what are you doing” and I was just dumbfounded she then got dressed and left the room and for lack of a better term I felt blue balled but it was much more than that for me I felt mentally destroyed. I felt like I had forced her into something she didn’t want to do I felt extremely ashamed and nasty that I’ve made her uncomfortable this happed more than 7 times until then and up to the point we broke up and was the reason for the break up. Not that I was mad she wouldn’t let me have sex with her but for the fact she had aroused me then completely made me feel like a nasty horrible person. At the end of the break up she texted me and said “I would have let you”. I’ve never encountered anything like this since but I really want to know why this happens all views on the matter are helpful sorry for the run on sentences and stuff I’m a machinist English is not my strongest subject.,True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1029182,public,self,Strange relationship dynamic I still don’t understand,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pwdvye/strange_relationship_dynamic_i_still_dont/,all_ads,6,,,

I'm a 19 year old girl and I'm really looking into getting in a relationship. The only issue is I have vaginismus. A condition where your vaginal muscles tense up making it extremely painful and sometimes impossible to have vaginal sex that can be cured.

I know sex isn't everything and there are other options besides PIV. It just feels weird knowing my partner would probably feel almost as if he could've picked any other girl and wouldn't have to deal with my problem. Maybe this means mentally I'm not ready for a relationship and that I should just continue with what I'm doing..

This guy from work joined the team some 6 months back and it's been a month since we started talking over text (due to the pandemic, offices are closed and we started off that way). Within 2 weeks of speaking he asked me to meet him,  we hung out and had the most amazing time but all this while he has never tried to flirt or indicate his interest in me, it's all been very platonic. After this happened , he has been following up to meet me over the past few weeks and in total we've been on 2 hangouts together- both of which were really fun. Some things he does indicate that he really cares for me but his texts are starting to get less responsive although we've been texting daily. He recently started calling me over cell too. Idk what to think of this and I'm super confused... he seems to be a guy who's usually indirect with what he wants to say and it's making things a lot harder to read. I am really crushing on this guy but do not know if there is any meaning to all of this.

Mixed signals include: him insisting on picking and dropping me home, him showing concern with my health and things that matter - occasionally checking up on me and ensuring I get home safe, pulling the chair for me, being able to trust me (one time he was high af and relied on me to take care  when we were out drinking- not sure if this counts), laughs a lot around me. He texts me daily albeit intermittently sending snaps and memes.

Things that make me feel like im reading it wrong: our interactions seem to be platonic and he has not not asked me if im seeing someone or my past dating history but spoke of the times when he picked up other girls etc on our first meet. Whenever we plan something he sends me the link to the event but never asked me directly if I want to go, his texts have started becoming much less responsive and have reduced.

Then we played mini golf, went out for drinks and pool, and walks during the summer. I met some of his friends as well once when he invited me to come and join them to watch soccer. None of these occasions were labeled dates or anything so I went in with the understanding that we are just good friends that like to hang out.

Most recently, he started working at a college bar and last week he texted me friday afternoon, asking me if I could come. I arrived and saw him in the bar and we chatted for like half an hour, laughing and joking around. The next day, at around 11 PM, he texted me again saying he wanted me to come so that we can have revenge on the winners of a music quiz the night before. Sadly I couldn't attend that time. When I went home that friday night, and the following week, I realized that I'm absolutely smitten with him, cannot get him out of my mind-level.

A month after talking about this, she started saying stuff like, ""ill never find anyone like you"", ""i cant leave"", ""if i leave, i hope one day u take me back"" and stuff that insinuated her leaving and coming back into my life at a later point. And then her ""mental health"" got worse, which would have been fine if it were true, and she used this as an excuse to break up. While broken up she texted me saying how much she still loved me and she just doesnt know the direction of her life. We were broken up for exactly ten days. And then we got back together. I later found out while she was drunk, that she slept with someone within the week and a half of being broken up. It wasnt forced and she wasnt drunk, it was a choice.

But! She has a boyfriend.

And no, I don't want her to breakup!

And I know it might be time that made me forget but it's all working at the same time!

She gave me hope that I can find another person and I will start looking once again with a different mentality from the mentality i had with my previous girlfriends.
Sadly, I cannot tell her that nor thank her for that because i don't wanna tell her that I've fallen for her because it's unethical when she is in a relationship and I don't want to make things weird between us.
And I am proud of myself because i was always pushing her to fix things with her bf when she had problems instead of benefiting from it for my good and i've been assuring her that she is perfect for him whenever she doubts herself.

 But I wanted a memory of that moment in my life cause for me it's a milestone, and who knows maybe  in few months i might find another fish in the sea who is single and be able to send this post to girl I am writing about.
