0,ohrck0,1625952668,Thought being the rejecter instead of rejected would feel less shitty. It doesn‚Äôt.,"Inb4 ‚Äúthis post is just a flex‚Äù, it‚Äôs not, fuck off, I‚Äôm just venting.

I grew up constantly being friendzoned, told I‚Äôm ‚Äútoo nice‚Äù and being rejected left right and centre. I am now finally reaching levels of confidence where I‚Äôm actually getting dates (albeit not with girls I like).

Went on another date tonight. Previous 4 in the last months I rejected all of them (not a nice feeling). But today hurt a lot.

She was lovely, bubbly, sweet and smiley. I WISH I could force myself to like her but I couldn‚Äôt. I made up my mind in about 10 seconds that I didn‚Äôt like her.

She was shorter and chubbier than I expected (couldn‚Äôt tell on her profile). I could get over that though but her attitude/personality didn‚Äôt do it for me. She was really ‚Äòcute‚Äô but I like sexy, edgy, proper femme fatale.

This sounds pathetic but I feel like I want to cry. I talked to her throughout our cute date and established pretty soon that we weren‚Äôt compatible and told her as much. And what hurt most was she spent the rest of the date trying to impress me and change my mind.

I felt like I was consistently kicking a puppy in the face. I was hoping that at least if I was doing the rejecting I wouldn‚Äôt feel sad but I do. She was an absolute angel and did nothing wrong apart from not turning me on one bit.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ohrck0/thought_being_the_rejecter_instead_of_rejected/
1,ohrgds,1625953034,Stop Feeling Sorry For Yourself Guys!,"I get it...

We live in a different era than our fathers and grandfathers especially did. 

Online dating apps have brought out the most spoiled, most privileged, and certainly the most pickiest of women to ever exist. 

A lot of you guys probably assume you are ""forever alone"" or whatever excuse you give yourself for why you aren't successful with women at all. 

Here's a little something I learned as a 25-year-old autistic male virgin who's never had a GF in his life and doesn't plan on getting one anytime soon...

Simply talk to women whether online (that is through social media) or irl with ***no expectations*** that she'll respond in kind, give you her number, or even put out for you for that matter. 

And don't just talk to the ""pretty ones"" or to ""normal"" women mentally speaking. 

You'd be surprised how many average, but cute-looking women will give you the time of day or women you don't think you'd get along with because she's not ""your type"" in general. 

You'd also be surprised how human a lot of women are and how listening to their problems and sharing your own problems in turn makes you a better man. 

Cut the ""alpha male"" crap guys, there's nothing macho about being a ""Tyler Durden"" esque kind of guy who acts like he's all that, but is also secretly hiding his true self for fear of being judged harshly. 

By simply going in with **zero expectations**, I've built online relationships with women from various walks of life (including NSFW content creators who are female) and I don't feel bad that I'm not dating any of them long-distance because I know there are plenty more wonderful women out there irl and that in time, I'll be their ""Prince Charming"" without even having to try simply because I don't expect to get *anything* out of them nor do I play games with them and by communicating with women over social media, I've learned to be more honest with myself and to be more direct with my intentions.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ohrgds/stop_feeling_sorry_for_yourself_guys/

I‚Äôm legitimately stumped because I totally thought we this could be something really great. Not really looking for advice or anything.

3,ohrlnm,1625953536,I (24 m) made out with my one of my sister‚Äôs best friends (23 f). Now we‚Äôre going to hang out tonight.,"I went on a trip with a group of friends this week. We spent four days at a cabin hiking, canoeing, drinking, smoking and just having a great time. There were nine of us all together. Five girls and four guys. Two of the girls were my sister and her friend Shayna.

I‚Äôve known Shay for about ten years. I‚Äôve always thought she was really cute but when we were younger my sister and I promised we‚Äôd never date each other‚Äôs friends. We both figured it could cause too much drama. Since we‚Äôre only a year apart we‚Äôve also shared the same friend group over the years.

Anyway Shay is a tall athletic girl with this great long black curly hair. She and I have always flirted a lot but because of my promise to my sister I‚Äôve never pursued her. I‚Äôve always been able to make Shay laugh and we get along really good.

On the last night of the trip (Thursday) me and Shay ended up being the last two sitting out by the fire. We were talking and joking and I made a stupid joke that made her laugh. She told me I was a dork. I agreed. Then she said ‚ÄúBut you‚Äôre a cute dork.‚Äù Next thing I know she plants a kiss right on my lips. Not a peck either. A full on kiss. We ended up making out for like an hour out by the fire. 

We came home yesterday and as we were all packing up Shay kept smiling at me. Of course I smiled back. I figured we just had a nice little make out session and that would be it. But then this morning at work I got a text from her asking me to call her. I called her on my lunch break and she asked me if I‚Äôd like to meet up with her for drinks this evening so we could talk. 

So now this evening I‚Äôm going to meet up with her and see what happens. I don‚Äôt know if I should feel guilty or not. I mean I made that promise to my sister when we were in high school. Now we‚Äôre all adults and I feel like if this girl is into me I want to pursue it.

She's African American, so am I,  she asked me why am I 28 with no kids, I told her because I'm not rushing having kids, I want to make the best mature decision I possibly can on who ends up being the mother of my children, there's way too many situations where guys who want to do right by their kids are destroyed by a bitter woman and a favorable court system. When I have a kid, I want to be in that kids life the right way, I want to be a real father and raise my child.

She asked me why am I not married, I told her because marriage isn't the same as it once was, though I would like to have a solid marriage, I also want to find someone worth taking that step with, even if I never get married, at least I won't be in a miserable one. When I find someone I feel is worth taking that step, I'll consider it, until then I'm in no rush.

She went on to tell me how she's a pastor's daughter and that she hasn't really met a 28 year old like myself or with my mindset, me being older and mature, I took her words with a grain of salt, the time has long passed where I was gullible and believed whatever a woman tells me.

Thursday she had to pull an all nighter and I had just got back into town from visiting home for the 4th of July, I went by to take care of a few things and there she was working, her eyes lit up when she saw me and she said hello, it's late at night, I have nothing going on and I'm still on vacation time until next week so I sat down and we talked for a little bit. She took my phone and added her snapchat and she added me back, I'm thinking okay cool.


I'll be honest she's definitely an attractive woman, and has a great personality, today I happened to be scrolling through my conversations on snap, and I was free today so I was gonna send her a message, turns out she blocked me Friday, which was yesterday, I couldn't do nothing but laugh and shake my head cause it was so weird, added me Thursday, blocked me Friday, and I'll be seeing her at work Monday, talk about awkward.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ohrp6l/so_much_for_that/

7,ohs0s4,1625954993,What would you do in this situation?,"There was a guy I went on a date with and hooked up with before the pandemic and we still occassionally snapchat. As it turns out, our two best friends are now dating each other so we still have a weird connection to each other.

I ran into him at a bar last night and we talked for a bit. I hadn't seen him in person in over a year, and I still find him attractive. However, I've been advised not to date him for fear of causing a potentially awkward situation between our two friends if something bad were to happen between us.

So after I ran into him, some time passed and I saw he wasn't there. I was sitting next the friend I was at the bar with (not the friend mentioned earlier) and I decided to ask if he was still at the bar. He said no, but then said something along the lines of he could come back. I don't entirely remember because my snapchat messages deleted everything. 

At this point, my friend is begging me to take my phone so she can say something flirty to him (as me), but just ended up talking in a way that made me uncomfortable (nothing too sexual, but definitely flirting). I took the phone back and immediately apologized saying my friend took my phone. He said it was all good and nothing else happened. I don't entirely remember his responses, just that he sent the üò¨ face. 

I feel so embarrassed because he probably thought I was drunk texting him and then lied about it. I told both of our best friends about it, so then if he confronted his best friend about it, she would know the truth. Do I just completely forget it happened? Should I not say anything to him about it over snapchat? What would you do?


TL;DR: I ran into a guy that I hooked up with last year at a bar last night. Our best friends are dating each other now, so we're vaguely acquainted still. My friend (different friend) took my phone from me after I was messaging him and started being really flirty. He seemed uncomfortable over snapchat and when I took my phone back I apologized to him and told him my friend took my phone. I feel like he doesn't believe me but I don't know what to do or if I should do anything. I will most likely see him again bc our friends are dating so I don't want to make things awkward.

8,ohs1t6,1625955087,Complicated situation with crush,"So it all started when I asked this girl out one day. I used to see her in the university at different places and sometimes we would have eye contacts and I would catch her looking at me. She seemed really timid. So one day I decided to go talk to her, she was sitting alone somewhere and I just went up to her and said hi and started chatting. In the end I asked if she wanted to go out and she said yes and I got her socials and a week later I texted but she didn‚Äôt reply (didn‚Äôt even make it seen). I thought she wasn‚Äôt interested and was just being nice at that time. Weeks passed and again whenever I would see her, she would keep looking at me but I was too embarrassed to have eye contact with her so i avoided it. Also I would occasionally see the posts she would like on Instagram in my news feed which seemed pretty close to our situation. From all the posts she would like, I gathered she is really timid, suffers from anxiety, likes me but is very afraid to show it and wants me to wait. This staring of her and me avoiding being near to her continued on for 2-3 months. Then I decided to text her again. When I texted her, she again didn‚Äôt reply which was very surprising. Now it‚Äôs been a month since then, occasionally I would see her in the gym and she would still look at me, sometimes workout next to me. But i feel very insulted and embarrassed to talk to her now. I really like this girl but I don‚Äôt know where is this going. Now I‚Äôm unsure that if she even likes me or not. I need some really good advice how to make this right and approach her.

P.S More details: She doesn‚Äôt even follow me back, she has an open profile with which I followed her twice before texting her both time. Before I texted her the second time, I made a stupid mistake, I was going through the chat settings on IG and I changed the theme to love and when I realised it sends that change a message to the other person, I quickly changed it to some other. I expected that she would block me but she actually accepted the message request (Request as she doesn‚Äôt follow me back) And few days after the second text I received a notification that she followed me but later when I checked she didn‚Äôt.

How can I move on? I‚Äôm so tired of thinking of him, I guess the main reason is that no one caught my attention since then in the way he did.

When we matched, we had really pleasant and quick conversations over tinder here and there but one day decided to exchange numbers and planned to meet. I, during a stressful time in my life, got cold feet and kind of ghosted him. (Terrible I know, I feel terrible). A few days after we were supposed to meet, I texted him and apologized and explained what was going on though and he was actually very cool about it. From there, for about two weeks we kind of lost contact for the most part barring a small convo or two but nothing significant. Suddenly, about two weeks ago, he hits me up out of nowhere asking me to confirm my day off and inviting me to hangout. I agreed, it was very exciting a to have him initiate. We walked around downtown and visited a couple of parks and it was actually a really good time, even with a sort of awkward goodbye. 

We continue to text after that and only 5 days later I initiate another hangout to which he agreed. It was another park but this park is particularly intimate (namely romantic) and we basically had a picnic. He shared his blanket with me and towards the end of the night we laid down on his blanket and listened to music and had great conversations. Another really good time we had. 

This was very recent. I now am wondering what could come of this, romantically but 1) i don‚Äôt think we‚Äôve had a proper date for me to assume that he‚Äôs actually interested in me romantically. Neither hangout has been titled as a ‚Äúdate‚Äù by either of us. We have even picked out a place for our next ‚Äúhangout‚Äù and loosely made other plans but no ‚Äúdates‚Äù. 

The BIG detail here, to me at least, is that when we first matched, his profile stated that he was ‚Äúmostly looking for friends‚Äù. I am truly stuck and would be bummed out if he could only see me as a friend but at the same time, I can handle rejection and am always grateful to add another great friend to my circle, especially someone like him.

Left alone at some events with her excuse being she slept in or picked up a shift.

She is close to my family, but I never had met her family. My family thinks I should just continue for something because she is the ‚Äúkindest/sweetest human ever‚Äù. But knowing my experiences I think it would lead to a bad relationship (which she had been part of a few).

I had put my foot down after the third ‚Äúflake‚Äù, explaining how absolutely ignorant she was on this. She tends to overthink things or think most of everything is her fault, so she was terribly sorry. I decided to leave it all for her to think about it and haven‚Äôt called or seen her since.

Sometimes I think she is avoiding a relationship, but she always tries to call me out for not reaching out to her for anything. My thought is maybe she is only trying to start lots of little candles to keep warm, rather than trying to start a flame. 

All I can do is respect her choices and move on, but  I think of her often like the dumb brain some of us men have. So I continue to work out, work, school, do things and be with friends when I can. My perspective is like what can I do to not think of her. Being religious, I pray about for clarity in thought and direction through this challenge.

Any tips? Should I just continue to leave it all up to her? I want to move on. I try to be careful in thought that this is just one girl, not one on a pedestal.

34,ohu1fg,1625962249,She walks in the apartment completely naked with a guy following her?,"I'm an ex-boyfriend of this 24F girl I moved into an apartment with just last week. We are NOT exclusive, although we have agreed to a few house rules. 

1. If we ""raw"" doggy with anyone we need to let the other know out of respect for STDs.
2. We were ""supposed"" to not bring other people back to the apartment. What happens outside is fine but we share a bed and play around and agreed this was respectful of the shared domicile.

That's pretty much it for the rules. I spend half my time in the apartment and half my time in a country home and don't ask too many questions. She calls a lot. I call her a lot. We have a great friendship and I genuinely care about her.

Why are we not together? Our relationship took a dive during ""Rona"" and she went back to her hardcore party friends. They hang out with all the coke dealers in town. Close the bars down. Mix and mingle like tigers in what I call the ""social toilet bowl"" of the city. She's been partying hard most of her young life and was quite the wreck when I met her. She got herself back on her feet, got a good job, went back to school, etc. Then we broke up. She took the summer off from school and has been party party party the last 2+ months. 

So here's my dilemma. I installed a security camera in my office at the apartment because I knew she'd have ""friends"" over, and given their behavior I wanted video of my expensive set up should anything happen to it. 

My first week back and and my camera caught her walking IN THE DOOR completely naked at what I think is 11AM or 1PM (the clock was off). Not a damn thing on. Just a phone in her right hand and a scrunchy on her left. She clearly just walked in because her dog is doing the ""OMG you are home"" dance to greet her. Behind her is this grungy looking skinny guy that is completely dressed holding some bag and a bottle of water. He's got this creepy grin on his face as he follows her into the living room. I noticed she was wiping her nose a bit and looked absolutely demolished. 

She disappears from the view for 20 seconds and then reappears looking into my office. She looks annihilated, closes the door, and the rest I can't see. 

I'm not sure I'm going to confront her on this issue. She is free to see other people although I am concerned she is violating the rules of the house the FIRST day I was gone. Plus, when I ask her if she's slept with anyone tonight when she gets home from work, for STD purposes, I bet she's going to say no. 

I am concerned about her well being. I'm sensing the following could be true:

1. She's doing a lot more cocaine (she can literally rattle off all the coke dealers in town and who has the best, the worst, and her good friend was sleeping with one of them for a while).
2. She's giving up her body for cocaine as the dude did not look like her type at all. 

But this is the strange part. How did she come in COMPLETELY NAKED? Did this guy drive her home naked and she walked up the stairs naked (pretty visible area)? Or, was this maybe the next door neighbor (they are losers over there) and she was bringing him back over to our place after? 

I just can't wrap myself around the walking in the house completely naked. How is that even possible? Why?

These are some of the ‚Äúsigns‚Äù that makes me think that she likes me...

**I catch her staring at me often. She‚Äôs a very observant person, so I don‚Äôt think that this is a sign. I catch her looking at me at least twice a day. Once I caught her staring at me while smiling.**

**We joke around a lot and I make her laugh often. One time she said ‚Äúyou‚Äôre so funny‚Äù.**

**She remembers a lot about me. I‚Äôll mention something once and she‚Äôll remember it. Even really small things.**

**We tease each other all day long. Like the other day we were shooting trash in a trash can she said how if we played basketball 1v1 she‚Äôd beat me. We tease each other about our food tastes and random stuff all day. 50% of our conversations is just us teasing each other about something. We also compete with each other over little stuff.**

**The other day we got tipped at our job, but because of my position I couldn‚Äôt accept the tip. I jokingly said I was upset, and she said she‚Äôs bring my a Gatorade and some sour skittles (we talked earlier about our love of sour skittles). Sure enough, the next morning she brought me some. I will say that I‚Äôve had female coworkers buy me random snacks before, but it was always platonic and they never bought me a snack they knew I loved.**

**She asked me if I worked a certain day, and said she‚Äôd bring me a thing of milk that day. We teased each other a while back about how I love to drink milk, while she hates it (lactose intolerance). It was a joke at first but she said she‚Äôd really bring it. I asked her what‚Äôs her favorite snack so I could bring her something too. The day arrived and she actually brought me a small thing of milk. I also gave her the snack I bought. Later she bought a thing of chocolate milk from our cafeteria to ‚Äúprove to me‚Äù that she can drink milk.**
 
**Yesterday morning she showed me a video of herself that she recorded for me of her drinking milk at home after work. She flipped off the camera afterwards, which I thought was funny.**

**Yesterday was so stressful with at our job that she started crying at one point. I pulled her to the back and we talked and I was able to calm her down. Towards the end of the day, she went to our work cafeteria and bought me another thing of milk.**

Since I‚Äôm her supervisor, even if I wanted to I couldn‚Äôt ask her out. At first I wasn‚Äôt attracted to her, but now I kinda am. I may ask her out, but that‚Äôll be after she leaves our job in August.

53,ohvyz1,1625970031,How do I stop being stupid?,"
In fall of 2020 we had a couple of new girls join our country‚Äôs society in college. We all only used to meet in a group when the societies had events. Eventually a smaller group formed where me and this one girl were in the same group. We followed each other on insta, and she is an active poster, and i started liking her/ developing a crush.

In the meanwhile a fight happened amongst another group me and her were a part of, and how she handled the whole thing and trying to save friendships, really got my attention and i developed stronger feelings for her.

We started talking, and were messaging alott‚Ä¶for like a month, i being stupid..was complimenting/reacting to all her stories and listening to her life problems, telling her how she is an awesome person(i know I‚Äôm stupid). We started meeting more frequently as a group too. 

Then one day she just told me that she has been noticing what I‚Äôve been saying and how I‚Äôve been treating her and she only thinks of me as a brother/friend (yikes) and if i still want to pursue this and make her awkward, she can leave the group OR we can go back to being friends and have things be normal again.

I didn‚Äôt react harshly and just told her that its fine, she just gave me a generic rejection‚Ä¶‚Äùits just not the right time/i haven‚Äôt found the one‚Äù. 
I said okay and just stopped messaging her. 

The rejection made me think about my life and what lacked in it that I‚Äôm being rejected. I made some changes to my life and I‚Äôm trying to be better for MYSELF, workout, focus on my mental health and i haven‚Äôt thought about her that much, although low-key i still have feelings for her, even though ig i shouldn‚Äôt. 

Recently she reached out and said that she valued our friendship and wants to save it and she doesn‚Äôt want me to not be friends over some feelings(this felt like my feelings weren‚Äôt even valuable) and told me how she thought i was there for her and a good friend etc.

I realize that i was simping and was giving her everything without any commitment. I don‚Äôt think i can think about her just as a friend. 

What do i say to not come across as a douche and lookout for myself and not be Classic Schmoseby.

54,ohw3hp,1625970563,"I just finished bawling for two hours in my bed...after the fourth date, my date ghosted me after I discussed past sexual abuse","My date and I were having an amazing fourth date together. He had even been talking about things that we were going to be doing on our future dates. Then, during the time of being intimate/snuggling in his bed, I made one statement that said, ""Sometimes just certain sexual things (like finishing) can be very difficult for me because when I was younger, I was sexually abused."" He did not say anything in response to this. He did seem upset though afterwards mentally (although did not say he was verbally). Soon after, he told me that it was probably best if I left because he had to be at work at 6 AM. I then texted him a week later (after no contact) stating that I was very sorry if what I said upset him (I said it multiple times within the same text). He never responded. It's been a month since that date. I am utterly heartbroken and also concerned. I just think his reaction is so odd and bizarre. If I text someone apologizing if I upset them and that person never responds, doesn't that mean that clearly they are upset and giving me the cold shoulder? I'm also worried that I could have possibly triggered him if he had abuse himself in his past, and he was so upset by this. I really did not mean to cause such a mess by this, I just wanted to tell him that my hesitancy to do sexual things has absolutely nothing to do with my feelings for him - it has everything to do with sometimes I get very embarrassed and ashamed of my body. He definitely did NOT seem like the ghosting type, I feel like he would only ghost someone if he found them unsafe or if he was truly mad at them. I just think his reaction to everything is so bizarre. I mean, I really thought he was a nice person. I just think his reaction is really unusually cold.

Some of my very best friends are ex‚Äôs. 

The gag is I‚Äôm not single! I‚Äôm in a LDR of two years with a lovely man I have a great connection with. This relationship is friendly but also romantic/sexual. This is my only one at the moment. I am poly and I don‚Äôt really have any romantic interests in my city right now.

I‚Äôm completely gagged because I don‚Äôt think that I should date. I say this because I think they are right. Most of my cherished connections are platonic. I can wholeheartedly agree that we are better off as friends. I feel so much better hanging with them that way. I feel like I can really be myself and connect with them. I‚Äôm sure I act weird in some way when I like someone that turns them off. Then they reflect and realize that we are great friends too and want to continue that. 

I‚Äôm not sure why I act weird but if I do, maybe I shouldn‚Äôt be doing this. I can‚Äôt even identify any specific thing that I do. Maybe reactions that are a little too strong and language/emojis that I use make people think I‚Äôm becoming attached too fast?

During our date, we kinda discussed more about our dating past and I noticed that these other guys didn't have to go through what I did (though these guys spent hundreds of dollars on her)! She was available! Sure enough I kinda got turned off about the idea of a 3rd date and jumping through her hoops, so as I broke the hug, I basically said: ""Hey I'm just fine being friends too"" in which she paused for a few seconds, and then told me she'd be more comfortable about this because she was in her early 20s and I was approaching 30 and she didn't like the age gap and was conflicted with it (BS since she thought an actor in his 40s was hot). So anyways, I played the friendly guy part and ended things that way there isn't any drama. I also plan on slowly phasing out and pursuing other people. But I wanted to know if what I did was a good way of breaking things off without being rude?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ohwtiw/did_i_handle_this_well_in_just_being_friends_with/

64,ohx31n,1625974646,I (20m) like someone (43f) in a serious way but she doesn‚Äôt live near me. How can I properly express myself?,"Her and I have spoken for about two months. We‚Äôve said good mornings and good nights nearly every day. We send Snapchat‚Äôs of our pets and things in our daily lives. A few times a week we send voice messages and talk about our day and other various topics (she doesn‚Äôt like calling, and thought voice messages was a good way to work around it. We‚Äôre both busy relatively). I managed to get her to sign up for tiktok and we now spam each other with hilarious videos we find. We‚Äôve also had a fair share of lewd exchanges (interestingly enjoys random pics from me). 

Now, I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm misinterpreting things as her being merely friendly and casual, or her being into me. 

We met off Reddit on one of my other accounts. Interestingly it was off a confession post about me liking older women more than women my age. 

Instantly I wanted to be clear about all of this, and she was absolutely fine with how young I am. We right away began chatting every day. I am 100% certain she‚Äôs not a scammer or out for anything. About a week ago, I told her I like her. She says she really enjoys our vibe. I‚Äôve shared with her how difficult it has been for me to find anyone near me to date. Even online, it‚Äôs been difficult. After that we kind of left it at that and resumed things. 

She hasn‚Äôt ghosted me, she hasn‚Äôt stopped replying to me. She definitely shows signs of interest‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm kind of confused. I didn‚Äôt really get a clear answer from her if she likes me back. Perhaps she‚Äôs contemplating? I haven‚Äôt asked, and I prefer things to mold naturally and organic. 

I haven‚Äôt came across anyone in a long time (2+ years) where it feels so‚Ä¶ natural? Genuine? Just enjoying the moment. 

To elaborate a bit further, she‚Äôs thousands of miles from me. Both in USA. I‚Äôm MST and she‚Äôs in CST. 

I guess I‚Äôm all ‚Ä¶ anxious. The ‚Äúdamn I really like this person‚Äù anxious.

But there's something missing, and I've felt this with most of the people I've been involved with (only 4, so limited experience). I seem to end up dating people who are more passive and hard to read, or like they just aren't *that* into me. I know this sounds cheesey but I guess I just crave having someone who matches my energy, someone more intense and.. well, I guess more obviously interested in me? I want them to be excited to talk to me or spend time with me, make it more clear that they actually like me, etc. With this girl she still basically talks to me like a friend even though we've established more than that? Or like I'll compliment her and just get ""haha thanks"" or something, also stuff like that. I've seen other couples who have the kind of relationship I want, but I can't seem someone to find someone who likes me as much as I like them, as pathetic as that sounds. 

I also tend to be very talkative and energetic, and she's more introverted and stoic. I find myself holding back so that I'm not too much, I guess.

75,ohxqrp,1625977508,How to differentiate between gut instinct and being too picky?,"I met this guy on a dating app. We texted a week before first date. Something seemed off about his texts. He wasn't like other guys. He texted constantly (which other guys didn't do so early on). By constantly I mean: he'd text me during the workday asking ""what are you doing"" and if I didn't reply in 5 minutes would send another text asking ""?"". Something just seemed...off. But I dismissed that because maybe people are different IRL. The night before scheduled first date, at 9 PM he asks me to drive to his area (30 mins away) and go to a bar with him which I thought is a bit sketchy considering we hadn't even met yet and HAD a first date planned for lunch the next day. First date was okay, but again something seemed off. For someone who seemed clingy over text this guy did not talk much...he barely talked. Long periods of awkward silence. I got the vibe, not of someone being shy, but rather...of strange, mysterious...but there was no rational explanation for this. Just a feeling I got.

In between first and second date he kept sending me pictures of himself. I don't know why. His profile, and mine too, have many recent pictures of us in professional and casual settings. It was like he was trying to flaunt himself and his muscles. I didn't reciprocate with much excitement. He asked me for a picture too and I asked him why-considering we met already-he just stopped there. Again continues to be very clingy on text. I'm a resident physician and I told him I can't reply immediately when I'm with patients but he didn't stop.

I definitely felt something was off and weird but again can't fully rationalize it. It's more a strange mysterious vibe. 

Second date today went progressively worse. Something was just creepy about the way he looked at me. Again, hard to explain, one would need to be there to see. We decided we would get lunch then take a walk around the park. At lunch he ordered a drink and asked me if I'd want one. I politely declined saying I can't day drink as I had to do some work later today. During the walk in the park he took out a shot of alcohol from his pocket and downed it. Again, something was weird about his behavior...the strange, quiet behavior, the mysterious vibe. And then he began to get touchy feely. I'd move his hands away and he would still do it. I never reciprocated but moved his hand away or moved away from him. I'd have thought this was enough to make him stop but nah. I then told him I had to go home to get work done. He insisted I go with him-to a ""surprise place"" and wouldn't tell me where-took my hand and made me go...it ends up being a bar. He said ""I know you won't enjoy this"" but proceeded to a table and guided me to it by physically putting his hands on me...and then got 4 drinks and downed them. He barely talked during this time. I tried to make convo but he barely talked. TBH I was out of it by now, totally out of it. But from time to time he'd get touchy feely, move closer to me...and I tried to move further away..

I then insisted I HAD to leave. He wanted to ""hang out"" even more but I insisted.

Looking back, my gut instinct about him was right but I had no rational data until really this date. Anyone else have similar experiences?

1. Should i text a last goodbye message like ""i can see you lost interest, and i wanna stop in good terms, good luck on everything""?

I didn't really wanna have sex on our first date (cause i was on my period) but he didn't mind and honestly was so sweet so i thought okay whatever. After that, we saw each other once  and then he stopped talking so i thought he was going to ghost me and i deleted him from everything. But then he reappeared (i assume he wasn't having much fun ) and i was okay but i realized he was a little manipulative. Like for example in our first date, he said it was his first time using tinder and he did not like it but he continued using it ... i thought it was a silly lie like he didn't expect me to believe THAT? anyways we kept seeing each other like every other week and i thought we had chemistry like it was all fun and games and even though i knew he was seeing other girls (i knew cause i stalked the hell out of him) i didn't mind. I guess i was fine with it being not serious even though i did start to have a crush on him but i never fought or asked questions, that was until he started asking me weird questions... like if i was dating one of the friends i was in a Christmas pic with and pointing out i was looking other guys on Instagram. After a while of not speaking again i was bored and back on tinder i happened to see his profile again and i swipe right thinking there's no way we'll match again but we did lol. But then things got very weird i vented about my personal life to him which i regretted because i didnt want us to get too close because i knew he was a player, then he saw me walking with a friend and was a lil too inquisitive about it: he asked me is it was a date to which i jokingly answered that it was none of his business and then he got big mad and told me he kinda liked me and wanted to spend more time with me i was like okay... cause i felt like it was 1, a lie and 2. that now that he wanted me i wasn't mentally prepared to spend more time with him. After having disappeared because i was sick and honestly told him to f\*ck off for a week he invited me for a walk (btw i feel like don't need to mention this but our meetings were strictly to have sex, so we did have sex and then took a walk) when we were walking we ran into this other girl he had hooked up with and i was jealous as all hell. The fact that he was seeing all these girls that were so much prettier than me made me feel so insecure and i obviously did not hide it well and he was all like "" you're jealous :p hahah"" and i was all like: ""I'm nooot :("" and then i made up this story about this boy in my hometown that thought that was in a relationship with me and that i was projecting my jealousy cause i felt guilty and some shit. IT WAS DERANGED and then he ghosted me and omg i feel soooo bad why did i do that instead of actually communicating my feelings and now i have to carry this guilt but i cannot apologize or anything and i feel bad for lying. should i just apologize ? or maybe hope he gets it like i don't know i am seeking help cause i never used to do crazy shit like that.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ohy93b/i_feel_terrible_for_my_behavior_even_though_he/

94,ohzokk,1625986604,Is it wrong to tell him I love him?,"So my... well, I wouldn't say boyfriend, we like eachother, but distance is a thing and he's not completely comfortable with it (veeeery different backgrounds socially, apparently anyways.) but I can't help but feel like I messed up. He's had a lot of bad relationships before, and so have I, but I wanted to be genuine with him today, I wanted to just... let him know that he's loved and appreciated, for once.

I've been really reserved about saying anything like that because I don't really understand him well, language is a barrier (partially at least), and he's also shy and a bit withdrawn, he's said he likes me, but it's been done in the weirdest way, and I take it that it was done in the way it was because he was embarrassed about it, which is fine, but he's not always easy to understand. I was thinking about it a lot though, and I felt bad that I wasn't saying it more often... you know, at least from my past experiences, people like to hear that you love them sometimes, and he's been going through some hard times at work recently. so I thought maybe he'd be happy if I said it again.

Turns out it confused him, he didn't understand why I told him that I loved him again, and he later on said ""My (his) feelings are a bother sometimes"" and I honestly don't understand what he was talking about. Sometimes he speaks in riddles, it's not easy to understand him sometimes... and it doesn't help that I'm extremely dense as well. Even if it was done in good interest, I think I may have screwed up by telling him that I loved him... Was I wrong to? I'm really confused, but I don't want to push him for answers or bother him about it.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ohzokk/is_it_wrong_to_tell_him_i_love_him/

We ended up talking the whole date and we talked about murder documentaries we liked. I went in for the kiss and she denied me. Which I respected. Two days from the date she made it clear she didn‚Äôt wanna see me again. Of course I had to respect it. I didn‚Äôt ask why and respected her opinion.

96,ohzuyj,1625987497,When is self-esteem too much?,"I've battled with my self-esteem for a really long time. I was never ugly per-se but I was a kid, and of course back then during my teenage years I felt a lot of pressure to be pretty like the rest of my classmates. Like everyone lol. I used to cry in front of the mirror because I hated my face, my skin, my nose, my hair, my hips, my legs, my stomach, my teeth, everything. My ""friends"" made fun of me because of my personality but I didn't realise any of that until the last couple of years. 

In 2020 I went through my first real break-up. Awful. I wanted to die. I didn't sleep, I could only cry. I would walk around my house waiting for a call from him. 10 months later and I'm thriving. I really am, I feel much better! I have a very high self-esteem both physically and emotionally. Well, this may be a lie, because when I feel the ones around me change their attitudes towards me because of this I go back to my shell. 

Why is it? Is my self-esteem just actually ego? Am I loving myself wrong? Am I being too much? Why is it that people change around you when you feel better about yourself? Thanks to my change in perspective I take no bullshit from anybody. First red flag I see, first thing I have in mind to discuss. I voice my opinion instead of laughing and saying ""hehe you're ruthless michael hihi"" (I believe this last thing is one of the reasons my old friends abandoned me).

97,ohzvjr,1625987587,I will become a 40 year old virgin in 2 weeks ( a wizard )," 

Some advices I have heard, were slightly dismal.

**""Just Go Talk To Her""**

In the city named Toronto, women are not so friendly

Guy : "" Hi my name is....""

Girl : "" Fxxk Off you have 3 seconds before I call cops on you""

**PROOF** [https://m.imgur.com/gallery/mxKH3fn](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/mxKH3fn)

I  have heard of "" Cold approach does not work, 99.9% of the time "" but  there will always be a guy or a girl who will claim ""I have met the love  of my life when I talked to her randomly in public"" or ""I met the love  of my life when I started talking to her completely out of nowhere in  public""

**"" Just Be Confident ""**

How   can you be confident if girls tell you to fxxk off even before you   finish the sentence "" Hi my name is...."" My confidence was shattered   years ago

And if that was not cruel enough, in Toronto, women walk away as soon as they see a man approaching where they are

A few weeks ago I went to a bus stop because that is where my bus was coming

There was a young woman, and when she saw me she walked away.

I did not have any micro intention to talk to her.  She looked in her early 20s ( too many years of age gap )

A few minutes later the bus arrived and inside the bus there was the young woman who walked away

It hurt my feelings

I talked about it and other men told me

""I   notice similar patterns but that is what it is, Toronto is a big city   and women often suffer inappropriate advances and harrassment""

Women told me

""Better safe than sorry""

""We are not mind readers""

""We would rather hurt men's feelings than suffer any negative experiences""

How can I gain a lover if women won't even let me say a word? Or let me approach her?

I   didn't have any need to say a word to the young woman at the bus stop   because if I had a question I can simply look it up on my phone, and to   be realistic, phones sometimes provide more detailed, upto date   infomation.  I had nothing to say to a girl I did not have any  information about.

And my English pronunciation is problematic

I can read write understand English without any significant problem(s) but my pronunciation is quite problematic",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ohzvjr/i_will_become_a_40_year_old_virgin_in_2_weeks_a/
98,ohzw2s,1625987670,How to stay happy single,"My advice on how to stay happy single:

What I've observed on me and on other people, there is one crucial aspect that determines whether or not you'll be happy being single, if you're not a ""natural"" (keep reading, I will explain what ""natural"" is). 

There are two types of single people - the happy ones and the unhappy ones. And there are two types of the happy ones - those who are naturally enjoying being single and it's just their core personality trait / genetics /or whatever that makes them to not want any relationships at all, they just naturally don't care regardless of their life situation - those people I call the TYPE 1 happy single - The Naturals and they are the minority. I'm not going to talk about them, since there is nothing to talk about this type - they are just the way they are and are damn lucky to be like that.

Now let's focus on the other type of happy single that most of us strive to be. They TYPE 2 happy single. When unhappy single people try to ask for advice on how to stay happy single, the advice is always like:

* stay busy
* get hobbies
* enjoy your company
* love yourself 
* I don't know, travel, go to Japan and try sushi or whatever
* make your life exciting 
* build your career focus on yourself
* ....and much more

I'm not going to mock this advice, it is actually a good advice since it can help with the main goal I'm going to get to. What I've noticed on people who took this advice to heart and practiced it, that in the end, after reaching all their career goals, travelling around the world and trying new hobbies... at the end, they ended up being unhappy single again. And why? Because all the advice on how to stay being single lacks the core aspect that makes difference between whether you'll end up being happy single and being unhappy single. And that is - **making yourself desirable and therefore voluntarily single.** That's all. If singledom comes out of choice, then you'll be happy single. If you can get relationship easily, you'll be happy single since you know you can get it any time you want. Being single out of choice is what makes you feel good about being single. Knowing that you're desirable and that you can certainly find someone that would desire you is extremely reassuring. Then being single is much much easier. 

That's the main difference between unhappy single and happy single. The people who I mentioned ""did everything right"" yeah, but in the end, they still felt like their single-ness was forced, involuntary and that they are not desirable - and that is where all the unhappiness comes from. Feeling unwanted and being unable to find a relationship is soul crushing. That's why some people who are single are so unhappy and angry. It's because they feel powerless. They feel like they can't change the situation, so even if you try to be happy in that situation, you'll never actually be happy since you'll always feel forced in it. That's it. That's all it is about. T

The key to become a happy single person is ironically obtaining the ability to get a relationship. All that advice people give you will help you a little but don't focus too much on that because you'll end up like the people I mentioned. Resolve the issue of your un-desirability. If you're single and desirable you'll be happy, if you're single and undesirable (or feel undesirable), than you'll end up unhappy and bitter despite trying all the hobbies in the world.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ohzw2s/how_to_stay_happy_single/
