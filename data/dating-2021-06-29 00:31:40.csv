1,oa1wwz,1624944857,I can’t experience heartbreak because I process love differently.,"
love is just.
If I feel love for you it means I’ll treat you as nicely as I can with no expectation of reciprocity. 

I’ll give u half of my life savings to get your life on track or give u a boost and I won’t regret it. Then I’ll use the motivation I got from helping you to help myself.

I’ll give u the warmest softest hugs. I’ll find a way to remove ur stress. Make you fall asleep.

I know it’s love because infatuation would make me feel trapped with you. It would inflate my ego.

 if others think it’s a dumb thing to give so much well it is due to a reluctance to empathize with an incomprehensibly altruistic personality.

I’m wired to feel good when the people I love feel good

Like honeslty i cant control who im attracted to. I just cant. Im asian and i cringe when i picture myself sleeping with asian woman. I have nothing against asian women but, im just not sexually attracted.

Even when i watch porn. Lets say it only shows the womans body and im enjoying myself. As soon as that camera pans up and it shows me its an asian woman, i start going soft. I cant even force myself to keep going, my brain just isnt in the mood anymore.

No, im not saying Asian women are ugly. If an asian woman is hot, ill admit it. But no matter how pretty she is, if she were to give me a lap dance. I just cant get turned on....

Im so sorry if disappointed my fellow asians just now. I love you guys, but i just cant help it. Ive been called a disgrace to my own culture and i feel so terrible about it.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oa25nc/is_it_bad_that_im_not_sexually_attracted_to_my/

4,oa2g3e,1624947185,Feel like it's too late,"Just a little background about myself is that I'm 26 (F) and got out of a 5 year relationship and have been single for the past 6 months. I've tried online dating but it feels very weird when you have been in a long term relationship. I feel like most, if not all of the dating apps are just monetizing people's loneliness and no one is really getting anywhere. 

Maybe it's just too late for me and I should just be happy with being alone. During these 6 months I have worked on myself a lot, I no longer have anxiety driving long distances, I've tried to connect with friends I haven't talked to or seen for over a year. I have also worked on myself physically such as swimming and running, and focus on fitness and eating right. 

But during the weekend I saw friends I hadn't seen in a while and most of them were couples and I had to tell them that my ex and I were no longer together. I felt like I used to be a part of ""the couple"" group and now I'm just alone. And my ex is a much more fun person to have around, he was always the life of the party and I'm nothing compared to that. And although I want to be mature and be able to hang out with our mutual friends I know that they will want to hang out with my ex more. 
It just sucks, because not only did I lose and am grieving the ""future"" I had in mind with my ex I am going to lose my friends too. I'm introverted so I feel good being alone, but I'm also human and need interactions with friends. 

And I know most people will say I'm young and that I'll find someone better but it's just difficult finding someone who values authentic connections instead of just getting that instant gratification of sending nudes or sex. No one wants to organically grow and build a relationship with someone, and that really sucks.

5,oa2kbj,1624947720,Need help reading this gurl,"So I had a graduation party and I invited some co workers and employees. On of those employees I helped promote a while back, and I been knowing her for 9 months now. So we were all drinking and I normally don’t ever drink and everyone knows that. I drinked, and I got really tipsy and happy. She was drinking too but she didn’t get drunk she was just tipsy like me. So as I was starting to lose it tipsy and my confidence went over the head as I talked to my coworkers and friends, she asked me to get a chair and sit next to her. I really wasn’t talking to her I was talking to my friends playing beer pong and stuff and she started grabbing and holding my hand. She initiated that I didn’t expect a move like that from her since she is usually somewhat timid and calm. She would let go and place my hand in her knee a few times and I would move away and she would hold my hand again and repeat. Some points she would squish and hold my hand tight but never once did I initiate that behavior myself. She started leaning against me and put her head in my shoulder and that I did do back to her. What does this mean was she crushing on me or was she just worried for me. Because next to her prior to me was her best friend from work a guy. She could’ve done what she did with me to him, but she chose me. We usually aren’t close like that but we are in good terms. She is kinda cute but prior to this, I would never talk to her or see her like that because she is an employee I helped move up and I was her boss once. I always thought she was cute and all, but after that I really want to talk to her and get to know her.

I’ve been in a codependent relationship with someone who is somewhat a narcissist. I have been in a previous situation where I was the 3rd party and being used to and this is quite literally the same situation. It’s funny though because it seemed like the universe leveled up and threw the same situation in my life, but in a more enticing, lustful, and dramatic way. I have been so torn because yet here I am, relating to someone who’s sadness I can relate too, who’s companionship I’m always seeking, yet so unavailable emotionally (again). In the past few months I have ruminating about this “situation-ship” , I think to myself, “why am I putting myself through this torture?” Finally today It clicked, I allow myself to be used this way. I was playing the victim, “why do I keep attracting these people” until I saw on tik tok that unhealthy people go where anybody will accept them. Today I realized I think I’ve been disappointed in myself for going through this again, but at the same time I got excited because I’ve finally come to the resolution I’ve been seeking. So I do have to thank this person for teaching me the lessons that I needed to learn so I can be better equipped in the dating scene. What motivates me is that there is someone out there that will be a perfect fit for me, til then I’ll be doing my inner work to be a happy, healthier stable partner 😊",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oa2zxd/just_wanted_to_share_my_accomplishment_today/

A short and simple advice. As studies and surveys recently show about a third of women only go on dates for a free meal, so if you're a dude who who is paying for bout of you on a first date your literally just trowing money away in about 30% percent of the time. Stop thinking that you might win her over with flashy dinner because you have a better chance of return on investem if you just used that money on the lotery. And to the women who will say it's just the gentlemanly thing to do, it's also the ladylike to go to the date to actually want and to see the person there. So this social contract is broken. Plus isnt a date supposed to be the first meeting where both parties are excited to meet and see if they like each other, and not just a transaction where for the price of a sandwitch you might gate a girls attetion for half an hour. I mean dudes if you want to trow money at women to show you attention atleast get a prostitute, that way atleast you have a guranteed happy ending.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oa4v4b/always_go_dutch_on_a_first_date_as_a_guy/
27,oa50yc,1624960022,Conflicting signals during break,"I’ve been dating this woman on and off for a few years now. We don’t get into arguments/fights and have always been supportive of each other. Sometimes she’s initiated breaks and other times I have. I initiated the current one. Our reason behind our breaks usually has something to do with our personal lives not being compatible at the moment. We always end on a good note and keep in touch and still act flirty/saucy in our conversations. These breaks usually last a few months at a time. These breaks don’t even seem like breaks/periods of non dating as much as they do us keeping things low key. However, during our last couple of off periods she has been acting off. She’ll go a couple weeks talking to me all day/night and act more interested than I’ve ever see her been. She’ll even verbalize what acts of physical intimacy she would like to engage in when we’re just texting. She does this for a few weeks, and then she’ll spend a couple weeks acting unfamiliar and uninterested. She doesn’t show any affection, she barely talks. Her choice of words/things she says seems strange as well. For example, I might send her a message midday saying “just a reminder that I love you and appreciate you” and she’d reply “I appreciate you too.” I know I sound like I’m overreacting but I feel it’s odd that she leaves out the first part when she’s told me before many times she loves me and it’s easy to put in. She doesn’t use any non platonic vocabulary during these periods and she might not put any effort into keeping the conversation going. Sometimes she’ll give really simple answers to any questions that I can’t really do anything with and then she won’t ask me anything/try to engage me in the conversation and in the end it will feel like I’m grilling her. And if I ask if anything’s wrong she gives me one of three answers: “Why do you ask?” (With a genuinely oblivious tone, making me question myself and back out of the situation I created,) “No, everything is fine,” or “Yes but it has nothing to do with you.” After a couple of weeks like this she always goes right back to being super affectionate and warm. And then she’ll become distant again. It’s a cycle. She’s told me before that she would tell me if she ever lost interest in me, but sometimes it’s hard to believe she is. I always have a gut feeling that I’m the only one she acts this distant from during these periods (I’m saying I have a strong gut feeling she talks to her friends and acts normal around everyone else when she acts like this.) She has said she could see herself going long term with me. I don’t know what to make of this situation. At points this gets so stressful that I write out all the evidence for her loving me and for her lying about being in love with me. And it’s honestly way too difficult to figuring out because of how big the contrast is between her warm and unfamiliar side is, as well as because of things she says when she’s feeling affectionate. For some context which is probably important about her, she has ptsd from being abused by a previous romantic partner and her dad has bipolar depression (I think she might have it as well.) Does anyone have any psychology that could help me out or similar experiences?

28,oa54ce,1624960505,A very unusual dating apps review.,"Hey, I’m the opposite of many people who do these reviews.

30M, black, bisexual—and not the masculine type—and pretty chubby at 5’10, 215 lbs.  I exercise and always come up fine in health checks, but I have no intention of changing my size.  I also have long dreads, which I get a lot of compliments on and a few insults.  I’m told I have a very nice face, though.  (Apple cider vinegar, charcoal scrub, and lotion.)  

I’m a (moderate) socialist who goes to protests, and not only am I lower-income, I don’t even value money much.  I have no career ambitions.  I’m a writer for a big-name digital arts website, which doesn’t pay very well—I only crack $30k a year if I hustle and pick up extra projects—but it’s my literal dream job that I’ve wished for my whole adult life, and I have no desire to do anything else.  And in fact, I’m working on minimizing my life, moving out of my apartment and in with a roommate, to maximize the amount of time I can spend learning art.  I prefer living communally and occupying less space, owning a few r/buyitforlife things instead of a house full of stuff.  

In short, I’m a very polarizing person on OLD. 

My type is also the opposite of most members of this sub.  I absolutely love alt (goth, punk, weeb, et al.) BBW and fem gay guys, and have a thing for androgynous folks, trans people, and others who bend or blend genders. 

I live in Philly, which is a very good city to find those types in.  

I’ve been on online dating, mostly OKC, on and off for ten years, learned how the systems work, and have figured out how to “appeal to my base” so I don’t waste my time and everyone else’s.  I’ve gotten attracting blue-haired girls who read bell hooks down to a science.  First of all, I have a photography background, so I can take pro-looking selfies with a DSLR.  I focus on wording my profile well and couch the weird shit about myself in jokes.  I’m very selective about who I swipe right on.  I do pretty well, in that I get a lot of makeouts and hookups, and I’ve made several long-term friends, but it’s been years since I had a serious relationship off it.  

My last stint was on OKC, Tinder, and Bumble from 2018 to 2020, when I deleted everything because I hate long-distance relationships and didn’t want to put up with one through quarantine.  I just rejoined three days ago, trying out five sites to see how they went.  Here are the results:

**Tinder** is fairly useless: not just because of the whole “looks are all that matter” thing, but because the meat-market approach attracts a boring crowd.  It’s much better for gay dating than straight, although that brings a ton of chaff.  Most of the likes who I identified from their blurred thumbnails were dudes who were the opposite of my type: While I’m flattered that so many buff, bearded chasers are into me, it’s unfortunately not mutual.  Out of 40 likes in the first three days, I’ve only matched with 5: One guy who I’m about to arrange a date with, a few I’m just sitting on because I’m not very excited about them (hey, they’re not messaging me either), and one woman, a cosplay model whose profile says she’s “real,” but might just be promoting her OnlyFans.

**Hinge:** I tried this one in 2018 and deleted it within less than an hour, but the constant praise from Reddit motivated me to at least try it for review purposes.  Turns out I still don’t like it.  Instantly I hated the format: I’ve spent a long time working on a summary that encapsulates what I’m about, and having it replaced with quirky questions that make it much harder to communicate what I want to throws my first impression out the window.

This app clearly knows its audience, which coincidentally, is the exact opposite of mine. The girls on this site are aggressively ordinary, although they’re very conventionally attractive and objectively high-caliber.  Great jobs, good degrees, all that.  So I see why so many people like it.  

One enlightened Redditor in another thread complained about the number of “morbidly obese” women in his area.  Either he lives in Alabama or his idea of obese is 140 lbs., because all I’m seeing on this app are yuppies with Instagram hourglasses.  

Constant swipes left, and I’ve spent a lot of time watching that loading icon spin.  I haven’t even bothered looking at guys on this one because I know it’ll be a desert.  I got one match on the first night, though, from a cool-looking girl who asked to read my work.  Waiting to see what she thinks of it.

**Facebook Dating:**  I signed up for this one first out of pure curiosity, and what I found was…  OK.  First match was from a guy in Maryland who was cute despite having unflattering pics, and nice, but practically opened by saying he was looking for his true love.  Slow down there, my dude, we don’t even know each other’s full names.  

I like that it’s legitimately free, with no premium option, since Zuck already owns 2% of millennial wealth.  It’s refreshing to just like whoever you want and see who’s liked you back.  The main downside is that it says “fuck your distance limits” and mostly shows you people in other states.  Some of my matches were hot, but not six-hour-drive hot.  First three days brought ten of them, out of I’d guess about 40 likes.  The main problem was the same as Tinder: most were from homely guys with sparse profiles who weren’t my type.

**Bumble.**  Looks good at first, but slower than a Nissan Versa going uphill.  There turned out to be a lot of options in my type, although it took hours of swiping before they started popping up.  I suspect the app shows you the women who are rated the most attractive first, then once you run out of them, starts throwing up the supposed uggos.  Not a single like in the first three days, but that’s par for the course.  When I had it pre-pandemic, it was like that at first too, then suddenly after 2-3 weeks, I started getting likes and dates.  

...Wait, am I one of the uggos?  Oh God oh fuck

**OKCupid:**  I’m not sure how this became the designated dating app for weird people, but somehow, that’s what it’s always been.

Contrary to most people, I actually liked when they switched to the swipe format.  Before, it was frustrating blindly guessing who to send messages to, knowing that I consciously don’t appeal to most people on OLD.  If you’re anything besides a rich white guy, knowing who wants to give you the time of day beforehand is invaluable.

Of course, the nearly deal-breaking drawback is how many microtransactions and paywalls they’ve added over the years.  I know there’s always more money to be squeezed out of our broke generation, but it’s like they’re trying to see how many stones they can pile onto their own site before it’s pressed to death.  Also, for some reason, no matter what distance I set my preferences too, this (and a couple other apps) are desperate to show me New Yorkers.  I love visiting the city, but not enough to schlep up there every week to see someone.  Maybe they’re trying to pad their results.

But this was the first one I joined, it’s always been my main one, and it’s still the only one that’s working.  Being able to write pretty well is one of my selling points, and OKC’s longform approach is the only one that lets me show it in my profile.

The first three days have brought 62 likes, ten matches, and five conversations.  There’s one in particular who I’m getting along amazingly with, the kind you only get once a year.  I know that often doesn’t translate to real life, but I’m cautiously optimistic.  Our first date’s this evening.  

**TL;DR:** If you're bi, unusual, fat, or into alt types, Tinder and Hinge are useless, Bumble is promising but glacial, Facebook dating might be a hidden gem, and somehow, OKC is still the best game in town.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oa54ce/a_very_unusual_dating_apps_review/

I met this girl on Instagram a while back, we both play basketball in college she lives a state away from me and it’s not to far like a 41 min drive so it’s not a far way to go, I dmed her said “check rock” she told me when she get back home from school we can play, so luckily in my case someone on her campus had COVID-19, so she winded up coming home earlier than expected, so we texting and we hit it off kinda fast, no sex or nothing like that, I told y’all she lived a state away so at the time I had workouts in the morning in her state, I would go to workouts than come over her house after they were over. We would just chill vibe and watch a movie kiss no sex(which I’m fine with), unfortunately Like I said we both play ball so she found out that I was dealing with another girl at the time(this girl wasn’t my gf) she found out from a dude that didn’t like me so he made it seem like I had a gf, which he knew she wouldn’t like which lead to her cutting me off and blocking, me on everything, so my birthday comes around in June she texts me happy birthday and stuff, she unblocked me, she said she forgave me and was willing to move past it, so we hit back off we didn’t chill as much because we was getting the flow back, I asked her to come watch play pickup at the gym thar she lived near and she sent me a lengthy text message cursing me out, but I got her on the phone we soothed things over and she winded up coming and we had a talk in the parking lot and I told her I was sorry for everything for not being honest, she said it’s okay I forgive you, so fast forward days later she texted me that she want me to spend the night over her house but than, she winded up canceling on me, which made me mad because me y’all I like to see the girl I’m dealing with but she kept blowing me off, like she wouldn’t text me back and she winded up telling me that she didn’t want a relationship right now, she just wanted a vibe and someone’s that she can talk to at night, so one night it was spontaneous cause I was in the area with a friend I asked her could I come see her she said she wasn’t home which to me was a red flag cause she doesn’t have any friends and it was 11 at night, so one night I get a Instagram FaceTime call from her page while she is sleep I answered it and then she wasn’t saying nothing than I get a dm saying “do we talk” come to find out her ex hacked her page and was asking me questions like “did we at see each other monday”, so I called her on FaceTime she picks up saying that he is crazy leave him alone, don’t Pay him no mind.so I said okay gave her a pass, came over house the next day drive to get her something to eat, we go in the house chill, watch movies and lay in the bed together,had a great time I even gave her some money for gas in her car plus food, so after that happens she goes ghost on me y’all, i told her I was going to be around at the same basketball gym we first met at, she sees my text doesn’t reply to none of them, watches my Instagram story the same night I asked her to come to the gym doesn’t reply that was last Friday and I haven’t heard from her since ? I felt like i tried my hardest to show her that I was different but she isn’t budding, also she told me the night her ig got hacked that she did see her ex 4 months ago, I feel like I tried my hardest to show her that I wanted to be with her by double texting her and things like that but I just feel played, like I know the first go round I messed up even though someone lied on me but what should I do? Should I text her? Should I dm her on ig? Should like I wait for her to comeback to me ?

When we work the same shift together he always takes his break when I do, and we have some great conversations! We have similar interests as well. 

When we talk he likes to stand really close to me. He talks about how he goes to the gym and often flexes his muscles around me lol. One time he even held my hand to look at my rings. He gives me lots of compliments and one time we were in the break room and I took off my mask and he said it was nice to see my face (he hadnt seen it bc we are still required to wear masks).

I'm pretty good at reading people and I think I make him nervous which is really cute lol

He also unexpectedly asked whether I like guys or girls, I said both. My friends tell me he wouldnt ask that if he wasnt interested. 

The thing that really confused me was the fact that I asked for his instagram and he gave it to me and I followed him. This was about a week ago and he never followed me back? Its possible he just doesnt use instagram that much but if he was interested, wouldnt he follow me back, especially because he knew I followed him? Its so hard to get to know him because our schedules dont often overlap and he hasnt asked for my number either, thats why I asked for his instagram to kind of initiate that. He hasnt posted anything to his instagram recently either so idk

Is he interested? If he is, do you think it would help to flirt more obviously? That way he knows that I'm also interested?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oa60gd/is_he_interested/

One night, I said something which upset her, I felt that she was pushing for 'more' between us based on how things were going and things she was telling me, so I asked where things are going, and suddenly the conversation took a nosedive and she thought that I'm taking things too seriously. I asked her if she is seeing anyone else and she said that she is. It was a really contradictory conversation, but it is what it is.

Anyway, the thing that upset her was me making a comment about her having a 'side-boy' and that I am the 'main man' and that she wants to take it easy for now but feels I'm a little too serious. This was 2 weeks back.

Things went cold after this, we spoke 4/5 days ago, and she admitted to me why she was annoyed and that she feels that I am expecting more than she can give. I told her that if she wants to call it quits, that's ok, but all she said is ""I need to think about it, I like you, but I'm struggling to get past this"". Alright, let me know, I said, and I let it go. I haven't initiated contact since and vice versa on her end.

36,oa6h7w,1624966582,Was my Breakup valid?,"A few weeks ago I (23F) broke up with my bf (29) of four years.

I have big goals and dreams career-wise. I wanted a relationship where I didn't want to possibly give up schooling or my job. So when I met my ex, he explained that he didn't have any goals and dreams. I thought it was perfect, but I soon learned that dating someone with no goals was sorta sucky.
He didn't understand my passion.

He's also fairly immature for his age, as am I. We both still live with our parents. I have been actively trying to save money to move out (though I had several setbacks due to medical bills and vet bills and as I stated I am still immature and pay for things I don't need). He gets paid more than me yet somehow always has around 250 in his bank account whereas I have 10x that. I have no idea where the money goes.
I became concerned that I couldn't mature fast enough to compensate for him.
In the four years he and I dated I have gotten my driver's license, paid off my car, got several jobs, got a volunteer position (that I currently can't do due to Covid) and he has been working the same job for almost three years.

I just don't see growth in him. He makes me so happy when I see him in the present, but when I think about the future I can't see anything.

Before I broke up with him, I asked him what is his goal in life. He said it was to marry me.

I noticed later in the relationship I'd yearn for other men. Men who were accomplished, and had dreams. Especially ones whose goals reflected my own.
I felt so unfaithful.

Is my breakup just an excuse for me wanting to see other men? Is it valid? Or am I being selfish and not understanding him?

Because he is a wonderful boyfriend. He's patient, and listens to me, and he cooks for me. He plays games with me. He gets all my jokes. He's perfect except in the maturity department.

I had to spend a long time working on things with my husband but now we are here. My husband never liked the idea of sharing me but he was ok with it and allowed me to find a fwb situation. Fast forward and I meet the fwb but soon enough I realize I have mad feelings for him. He is basically the other half of me while my husband is my soul mate. Made an agreement with fwb that we would be exclusive because I didn't want drama and didn't want extra people involved. Just keep it simple and he agreed to that. Except then he slept with his ex on a trip to NYC. Didn't tell me but I found out somehow. I asked for additional std testing because that's part of my husband and my agreement with additional playmates. Fast forward and I tell him I have feelings. He responds and says he has feelings for me too. Then two days later goes home and tells me his ex needs some good dick and he wants to help. Ok well I am not dating him so what am I gonna do? I say whatever and get a test when you get back if you would.  End up telling him how that hurt me and he seemed to understand. Couple months later he tells me he loves me on a park bench. That weekend I was so excited to hang out with him. I wanted him bad. He ended up getting drunk with his coworkers and crashed at their house and got his dick sucked by a coworker he had previously slept with before meeting me.  
So here we are months from that. We both clearly like each other. He is depressed, has untreated issues, is going to therapy and obviously has alot going on. I have tried to be a friend as best as I can even though it has cost me. We have absolutely amazing sex or at least he knows how to work me in bed to perfection. I never have had so many orgasms as I do with him and I know he's told me he cares for me and enjoys being with me. But I've asked what we are or if we could date. If not then can we at least agree to having some boundaries? He never responds. He never wants to figure it out or talk through it. I am slowly breaking up with him in my mind because I don't know how long this relationship with him will last. My husband and I have ok sex but we have an amazing relationship. So each of these people in my life makes me feel like a whole person. Do I end it? Do I swallow my pride and accept whatever good comes? Do I move on slowly? He hurts me but also makes me feel amazing and we get along.

Full disclosure on this is that I was diagnosed with Aspergers when I was five and I've gotten so good at 'masking' that it's literally second nature to me. I can spot ASD traits in others a mile away sometimes; the ticks, the obsessions, verbal nuances stuff like that. It took me a while but after two weeks it just hit me she was giving these signs off as well only I didn't pick up on it.

She's funny, smart, matches most of my interests, and has had very similar life experiences to me.

Do the same rules still apply here? This is the first time I've ever encountered 'one of my kind' in the wild but am I reading too much into it?

But i noticed that i was did like, 75% of the talking, and i suck at that, i mean it. The girl is beatiful, but very shy and timid.

I REALLY dont know. I am very comfortable and i liked her presence, but at the same time, not having enough subjects to talk to and being bad with conversations with an already timid girl is like... double trouble. 

I dont want her to change, unless she does want to, i just want to be next to her, and be nice to her, but i dont know how to do it and IF i am doing enough...

Could you guys and girls give me any help?
Feel free to ask anything.

PS. It was our first date.

52,oa89id,1624973227,Weird feeling after amazing first date HELP!,"I went on a first date with this guy I met off Hinge. We'd chatted on the phone several times before meeting and had been speaking online for a while. The date was incredible and we clicked instantly, in a very deeply emotional way. I'm not huuuugely physically attracted to him, though I did enjoy kissing him. But for some reason, I keep getting a spike of anxiety in my stomach every time I think about the date, or look at pictures of him. I cannot for the life of me put my finger on what the feeling is, but it feels like some sort of... mix between attraction and unattraction?? I have NEVER felt this before and it's driving me crazy that I can't work out the feeling, especially because the date was so ridiculously good (honestly like romcom level good.) At the time I was enjoying the physical contact and all the ways we spent time together, but now I have no idea why- its like the memory of it is kind of stirring something anxiety inducing or uncomfortable in me. Any ideas? I really like him!

As a bit of background- I've never dated properly before. I had one shitty (and I mean GOD-AWFUL) relationship when I was 16 (I'm 18 now) and some slightly dodgy sexual experiences. I have a lot of barriers up.

Any advice??",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oa89id/weird_feeling_after_amazing_first_date_help/

We met on a dating app. Originally she didn’t notice by distance but when she did we kept talking. Tonight after some good texting, I texted her asking if she thought we might ever meet one day and asked how she felt about distance and her reply was “I took the last year + off from dating completely, I’m in no rush. I’m not out there desperately trying to meet anyone. I love my life I’m happy working on me, being a better version of myself everyday. I’d say the distance thing is an obstacle, I’d prefer to get to know you as a friend because of it and meet you someday and see if there also chemistry there.” 

I responded back with “Well there is definitely no rush, I didn’t mean that if it came across that way. I do want to find someone, but you cannot force such a thing. I just meant that one day if we continued to get to know each other for a while in this way, you would consider the possibility of meeting for a date one day. Just to exactly as you say, meet and see if there is chemistry there. Definitely not saying let’s set one up now and rush it. Distance is definitely an obstacle

I like the interaction we have going on now though, and would like to continue it.”

She responded back with “Yeah I’m happy with that. I enjoy getting to know you.” And it was late so I ended with convo and we said both said good night. 

So she knows I have a dating interest in her. So I don’t feel bad befriending her with those desires. We text daily for about a week, we are both talking in detail about what we do each day and getting to know each other. I think she’s really cool in many ways, and I don’t want to give up on this.

54,oa8f1i,1624973748,Am I seeking attention from the wrong people?,"Dating over the last few years has been difficult, I’ve seen several women although never gotten beyond the ‘talking’ phase. My latest ‘relationship’ lasted 8 months, with all the typical signs of a relationship - time together, trips away, involvement and introductions to family and friends etc. Each relationship has had its own collection of moments that have been significant. 

Regardless of how these relationships feel or develop, each person I’ve seen has actively avoided acknowledging the depth of our interaction or attaching labels, and they typically end the same way - “you’re the best person I’ve ever met, and I still want you in my life, but we can’t be together,” or “I don’t know why I don’t feel the way you do because I want to, you’ve been amazing to me and I care about you deeply, but we can’t be together” etc. 

I’m respectful, only seek to empower the person I’m seeing and make an immense effort to be thoughtful and make the most of our time together. I’m good looking, held in high regard amongst my peers and do well for myself. The majority of people that I’ve seen have had prior poor relationship experiences and have revealed these to me in length in deep conversations we’ve shared, and have since moved onto committed relationships directly after seeing me. I am genuinely happy for them and wish them all the care in the world, but the repeated occurrence means I can’t help feel like a stepping stone at times.

Recently met a girl via OLD and got talking as I noticed we had similar interests. As the conversation grew we discovered we had so much in common and shared a lot of the same hobbies. Our conversations are great and we have discussed meeting at some point in the near future!
Sounds great right?
My only problem is that I’ve noticed something which says she’s bisexual. I believe her ex was female and I have only ever had one straight long term relationship due to our ages. This was not shown on her OLD profiles and she hasn’t mentioned anything of the sort in our messages. I would highly support her and accept her sexuality. I honestly think she’s ace! 
My issue is that I cannot read her intentions. She seems eager and wants to meet but mentioned about her sibling being present if we do. I can’t tell if she wants to be friends due to our hobbies or whether she wants a relationship together due to the occasional flirty comment she makes.

I may very well be overthinking as I’m aware I do that in the early stages of dating due to possible anxiety.

61,oa9dx5,1624976898,Venting - Feeling down seeing others in happy relationships,"I am 22m, currently single. I look at various stories about relationships both on and off reddit and can't help but feel a little envious of the happy couples. I know I am not alone in this and most all single people feel this way, but I knew I had to get this off my chest, so here is my soliloquy/rant.

I consider myself to be a very nice and compassionate person. I treat others (including women) with respect. I am healthy, and smart, and funny. I am also sensitive to other's feelings and care about the people who are close to me. All this makes me think I would make for a good partner.

And then I see and hear stories about people who are in difficult relationships. There are posts on reddit about one person really giving their all for their loved one. People asking for tips to help their partner with a mental illness, or support them through a difficult time in life. People willing to go to any length for the happiness of their partner. And all this makes me a little sad for myself. Don't get me wrong, it warms my heart to read these stories of these beautiful people - both men and women - who are willing to fight for their love. It just makes me long for something like that.

I look at posts by so many girls who are with their partner even when the relationship is difficult because of the guy's past trauma or mental illness yet they stick with them. Sometimes it's people struggling with addiction and their wife or girlfriend helping them through it. Or a couple toughing it out through a financial crunch. And I think how much easier it would be for my partner because I am not facing any such problems. Again, I do not mean to belittle others' struggles at all. I know no one wants to be in a bad place, and I have so much respect for couples working through a tough time. Neither does any of these make a person or relationship less worthy. I just mean that I am fortunate to not have any mental illness or addiction or financial troubles. And therefore being with me should not be difficult for my partner. Of course I know that I am not perfect. Far from it. But I am (hopefully) mature enough to handle my own shortcomings.

It's not like I have only faced constant rejection from women. I just didn't have enough confidence in myself to ever consider dating as something that was possible for me. I really grew into my own in the last few months, perhaps a year. I was not very social before that, and then the lockdown happened, so there was no chance of going out and meeting people. However, in these few months, I have worked on my style, my fitness and completely revamped my looks. Whereas I earlier used to avoid being in photos because I was embarrassed by how I looked, I now find myself to be highly attractive. I also started therapy to tackle other psychological problems like my self-esteem.

The issue now is that I don't know how to go about finding a connection. I tried OLD, but that is a proper game. It is a tournament where everything is about glamour and how shiny your profile is. You can do nothing if no one swipes on you. And I don't even blame women for that given the economics of the trade (it's similar to how recruiters only glance at every resume for a few seconds before deciding on it). Sadly, I am not very good at taking pictures, especially of myself (see above).

Still, I know that I can crack OLD given some time and enough dedication on my part (have cracked really tough challenges before). It's just not how I want to do it. I hope it does not make me vain to say that I know I will keep my girlfriend really happy. Others have said this to me before (including women I know). I just don't know how to use this to find someone I would like to be with. I am not even looking for hookups or something casual. I hear how most women want serious relationships with a caring person, and that makes me feels I should not have to play the OLD game. But I just don't know how to make it happen for myself right now in any other way.

All of this makes me sad sometimes.

Anyway, thanks for reading. I would appreciate kind comments. Or just read this and move on.

82,oabwaw,1624984459,I have been dating this guy for 3 months and he'll go away to travel for 6 months : should we continue dating ?,"Hey everyone,

I (23yo female) have been dating this guy for 3 months now. Things have been going great ever since, we really have a good time together, share lots of intimacy, have a blast.

Here is the issue : in one month, he will go away for 6 months to travel. This has been his dream way before he met me.

I don't have any issue with him going away, but I don't manage to just ""live the moment"" and enjoy the present anymore, I always have his departure in my mind. Is it weird or a sign of emotional immaturity to want to ""plan"" the future ? To want some stability/certitudes ? Or is it a sign of emotional dependency or insecurity ?

I mean, he always tells me ""let's enjoy our time together and we'll see how things will evolve"" but I just feel like I will get more and more attached, even if our relationship has a deadline, and it feels like I'm investing time and energy in something that will not last. He's not sure what he wants and tells me he's not ready for something serious now because of his travel.

He's clear about the fact that he does not want something serious right now, because he'll be traveling. Is it worth it to enjoy our time together until the last day before he goes away ?

Do you think I'm auto-sabotaging my relationship by being too serious or that, in a sense, it is be normal to not want to invest yourself in a relationship that is doomed ? I can't make any project with someone who goes away and he's clear about the fact he won't ask me to ""wait for him"" until he comes back.

Thanks",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oabwaw/i_have_been_dating_this_guy_for_3_months_and_hell/
83,oabyya,1624984681,Confused.,"I(21f) am dating my batchmate from college( 21m) since 5 and a half months. We were friends for over a year before that. We both feel a lot for each other and are pretty serious about the relationship but because of lockdown in my country both of us had to leave our hostel and go back to our homes. We live in different cities , more than a 1000 kms apart , and well obviously it has caused various problems, we miss each other a lot and because of being locked down our mental health is also taking a toll , as a result we get irritated and fight over stupid things , it's mostly him getting mad at something stupid I said or did. The problem is he gets very rude when he's angry and I feel like I deserve it because I was the one who made him angry. Sometimes I feel like even if I'm talking about something that should bother me , he makes me feel like shit for making an issue out of it (stuff like other girls being a little too friendly , he made me stop talking to one of my seniors from high school whom I was only friends with through instagram) He feels like we shouldn't be friends with people online whom we haven't talked to or met irl. But he's also very active on social media and veryy sweet with everyone. I really don't get it 🙆 He's very loving and caring and we're both really attracted to each other but when he behaves like this I start to doubt if it's gonna work out. He claims he gets angry over stupid things because he cares about me so much that even little things affect a lot. Sometimes he compliments other girls while talking to me , it makes me insecure. There are various little things like that .. I wanna know if I'm just overthinking all of this maybe because I've nothing better to do stuck at home ? Is it going to be better when we go back to college and meet? the relationship was very good when we met everyday.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oabyya/confused/

87,oac6m6,1624985326,"Handling rejection with an ambivalent, light-hearted attitude helps you de-stigmatize and move on so it doesn’t affect you","When I was newly single last year, I made a lot of mistakes early on. I took a woman on a second date to an expensive restaurant, which is something you typically shouldn’t do when you just met someone.

In my mind, the date was going well. We had a great conversation, and both mentioned what a good time we were having. At the end of the night, I walked her to her car, and after taking for a bit, went in for the kiss. She turned her head at the last moment as my lips collided with her cheek and said, “Oh, that’s awkward.”

I simply smiled and said, “I had a good time, hope you have a good night.” We texted a little after, but I never asked her out for a third date.

Although I made a lot of mistakes early on, one of my strengths was that I always handled rejection like a champ. I looked at going on dates as practice—all I wanted to do was have fun and meet amazing women. The next day, I even texted my friends like it was a funny battle story, instead of a slight. I realized it was for the best and moved on.

Men are horrible at rejection. We lose our shit, and take it as a referendum on our manhood, or our value as a person. It isn’t. Every single adult has experienced rejection. Meeting other people is a number’s game—some will think you’re amazing, others will think you’re corny and will want nothing to do with you. It’s part of being polarizing, which is necessary for success.

The ability to handle rejection like a man is powerful. If you become unglued when you are rejected, that person has power over you. If you treat it like it’s minor blip in your life instead of a catastrophic event, you are in control.

Next time you encounter rejection, even if it is rude or stinging, handle it in a centered, ambivalent, polite manner. Visualize yourself joking about the rejection to your friends, as you forget that person and move on like it was nothing.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oac6m6/handling_rejection_with_an_ambivalent/
88,oac8gr,1624985478,I'm 22M looking for some advice on approaching people over text.,"For context I was good at intriguing people over text, above average when it came to flirting. But over the years I feel like I'm losing my skill set required to talk to a woman in the first impression. The last relationship I had was 2 years ago and we broke up a year back midst covid and since then I haven't approached anyone nor I feel like I can anyone since all I could talk about is plain boring ""How are you? What you doing? You like this/that?"" and tbvh this isn't gonna cut it. I'm kinda introvert so approaching people in public isn't my forte. I like to approach people over text and then go with the flow and hoping an eventual date (all my previous dates/relationship started out like this). So I'm looking for some advice on up'ing my texting/flirting game since I have lost my touch to it over the last 2 years of not flirting with anyone.

89,oacffy,1624986044,AITA for telling my friend not to message this guy?,"I found this really cool guy and I'm very selective with guys. I told my best friend about it how he seemed like a gem and the most interesting guy on the app. She asked me to send his social media which I didn't have and I was jokingly like hahahaha. Then she found his Linkedin and messaged him on there without me knowing. She was trying to shoot her shot with him and I was surprised she did that, since I told her about him because I liked him. She told me I told her to shoot her shot and I sent him to her, which I didn't do. So she lied to him saying I sent him his profile. Then he told me in a joking way it's creepy if I guy did what she did. I told her not to message because some people might think it's creepy. And that I told him I told her not to message. She threw me under the bus, first by messaging him when I told her about it . Am I in the wrong for it? we're also both single and he is too, so it's not like he's mine, but her lying about me and then going after this guy I'm into is like making me feel terrible and that she doesn't give a fuck about my feelings.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oacffy/aita_for_telling_my_friend_not_to_message_this_guy/

94,oadedf,1624988927,girl asked me out (31M),"So we follow each other on Twitter, have a minimal back and forth over the years... mostly about baseball and what shows we're watching. Honestly, never really thought much about her, other than she's a cool follow. Over the weekend I got a DM from her about us going to a baseball game together in my city I live in (she lives somewhere else in the state I'm in). 

That really threw me off my axis, the introvert in me was like, NOPE. I don't know much about her, but I basically said no. Then my depression started to kick in because I'm single and would love to meet someone and have something real with a girl but it's tough meeting people with a mutual interest.

But then here comes this girl who seems cool and throws this grenade of a opportunity at me that I was not expecting.

He told me his last relationship scarred him for life so I tried to be patient. I went out of my way to make him feel loved. Ignored all the red flags... but I couldn't hold out for long. Not with the constant empty replies he gave whenever he was asked about the real score between the two of us. 

It all hit me like a flash flood. One day, I decided to finally end things which he immediately agreed on without any restraints. 

A week passed, after such a heartless response to our supposed break up, he texted me asking if we could try but as ""friends who have fun only"".

I have nothing but regrets — regret of wasting so much time and effort with someone who only saw me at his convenience and ultimately, regret of not loving myself enough to allow such an undeserving man to make me feel so unwanted. 

In the end though, I'm regretful yet still thankful because that experience taught me how to value myself with utmost sincerity.

- social media ruined rates of scuessful relationships

- divorced parents (even if you think you found your soulmate, its not always true)

I continued to see this girl at her job every morning when I went in to get my cup of coffee. For a couple days I went to a place across the street but this coffee was terrible so I had to go back to her job. It was kind of awkward at first I guess with the two of us trying to ignore each other.

Finally yesterday morning I went in to get my coffee and she actually said hi to me and I said hi back. Later in the day I got a text from her and she asked what time I was working until and could she call me once I was off work.

She called me last night and we talked for a while. She apologized for ghosting me and said that she has real trust issues and she gets anxiety a lot when it comes to dating guys. She also said she does like me and thinks I’m cool but she doesn’t think she wants to date anyone right now. On top of trying to work out her trust issues she’s really busy. She’s basically raising her daughter by herself and working two different jobs too. Plus going to school.

I told her that was ok and I wish she could have just told me this in the first place. She said it was hard because she wasn’t sure how I’d react. I said I understand where she’s coming from. I told her I think she’s a pretty great girl and at least we had two good dates and had some fun. She said maybe we’ll hang out again soon and I said that would be good. Then she said that I did give her two of the best kisses she’s had in forever on our dates. Maybe she was just saying that but it made me feel good.
