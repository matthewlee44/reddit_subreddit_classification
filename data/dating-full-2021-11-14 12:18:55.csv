I started speaking to her and realized she isn't exactly the sucker for rules type but has a fun personality that's sort of buried deep underneath those 8-6 work hours. She likes sharing her secrets with me and always don't tell any one about it and I constantly guide her career prospect wise or how to deal with people at work regarding difference of opinions wise.( I am currently studying business management graduate) so I started sneaking her in Irish coffee, some food which I cook and it started off a comfort level bonding yet professional courtesy kind. She is single and I am single and I asked her out couple of times. She likes the attention and she likes the vibe around me, she kind of smiles and says we are coworkers we can't date. It will complicate things or so has been her standard reply, but she always likes the attention I give her especially after work chat. She finally agreed to go out as I changed my tone of we aren't exactly dating we as ""coworkers"" going out on lunch but it's just you and me. I told her exactly these words "" you know that I am fun to talk and I know I am fun"" so let's just have a nice chat at a good place where we sit and talk and let's see if it's really going to get complicated.

Symptoms of burned out because working out everything r everyday .
She basically has no work life balance, she was on the verge of changing job until I asked her to stick a bit more so her hardwork could be noticed and it happened, she got called for a new store opening and she got a pay raise as well. 
She has no social life or very limited social life,I could understand as her weekend activity was babysitting an ex employee's cat or having a bottle of wine and sleep for the weekend. 

I want to talk with her she is not a bad person or flaky but just work above everything else.

We went to dinner, a coffee shop and then to an outdoor market on our college campus and then went back to her place for a movie. 

Everything seemed to go very well, and she seemed to have a good time. When we got back to her place her housemate and our friends were there and they were finishing up a movie before leaving so we could be alone. Anyway, the movie started and we started to cuddle. Her head was on my chest and I put my hand over hers before she interlocked them and then asked me ‚Äòis this comfortable for you?‚Äô I told her yes and we stayed like that the whole movie. Once it got over she had some cake that we ate and then started another TV show and got back into a similar position on the couch. Her head was below me and she looked up and I went for the kiss. We kissed probably 8-10 more times after that during the show and then once it was over I told her I had to go because it was getting late and it didn‚Äôt seem like she wanted me to leave. Ultimately I had to because I‚Äôve gotta work early this morning, so I got up and brushed her hair back for another kiss. Then I got up, but my shoes on and she came back over and I gave her a hug and said I had a nice time tonight and then we kissed again and I left. 

Anyway, in the past before our date and we were generally friends, she‚Äôd almost always text me right after we hung out saying she had a fun time, but last night was different. She didn‚Äôt text, so I gave it an hour or two and then texted her and thanked her for the fun night and wished her a good day tomorrow. She replied and said ‚ÄòI had a great time :) thanks again for everything‚Äô ‚ÄòI hope you have a good day tomorrow too!!‚Äô 

Nothing about a second date, so I replied and said ‚ÄòThanks! Would you be available Friday evening to catch dinner again?‚Äô And she said ‚Äòthat sounds so fun! I‚Äôm down :)‚Äô I told her I‚Äôd txt her with time and place and said good night, she ‚Äòloved‚Äô the message and said ‚Äògood night!‚Äô

Maybe I‚Äôm over thinking it, but once I left, her housemate and friends came back, but they waited for my (and their) close friend (a girl) to leave before they talked about the night. This is what has me confused because if it was good, wouldn‚Äôt they want my friend to know it?

Would age gaps matter anymore? I think a big part of why some people are turned off by age gaps is they imagine the older partners doing it, and since most people become less attractive past a certain age, the mental image can carry some ick factor for some people. But since everyone is stuck at 25 give or take, that would no longer be a factor.

I can imagine the oldest people having accrued a lot of resources. After who knows how many years, they could be the ultimate sugar daddies/mommas.

Physical fitness would probably reach a new high. Without age to slow and even negate physical gains, people would have an eternity to turn themselves into carved Greek statues. They‚Äôd also have forever to study. We‚Äôd see people with dozens or hundreds of PHD‚Äôs eventually.

After two straight days of barely texting, she blocked me with no explanation. I'm trying to look at it from a distance and understand whether I messed it up or not. 

Our first date 

We met on a dating app, texted for a few days and I invited her on a date. It happened to be raining on the day of our date. I few hours before the arranged time and durign the heavy rain, I texted her saying that I'm glad I went to get groceries before it started pouring outside. We exchanged a few messages with smalltalk and that was it. 

She didn't show up for our date. It turned out she though that I cancelled it when I texted her about it raining, so she decided to stay at home. I didn't even imply that the date was off and the rain had already stopped like 2 hours before the date. Nevertheless, she apologised and offered to come in 30 mins, if I'm okay with that. I believed that it was an honest misunderstanding (still do) so I waited for her. We had a good first date, spend 2-3 hours together and the conversation flew naturally. 

Dating 

She was never late afterwards. We had a good second date and kissed on the third. She spent the night at my place after the fourth date, but we didn't have sex as she told me she's not comfortable yet. I respected that and told her that there's no pressure whatsoever. I explicitly saidnthat It's very important that we both want it and feel that it's the right time. On our next date she told me that she felt that I was not happy with her decision to not have sex, which left me baffled.

I don't text people very often especially during workdays. Even though I'd always reach out during the days when we didn't meet, she complained that I seem too cold over text and she can't tell if I'm serious about her. I seem to be distant over text and very warm in person. That surprised me, even though I acknowledge that texting is not something that I enjoy too much and probably am not very good at. I often don't use emojis and usually text with a certain end goal in mind, instead of having a random chat. There was never a day in which I didn't talk to her though. I ensured her that this was not the case and am looking for a long term relationship. 

We spend a few very nice weeks together. We'd go on places we both enjoy, eat nice food, go hiking, etc. I always took her to the football games I play with my friends. She invited me on her bday party where I also met her friends. We had a great sexual chemistry too. Once she wasn't feeling very well and I brought her food at 10PM. She would cook cheesecake and bring it over. It was great overall.

We had one little fallout. We were playful and teasing each other quite often, so one time when she was in bed I told her ""Get off the bed you lazyl!"". She took that very badly and suddenly went on to leave. I immediately apologized that it came out the wrong way as I said it jokingly and didn't intend to hurt her. She accepted it and stayed that night, but it was a strange situation nevertheless. Even though I was at fault, I found her reaction to be impulsive and immature as she wanted to leave instead of stay and try to communicate (and maybe then decide to leave if that's what she wants). 

The last time we saw each other and the aftermath 

We spend a nice weekend together. On Sunday morning, we had breakfast and then agreed to watch a movie. 30 minutes into it, she suddenly decided to leave by saying that she's meeting a friend. We talked about meeting on Tuesday as I was going out of town for a week on Wednesday. Her leaving all of a sudden felt a bit strange and cold. As if she was rushing to get away. She even forgot her bag which I reminded her of. 

I tried to rationalize it. We had spend the last 48 hours together so I thought maybe she needs a breather so I tried to give her space and didn't reach out that day until the evening. Then I texted her, we exchanged a few messages and that was it. 

The next day (Monday) I decided again not to bother her but she also didn't reach out. I texted her around 10PM and again, we exchanged a few messages. It felt a bit dry and distant, but I also didn't really try too hard at that time. 

The next day I saw she deleted a message and then blocked me. I'm trying to find the fault at myself. I didn't arrange a date during our last convo. Honestly, I felt that it was a good time for her to bring it up as I've always been the one initiating a planning so far. Nevertheless, whatever the reason is for her to cut contact, I think she should have communicated it. 

My feeling after all this is that she was not the right person for me and I feel more relieved that frustrated.

It feels like I‚Äôm missing something. Is there some sort of online dating etiquette I‚Äôm missing? Am I supposed to ask out the person immediately after matching? 

I tried out asking out someone I just matched with once, but they weren‚Äôt comfortable with that. I try chatting with someone for a longer time but I quickly lose interest because I sense no interest on their part.

The problem is I genuinely don't want to hurt anybody else in the process.

I'm in the strange position of not struggling at all to get attention and dates with women, but they're overwhelmingly interested in taking things serious very quickly.

While I'm only looking for something casual/with no expectations, I always aim to treat women I date respectfully and connect them as real people rather than sex objects. But I guess something about me must give off serious dad vibes as almost everyone I date is super interested in me but makes it very clear they want a relationship with me and even talk about going exclusive/kids/marriage etc. from day one or a very early stage. Which is very flattering, but just not for me at this point.

So, how should I attract more women for more casual connections without acting like an asshole and completely changing my personality? I know the obvious answer is to immediately tell people I'm only looking for sex, but that's not really true either. I would always be open to something developing naturally, but I just want something with no expectations where I won't risk hurting people. TIA

I was at the bar for a good two hours and then this woman sat down two seats away from me. She happened to be one of the cooks in the kitchen who came to the bar after her shift shifts he have a few drinks.. She was really friendly I could tell from the first smile she gave me when she sat down. I waited a few mins to start a conversation and when I did start the conversation I complimented her on her hat and conversation continue from there. 

We talked about life. She gave me her life story and after she was done talking she asked me about my life story and I told her. We talked for the next hour and forty-five mins at the bar. It was getting crowded over in our area and she asked if I wanted to move so we can continue our conversation. So we agreed to move to the other side of the bar.

 She mentioned to me that there was a shot she really liked and asked if I would do it with her and she had every intention on paying but instead I paid for them. We talked some more and she mentioned she would do another shot and asked if I would do it with her but she said she will pay this time. But I didn't do the shot because I had a few too many drinks already and I didn't take the shot. She jokingly mention ""why do you not want a woman to pay for your shot""? I told her that I had too much already. 

Then there was this older guy who was drunk came up to us and jumped in our conversation and made things kind of awkward. After him talking for about a good 10 mins. The woman stood up grabbed her coat like she was getting ready to leave and I ended up getting up as well and I turned to both of them said my goodbye and walked out of the bar before her. I left because I could feel myself getting drunk and I didn't want to make a fool our myself by saying something dumb or make her even more uncomfortable.

I got back from vacation and asked if she was still free to which she replied ""you're a great guy but I've been talking to someone else more someone I've been talking to before you and I think I'm going to give that a try but 100% if this dosnt work then I want to take a ahot on you"" I was really crushed but she mentioned she still had interest rather she ment it or not so I just went with it.

I haven't gotten a match since then so I figured I had nothing to lose still talking to her.

She replied ""YES I would love to"" I asked if she was free this week to which I was left on read. I figured she got busy and had to view her schedule since I asked while she was at work.

Felt like sharing this doozy from a few weeks ago. I hadn‚Äôt gone on a date in ages after taking a long time getting over my ex and just having pretty shit luck on dating apps in recent days. So my first yellow flag should‚Äôve been the fact that this was a girl I messaged first and then didn‚Äôt get a response for a couple days. She wasn‚Äôt very talkative but looked cute and wanted to go out that night, I figured what the heck she lives down the street and I need to go on a date and she‚Äôs cute. Let‚Äôs do it. 

So we grab some killer gourmet grilled cheeses, she looks even better than her pics, she‚Äôs touchy with me, conversation is ok, so far so good. Things got a little weird when we started making out, first thing I noticed was that she was an absolutely horrendous kisser. I mean it was like kissing a dead body. She talks about how religious she is and reads the Bible and how god talks to her (I am not religious). She makes it very clear she‚Äôs into blonde guys (I‚Äôm blonde) so I‚Äôm like cool she‚Äôs into me. We were cuddling and then she tells me I‚Äôm her little Nazi. (WTF)

By this point I‚Äôm like what the absolute fuck. I ask her what she means by that. She says well you know you‚Äôre blonde and have blue eyes, like the superior aryan race. The Nazis just liked good looking people. And then when I say I am not cool with being called her little nazi, she backtracks and says something about how I looked like trumps son? I didn‚Äôt even know what to say to that. 

So instead of nazi she starts calling me her little prince and by this point I‚Äôm still weirded out but dealing with it cause I don‚Äôt remember the last time I had a woman in my bed. We get half naked and she starts sucking on my fingers and says it‚Äôs what she‚Äôs into, very uncomfortable but hey I don‚Äôt judge most fetishes.

I've seen him online after that, but didn't asked about it because it could be because of many reasons and also because we are not even dating. So i don't have a right even to worry about it.

On this Saturday he sent me the good morning text again and i replied back (he's the one usually text the good morning text first as he wakes up earlier than i do). After that radio silence.

I have anxiety and OCD so my thought patterns just go crazy when I have feelings for someone. Anyway, there's this girl whom I met through a mutual friend, and every time he's had a party, I've ended up talking to her and as soon as we start talking, she always seems to have a smile on her face and undoubtedly goes along with my light teasing. We follow each other's socials and are FB friends. Then this one night, I got super drunk, we all ended up at the clubs, and I was talking to her and said ''hey, I want to talk to you about something'' and we went somewhere quiet. I can't recall exactly what I said but no doubt it was something stupid, then I tried to kiss her. She rejected me and I ended up kissing my ex in front of her \[thinking this would somehow make her jealous? stupid behaviour i know\]. I messaged her a couple of times during the night out just being like 'hey, where you at?', etc. All in all, I got drunk and acted like a fucking idiot.   


I saw her tonight with our mutual friend and I could tell she kind of felt weirded out/awkward of me being there. I know she's not an overly chirpy person, but I just don't know whether I should message her and say hey, or even apologize for how I acted a few months ago \[being drunk, probably saying stupid shit, trying to kiss her, etc.\] I don't know. I know my behaviour sounds super toxic and I wish I could take back my drunken behaviour. No doubt she thinks I'm a sleaze or creep or something from how I acted, but I'm just not sure whether I should even bother trying to mend things or talking to her. Especially considering every time we've seen each other while drinking we've had good banter and lightly teased each other.

There's a girl that I like and she owns a courier company. The first time I went there was because I wnated to take a package. She has a dog and I said her that I have one as well. She told me to bring my dog to play with hers. After a week another package came, she called me and told me ""nice calling tune, it's rare for the natives to hear that kind of music"". I went for one more after a few days and we started talking. She told me that she broke up 2 times due to her dog. She also told me that she does a radio broadcast because winter here is boring. I told her that I have many things to do so I don't care if it's boring. A friend of her told her something in the ear when I told them what I do. Then she invited me to go to the radio to talk (she doesn't do the broadcast alone). 

There is a church that I go for a walk my dog and I find her there sometimes. One of these times she was leaving and she told me tomorrow 15:30-16:00 to bring our dogs to play and told me again to go to her broadcast. She didn't come. That night I found a dog outside of my house, I couldn't find the owner cause it was night and I sent her message on messenger (I don't have her number). She replied the next day and added me. We exchanged a few messeges, nothing special.

The next week I went again to give her a package, I provoked her cause she told me to carry some packages for the store I work and I told her with playful attitude that we have equality now so it's her job. After that, I was playing with her dog, told her that we lost them (referring to me and my dog) and she told me that there are many cats and can't handle his dog (it's true cause she told me the very first time we talked and he is big), but this Sunday (today) we will go somewhere to play our dogs. She also invited me again to her broadcast. I told her i will go if she comes to tango classes that I go. She said yes but not very excited. Lastly, Friday I went again to give her a package from my work, I saw her, I gave it and immediately I turned my back and walked away. ""Good morning to you as well"" she told me and I just moved my head positively. I needed to go opposite of the road and I saw her looking at me. The same afternoon I saw her going her dog to the church but I was leaving. 

Today, she passed by with her car and her dog to go to the church earlier than usual. She didn't tell me to go with her to the place she wanted.

We‚Äôre both 22. For a month after that we went on a few dates and hung out on campus a few times. At this point I thought we were kinda on a path to some sort of relationship, we were hanging out, we were both initiating on texting a once or twice per week. On the second date she asked about my past relationships, I told her about mine, said she hadn‚Äôt been in one. We exchanged playlists, sent eachother update videos (she started that randomly) of stuff we were doing with friends, sent eachother songs, etc.

On the 3rd date I didn‚Äôt kiss her (I wasn‚Äôt getting the signals) and then we kinda stopped hanging for a little bit after that because school just got crazy. We didn‚Äôt hang outside of class for like 3 weeks, but we were still keeping in touch on text and stuff. We finally got lunch following this 3 week gap, she paid, and also invited herself to a party at my house. I didn‚Äôt invite her because I thought she wasn‚Äôt around (which is why I thought we were getting lunch instead of dinner) and I told her to come to the party. She said she‚Äôd see me there but then she cancelled. I texted her a few days later asking about a movie she made clear she wanted to see with me, and she gave some kinda bs reason about why she didn‚Äôt want to commit because that weekend was a little hectic. 

That was almost 2 weeks ago, I haven‚Äôt texted her since then. I felt like I had to back off after that, and I haven‚Äôt heard from her. When she said no to the movie I kinda accepted it was over, but I still really like her.  Part of me thought she really liked me but I was getting mixed signals, and she would put homework over hanging out. She is really busy with her thesis (which I‚Äôm not doing) but I still feel like she‚Äôd make the time if she really liked me. She‚Äôs flaked a few times, and she did apologize for it at lunch that day, but then immediately did it 2 more times. And she wouldn‚Äôt often initiate hanging out in person, that was usually me.

I‚Äôm sure she has stuff going on in her life and it‚Äôs probably a combination of a lot of stuff (busy with school, anxiety, she hasn‚Äôt been in a relationship, she‚Äôs not fully sold on me). My friend was telling me I didn‚Äôt make a move fast enough which could be true but it really seemed like this girl wanted to take it slow. She hasn‚Äôt been in a relationship before, and she made it clear she wasn‚Äôt into hookups.

I‚Äôm just wondering if this is salvageable in any way. I‚Äôll see her in class later this week and we‚Äôre having a party this weekend, should I invite her?

We clicked on many levels; I was able to open up and be vulnerable, and we were both incredibly happy to be around each other. She then suggested we go out for a walk aimlessly around town, which I agreed. Shortly afterwards, she turned to me and kissed me. We then proceeded to walk, stop, kiss more, walk again for 15 or so minutes. Afterwards we agreed to see each other again before parting ways.

Today I received a message from her saying that the way I kissed was too forceful/aggressive, slightly painful on her part. I've been in several relationships before and never been told this, so I was a little shocked to hear this, but I felt incredibly bad. I apologized to her, and I told her that I was glad for her honesty and that I was open to learning from her and working together if she wanted to continue to see me.

However, she now is having second thoughts about seeing me again because she feels that there is a deeper sign of incompatibility from the kiss. Whereas I feel as though I've just learned different things from previous relationships and am open to adjusting (I haven't said this yet, giving her time to think). She admitted this all to me, and I'm really devastated. I haven't met someone like her before, and I feel like I ruined something special without realizing what I was doing. Which is perhaps the biggest problem- that I didn't realize she didn't like it at the time. 

 Guess I just needed to share this somewhere. I've definitely already learned from my mistake. I'm thinkin of the Wong Kar Wai quote

SITUATION &gt;: Now during this time, during conversations etc, she'd openly established the idea of labelled relationships etc would give her the 'ick', and isn't fond of the idea purely because of the things she's seen happen to her friends and what they've gone through. She states this as the reason she's never been in a relationship previously, or actually 'caught feelings'.

Some red flags, I know. So rather than forcing that impression on her, I'd hold back on any feelings &amp; just keep seeing her to see if anything was there and it was quite literally like a relationship. Even in public, infront of others we knew, she'd hold my hand, look after me when I was ill, stay over all day and just accompany and talk to me &amp; get food etc watch films, and her actions just completely contradicted the idea of her hating relationships. I wanted to, and should've brought up the conversation but I didn't want to drive her away &amp; just assumed it was so blatantly obvious that this wasn't just friends with benefits. That is until last night.

She had travelled to her friend's university to stay for a few nights, and video called me very drunk. It was a normal call until I heard her mention, whilst on the call and my face literally on her phone screen, that when she kissed someone she realised he looked like someone else she knew. I didn't say anything, but simply downplayed the conversation we were having and ended the call.

\----

HER REPLIES &gt;: I then texted her if she had got with anyone that night (kissing) and admittedly she had. I had a feeling this wasn't the first time, and she also admitted it wasn't and that she'd got with people (kisses in the club etc) on nights out before whilst talking and seeing me. Bare in mind it was still almost practically a relationship at this point. She was very sorry, blamed it on her inexperience in relationships, how she hasn't had boundaries before in her life or anyone else to think of. She then went on to say she actually liked me, basically reiterated what she previously said into bigger paragraphs to me until 7am in the morning. She also stated that she'd assumed I also wasn't into the idea of a relationship, &amp; didn't want to bring up the conversation as she was scared of getting screwed over.

MY RESPONSE &gt;: My response was even with no experience, boundaries should come natural out of respect for your own feelings and the other persons. That if her feelings were genuine, she should be thinking of me in her head without me having to establish any 'boundaries' before doing anything like that, purely because it could upset me if she did so. I mentioned that if it takes a label to have that respect and boundaries, I'm not sure I want it. I also said it's as if she was oblivious she was even making a mistake as she just so casually uttered it to her friend over video call with me, and that it's quite literally just common sense and respect, so there's no excuse for it. I told her I couldn't just ignore the red flags and that it's created trust issues that I don't want. The right thing in my mind would be to end what we have, because if she can't control herself then I wouldn't be able to trust her in a relationship, but it's frustrating because she has so much depth and is a smart girl, one of the few I know who can genuinely make me laugh (don't take that the wrong way, I'm just friends with some girls who's humour aren't really my thing). But if I can't trust her I know I'll end up getting hurt.

\----

It was late at 7am and we agreed to talk later today over text when she gets back from her journey. I'm tempted to end it and stop seeing her, but I don't know if I'm the first person she's caught feelings for. She was very apologetic and clearly couldn't sleep over it. But I still don't think I'd be able to trust her on her nights out. I've held back from catching feelings as I suspected this would happen, but it still annoys me.

Sorry for the long one, tried not to spare any details.

We didn't go in this date for a couple weeks.The week i asked she said she was busy and showed me her schedule the following week I was on vacation. I asked her if she was free when I got back and she said most likely and that she would let me know. 

I got back from vacation and asked if she was still free to which she replied ""you're a great guy but I've been talking to someone else more someone I've been talking to before you and I think I'm going to give that a try but 100% if this dosnt work then I want to take a ahot on you"" I was really crushed but she mentioned she still had interest rather she ment it or not so I just went with it.

I haven't gotten a match since then so I figured I had nothing to lose still talking to her. We still talked a bit and I would send her videos of me playing guitar to songs she likes and she would send me suggestions so I figured I was sparking her interest. A fee weeks go by and she stops initiating conversation and leaves me on read more. I would text her after a few days to a week to spark conversation but our messages only lasted a couple exchanges before I was left on read again.

Fast forward to 3 weeks ago I took my shot, we both really like hockey so after one of our small exchanges I said something along the lines of ""with hockey season starting I really want to try skating would you want to go Indoor ice-skating this week? (I mentioned an actual place close to her)

She replied ""YES I would love to"" Considering she said yes inassumed she wasn't talking to anyone. I asked if she was free this week to which I was left on read. I figured she got busy and had to view her schedule since I asked while she was at work. A few days go by and I ask if she's still free she replies with ""I'm going out of town this week but I'll see when I get back""

She actually did go out of town a couple days after she got back I asked how it was and asked if she was free that week to which she replied ""honestly I'm talking to someone but thank you""

I *love* my job and the supervisors I have are genuinely nice people who only want the best for me.

That said, this issue (if you could call it that) has been eating away at me for a few years now, basically since I was in second year of uni. 

I realise now that I don't think I'll ever be able to find a woman and settle down because I still have another 3 years of PhD and minimum 5 of postdoc work ahead of me and after that I want to work abroad (I'm a UK based British student) in Japan or Canada. 

After this I want to settle in the UK and buy a house.

Look, my point is I know 23 is still young but my life plans and lack of relationship status make me less than  an ideal dating partner and I'm pretty aware that my clock is ticking. I turn 24 in 8 weeks and by that point in their lives, both my maternal aunties, my parents and my grandparents had been married for 3 years. What's more is all my friends are the same age as me and all found serous long term partners. 

I feel hopeless and the sentiment that ""it'll happen one day"" or the idea that I need to meticulously curate an attractive version of myself to please a date is driving me insane.

We do talk quite a lot (on discord mainly by text) even though sometimes she waits a bit long to answer, sometimes she replies before I have the time to blink.

We have so much in common (food, music, life goals, habits, visions on life, and many more). I joked that she is my clone but on the opposite sex. I feel at peace whenever we talk, I feel safe, which has only happened once with another woman 7 years ago (that I fell in love with but it didn't work). But at the same time she's all I think about.

That wouldn't be a problem if she wasn't already taken (and has been for a long time so this is even worse I guess?). I'm split in half, one side wants to leave them happy together because all I really care in the world is seeing everyone happy around me. My other half obviously wants to be with her.

Sometimes I believe she's flirting a bit with me. Honestly at one point I'm not sure, it might just be me that is finding explanations that satisfies me. It might be she just want some attention as well. She's really shy (I am too but maybe a bit less). We're not living in the same city, we are not that far though, but she expressed wishing I was in her city so we could try restaurants and drinks. Other times she'll just tell me when she's hungry or tell me random stuff. She also expressed joy when I told her we could watch movies (harry potter) together through screenshare (she brought that she would like to see harry potter again). Well basically she seem to never decline when I offer to do something with her (aside from when she's busy obviously). She also asks me a lot of help whenever she has questions related to the video game we both play. It's just.. sometimes I feel like she tells me stuff someone in a relationship would normally not. But that's also maybe because we're a lot alike.

I had 2 women in my life (1 year and half each basically) and both of them left me for someone else so I have been on the other side twice and know the feeling. I thus already hate myself for ¬´trying¬ª a little bit but I also know anything can happen.. No seriously I don't know anymore, I wish I could cancel my feelings these days because I feel numb.

Probably my cleanest thought is to just remain in standby, by not doing any obvious move/anything, by just waiting to see if she, one day, will be single. Though the waiting is a painful feeling and time is stretching out to make days feel like weeks (is this the secret of longevity? lol). At least I can forgive myself, I'm a simple human, I have flaws and failures. Sometimes it's just hard to override your basic instincts. But I haven't been in love with someone for so many years, I did forget a bit how it felt.

As he spends weekdays away for work I‚Äôll only see him MAYBE in a weeks time or if not then, in almost 2 weeks time.

However I don‚Äôt want him driving to see me on a weeknight for me to end things with him so feel the only time would be when he‚Äôs already in town on the weekends.

These are my options:
1. Don‚Äôt delay it and end things asap over video call. 
2. Be normal with him until I see him in person in 1 or 2 weeks to end it. 
3. Be cold with him until I see him in person (I‚Äôm sure he will bring something up before then though tbh)
4. Get him to drive to see me on a weeknight and end it.

First of all, I want to apologize for my English, I have never been able to learn new languages well.

Girl I've been with for 4 months broke up with me. That's all clear for me. Things I don't understand are we were talking like 10 days before broke up that she gets hope with me again and comes to life again, as if she tends to dress nicely, to make up, we planned Christmas and presents, as well as presents for our loved ones. And even some 5 days before the breakup, we wrote about sex and that we buy some spicy things to play with. Her reason for breaking up is she doesn't love me and never loved me. But that's just weird when I think about it. I've never noticed that she was dissatisfied with the relationship, on the contrary, she said she liked it with me. She told me many times that she miss me, that she was looking forward to me when will be together.

She also had a couple of relationships in her life, one partner emotionally bullying her and the other she was happy as long as it was a long-distance relationship, but once they lived together, she was no longer satisfied. She claims that she always had a problem falling in love and that she only managed to do it once and that was almost immediate, and that happened in the distance relationship I mentioned.

 With this girl, I felt like me and happy like never before. Ever since I started dating her, I felt confident, relaxed and overall a much better person. I started to think I found the right one (Yes, it's naive to say this I know) and then we break up, she tells me we're not judged for ourselves.  

Do you have anything you would write to me about it? Advice, reasons why what and how? I understand that no one will find a direct answer to this and I am reconciled that it will end, but I don't want to give it up, because I think it is worth fighting for her. What can/shoud I do?

&amp;#x200B;

There was a girl, who was from a religious family but she very badly wanted to find love and she wanted the man to be from abroad, because she was going to study abroad anyway and she was scared that if she will fall in love with a man from her country she will be stuck in that country forever.

&amp;#x200B;

So she started her search and one day she started exchanging messages with a nice man from the USA. They connected really quickly and there was no sign that the man was ""UNIQUE"". Alla fell in love with him and only in a year he decided to open up to her. They were already planning a meeting and even a life together so he felt like he should confess. He told her that there was a thing about him that he wanted her to know and he was hoping that thing wont scare her. At that point she was already freaking out! She had no clue what so horrible that man could possibly hide from her for the whole year!!!??

&amp;#x200B;

He sent her a photo. On the photo he was wearing woman's clothes. Before she asked any questions he said he was no gay or anything! He just simply liked to wear woman's clothes and underwear. He told her a childhood story of his mother always been disappointed at giving a birth to a boy, when she wanted to have a girl. She used to dress him as a girl a lot and tell him ""my little princess"", which had a harmful influence on his mental health. So he was perfectly normal except that he liked to wear woman's clothes.

&amp;#x200B;

He said he could not find a girlfriend who would accept him as he is and this is the reason why he kept it a secret this whole time!!! How would you react to such situation?

&amp;#x200B;

Would you still accept such person if you really loved them? There might be girls who like to dress up as men. is this less harmful than a man dressing up as a woman?
