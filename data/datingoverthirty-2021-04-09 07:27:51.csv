0,mnh0ap,1617974305,2 hour car ride second date when surprisingly well ! - has anyone else done a long plan and had it work out well or poorly ?,"So yesterday I (39/m) invited a woman I had really only been on 1 date with prior like a few years ago before covid (but knew in high school and message from time to time) on a 2 hour ride to visit amazing garden in a neighboring state then hit the beach for a bit and It actually went well !

&amp;#x200B;

I was worried such a large commitment of time in a car ride (I feel like long car rides and IKEA are the final test of many relationships) But I actually think we both had a great time and kept up a good conversation the whole time .  I feel like it was actually more comfortable than our prior dinner date by a wide margin - I guess if your both know the timetable and plan going into it it's more relaxing.  - maybe I need to have more structure for all my dating lol 

It was fun to do something so random in the middle of the week and have a partner for it - during the covid era I've done tons of little escapes for nature stuff but this is the first time I've done such a long trip with a partner.  

I wonder has anyone else ever done a long trip or extended date commitment that went really well or really badly ?",datingoverthirty,t5_34cyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/mnh0ap/2_hour_car_ride_second_date_when_surprisingly/
