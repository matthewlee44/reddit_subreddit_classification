I eventually broke up with her and after the hurt from the break up was over we’ve texted each other occasionally – like, “I found X of yours, do you want it?” and sometimes just to say hi. 

She has a boyfriend  and is happy and I’m genuinely happy that she’s happy. She’s a great person but we just had different outlooks about what we wanted. 

But it’s been two years and I still think about her a lot. Certainly more than I would’ve anticipated. I’ve gone on a handful of dates since then but I just can’t seem to fully move on.

I think I’ve never been ghosted (I’m 30), at least not by anyone I knew to this extent. Not gonna lie, it does suck at first cause you don’t know why it went from hot to ice cold so quick. Just be straight. We’re not strangers. I know I’m dodging a bullet here, but it sucks cause she is a cool ass girl.

So I worked with this girl for a few months. I never made a move cause she was in a LDR. Little to no contact over next year, but I’m into her and I know she digs me to a certain extent based on a couple things I won’t say to not make this any longer. Couple months ago, invites me and old coworkers to her bday party. We fall asleep on couch together. Nothing happened.

Hit her up a month later, invite her out for my bday. We go out night before and night of. We have a blast. Bunch of her friends meet up, they all love me according to her. Sleeps over both nights, but barely hookup (too drunk/hungover for sex). Morning after, watch movies, cuddle, caressing, she initiates make out with me. SHE kisses me on lips goodbye. Her texts later, very into me, complimenting. So I’m like ok this is different.

Next week, invites me to her friend’s party a couple weeks out. After two failed meetups that weekend, in my head I’m like forget it.

We text few days later, reminds me that I’m going to the party with her, asks if I want to watch a movie. Comes over. Watch a movie, foreplay, have sex, but I can’t finish lol. Don’t think it was bad for either us, but I know I’m better. I’m a confident dude. Was just overthinking. After, she cuddles, lays head on my chest, caressing my chest, initiates make out with me. Asks me if I want her to stay or leave. I say stay. Sleeps over. She kisses me on lips goodbye in the morning while I’m sleeping.

Text her almost a week later, no response till next day. Says she’s been busy. That party comes a few days later. She never hits me up. I knew she was ghosting, but a couple days later, like an idiot, I ask if she’s free later in the week. Apologizes for being so busy, asks what day, I give a couple options, she picks Saturday. I say cool Sat night and she hearts my text. Ghosted on saturday. Never hit her up again.

A week later, my friend sees her out and tells her that she’s “kinda” ghosting me and is working shit out with her LDR. Don’t even know if she was ever single, on a break or whatever. Her working it out doesn’t bother me. We weren’t dating and I was fine with just a NSA hookup whether it was one time or more.

It’s when SHE started showing lots of affection, intimacy and inviting me out where I was like ok, i’ll ride this wave. But since she ghosted after a night of sex, I’m like was it the sex? It would SUCK to get ghosted cause of that. But why stay, be intimate, kiss me on the lips goodbye in the AM? Was she just using me for some sex cause she needed it? Fine, I like sex, but why all the intimacy, why hang out with me and be all over me in front of your friends and invite me out to hang with them?

A few weeks later, he’s texting me while I’m on vacation and it’s going well. We plan to hang out again and he asks for my schedule. He says he’s going to call in so that we can hang out. That week, I hardly hear from him. He doesn’t text me for two days. The day we are supposed to hang out I text and ask if he called in. He responds with “yeah” and nothing else.. I didn’t say anything because it took him hours to say yeah, and I hadn’t heard from him in days. He left me with a one-word response and no plans to hang out as we had talked about multiple times.

Not an Expert but I can navigate the scene. I have been ghosted before this situationship too*

I am 25F and I had 6 dates with this guy, this ""no labels thing-y"" lasted 1 month. I know, I know: it's such a short period of time but time is not the point here.

He added me on FB in March and liked all my daily posts until June came and that's when he sent the first message my way. After talking for a couple of days he asked me out, so:

* First date: he came to see me, we talked a lot and didn't kiss, just hugged goodnight. It was ok.

* Second date should have happened after a few days, he made plans to see each other after work just to  disappear later that night. The next day he told me he was so so sorry, I got mad but then wanted to act cool cause ye, it's just the /Biggest Red Flag/, what could go wrong, right? But I wanted to act cool (as much as it sounds nonsense) and I restarted texting back. He asked again and that Second date ""finally"" happened.
That was INTENSE. We kissed, he massaged my feet, we took a walk. It was romantic and sensual without getting awkward or ""too fishy"". 
It's when he started showing more interest via text too.
He also asked if I wanted to spend my Birthday with him.

**3RD/4TH/5TH happened one after the other**

* Third date: he works in a hotel, there's a pool too so yeah, I went to see him after work. We chilled, kissed etc but nothing super intimate. He pushed for sex a bit but told me he could wait, just not wanted to. It was sweet. We talked a lot.
Just right after the date he he literally sent me 
""I have never felt like this, maybe when I was a kid. This is unique. Looking in your eyes makes me feel free to be myself. I can not explain it, it's only been 3 weeks and here we are. It seems like we have been doing this for so long but it was the first time I could keep eye contact w/ someone for so long""
Yeah. Enough said.

* Fourth-Fifth Dates: that's when we started getting intimate. Messed around on the 4TH, had sex on the 5TH. 
The night we started getting somewhat intimate he took me to a bar and had a drink, he revealed he accepted a job out of region and he was going to move there. He asked me if I was willing to go see him sometime. 
Also, I am currently looking for a job and my CV matches with his so he said he might ask if there was still an open position. I took that lightly and said we shall see. (no, he was not drunk LOL)

Sex was great with him, we also had fun several times that night. When I got home he texted: see, I am still here (????) I was never willing to walk away. 

That's when things started going downhill though. I didn't realize at first but now it's clear.

* Sixth date was 2 days ago. I told him I'd like to see him. Yeah, I am straightforward. He said: then come see me.
I went, we had fun you know but there was something missing. He was distant in a way, distracted. 
While having sex I told him that for me that... Uhm, type of activity... Was exclusive to him only. He responded ""Same here. We got to this point, seeing others would make no sense"" . During that night I tried to get to know him better but also realized he didn't make that much of an effort to do the same with me.
We kissed goodnight and he promised me he would come and take me somewhere on my Birthday (which is today) and... That's the last time I saw him.

Texts started becoming drier than usual, he also made a comment/joke about how my sister is almost hotter than me and that turned me off completely. How dare you tbh.
That's when he turned me off but since my friends are either out of town or worked I decided to stick to the plan and see if he'd either surprise me or be an A$$hOle. Sometimes I'm just curious/masochist to see how red the Red Flag can get.

Today he started pulling away, I had to ask him for tonight and he said yes, I wanna see you of course...... Just to straight up come back with a big excuse I saw coming ""since I'm leaving my work position here my colleagues threw me a party, we'll have some wine and a slice of cake""
How dare you pt2. He didn't apologize, he didn't feel bad about the thought of doing this on my Birthday (which was planned seeing his texts from today and yesterday) .
He could have just said ""Hey, do something else. / I am not ready. / I have something else going on. / Don't wait for me. / I do not like you go out and enjoy your time"" 
He didn't LOL. I confronted him and he ghosted, just to hide his IG stories from me.

One of my best friends follows one of his friends and saw him reposting a story with my Ex-date or whatever.
I went to check this boy IG and he hid his IG stories from me as well... He doesn't even know me wtf how lame is that. 
Why is confrontation so hard for some people?

I do not care about losing the possibility to bond with this person, I care about the lack of respect. He didn't owe me anything and I'm ok about that but two days ago he told me we were exclusive, ""since we got to that point it was obvious"". I am not the type to go sleep with anyone, especially during the pandemic, but still!
Why isn't ok to inform me of the BS you just said? That you are not ready or whatever. Why make me feel miserable? I care about my Bday, this was supposed to be a Great Day.
It was not.
If it happened on any other day I wouldn't have cared much and moved on with my routine but reserving a spot for yourself just to make fun of me is mean. 
I might sound dramatic to some but he might have just told me earlier (and not at 9pm) . I got ready too, had my hair, make up and all. He didn't intend to show up anyway.
It was sad.

This was not just to rant but also to get your two cents on this situation. I like analyzing situations to get better and to catch on my mistakes/things overlooked/Red flags - no experience should be useless.

I got out of a relationship 6mths ago &amp; he made me feel unattractive. It really took a toll on my self esteem. I really haven't made much of an attempt to date. I'm more focused on making more friends &amp; just enjoying the summer after being locked in the house for 13mths. (I live in a very transient city where people come &amp; go quickly. I also don't have any family here.) I felt this chemistry &amp; spark I don't feel towards very many people. I'd been saying I'm not ready to date again but he made me feel differently. I was excited.  We texted over the weekend here &amp; there. We had tenative plans for one of his days off on Tue/Wed. Tuesday morning when he got off work (5am) he asked if I had plans that night or if I was free. I responded that I didn't have anything going on about 930am. I knew we was likely sleeping all day but when I hadn't heard anything by 530p I texted him again asking if he slept late &amp; are we getting together.  I haven't heard a word from him since. I'm so disappointed. I hadn't been on a ""date"" in a few years so I went &amp; bought a new outfit, dyed my hair, painted my nails....I wanted to feel beautiful.  Now, I'm hurt more than I probay should be. The last time I gave a guy my # at his job after he was being flirtatious, he lied about having a GF &amp; a baby. So I'm just kinda over it.

Don't fucking play it out as us being our own enemies because in most cases its not, other people are. You don't live our lives, you aren't in our own shoes.

Love doesn't die a natural death.


It dies because we grow in different directions and we no longer want or are willing to strive towards the same things


It dies because of lies and cover up. When we inflict jealousies and inappropriate behaviors. The explosive confessions after a fog of suspicion.


It dies because its impossible to divide the heart over multiple partnerships. That feeds indifference. And its a testament of character.


It dies due to starvation from crumbs of affection and attention. Crumbs of smiles. Crumbs of happiness.


It dies due to stagnation. Love is dynamic and alive ever growing and developing. When you no longer wish to explore new interest together, love will coil around someone who will.


It dies from abuse, cruel words, non pleasing acts and from over possessiveness. All these states invite resentment.


It takes more than love to keep love alive. Midnight never strikes two hearts at the same time. One will always love more than the other. The one who loves less stops protecting the one who loves more. Remember my reddit reader. Love is not words. You can proclaim love and treat that person badly. Love is not a feeling. Your feelings can change over the course of breakfast, plus love comes with a drop of pain and fear. Love is behavior. What you do. What you show.


We have become sexually frivolous and confuse desire with love. Sex and desire are elements of love just as hot water is not soup.


Remember the vow. Remember the reason for the vow. The wisdom behind the vow.


To honor and cherish my mate in good times and bad. Please grasp the wisdom. Good times destroys sometimes faster than bad times. Look at the mess celebrities create. In sickness and in health. A vain man always working out or woman looking for a boob job has a drop of poison. Health can destroy. In want and in plenty. Wealth becomes tools of dominance, and that is anti love. Love is an equalizer in that it can reduces a king to kneel and marry a peasant. To forsake all others. This one really confused people and I will not get into this.. All others. All ,not except...


But love does not die naturally. When you allow yourself to get familiar and boring. When you allow your passion to wane. When you reach the point when you believe your mate isn't worth fighting for.. You murder your love.

This is some simple advice that's meant to be encouraging. There are a lot of people who post here who have trouble getting matches (whether quality matches or any matches at all) through OLD. There are a lot of guys, and women, too, who find it extremely awkward to approach someone of their preferred sex in public. I'm going to suggest, rather than doing what you've been doing (and not being successful at) in a different way, to do something completely different.

If you look across human history and around the world, you might notice that the way we do courtship in this time, in industrialized societies, is really weird. We treat it, for the most part, like a solo endeavor, hoping to bump into a compatible atom in a sea of them. That works for some people, but if it isn't working for you, why not try what humans have done throughout history and meet people through friends, family, and social gatherings that you simply get to know, enjoy some conversations, without being on the hunt for a mate.

The phrase ""getting back out there"" is literal. Hanging out with friends, going to concerts, joining barbecues, going to weddings and funerals and baby showers and birthday parties, joining a kickball team, joining a rock climbing gym -- all of these are the kinds of activities where you may or may not meet people you'd like to date, but you'll certainly meet a lot more people who know someone you might be a good match with. If your efforts so far at doing this solo have been a waste of time, this can't be any worse, right?

Look: I'm an introvert and ADHD besides. I don't like crowds and I am terrible at parties. But some of the best dating experiences I've ever had started when I was around friends who think I'm awesome and around whom I'm relaxed and confident. Getting to know someone new, or even an acquaintance, in an environment like that lets potential dates see you in your best light. Allow the people around you hype you up, not in an artificial way, but by simply enjoying your company. If they happen to invite a few eligible singles as well, all the better. It takes time and energy, but so does swiping for nothing.

It's possible you're thinking that you don't have friends like that, that you don't get invited to things, or that you're estranged from family. I get it. But with all love and respect, if your life is that devoid of human connection, maybe that's something you should work on before expecting to find the one person who will be your ""everything.""",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,937833,public,self,You don't have to do this alone,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oy93cv/you_dont_have_to_do_this_alone/,all_ads,6,,,

I understand I'm not entitled to their interest and respect their feelings but after getting this tons of times it's starting to really get me down.

I hear advice the meet as many people as you can as the more people you meet the more you increase your odds on a sheer probability basis but that's never really worked out for me. I've been on least 100+ tinder dates/meetups over the last few years and they've never really panned out. I've met plenty of women IRL through things like uni and mutual friends and they're almost always not interested at all; they barely engage with me. 

Often times there's cases where I did feel a strong connection with them (especially after a few dates) but they never seem to with me; which especially gets me down as they're often super lovey dovey and affectionate with me which makes me think things are going well only to find out it's not. 

I don't know what it's like to have a woman flirt with me, drop hints, crush on me whether from a woman I've got to meet and know IRL or met up with from Tinder because these things honestly never happen. 

I believe I'm physically attractive, look like my photos, and aren't going for women above my league. I've asked female friends and former dates (now friends) if there's anything blatantly off about my personality/vibe and honestly couldn't find anything. 

I look at some guys in relationships and/or that my female acquaintances have expressed interest in and am confused as to what quality I lack that's holding me back. 

I've done all the things that are suggested in threads like these. 

I'm in great shape and dress well/take care of hygiene etc. I have lots of passions that I can talk in depth about and have had a lot of interesting experiences in my life. I'm a confident and friendly person with quite a lot of male and female friends. I ask them questions about themselves and am an active listener. I flirt with them directly and gradually escalate if receptive. I have my shit together and make quite a bit of money and have a sizable (for my age) net worth.  I'm not needy or overinvested. I'm not a ""nice guy"" and don't talk badly about women on dates.

These things don't entitle me to anything of course but I would figure having so many positive qualities and green flags combined with lots of interactions would see me doing at least a little better than I've been doing just on sheer probability alone.

I just don't seem to be someone that women feel worthy of investing in or putting effort towards to try and keep around and I'm not sure as to where I'm going wrong.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,937883,public,self,(24M) Women never seem to feel chemistry/sparks/connection with me and it makes me feel sad,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oy9sge/24m_women_never_seem_to_feel/,all_ads,6,,,

One of these guys has been my good friend for over 10 years and I’ve always been attracted to him. The other two are less close friends, but guys I know fairly well. 

I kind of want to scream at all of them.

Then having it happen three times, in three weeks? I don’t have the words to explain how much it fucking sucks. In my darkest moments I wonder if they were just saying anything they could to fuck me and that really, really hurts, especially with the old friend.

&gt; She has also refereed me some clients.

&gt; I just informed that I received your magazine. She kept asking if I read, what I liked about her writing. This time IDK why I replied her questions with minimum enthusiasm possible, like it was a just another gift.

&gt; I do FB story things a lot. And, almost every FB stories leads to a conversation with her. I never posted about her writing.

&gt; Within 2 days, I found her FB account has been deactivated. 

&gt; Now, I felt empty. I miss all those little chit-chat that kept me alive. 

&gt; Then I discovered her number at that magazine's currier receipt. I immediately saved the number and found her whatsapp, and typed ""her name""
- she replied - ""who?""
- I replied - ""guess"" 

Then, her whatsapp also has been deactivated.

Met a girl on Hinge who I like a pretty good deal. We’ve hung out three times so far:

First date 7/28 - got drinks, came back to my apartment, vibes out to music cuddled, hooked up, great overall evening with no considerable difference in behavior.

Second hangout 8/3 - went to her place and was greeted by a jovial, almost drunk-like mood. ordered pizza, watched a scary movie, and by the time the movie was over she’d fallen asleep. I tried to cuddle as we had previously and was greeted by sharp rejection. She asked me if I could scoot over as she mumbled her words (and got mad when I mentioned her mumbling) and completely shut off from me for the night. The next morning, however I was greeted by a much warmer, more familiar mood as we proceeded to hook up. We then cuddled for a few hours until we had to both leave for work and left on good terms. 

Third hangout 8/4 - Got a message as I was leaving work about hanging out the very following evening from hangout number 2 (same day). Showed up about two hours after making arrangements to her in a very good and welcoming mood. She wanted to be cuddled instantly and seemed genuinely happy to be in my company. She fell asleep while we watched a movie and later woke up in a pretty foul mood. Rejected my cuddle attempt and went as far as to lay on the other side of the bed claiming (while mumbling) that she just needed space and that the bed was making her back feel horrible. Granted, her bed sucks and should be replaced but it’s not nearly that bad to where I would take that type of action with someone who I’d been seeing only for a week now.

After the 2nd dates events I just thought maybe she was drunk and was better in the morning because she sobered up. But after the reoccurrence tonight I started speculating that maybe she has some sort of mental illness. Some of her actions reflect someone who may have bipolar disorder, but I am not in position to diagnose anyone with anything. I, myself have legitimate anxiety issues and have been doing well lately but this shit here is triggering to say the least.

I'm somewhat over it but I still have love for him. We moved on mutually knowing that we were bad for eachother. And it hurts even more that me and him were Engaged and wanted kids. Well atleast i wanted them. He was always unsure with me but gave her a Baby and a ring so fast. Sucks enough that my own Mother told me about it once she found out. There was another guy i had feelings for but after him playing with my feelings and basically giving me hope just to use me for my body and his therapy sessions for his Ex girlfriend who he's still madly in love with even tho she use to beat him. (I met him after they broke up btw).
I caught feelings for him we'd talked for like 8 months by that time had sex amazing sex. He made me believe we'd be something led me on.
Did the whole dating thing- he became my Bf. Then out of the blue he got her Pregnant... After i found out he told me he just liked me for my Body. Now Marriage and Having children is so unappealing to me. I have a hard time getting close with men even more so now. Fwb is just so easy and fast and i don't have to deal with sh*tty ass men drowning me in their problems that i could give two fucks hearing about. And getting Pregnant now is scary. Even thinking about kids is unappealing. I've been in so many bad relationships at a young age and I'm so done. I'm just fine dying alone. But, i know I'm still young and there could be hope?.

They believed the baby wasn't his but it's not like his family was sunshine and sprinkles where she would voluntarily stay unless she needed to 😅. Once she finally decided enough was enough, they didn't even hesitate to run her off and her ex was a deadbeat and never once gave a dime for the baby. Me? i loved this kid, i stepped in when i didn't have, helped care for them, raise the baby and watched her grow, my family received them with open arms, all sunshine and rainbows right. Come to find out about a couple months ago she started talking to the babydaddy and bada-bing bada-boom, back to him she went. She ugly cried to me, apologized a million times and kept saying ""I'm sorry, but it seems as he's changed and wants to be there for the baby now"".

He checks all the right boxes too so I thought it was gold. He's attractive, close to my age, owns a home, doesn't live with his parents, has a stable job, a pet, not a smoker or alcoholic. I mean, when the hell does that happen? 

But when I text him (our form of communication) it takes a very long time (we're talking a day or 2) for him to get back to me. But when we are together, we get along great.

I invited her to come stay with me for the weekend recently. She doesn't have a car and would have to take a train, but I figured it was fair since I'd traveled so much for her already. She rejected my offer saying the trip was too much hassle for just 1 night. That hurt me and I knew we probably weren't on the same page at that point. But I don't have many people to talk to, and just being friends and having her in my life was so good for my poor mental health, so I swallowed the pain and pretended things were okay. 

She began acting more and more distant over the weeks. We spoke last weekend and things seemed okay, then we didn't talk for 3 days. I texted her saying hi stranger and she didn't reply for 24 hrs, so I tried again and said to please at least say goodbye, that being ghosted doesn't feel very nice. I haven't heard back yet and feel I never will. 

I was never anything but good and decent to her and didn't deserve this. I feel so terrible and mentally broken. I need a partner and a friend and I try so hard to be a good person, but time and time again find myself alone and disappointed.
