We didnt label our relationship (mutual desicion). The thing is, he is in love with another girl. Recently I told him he is special to me after him telling me I am so important for him. As a response he said ""You mean so much more than you think you do. It is not just liking you as a friend anymore, it is more than that. But I love X, you know that"".  He loves her (X) so much that it hurts him very deeply. I am very lost. I am afraid of falling for him (I already am and I am very scared). Because it is a dead end, but we both need each other right now. I stopped sexting too. Right now while I am writing these, he fell asleep talking to me on facetime. I start crying when I see his face there, looking at me with all that care and warmness. I hate that I am the one who comforts him when he cries over the girl he loves.

Just don’t respond after . Well maybe 2 months go by and she sends me a picture of a sonogram (I think that’s what they are called) and it had her name on it in the corner so I knew it was legit and she wasn’t pulling the come back routine females run to after something like that happens it showed a child  and date conceived well I did the math it matched up but I was still in total denial and denied the possibility of the child being mine . Anyways she didn’t say too much after but obv I kept In touch anywho few months go by I met this girl one year younger than me we clicked immediately personality seemed to be a perfect match for mine . We dated about 6 months then Nicole (my current fiancé mentioned first ) had the child and obv I went there my girlfriend at the time was mad but kind of had understanding . Anyways 6 months after that I get a paper in the mail demanding a dna swab she’s going for child support . So I comply for up there take it and few weeks later 99.99999% my child . So I made the decision to drop everything and go be with her and my child a year goes by . We just argue all the time nonstop and she hates everything I enjoy even doesn’t like my brother coming over . So we fall out on that she moves away to Alabama with her dad without saying anything . I just come home to nothing but a mattress on the floor . And I was so depressed for awhile . It shook me way harder then I could have ever imagined. For reference at this time I had not been the best either as in having random old friends that do drugs over I was always out cheating as well . She had her suspicions. But anyways after a couple weeks of her gone I’m begging for her to come back which is something that is odd for me because never in a million years could I see myself doing that but there I was pride out the window just begging . She came back . Everything was fine for maybe a month then boom right back to it except her leaving was like a wake up call to me I stopped hanging around bad so called friends and stopped cheating haven’t even looked at any other girl since but it was like we were roomates we’d have sex maybe twice a month because we wasn’t always feeling it . She stil hates when inhang with my brother and won’t do anything I enjoy like the river fishing hunting camping but expects me to go do things that she likes which is like going to her family’s in Alabama and stuff anyways at present time we have 3 kids and nothing has changed it just feels toxic and I can’t just leave she has no way to support these kids and wouldn’t ever let me see them if we split .

We've been dating for about 9 months now and he says he cares about me and so I know that he does but with my past(abuse) it is really hard to acknowledge that he does care about me when he is not showing it. He plays lots of video games and I have had multiple conversations with him saying that I don't feel like I'm getting enough attention and he'll say that he is trying and I'll see that he is trying maybe that day and the next few days but it never lasts. 

I need more support from him but I'm just not sure if he can provide that for me because he is busy playing games or just doing something else, it seems like he just wants to keep me around but without putting in the effort. I care about him a lot and I love him and we had plans to move into an apartment together in the fall (with roommates) since we go to the same college and we are sharing a cat. I got the kitten for my birthday but it was at his apartment so it's like ours and I know he is attached to the cat and I don't want to just take him away but I'm not sure if the relationship will work and I don't know what to do.

He does have depression so I understand that he does need some time to himself but he just doesn't seem to talk to me much and will disappear for hours playing video games sometimes, which is really hurtful because I am his girlfriend and he should want to talk to me and feel comfortable opening up to me. I have tried to let him know that I am there for him and want him to tell me how he is feeling but I also know he has trouble even knowing how he feels sometimes.

I asked him why it's so hard to have a conversation most of the time and he said ""I just don't like doing conversations over text or snap they don't feel like they hold any significance""

I replied with ""That's fair I just do wanna talk to you more and if we can't call then that's what I wanna do, but if that is the case can we try to make it a routine to actually call?""

He replied ""I mean calling every day is just a lot though, even every other day can be a bit much sometimes""

To which I said ""That kinda sounds like you don't really enjoy talking to me then""

And he said ""No?""

This to me really seems like he would prefer not to talk to me and he says no so I don't understand

We weren't talking that consistently for the first month but after that we were. First month was just teasing each other in the dms till I finally gave him my number after feeling more comfortable. He wanted to go on a date with me while I wanted to call first before meeting up in person but ultimately he didn't wanna call cus he wasn't comfortable/ didn't want to put expectations before meeting. I wasn't comfortable meeting cus of covid and all the cases so I told him let's meet when things calm down. We had an online friendship for the past 3 ish months where we just talked over snap and texted a few times (but convo would last for a few weeks and a few replies a day). We would just text about random stuff and tease nothing too serious. 

Anyways, things have calmed down and he hasn't asked me out yet/doesn't text me. We recently became each other's best friends on snap for about 3 weeks now. He usually teases me over snapchat and I've dropped hints numerous times that I don't like talking over snapchat and he knows I like text better. Anyways, I ended up telling him that I was a little annoyed with him cause he doesn't listen to what I like(referring to him not following through with the communication method I like which is texting). He just replied with smh and that was that. Kind of a red flag to me but think maybe I should just move on and explore other options instead of hope for him to take note of what I like which is the bare minimum.

I met this girl around 2 weeks ago , we where at a small friendly reunion, she is friends with the girlfriend of a close friend of mine .


It was a rather small reunion but pretty cool one , this girl was pretty shy an rarely spoke to anyone , I was lucky enough to have her sitting next to me.

I eventually decided to talk to her and we got to knew each other a little bit , I was already semi drunk but barely noticeable, she left the reunion early.

It is worth noting that she is from Europe and quite cute in my opinion but anyway, she decided to leave early on the reunion and didn’t got the chance to ask for her number since when she was living both my friend and his gf walked her out so I didn’t want her to feel pressured.

My friend even asked me if I asked for her number , he told he could get her number so as long as she agrees to give it to me , then 2 weeks passed or 1 idk , and my friend gives me her number this happened last Friday.

My friend told me that she told  him that following 



“Give him my number , just tell him tho that I am seeing some other ppl as well”.

This dosent mean she is in an open relationship, she is just hanging out with some other ppl at the given time since more men are seeking her out.

This happened all in Spanish so I am making the literal translation of it , but I know for a fact that she aint whoring around or doing open relationship shit , she is just hanging out with other dudes to see who she likes the most.


She did told my friend that she noticed me to be younger, and that’s actually correct , I am around 4-5 years younger. I am 22 and I am guessing she is around 25-27 years old.


I am incredibly shy and suck at texting so I have 0 clue of how to text my way out to a date, once we date whatever happens will be on my hands , but for now the texting part is giving me a headache, any advice.


Btw she did agreed to the fact of having her number giving to me , while it may not tbh she is 100% into it , it may mean something or she just wants to see how it goes , regardless I need help :(.

There is a girl in the class that I really huge crush on, but everyone time she’s is every around me the only time I can get even look at her is when I think she is talking to the group or to someone else and I can’t help but glance at her. What’s bad is her very close friend (let’s say her roommate) I used to like as well but as I got to know them more I realized that her roommate would be a better friend than a girlfriend for someone like me. 

But now I can talk to strangers like nobodies business and whenever we have the class and we discuss the Bible I can say things that might make everyone else turn their head because well I’ve been to a Christian school and my dad was a pastor so I have a huge background in the church and I know well enough about the Bible to always have an answer ready when given the opportunity. 

But every week after class is over I rush out and don’t really say anything other than bye. But like tonight we met somewhere and I was able to talk to pretty much everyone ELSE but my crush. Heck she was behind me in line and I said hey (she was all alone) and that’s it. 

But her roommate and everyone else I don’t have a problem talking to but everyone was leaving and it was just me and her and their other guy and her roommate and she sitting right in front of me but I get it and ask both of their something about their house and her friend shows me a photo then I said bye and left. So outwardly it may look like I like her roommate but I obviously don’t. 


HOW DO PEOPLE SPEAK TO THEIR CRUSH? 
Plus I think the other guy may like her or unlike me he and her talk or I’ve seen them talk and at least be friend but when I talk to her if EVER I can only be super formal and say something stupid like hey or bye.

About 8 years ago I met my current fiancé. We’re from the same neighborhood, have a ton of mutual friends, I know his ex girlfriend, but somehow just never met him in person and our paths never crossed.

One night while out with my best friend, we run into my current fiancé and his friends (some who I knew at the time). I was drunk and we said hello and he kissed me on the cheek.

I got into the cab that night and asked my friend who the cute guy was. She told me and 5 mins later I Facebook messaged him and the rest is history. We really hit it off.

Now that night, I went over her house and stayed over. She didn’t know I had already texted him. Next morning over breakfast we were talking about him and she said “back off he’s mine” (as a joke)

Now a bit of background story. Best friend and fiancé have known each other since kindergarten (they’ve stayed in touch over the years). She has really been into him. He is not into her. They have never went out or done anything sexually.

I did not know she was actually interested in him until I was already talking to him. 

Fast forward to now, we’re still friends, but she will take jabs at me whenever possible. When we first started dating she told him I  wasn’t Jewish(neither of us are religious but this is in the context of dating someone your own background). 
She joked and told me the rabbi marrying us probably isn’t really Jewish if he’s marrying us. Constant jabs throughout the years.

I (24F) have been in a relationship with my boyfriend (26M) for a little   over a year now. It has been a happy, fulfilling relationship and he   constantly tells me he loves me. He also says how much he loves me (i.e.   I love you so much, I love you so so much, I love you so very very   much...). Within the last week, he has specifically stopped saying ""I   love you so very very much"", which is starting to make me worried. Like   why did he stop saying it? No other evidence exists that he is upset   with me or losing emotions. But yet he isn't saying that anymore.

My high school boyfriend used to do something like this too and it ended   up driving me a bit nuts. My college boyfriend and I just said ""I love   you"" and nothing more and I loved that because then it was never   quantified, it was nice and simple and full, and never changed in   wording and thus did not cause any worry.

My current boyfriend started doing this quantifying ""I love you"" stuff   from the start of him saying ""I love you"" to me, and I didn't have the   heart to tell him to stop, and I went with it because I thought why not?   And it felt nice to be showered with it.... but now I really remember   why I did not like it, like as with my high school boyfriend.

Now what I want to say to my boyfriend is that I don't want us to quantify   ""I love you"" anymore. Because then it just causes anxiety and hurt   feelings. ""I love you"" is all I want, it is simple and does not cause me   to look at how he is wording things.

So my advice that I am asking about is how to tell him this in a non-hurtful way. Thanks.

TL;DR: My boyfriend always adds ""so much"" ""so very very much"" to ""I love you""   and I want him to stop because it causes me anxiety the times he  doesn't  use the add-ons.

The most common question I receive related to couples is “What’s the secret to a happy marriage?”  In response, I frequently think of the famous saying by Henny Youngman – “The secret of a happy marriage remains a secret.”

This can certainly appear true when one understands how many marriages end in divorce (roughly half).  With such a large percentage of marriages ending, a common perception is that successful marriages are exceedingly difficult to sustain.  That is definitely true, but it is also true that the “secrets” to a lifelong happy marriage are not so secret – contrary to what Mr. Youngman joked.  The secrets are rooted in emotional maturity, a willingness to put another person ahead of ourselves, a receptive attitude toward change and a dogged sense of commitment to bond.  

Of course people are unique and relationships even more unique; what works for one couple might not work for another.  Yet, I do believe there are qualities and behaviors which solidify a marriage in ways that withstand the trials and tribulations of life – and in the most important ways are simply not secrets.  By developing and actively nurturing these qualities and behaviors, you can save a failing marriage and/or greatly enhance your relationship with your spouse.  It’s simple, but not easy.  It takes great courage and a true heartfelt desire for the relationship to work.



“By all means, marry. If you get a good wife, you'll become happy; if you get a bad one, you'll become a philosopher."" — Socrates, Greek philosopher 



1. Great Communication – Don’t go to Sleep Angry
 
Perhaps you have heard the old adage “never go to sleep angry.”  My wife and I actually say this to our children when we give them advice on relationships.  Certainly, there are times when couples need a break from conflict and should get some space.  Sometimes that involves another old adage that we need to “sleep on it.”  But I think the core of meaning behind “never go to sleep angry” is that we should avoid running away from conflict in the relationship.  

Conflict is not in itself dangerous for the relationship.  In fact, conflict offers up the potential for improving the relationship.  It is frequently through resolving conflict that change takes place.   Resolution and change are very helpful in order to move past disagreements.  Sweeping concerns under the rug won’t typically help our marriage.  More likely it will be a breeding ground for resentment to build and fester, only to be expressed within the relationship in unhelpful communication patterns such as stonewalling, defensiveness, criticism and contempt – what Gottman calls the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.  If those patterns are prevalent in your relationship, I highly suggest you seek to resolve the underlying conflict(s) which are driving them – or the end of the relationship may be nigh.

What does conflict resolution look like?  I don’t believe there is a perfect answer to this question.  However, it certainly starts with clear honest communication (more on honesty in Secret 5 below).  And, clear communication begins with an exercise I encourage couples to use – Reflective Listening.  This is a style of communicating that slows down the process and helps keep the couple on the same track.  I wrote a short article describing how it works – here.  I strongly encourage couples to use this technique if they find that their disagreements spiral quickly in to heated verbal arguments.  Reflective Listening will assist you in avoiding the pitfalls of miscommunication and help you move toward realistic resolutions – exemplified by validation of each partner’s experience and commitment to specific changes moving forward.


""Women marry men hoping they will change. Men marry women hoping they will not. So each is inevitably disappointed."" — Albert Einstein, German physicist


2. Similar Values

I encourage anyone who wants to be married to date with the intention of marriage.  I understand the desire of people to date in order to gain access to sex or low-commitment good times, but if you have the desire to be in a lifelong marriage at some point, I simply encourage you to keep that notion front and center when you date.  If you do not, you are rolling dice on your potential partner.  You might get lucky and find a sexually attractive person that has similar values to you, although you might not know until some years later.  More often, couples find themselves in a long-term relationship which began out of pure sexual attraction, only to discover there are vast differences between their values down the line.  This isn’t insurmountable, but it does present a significant challenge to us, and means the couple will need a lot of Secret 4 below.

In order to avoid the struggle of being married to someone with vastly different values, learn who your potential partner is up front.  My rule of thumb is that this process takes about 6 months.  Active dating over that period of time will present enough stressors to help us discover who the person is that we are dating.  Of course, we should also actively assess areas of value too.

That means discussing many topics with your potential partner.  Do you want children, do they want children?  How would you raise them?  Would you engage in corporal punishment or not?  Would you want to teach them a specific religion or spirituality?  What about political notions?  Work ethic?  Community support?  The list goes on.  Ultimately, think about what you hold dear in your heart and find out if your partner feels similarly.  It’s not a deal-breaker if there are differences.  But, it’s information you should have before you decide if you want to partner up for life.  The truth is that marriage is much easier when the couple share similar values.  


“Before you marry a person you should first make them use a computer with slow internet to see who they really are.” – Will Ferrell, American Actor/comedian


3. Genuine Friendship 

Imagine for a moment what your relationship is like between you and your best friend (who is not your spouse).  How do you interact with this person?  What leeway do you give them when they behave poorly?  What motivations do you ascribe to their actions?  What do you admire about your best friend?

My guess is that many people relate to their best friend much differently than they relate to their partner.  There is reason for this of course – we aren’t as enmeshed in the relationship with our best friend as we are with our spouse.  The added emotional distance with our friend allows for more rationality, more objectivity and more realism.  Are you jealous when your best friend finds someone attractive?  Not likely.

I’m not suggesting we have the same type of relationship with our spouse as we have with our best friend.  But, what I am suggesting is that a secret to a lifelong marriage is genuine friendship.  If we relate to our spouse as a cherished friend, we can see them more fully for who they are and appreciate their unique qualities much more readily.  We find more admiration toward them, and we forgive their faults more easily.

We tend to give to our best friend, without expecting a completely equitable return.  When our best friend is having an event and invites us, we are more likely to show up, even if we don’t really feel like going.  In a lifelong marriage, we need to be “showing up” for our partner, even when it’s difficult and even when we feel hurt.  There is something about friendship which allows us to give a bit more than we take.  Finding true friendship with your spouse will help you give.


""To keep your marriage brimming, with love in the loving cup, whenever you're wrong, admit it; whenever you're right, shut up."" — Ogden Nash, American poet


4. Emotional Maturity 

Recognizing our own poor behavior is a hallmark of emotional maturity.  Often in relationships people become locked into their perspective, feeling justified for poor behavior, and this makes change virtually impossible.  We need to be able to own our part of the process and accept that we can do better as well.  Pushing conflicts off on to our partner and blaming them in our minds only serves to reinforce the patterns we want desperately to improve.

Developing emotional maturity takes time and courage.  It’s painful to see our own poor behavior.  It’s easier to imagine we are merely responding to that which has been done to us.  If our partner would just stop X,Y,Z then we wouldn’t be rude or dismissive in response.  Altering this tendency takes the courage of asking ourselves how we can be better.  It takes a strength of will to acknowledge and accept our own faults.  The good news is that positive change in your life will benefit you no matter what happens in your marriage.  By growing and maturing as a human you will be better equipped to relate to people in general.

One way you can develop emotional maturity is by engaging in genuine apologies to your partner when you have behaved poorly.  A genuine apology states that you see what you did, that you understand your behavior was inappropriate/poor/wrong and that you wish to be forgiven for the transgression.  If does not defend or give justifications for why you behaved the way you did.  The apology simply owns the behavior, requests forgiveness and promises to do better in the future.  It’s simple, but emotionally difficult for many people.  That’s where the emotional maturity comes in – providing the strength to confront our own frailties.  Practice it with small issues and it will become easier with heavier conflicts.


""Marriage is like a game of chess, except the board is flowing water, the pieces are made of smoke and no move you make will have any effect on the outcome."" — Jerry Seinfeld, American comedian


5. Capacity to Hold Uncomfortable Truth

I think back to the old television show House M.D.  The fictional character Dr. Gregory House was famous for saying and assuming that everyone lies.  It was a precept for him.  It informed his decision-making and was frequently a piece of the puzzle for solving difficult medical cases.  Everyone lies.  Start there as a launching point to this secret of a lifelong happy marriage.

I strongly believe it’s best to tell the truth, especially to our spouse.  That said, the reality is that lies are told in marriages all the time, and they can lead toward a spoiled relationship.  What do we do about it?  It’s too easy to simply say “don’t lie to your spouse.”  What I encourage couples to do, instead, is to better understand what motivated the lie.  Generally speaking, a lie is told in a marriage out of fear.  One partner lies to hide what I call an “uncomfortable truth” from their spouse.  They fear hurting the relationship or perhaps simply hurting the feelings of their spouse.  Thus, they hide parts of themselves, believing they are protecting the marriage or spouse.

However, a lifelong happy marriage needs to be able to hold uncomfortable truths without disintegrating.  In order for this to develop and strengthen, couples will need the kind of emotional maturity we discussed above.  And, when we are able to share uncomfortable truth with our spouse, leaning into it, our relationship can deepen, becoming richer and more intimate.  

As an exercise to develop a stronger container for truth in the relationship I suggest you sit down with your spouse and reveal something very small that is uncomfortable but true.  Ask your spouse to reciprocate.  To encourage them to participate I suggest you say something along these lines to your spouse – “I want you to feel safe enough to be honest with me, and I commit to being strong enough to accept what is true without leaving or judging.”  Again, I suggest you do this will very small aspects of your lives together.  Build up a tolerance for uncomfortable truth and ultimately it will not feel as threatening.  But do be cautious about jumping into the deep end of the pool on this secret to a happy marriage.  There is very real risk involved in opening up about things your partner does not know.  For the long term, a relationship that can hold uncomfortable truth stands a much better chance of thriving, so I do believe developing an environment of safety is in order to foster this.

6. Forgiveness and Allowance for Change

True forgiveness must be on the table for both spouses in a lifelong happy marriage.  Couples that struggle with moving on from conflict frequently foster an environment in which grace is withheld.  A spouse that behaved poorly gets trapped by their partner’s inability or unwillingness to offer a path to redemption.  

When a past transgression is brought up over and over, in the face of genuine apologies, it’s impossible for the spouse who transgressed to change.  Their partner is not willing to move forward.  Sometimes this can be warranted for a bit of time, but typically, when a genuine apology is given, the offended spouse has the onus on them to be willing to negotiate a path to forgiveness.  

Until that path is apparent, the spouse who transgressed is pigeon-holed by their partner.  The relationship also tends to stop growing, and in many cases can become regressive.  If one spouse believes their partner is not capable of changing, then the relationship can become toxic.

In order to offer forgiveness, many folks want proof that their spouse won’t transgress again in the future.  They want a guarantee that it won’t happen again.  Without that evidence they are not willing to forgive.  The trouble with this is that it can become a self-fulfilling prophecy.  The offended spouse will perceive their partner’s behavior through the lens of transgression, rather than a forward-looking lens of growth.  And, the transgressing spouse will be seen as incapable of change, further reinforcing the offended spouse’s internal messages about their partner.  

Forgiveness is about letting go and offering genuine love.  Holding on to grudges within a marriage will weigh it down severely.  In important ways, forgiving is for the spouse who was transgressed.  By offering up forgiveness they allow themselves to put down the burdens of anger and resentment.  They feel better, lighter.  It’s a mental shift in which they no longer feel the need to hold on to the negative emotions related to the transgression.  The secondary benefit is that it allows their partner to change, and thus allows for the relationship to change as well.


“Keep your eyes wide open before marriage, half shut afterwards.” – Benjamin Franklin, American Founding Father


7. Commitment to the Partnership

A marriage is a strong bond between people.  Yet, it benefits greatly from an intentional commitment by the partners.  We have romantic ideas that true love will be enough, or that passion and intimacy are the salves that will heal all wounds in the relationship.  

The truth is that a marital relationship takes work to maintain.  We cannot simply hope for the best and tell ourselves that “if it’s meant to be, it will be.”  That line of thinking allows for all sorts of issues to crop up, building over time until the marriage crumbles.  Instead, we should intentionally nurture the relationship and make the internal choice to be committed to the health of our marriage.

There will be ups and downs in a lifelong marriage.  To meet the challenges we must stay engaged and be vigilant, actively seeking ways to improve and grow.  We demonstrate this commitment by making time for our spouse and expressing love in a way they feel it.  We demonstrate it by seeking to understand them and appreciate them, as well as accept them.

We must rise to the occasion when needed, not shrink due to fear or sadness.  In a lifelong marriage you will need to put your relationship above many other things.  There will come times when your partner needs you desperately, or perhaps you need them.  Your commitment to the bond must endure so that when the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune arrive, you have a deep well of support to provide or draw upon.

It will take a great deal of commitment and love to overcome some of the most challenging experiences a couple might face.  Without this sense of commitment, it will be tough to make it through those times together.  But, knowing this now, we can choose to put our heart and soul into the relationship.  We can make the choice to fully commit, and in return have a full commitment from our spouse.  I encourage you to make that choice, then live that commitment each and every day.


“I love being married. It’s so great to find that one special person you want to annoy for the rest of your life.” – Rita Rudner, American comedian


What Do We Do Now?

No relationship is perfect.  There is always room to grow and improve.  Even people who have been happily married for 30 years can find ways to strengthen and deepen their bond.  For those who are currently in a rough patch, take heart.  You are not alone.

That said, I do understand that many relationships are in dire straits, on the verge of collapse or divorce.  I assume many of you are looking for answers, seeking a way back to the fulfilling relationship you once experienced.  

My best advice is to take an honest inventory of these 7 “secrets.”  Assess where you have challenges and where you don’t.  Look as objectively as possible at your own behavior.  We say it takes two to tango.  However, it only takes one to detangle the knots in the marriage.  If just one person in the relationship decides to dance to a different tune, their partner is forced to start new patterns.  You can be the catalyst for positive change in your marriage.

Take one secret per day and do something to improve it.  Maybe Sundays are the days you actively schedule alone time with your partner.  Wednesday might be the day you work on developing more emotional maturity.  Work on something from the list each day for 2 full weeks, then take another objective look at the marriage.  It’s quite likely you will feel better, as well as your spouse.  Consider this my 2-week challenge to work toward a lifelong happy marriage.

You can also seek professional help from a marriage counselor.  I do a great deal of couples therapy, and I see immense benefit in having an objective outside observer to assist in slowing down the process and detangling the painful patterns playing out in the relationship.  There are many excellent counselors.  Try searching online or request referrals from your insurance company.  Read the websites and look for someone that states they specialize in marital counseling.  Feel free to reach out to me with questions or concerns.  I am happy to see how I can help.

There is a large segment of the population which dates based on  commonalities, like shared interests and values, and qualities of a  person. The supply of websites/apps that target this segment has shrunk  considerably, probably because Silicon valley nerds have very little  originality and are just chasing the previously hot app (Tinder).

So basically there's a situation at work, I've generally been looking to meet new people with intentions of getting to know them and maybe see if a relationship can come out of it. And to put it plainly there are 3 people here, 

person A -  I've met and find very very attractive but due to them always being surrounded by others in her department, there hasn't been much of a chance to talk with, besides that it's mostly been just saying hi, and taking a glance whenever she's nearby, and i had the chance when we both had a lunch to have a short conversation, I've also been able to ask for her phone number and ask if she wanted to hangout and maybe check out a place to eat, to which while texting and making small talk mentioned how she was talking to someone and it was ""pretty serious"" which a few weeks later when I asked said it didn't work out or something across those lines, from there I didn't really text her as much and I think i've asked twice in total if she wanted to meet up outside of work to which both times said she wasn't free to. from there i've noticed that there's been a few times she looks over. but i haven't talked with her as much. would there be a chance she's hoping i do more?

person B i've noticed them rushing around the store and have taken an interest in, also they work in an area where you can talk 1 on 1 better so I've often been able to grab us both a water bottle and go see her when I get some time either at lunch or after work, also I'm been sometimes nervous to talk with her since she's cute but it's also comfortable and fun which is a good balance I guess. so it's been something I look forward to. while we do talk often and i always check to see if I'm not getting in the way of her work she mostly seems fine to see me, while talking to her while working she said she mentioned that she could take a break and we went to the cafe to try out some snacks, we had a nice conversation and i got to tell a few stories and it went past 15 minutes probably 30-40 to which she said that she could stick around for 5 minutes before going back, so this looks good so far i guess. i asked for her phone number and while texting not my thing i've had a better ""conversation"" with her than i usually do with people, and besides that, i asked her if she was free after work to which she said she couldn't but that on Thursday she was free.

person c is a co worker from my department that has been very friendly, and we both look forward to when they put us next to each other which gives us a chance to talk or joke around, she laughs at most of my jokes and while we don't have many conversations getting to know each other better, we both have a good time making small talk or laughing, after a while she seemed to be getting more if the right word is intimate by coming over to my side to tap my arm or lean her head on my arm or just going for a hug, but i've noticed she's like this with others, and a few times she was able to give me a ride half way home when my car was at the mechanic, recently while playing a game online with her, her friend kinda blurts out something from earlier today that ""we both like each other"" to which she made her be quiet and i said i needed to think and that we should probably talk in person next chance we get. While it's true that i think she's great and i'd consider a relationship with her, and her being more personal made me like her more, I'm not as attracted to her as the other people before.

my feelings are a bit conflicted, and up to this point i've made sure to respect everyone here, and not do anything wrong. but I'm going to have to make a choice; even more so now with recent stuff. and i don't exactly know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR - I've been looking for a relationship, and to this point, just at work alone there's been three people that I've been getting to know, but now one of them and their friend told me she likes me, so now i gotta get a better idea of what to do, i find person A very very attractive but we haven't/don't talk much and they haven't been free to hangout. Person B i find cute and is great to talk with and i look forward and enjoy being with them and has been able to find some time to talk and hangout with me. and person C is not as much my type but is really nice and they laugh at all my jokes, and shows interest by leaning on my shoulder or holding my arm.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,839077,public,self,Don't Know What To Do,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o04pgg/dont_know_what_to_do/,all_ads,6,,,,,

He was the one who put in all the effort, so I decided to ask him out on a 4th date and he ghosted me. I went on way more dates than I wish I had over quarantine and he was the only one I really liked. 

A couple of months ago in April, he messaged me on LinkedIn (we weren’t connected) and asked how I’ve been and wanted to see me. I didn’t reply. Then he DMd through his friends IG (he doesn’t have social media) saying to text him if I was still interested. 

Me: so what made you reach out after all this time?

Him: Realization.  I got into something serious after our dates, and I wanted to see where it went, which is why I stopped texting you.  Sorry I left you hanging, I should’ve let you know.  

That something serious didn’t work out, at which point you popped into my head because I realized hanging out with you was a lot of fun. I can’t say exactly what I’m looking for, but I’m down to find out, and I promise I won’t leave you in the dark going forward (If you are even still interested, that is)

I told him I didn’t want to be a rebound and wished him the best of luck. He said he understood and told me not to be a stranger if I was bored one of these nights.

Two weeks later, I texted him asking if he was free. We ended up seeing each other from end of april until last week. 

He initiated 95% of the plans. He told me he liked me more than I think he does. He held my hand. Took me to a friend’s party. Etc.

It’s been 9 days since we last saw each other and I’m not the type to confront people, but my friends and therapist say I should. As much as a like him, I know I deserve better and don’t want to see him again. But I do want to let him know that what he did was an asshole move. 

I want to stand up for myself and tell him that if he didn’t have any intention of anything serious, then he should’ve said so and not left me in the dark like he said he wouldn’t.

She was one of the most beautiful girls I had ever been with, but later on in our friendship I was coerced on a daily basis to try and get into a relationship with her and she became more and more needier.

I always knew that she and I would not workout due to the differences in our personality despite us vibing together very well ( I really wanted a relationship, but at the same time I'm not in the right mental state). If there are a lot of red flags/things you do not like about that person in the beginning of the friendship, they will most likely still be there at the end of the friendship.

Because of the nature of friends with benefits, I began to develop semi-feelings for her and she still was a friend who I liked/thought highly of. She for sure caught feelings for me also because of it. Luckily for me I dodged that bullet of getting into a relationship with her.

A month later she is in a relationship with a different person, so she probably knew the red flags with me, but just really wanted to get into a relationship with someone/have some sort of companionship(it is all over her social media now). 

If you're ever doubting yourself about wanting to get into a relationship with someone, look at the good and the bad and do not use someone's looks (OR SEX or just companionship because you're lonely as a reason why you should get into a relationship.)

I'm so far beyond infuriated with dating, I don't even know where to start. I have never been so unsure/lost/defeated about anything that's not dating in my late 20's. I am honestly completely defeated. 

I have had such little success with dating these past 2-3 years compared to my early 20's and I don't understand why. I used to not give a shit about anything and I hated life, yet had no problems attracting women. Now I've got my shit together and have an actual awesome life worth sharing yet nobody to share it with. Good job, good money, good values. Semi-attractive, adventurous, fit, confident in myself, outgoing. I put myself out there, try to approach women I find attractive in public, and initiate conversation on dating apps. I'm not perfect, but I expected someone that matches my lifestyle to be interested. (I have lowered my standards and it doesn't last. I always feel like I'm worth a better match). 

I want to not care about being single, but it's been years of this and I really don't want to die alone. I'm a social person and can't be by myself for long periods of time. Don't get me wrong, I do like myself when I'm alone, and I spend most of my time doing things I love too. I'm just so fucking tired of being passed on time after time after time when I have so much to offer. So much support and love to give, yet nobody is willing to give me a shot.

As we all know, relationships come with ups and downs and right now we’re in a down. Let me preface this by saying, there is a setting on iphone in the privacy settings, that if you turn off location services, it will make it so your location says “location not available” instead of actually stopping sharing locations. We share locations for safety reasons and just for convinience. Well recently, that setting has been turning off at…weird times. Its happened 3 times, she says she doesnt know how it turned off, which i believed the first couple times bc sometimes one of my settings will randomly turn off. But its the times that it happens. For example, a couple days ago she was planning on going to her friends house, which she didnt tell me about until one of her friends told me(she says its bc she wasnt going). But anyways, i told her i wasn’t comfortable with it bc i had no idea who the friend was, and it is in a VERY bad part of town. She said understood, and said goodnight. Shortly after, i saw that “location not available”. It was off for a couple days, then i asked for her phone today to see if it was off, and it was. She said she doesn’t know how, that was the 3rd time. Then later today when she said shes taking a nap it happened again, only to turn back on right when she woke up. So basically the point is, im having these intrusive thoughts that she’s doing something behind my back. Not cheating per say, but something. She has lied to me exactly 4 times(that i know of) in our 2 year relationship. about small things, like did she finish her schoolwork for uni, or did she eat. But she never lies about big or important things. So i trust her for the most part, but ive been cheated on before so i have bad trust issues. I don’t know if i should talk to her about this or if i should just leave it alone because im overthinking. I know communication is key, but like i said we’re not in the best spot right now. So i think accusing her of doing something behind my back probably isnt the best thing to do.

While some strict dating site (such as millionairematch.com) does everything possible to verify the individual posting there is always potential for abuse. You should also remember that you only want to meet friends or potential dating partners IF you have some things in common. 

In order to find the things in common it is advisable to message or email each other until a comfort level is established. Remember you will learn so many things by evaluating the written word of the person you contact or one who contacts you. Watch for things such as demeanor, wanting a quick meeting and/or requesting too much personal information such as address, telephone number, place of employment, etc. It is best to be honest at first but very general in personal information. If you do eventually feel comfortable about that first meeting make certain you do so in a public place. It is never advisable to go to a home for a first meeting. Make certain you have made family or friends aware of the meeting place and time and also provide some information as to person you are meeting such as screen name and this site information.

While the majority of people may have good intentions, in this day and age, safety is of the utmost importance. Also remember if the person you are talking with is sincere they too should feel the same way about being cautious.

Having been on a handful of dating apps, the best and worst app I’ve tried is Group Me. Yes, an app that gained popularity for university students during the pandemic primarily as a means to cheat on courses—and in my case—finding the one. 

About eight months ago, I found myself responding to a handful of introduction Discussion Posts for my Race and Racism class. One post in particular caught my eye. A vegan girl that was into movies just as much as I was. She talked about the handful of pets she had and the movies she would buy. Who buys movies in this day and age, well, besides me, I thought. 

I found her on the class’ Group Me chat and sent her a PM. I asked for help on an assignment I had already finished. She didn’t respond. A day went by, she had yet to read my message. I messaged her again this time asking if she was the vegan girl that likes movies. At this moment I thought, what’s the worst thing that can happen, she’ll say don’t message me—I would later find out that that indeed that would hurt more than I originally thought. 

To my delight, however, I quickly received a response. “Yes! are you vegan?” she asked.
     “I am!” I replied. a few back and forth messages and I managed to get her number luring her with a vegan Mac and Cheese recipe. 

The days flew by and I had replaced my Tik Tok addiction with her. I woke up to Good morning texts that would be punctuated by emoji flowers. She asked for my Instagram then found me on Twitter . 

I was delighted. So much attention, so much in common I saw the world in pink. Sorry for the corniness, but she was awesome! I still have. a special place in my heart for her. 

Back to the story. She explained her past traumas and problems with stalkers. Hundreds of heart emojis and empty lovey-dovey phrases later and it was time to meet. 

Being in the middle of a pandemic and with a 40 minute driving distance we knew it would be a challenge but it was okay. Now, mind you I have all this in mind I’m being extra cautious and she’s giving me the cheat codes for our in person meeting. She mentions several times that she’s very perceptive. 

She decides vegan tacos and the theater, drive-in theater. The big day comes my covid test came back negative and I’m ready. I buy her a box of Mexican candy, vegan of course and head down there. 

All I could think about was don’t fuck this up don’t fuck this up don’t fuck this up. I get to the meeting point and she gets dropped off by her mom I hold open the door for her. She’s gorgeous! I really believe we both wanted it to work out but in the end the expectations were not met. 

I was shy, couldn’t keep my gaze and was distant. Aside from the fact that I was over worked, stressed, and grieving the loss of my dog, I had a mild anxiety attack and froze. I detached emotionally. 

I had her look up the directions to the drive-in on her phone, skipped the tacos, and essentially avoided those intensely-beautiful penetrating eyes of hers. I just felt them burning a whole in my soul. 

The funny thing is she said she was afraid she would freeze. She said she never goes on dates because she shuts down and can’t find anything to say. She said she was afraid she’d be awkward and the awkward one was me. 

The thing is I have been on successful past dates with girls I had little interest in and knew little about. With her I knew a lot she knew a lot yet in the end it wasn’t enough. 

I went home she texted me and thanked me. I fell asleep and woke up to the sound of my alarm instead of her good morning texts. I went to work no text from her a few days passed and I could feel the distance. 

I texted her, left a voice message, and finally she hit me with, we should just be friends. Then that escalated to don’t text me and finally blocked we only had Group Me left. I admit I overdid the texting I dug myself deeper trying to fix what was never broken simply I couldn’t accept not having what we had before the date. I focused on my school work and tried to distract myself and finally in a moment of clarity I realized that it was all the illusion of a hopeless romantic. Thinking back I hated how I reacted because I freaked out a girl that already had past issues with stalkers I don’t regret the experience because I learned a lot about myself and things I need to get right with me before I date again. 

If you’ve read this far, thank you, and if there is anything to take away from this it is: learn your attachment style and remember to not create fantasies in our head about what has yet to happened. I don’t intend on ever contacting this person as I’ve deleted every reminder of her from my life.

(And it’s not that I’ve had over 30 sex partners by the age of 19… I already knew that). By the time I was 19, I had given over 30 men of all different races, ages (17-42 years old), and backgrounds the opportunity to go out with me. Every man I’ve pursued, I let them take the lead after they showed interest in me. 

I don’t regret my decisions, but I just realized something awful. Not a single one took me on an actual date the first time we went out. Starting in high school and continuing on to college and places I’ve worked, every man I’ve been with (yeah…over 30+ men) essentially just wanted to fuck me. After that, I’d typically break it off. I’m not opposed to sex. But why would I want to continue to see someone who doesn’t even have the decency to ask me to dinner before requesting I strip? 

I didn’t do anything at the beginning  that suggested I just wanted to have sex. In fact, I’m pretty sure I was clear with many of them that I was hoping we could go out. But on every first official “date” I’ve been taken on, I was rushed straight into the bedroom. Or asked to give a blowjob in a car. Disrobe on a couch… etc, etc, etc. Nobody even took me out to watch the sunset first or anything. I understand that I could’ve said no. I’m not playing victim here. I’m just making an observation. 

And this now shapes my opinion of men. I’m pretty certain at this point that unless I specifically ask for it, or even demand it, I’ll never be taken on a first date. I’ll just be taken straight home.


Edit/ honestly, if I met a man that took me to dinner and said he didn’t want to have sex on the first date, he wants to get to know me!

I wasn’t over my ex, who I was very emotionally tied to and ended up back together with him (I know I know…) and my tinder guy and I eventually went our separate ways. Even though we were apart, I thought about him all of the time and I felt like I really messed things up between us because we got along great. Time went on and I  reconnected with him about two weeks ago and we hung out, which I was very excited about since I feel like he is awesome. He drove to my house and we went to grab late night coffee and watched a movie at my place. Nothing happened just a movie (which if you’re curious, was Stand By Me) and a drive to grab coffee. We stayed up until about 3am and he finally left and basically told me “I’ll hit you up later yeah?” And “we should hang out again sometime”…. It really made me feel like I was a casual thing for him and i didn’t know the next time I would see him.
We talk here and there or whenever he slides up on my story to laugh or make a remark but that’s about it. My thoughts are that he’s not that interested in me, because if he was he would make more of an effort? But, the same can me said for me since I am the one who split us up in the first place and maybe it’s me who should be making an effort… thoughts? 

To continue, earlier this evening him and I began to exchange flirts and kinda both agreed that we have wanted to do this for awhile but haven’t made the move. He then asks when we can hangout this week and my first thoughts are he wants to hookup. I don’t want to assume, but it seems like this is where we are going since it seems everything about us is very casual, hangouts at 12am, feelings over text… how should I go about this or should I just drop it completely and move onto the next? Is he really even interested? 

More info on our movie night, we had plans to hangout at that evening at about 6 and just completely lagged, forgot his keys in another car which was 15 minutes away, forgot his wallet in the same car which he drove back to get…again, and then waited at home for some guy to buy some car thing at his house and then drove over to me at about 11 o’clock at night… I should’ve said no to us hanging out but I was trying to be understanding.

Anyway, I’d love some feedback/ advice on what you would do or a feel from an outsider looking in. 

Thanks for reading!

I've been trying to take her out to do very unique and adventurous things to keep her from getting bored since she seems to have dated a lot more people than I have. We've gone on a couple road trips to do nature hikes and she seems to like that. She's also mentioned that other family members and friends have actual cameras to capture the views of the outdoors.

I know a bit about cameras and I found this nice mirrorless digital camera kit for a little over $1,000. I can say it's an early birthday present or a ""Christmas in July"" type of thing, and that she can use it for all our adventures we're going to have.

I just thought I'd get that out of the way so we could possibly explain why and what I'm about to say

Alright some years ago (8th-9th Grade) I would go on YouTube and look up dating advice. Stuff like how to get girls to like you?, do girls like skinny guys?, do girls like nerds?, etc. A lot of the time I didn't really like some of the stuff that I was hearing. Sometimes I would even look at videos like this find ""NO"" as an answer to questions mentioned prior. And even more of the some of the stuff they would say would be down right bad and INCREDIBLY generalizing towards women. They would say stuff like women want to and are to be dominated cuz that's what they want, I can't be vulnerable in any way around women or they will view you as weak, do you have to be the most dominant person in the room and at all times, and women are entirely biological beings, and pretty much that you would expect to hear from self-proclaimed alpha male frat boy.

And it really hit me how absolutely terrible advice this was for me was videos like ""How to get a Girlfriend if You're a Hopless Nerd, By Videojug"" (I'm cringing just writing out that title). Now it may have been satirical, but it reflected a lot of if not almost all of the exact same stuff that you would hear from guys like Jose Zuniga, How To Beast, even some of those Based Zeus more recent content. So I'm not against good exercise and staying healthy and fit. Should I work out quite regularly, but I still prefer to keep my slim figure cuz I am bisexual and I usually prefer to be the skinnier one in my relationships (with men or women). And to be honest I started taking doing exercise and trying to work out so I can get girls in that was it. That was going to take up some sort of sport as well but luckily one of those YouTubers gave me some advice about don't take up any specific Hobbies good jobs just to get girls because they could see through that. I know I know sounds incredibly freaking stupid. But remember I was 14-16 when I was doing this.

I don't deny that some of the advice that they said was helpful. But it wasn't until recently I realized that I REALLY shouldn't be taking advice from these type of guys. And it was when I actually use some of the stuff they're saying to to get with girls. When I was I never said I wasn't even attracting the kind of girls that are light and realize that the one girl that I did like you wasn't with me she wasn't somebody who I wanted to be with. Every time I was around her is this totally different person, and I HATED it. I didn't enjoy I got out with the people that I was being hit with the cool crowd I didn't like who they were either.

A few days ago I matched with this girl on Tinder. I never put a lot of stock into these matches because, well, it's Tinder. But conversation was nice and we got each other's IG's. On IG we talked for about an hour and then she stopped replying

She came back the next day and seemed excited to talk to me. She asked me out and suggested a place we could go. I said I would love to go there and she stopped replying again

The day after THAT (yesterday) I sent her a video about something we had talked about and she hasn't opened it yet until today. 

I know she's on IG viewing stories because she viewed mine but I find this radio silence a bit odd after she was the one that asked me out (and also sent the first message on Tinder)
