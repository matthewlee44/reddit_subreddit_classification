And I’m not talking about fuck buddies…that’s completely different. But I keep seeing people say I want more than being a FWB or I’m worth more than that. But what is that something “more”? Is it just exclusivity? And can FWB be exclusive? 

Dating over 40 is so different…many of us have been married and have families, friends, and a life of our own so what is your “end game” as someone over 40? Marriage? Because I think someone’s “end game” in their 30’s is completely different than ours.

2,tbujy9,1647018013,What’s your post-first date communication style?,"You have a date, it’s great, how do you communicate afterwards:

- Do you wait to hear from them?
- Do you text first? If so, how long do you wait?


I know there are a lot of conversations about texting on here but often it relates to people wanting advice about specific scenarios.

If I’ve had a great date, I’ve always texted pretty much when I’ve got home or the next day to say ‘hey, I had a great date, let’s do it again’ - and I’ve often texted first (I’m f45).

But I was talking to a female friend (48) and she said she still believes the man should text first and she will never text first. Her theory is that it’s the only way to be sure he’s genuinely into you.

I’ve always asked people out and had some great relationships along the way and some great flings.

Of course, there have been rejections too… 

My friend is as surprised by my approach as I am by hers. 

Would love to hear your takes. Do you have “communication rules”? If so, what are they?

3,tbvyhd,1647021652,Have you Played the Red Flag Game?,"I have been on Hinge now almost a week.  Most of the men will communicate a few times back and forth.  Never ask me any questions and only talk about themselves.  Even then its a big SNORE.  

So I was very intrigued when a man asked if I wanted to play “the red flag game”.  We were to take turns sharing our red flags.  

First it is important to note he had a few things I considered at least pink flags on his profile.  Yet, I still liked him because I found him attractive.  

The first being a tattoo of a gun on his neck.   (I let this go because I am personally covered in tattoos, but the gun image was a little out of my comfort zone. Especially as it was drawn pointing to his chin. 
It was hard for me to look at the tattoo and not immediately think about suicide. 

Second, pictures of himself with beautiful women.  One picture is fine but almost all of his were him standing with a hot woman from his tattoo parlor.  I was not chose to look past this, again because I found him attractive.

Third, the marijuana symbol was clicked for yes.  Nothing against this but it is always something I discuss because I don’t smoke pot. 

The game began with what we thought were pink flags, then crimson, then red.  I figured why not, it was more what “felt like” discussion than anyone else had offered.  In the end this was not a quality discussion, more like a “sharing of information”.

His red flags were unlike anyone I have ever met before.  My jaw was continuously dropping to the floor.  I had a hard time competing! Lol.

I don’t know why we kept the conversation going, I guess we were both laughing and having fun.  We both agreed early on we were in no way compatible except for sex.  However, in the end we decided against even sex due to logistics and differences in environmental cleanliness. Meaning, his bed is not one I would ever sit on. 

I was thankful to get right to the nitty gritty rather than continue communication and have gradual surprises.

Here are just a few of the red flags.  

He wanted to go first with a pink flag.  He said, “I have ten children.”  

I texted, “jaw dropped…lol.” He is 38, I am 48.

Then he said, “wait for it….from five different women”.

(Crickets)

Part of the game is we could not comment we had to just take our turn.  After remembering the hell I went through with last boyfriend’s crazy ex wife and picturing this scenario with five exes….(oh hell no) I shared my less interesting pink flag.  

Here are just a few of his red flags.

addicted to pain meds for back pain 

believes antidepressants are a way for the government to control people (i am on antidepressant, i guess i am controlled, lol) 

a felon for disturbance with a gun (remembering neck tattoo of gun)

warrant out for his arrest in the state i live in (he lives just over state line from me)

no drivers license

he gets along with two of the exes and talks to one of the two daily, the other three hate him and make his life difficult. 

he believes in pizza gate, that the world is not round, there is no gravity, we have political differences, aliens are here, (he did not lump these together of course, but i see them as all a similar red flag) 

he used to sell drugs 

he has more of a police record than the one felony

Thats just a few.

After the game we discussed the flags.  I say discuss loosely because he never asked me even one question about any of my red flags.  Hell, he never asked me even one question about myself, my likes, dislikes or anything at all.  (Never a good sign and points to a personality disorder like narcissist or sociopath) 

After a while I asked him why he was not asking me any questions.  He said, “if i had a concern about any of your flags i would ask, don’t worry.  If I want to know something I will ask.”  In other words, its all about him. 

He totally missed the point.  (I can not stress enough how big of a bad sign it is for myself if the man or woman is not asking questions.  it could be the opposite and they ask a million questions and come off as agreeing to everything i say, feigning interest, also known as love bombing).  

Communication should be as reciprocal as possible. Asking questions about one another is   essential to me.  Yet, this is the most common thing lacking with OLD or even meeting a man in every day life that I have noticed. 

So essentially I listened to him get all his red flags off his chest, shared mine to what felt like communicating with a wall.  

The whole experience was bizarre.  However, I learned that my own colored flags may not be as terrible as I thought.   

I am considering taking this game and using it when I begin talking online with another man.  It was a great way to see if he had ability to show empathy, reflect, make insights into his own life choices and mine.  

Lets just say he failed miserably in every way at his own game, except for one thing…honesty.  If anything, he was incredibly honest.  

However, for all of these flags I imagine there are more distressing things not shared because as we know there always are.  I would never believe he is an honest person knowing everything he told me. 

We have messaged one another a few more times discussing dating sites and other pretty much pointless banter.  No hard feelings that we are not a match and we both move on.  

Do you think I dodged a bullet here? Lol!

So far on the dating apps, it's been an immediate ""no"" when I see that name again. But maybe that's a little extreme. Like perhaps I could just come up with a nickname for the new lady? It's not an uncommon name.

I have two good friends from my 20's who were in a relationship- ""John"" and ""Joanna."" They broke up, and within a few years John would marry a new Joanna and Joanna would marry a new John.

9,tc4jzs,1647045931,I’ll never be satisfied.,"I married a smart guy, a surgeon. He loved me very much but I didn’t. We got a divorce after 7 years of our marriage. I thought I wasn’t happy with him because I was not physically attracted to him. 

I got a boyfriend I’m super attracted to. He has a good job. But I couldn’t take his short temper and also our conversation wasn’t interesting/very dry. He works at banking industry yet I didn’t find him intelligent. He wasn’t a curious person. We broke up after 1.5 years. 

And I got another boyfriend whom I’m physically attracted to, I can have a good conversation with and he has a decent job (an engineer). He was super nice and kind to me like my ex husband. I could feel that he cares for me. I didn’t like that he didn’t take initiative to take the relationship to the next level or be aggressive in his career. We broke up after 2.5 years. (We lived together for 2 years.. Honestly I can’t say if I could say yes if he proposed to me) 

I’m aggressive in my career and I am a goal oriented person. Always do something productive, which tires me out but I just keep myself productive otherwise I’ll feel useless and depressed. I don’t like that about myself. 

Looking back, besides my first boyfriend after my divorce, my ex husband and my last boyfriend was super nice to me for no reason. After breaking up with my first boyfriend, I realize that I’ll never meet anyone who cares about me like my ex husband did, then I met my second boyfriend but I still wasn’t happy. 

Now I know it’s me who has issues. I look at happy couples or families at a cafe and they make my heart warm and happy but I know I won’t be happy if that was my relationship or my family because I’m just not satisfied or content. I hate myself about it. I always look for what’s missing. I try to appreciate what I have but it’s difficult. 

Im not dating anyone because I know it doesn’t matter who it is, happiness won’t last 6 months and I’ll start seeing what isn’t going well.  

I wish I was a different person. One of those people who is content and happy… 

It’s easier to control my emotion when I’m being single because most of it is within my control. But when I’m with someone, it frustrates me due to the expectation. People tell me don’t expect much but it’s difficult to drop it. I had to break up with my last boyfriend because the expectation I have of him bothered me so much and it makes me say mean things that I don’t mean. I felt relieved after a break up.

Thoughts?  

Looks like we're headed toward if you have any reported history of violence, you should be removed from the dating pool and just give up.  Dating is a privilege that only those with clean records (which is bs anyway, a clean record doesn't mean you haven't done anything bad).  I'm not so sure I'm comfortable with that.

This one is different than the other two. We had fantastic chemistry right from the start. Things have been accelerating at a faster pace than I really want, and I'm trying to figure out whether or not this is something worth pursuing more intentionally. I posted last week on DO50 about going for a slow burn rather than an incendiary spark, but here I am again. The incendiary spark is winning, as I cut it off with the slow burn possibility this week. It was just moving too slowly, and I honestly think she was not that interested.

In the past when I've gone for the big spark, things have inevitably fizzled sometimes quickly and other times after a few years. I'm wondering if it's possible when things start out that way to put the brakes on and really try to get to know each other first so you can both make an informed decision? It's a bit like driving with your feet on both pedals. How do you know when something is going to be a good thing or when it's just another situation where things seem amazing up front and then it was just too good to be true in the long run?

It was a very big disappointment and i needed time to get used to the idea of not being with him and venturing out again. I now feel as if I theoretically could date again, but i feel mentally completely out of shape on the whole dating front and tbh socializing in general. My first baby steps were upping my activity levels and making sure i meet up with friends a couple of times a week.  What did you guys do to prepare yourself for dating again?

40,tdkgep,1647216897,Self Destructive,"You know that feeling you get when you’ve touched a reality that fizzled out 20 years prior and discovered a flame grew where you suspected you became a tally mark on someone’s head board.  You know what I’m talking about. The college crush that turns into a romantic interlude but then, like a contemporary Montaque who met his Capulet, he is stationed in Kosovo while you follow your dreams to a colder place and fill the plates of brides and grooms, politicians or a gander of 40 seniors, flocked with purple, meeting over tiramisu and hot spiced citrus Wassail to banter as cribbage, bridge, or mahjong came to life.  True he was betrothed to a family favorite, and after a night of “ I’ll never see him again”, I went on to pursue a chaotic path of adventure, poor choices, and traveling to a gypsy tune that pursued the nest impulsive move, which usually shadowed a self- serving heart breaker and he... married the woman of his parent’s dreamed, served in the army and raced after his dreams, which he embraced, to become a lawyer.

Twenty years later, I decide to look up old faces and reconnect with people who’ve impacted my life.  You see after dizzying turns, momentous risks, and unfathomable hardship, my immune system went berserk and entrusted me with a chapter of immobility, existential calamity and regret for the people I lived for, least of which, was me.   I research his name and decided to contact him on Facebook after seeing ‘single’ in most places. Yes, of course I went into PI mode to confirm his status.  Two decades ago, we danced the night away and then greeted a chilly sunrise with a commercially prepared breakfast.  What followed, put to rest any idea of romance.  You see, a waitress, soaked me with water, after an interrogation of what I was doing with her best friend’s fiancé, led to information that was politely omitted from our sleepless rendezvous.  Unfortunately, the date was over but the situation worsened. I went to pick up my belongings from his residence and when we arrived, his roommate was on the phone with his significant other.  The receiver was muted as my date took the call, and he turned to me and pleaded, “ Just say it, and it’s over.  I’ve wanted to get to know you since I saw you in class.  I’ll leave her if you want me too.”  Her cries where tiny hiccups that echoed from the earpiece.  His eyes reflected the despair thar crushed my heart. This would have been my first relationship, but her sobs and the immorality any romantic endeavor would truly stain my karmic receipt. I walked away.

Twenty years later, he’s in my view once again. It turns out the marriage lasted less than a year. He remarried a physician and 13 years later they’ve divorced.  They actually met online while he was deployed and a shotgun wedding followed.  He confessed he’s never forgotten me and said “ just think of how peaceful, how much easier the last 20 years would have been if things were different. “. He claimed his feelings were genuine and when we parted he felt like he made a huge mistake. He felt like something was missing.

Twenty years later, we talk every night and we are making plans to meet and then I realize something. It hits me hard and  each brick of self- awareness pummeled me into this abyss of doubt.  He’s a successful lawyer, is financial stable and plays sports with a local league. Me? I’m the girl who went to college for eight years, met the wrong person and birthed the right kid, am on the outskirts of financial ruin because let’s face it loans and disability don’t mix.  I’m here comparing our lives and I discover I’m who I never wanted to be, jobless, in debt and barely existing after the pandemic baptized every success with immense failure all because I now am a semi functioning, single mom with a debilitating chronic disease. And yes, it poured negativity and regret and pity before I did what I haven’t done before and ghosted him.  It was painful. It was awkward.  It felt ridiculous believing someone who’s not  wavered from academia, occupational demand or financial priority would like a misfit like me.  Of course, I left my invisible state and ask how his day went or how he’s feeling, even joke about the beauty of my state versus his but the connection hasn’t been the same.  Now I sit here wondering if I did the right thing in arriving at the impossibility of a couple like “us” and walking away before I got stung?

Twenty years ago, he could have been my first love.  I even joked we’ll wait another twenty to be sure we should reconnect and he said, “ come get me I’m tight here”. Twenty years ago, I feel like I made the mistake of not taking an absurd chance....and now 20 years later, I’ve done the same thing.

48,tdptip,1647234806,The Slow Burn...suddenly seeing with new eyes?,"Is it possible for a man to suddenly start looking at a woman with new eyes?

Background: Group of coworkers (equal percentage of male and female) often go out for happy hour. Over the years some have left the company. 
Recently all reconnected at the old happy hour spot. Good times. 
I (43W) asked one of the guys (49M) if he can assist me with a large store pickup order since he has a pickup truck.
Days before the order came we ended up chatting on the phone about relationship outlooks, retirement and finances etc. 
The order came in early and he immediately (aka same day) to pick it up and delivered it to my new home. He volunteered himself for a tour and commented how much how he loved my new home. He had never been to my home before (even the old one) since we are only hung out in a group  In other words...he lingered. Lingered is the only way to describe it.
After he left, my intuition told me that there was something happening. His smile, body language and his little DIY tips while touring my home. Could it be that he is looking at me as a prospect? Nah, it cannot me. I never considered...It is not possible. I told my intuition to shut up.
I texted him thanks after he left. He immediately answered suggesting I have a housewarming party.

Question: I have always believed you know within 30 minutes whether someone is a prospect not YEARS. Is this possible? Have you ever looked at someone with new eyes? BTW, I don't know how I feel about it...my intuition will just not shut up.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/tdptip/the_slow_burnsuddenly_seeing_with_new_eyes/

But, when we got back she said she realized that she didn’t want to complicate her life as much as I would have needed her to. (I still have two teenage girls every other week; and we had been planning to move in to her house this summer.)
 
I get that her feelings are valid, and these are legitimates reasons to split up.  We had been dating seven months, and on vacation I gave her a “promise ring”.  Which I think was the catalyst for her to take a hard look at our future.  
 
Since the breakup, I’ve been a mess.  Can’t eat, can’t sleep, no energy.   And while I am not in despair or in crisis…it feels like each day is more and more bleak. 
 
How do you find the will to move on?  How do you keep the Hope alive that one day, you can find a loving partner who won’t quit?
 
I was always an optimist about dating and love.  But when I found someone I know loves me, my life that I built before her (as she called) it, was a dealbreaker.  (I will say that I was the first man with kids she ever dated, so she didn’t know it was a dealbreaker until she did.). I feel hopeless for the first time in my life.  I’ve dated quite a bit and have had some bad breakups that have left me crying and filled with anxiety and despair.   I’m feeling none of that this time.  Just have lost Hope.

65,tefixm,1647314584,How to ask a person you're seeing to stop talking sometimes... (or AITA?),"I've (45M) have been seeing someone (36F) for about four months. We are in the same social circle and have felt pretty comfortable with each other from the start. We've also been taking it slow and not having an ""everyday"" type relationship, simply because we're both busy and not really sure that's what we want anyways. 

Last weekend we took our first road trip together to visit a national park near us for a long weekend. We were both really excited and expressed a lot of enthusiasm leading up to this trip together. 

Previously our conversation with each other had always been pretty even, in my estimation. We converse well on dates, and have a pretty steady even flow with how we talk when we spend time together. 

On the road trip we talked most of the three hour drive on the way up, but once we got up into the mountains and closer to the national park, I was more interested in paying attention to the scenery than talking. She seemed to be just as open at first, but also kept talking about things going on in her life while I drove. I paid attention as best I could, but I also interjected at times things like ""wow, look how pretty this is..."" 

Honestly, between driving, fatigue, and looking at the scenery, I wasn't too conscious of what was going in our conversation and what we were talking about. I just said ""yeah"" and ""uh huh"" a lot. She either didn't notice or didn't care, because she just kept talking... 

And it just kinda kept going like that all weekend...

Luckily we met up with some other friends and she spent a lot of time talking to them, but I also came to realize that they were getting rather annoyed with her too. She talked nonstop basically the whole weekend. 

I have introvert tendencies and need some time to myself to recharge. I was hoping I would be able to sneak these times to myself during the trip but it didn't happen quite enough. 

As a consequence, I was completely mentally exhausted for the drive home. And she talked the entire drive home too! All I said for the entire 3 hour drive was ""yeah,"" ""uh huh,"" and ""wow."" 

At one point I asked if we could listen to music, and she turned some on... and just kept talking. 

I was going crazy inside and at a completely loss for what to say because the only thing going through my mind at that point was to yell ""OMG, STOP! PLEASE STOP TALKING!!!!""

I'm curious to hear people thoughts on how to address this. How do you tell somebody that talks too much to stop? Or is that a primary incompatibility? 

Or am I the asshole here? I sorta know that I can't really keep up a conversation as well while driving, and I also get more introspective when out in nature. So maybe it's not a big deal?

78,tf2wvp,1647385264,Asking men out,"I wanted to say thank you guys for convincing me to ask OLD men out myself. Well, turns out, it works perfectly though not exactly the way it was intended lol

Basically,  the magic phrase (asking them if they'd like to meet for coffee) separates men clearly and undoubtedly into different categories (time wasters, a-holes and f-boys, and the genuinely interested), and that's great, I don't have to scratch my head as to why the convo has fizzled out. No regrets and mysteries as to why he has faded away and other ways of wasting my time.

I have 3 exhibits so far:

Guy #1: small texts from time to time for a week, then I sent him the magic phrase with a polite add-on ""if you are available"". He immediately jumped at the opportunity to have more time-wasting fun, ""Ohhh, I can make myself available"", ""why can't I make myself available, I don't know"" etc. And the next day as if nothing happened, he resumed texting me once a day, in the evening, from his couch. ""Where did the day go?"" and other BS. It was a weekend btw.

&amp;#x200B;

Guy #2: nice texting and connection, it was slightly weird that he invited me to the hotel for a first date but it was in a joking way and we continued texting, and it was still fun and interesting. Then he started slow fading, and I shot my magic phrase. His reaction was, ""ohhh but I don't drink coffee, I want to meet for laughs and kisses"" as if he was the princess and I was courting him, not saying about the fact that he showed his true colors as a f-boy who needs to be reassured that the intimacy would be from the get-go, otherwise he is not interested. 

Anyway, the magic phrase worked again, highlighting his intentions.

&amp;#x200B;

Guy #3: I had a good feeling about our connection, and when I used the magic phrase, he said, ""Definitely!""

93,tfld08,1647446417,Advice needed on next steps,"
My (38f) bf (42m) of 2 years kicked me out 4 weeks ago. I had been depressed due to extreme job stress and we were fighting too much, but I realized it and started getting help (antidepressants, therapy, time off, etc.). I was starting to get better from my lowest point ever, and days later he kicked me out because he hadn’t been happy for the last few weeks or months. 

He then left for a trip to Asia to potentially work there. He’s not sure but he’s there for 2 weeks to test it out. He had always said this was a decision we would make together. 

Now, he says we are not broken up and he can’t believe my words that I’m doing all I can to not be depressed and make sure we have a happy relationship - he needs to see it. But he’s also barely talking to me and doesn’t want to hang out because he’s feeling “too introverted”. 

On the one hand I do agree that actions speak louder than words, but on the other I can’t believe he left me at my lowest moment despite me taking full responsibility and making a change. And also making me feel so unstable (getting kicked out, asap leaving for Asia, being cold, etc.). He’s also not once in the past month asked how I’m doing, despite me being consistently caring and affectionate. 

Honestly I’m at a loss- what do I even do next?

I’m 40F and set my age range as 35-47. This is what I want to date at the moment. I used to date men 50-61 but right now I want to date men 35-47.
Yesterday I went on a great date with a guy that put down he was 39. He was really really into me and wanted to see me again; he kept complimenting my appearance and I could tell he was into me. I found out on the date he was actually 42; he said he lied about his age because his “finger swiped on the wrong year by accident.” Sure.
The only thing I can think of is these men want to date women younger than what’s considered “appropriate” (nevermind the fact I’ve willingly dated men as old as 60).
If I put my age range as 40-50 then I never would have met yesterday’s date.
Lying about the age just puts a disgusting taste in my mouth.
A few years ago I went on a date with a guy that wrote he was 42…but then I found out on the internet he was 52. This was after I’d already slept with him. To be honest it felt like rape…I don’t mean to sound dramatic but because I’d already slept with him, the fact he lied about his age by 10 whole years, felt like rape - like he used this lie to get into my pants.

96,tfpfkw,1647456979,Do I prioritize my kid too much?,"After a short break I’ve reconnected with the last person I was seeing. The break occurred due to difficulty maintaining consistent meaningful contact.  We were still very new (still kind of are actually) and he pretty much faded after multiple attempts to connect while I was caring for my mom for a couple of weeks after surgery. Apparently my quick texts between work and caregiving/ hosting made him think I wasn’t really interested. He reached out again and we’ve since had a good chat about how to stay connected through schedule challenges and obligations. He’s more laid back now about always trying to make plans and I feel a lot less pressure around that whole aspect. Last time we saw each other, just last Thursday, he was asking about the weekend and I excitedly reminded him that my kid is visiting for spring break. I don’t know about others’ experience their first year as an empty nester, but these visits are everything to me now that we’re on different time zones. He was like, ah yes, well enjoy! Seemingly positive and understanding. 

A few days into my kid’s visit he’s started to be kind of distant again. I’m communicating more/ better as per our chat, but over the past few days he’s become much less communicative — still responsive but…different. I can’t tell if he is trying to be considerate— I.e. giving me time and space during the visit — or if he really has an issue. I did ask if “we’re good” and he said, yea, enjoy your time with your kid. I didn’t want to make a thing about it so just said thank you looking forward to catching up later. He concurred, everything was friendly, but something is off. And I think it’s the lack of attention.

Is my prioritizing precious time with my kid out of the norm? It’s waaaay to early to introduce them and I can’t be in two places at once. The thing is I have to work as well, so I’m trying to squeeze as much time as possible in this 1 week visit. I like this guy more than I have anyone I’ve met since leaving my marriage but I’m also a mom and the reality is that opportunities to spend this time and get to know the adult version of my child is dwindling as life progresses!

Do I sacrifice time with my child /carve out time to see this man?

She’s very independent and has brought her kids up without a father, studied and has a successful career which she is very good at. She has told me about depression she had around 12 years ago and was on medication for about 5 years. 

The threat of her breaking up made me anxious and with her not opening up or communicating it happened again. 
The most recent breakup 3 weeks ago she said that she acknowledges she is bad at communicating and keeps doing this and she won’t put me through this again. So we are no longer together. We have both said that we are in love with each other but she seems to have shut down.
