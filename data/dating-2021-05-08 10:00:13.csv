Unfortunately, we matched a day before he was heading back home. He goes to school in another state and was visiting his family. He said he comes back often and that we could FaceTime and talk in the meantime.

I added him on snap and Instagram. Realized I had previously matched with his brother and hung out twice. Nothing happened between his brother and I besides kissing and me taking my top off (his brother was kind of a jerk lol). I told him about his brother and that if he did not want to continue talking to me I’d understand. He said “Let’s just keep chatting and see what happens I don’t really have any expectations and worst case we just become friends”. Which I was cool with. 

Yesterday night I noticed that he removed from Snapchat. But still has me on insta. We’re still texting regularly, I’m not sure if I should ask him about it.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n7rblt/removed_me_from_snap_but_still_texting_me/
1,n7rkor,1620487683,How do you not feel dehumanised when dating? I’m tired of proving I’m someone worth loving and not a creep or loser,"
I’m really just exhausted of having to tick everyone’s arbitrary boxes when online dating and never really being on the receiving end of any initial gestures. I feel  like there’s a huge push to prove I’m not a creep and that I’m actually someone worth caring for and after a while it’s gotten to me. It’s made me a touch bitter because I kind of feel like I’m simply worth less as a guy and I’m not worth anything as a person until I’ve fulfilled expectations that are levied on men and less on women. Like, I’m never intrinsically lovable, I’m only worth something because I have a job and stable income.

2,n7rmip,1620487833,How to transition to just friends with a girl I dated,"Some backstory first, So I met this girl 2 years ago at a friends party we didn't talk much that night and didn't think much of it till we met at a nightclub weeks later where I got with her but then left to be with friends. Then nothing for 6 months and in the middle of the summer during the pandemic we matched on tinder and proceeded to date for 3 months which was a nice summer fling but she broke it off with me as she was going home for 2 months and didn't want to do long distance. I thought that was fine as I wasn't looking for anything serious at the time.

Come the beginning of the autumn semester  we started seeing each other again but then I acted like a dickhead one afternoon but I apologised and we moved on. then towards the end of the semester a friend of hers told me ""I should be happy that she just uses me for sex"" which I didn't like hearing and confronted  her  to which she denied and we went on another break for a few months. During this time we talked a little here and their but nothing major then during January this year she called me and I invited her over to celebrate my exams finishing. We ended up having sex with each other and then she started to cry and confessed her love to me. To which I said I loved her back but we agreed that It would never work out between us right now and maybe we can try a real relationship in the future.  

A few weeks go by and she then tells me she just wants to see me again but only as platonic friends. I did feel a little hurt by this as It was a bit too soon after she had just confessed her love to me. Now after this we did kiss again one time 4 weeks ago but now last night I got the feeling she didn't want anything intimate with me as she would pull away as I put my hand on her back and I tired kissing her to which she responded ""not tonight"".

Now I'm stuck, I still care about her but I respect her wishes too and can understand why she wants to be platonic. I still really enjoy hanging out with her and partying with her, how do I go forward in this relationship as just friends as I'm finding it difficult at the moment as I miss the intimate side to our relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Girl says she loves me then says she want to be platonic, I understand her reasons but am currently finding it difficult at times and feel like this relationship is on her terms. how do I transition to this new stage in our relationship ?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n7rmip/how_to_transition_to_just_friends_with_a_girl_i/

11,n7s8ks,1620489617,Going undercover as a girl on dating apps,"So I always knew that girls got more matches on average than guys on dating apps in general but I had no idea just how skewed it really was. A few days ago I was curious and wanted to know just what it was really like being a girl on these dating apps. A female friend of mine let me borrow her pictures to use on the profile and I signed up for it. One thing to note is she is kinda cute on a good day but isn't someone who your gonna do a double take if you saw them walking around. I didn't wanna use a girl who looks like a twitch streamer cause then of course I'd get a million matches and it wouldn't be much of an experiment. Also I wanna make clear I didn't respond or talk to anyone during this experiment as well.

What I found was crazy. I signed up for tinder, bumble, and a few other apps. I would swipe left on 5 people and then right on 5 and go back and forth to have a good sample size. All of them came up with the same results. I started this experiment on Wednesday and it's now Saturday and in four days I got more matches as a girl than I did in years as a guy. I was honestly shocked just how many matches I got when swiping. It did explain a lot however. It explained why I never got anywhere with these apps. A girl can just pick the best looking guy out of the laundry list of people hitting them up. To get any kind of success on these apps as a guy you have to be in the top 15%. I wouldn't call myself ugly but I'm not even close to being in the top 15% of guys. A lot of the guys that on there are super ripped versus me who naturally has a skinny body type and no matter how much I lift I cannot gain any muscle. How am I supposed to compete with these guys and why would a girl chose me when there are 10 better looking guys hitting her up? I know not all girls are into muscle guys but whatever a girl is looking for she is going to have so many different options to choose from what are the odds she chooses you? Like I said earlier I knew that dating apps were skewed but I had no clue it was this bad.

With this knowledge I can honestly say that dating apps has ruined dating for the majority of guys. Cause even if your not all that attractive as a girl you could go on any apps and have at least 50 people hitting you up after a week. Some of these girls end up developing a superiority complex because if they aren't attractive and they never really got a whole lot of attention from guys their whole life and then bam they sign up for these apps and now all of a sudden she has multiple guys a day who are down bad telling her she is an angel sent from heaven. She's never gonna care about you in specific cause she can just go online after your guy's date and have 10 better looking guys teller her how pretty she is on her apps. The only way now I feel like I could find a girl is one who doesn't use those apps and realizes what they truly are cause those girls tend to be the down to earth ones since they aren't getting attention from a bunch of random dudes everyday. I guarantee if these apps were removed from society dating would be a much more even ballpark rather than women having all the power.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n7s8ks/going_undercover_as_a_girl_on_dating_apps/

Anyways, I could maybe slowly feel him checking out the past month or so, but he never communicated anything so it was hard to tell what he was thinking.

He eventually stopped texting me Completely the one day. I explained, can you please text me, because it makes me feel like you’re interested. 

He sent a long ass text basically saying he “wasn’t sure” if I’d fit into the farming lifestyle. He’s basically refused to communicate anything substantial since. I lost sleep and have barely ate the past couple days. I begged him to call me to talk about it, and he said he would, and I don’t think he will.

Then I slowly started liking him and told him that. He told me likes me too but he doesn’t want a serious commitment with anyone because he’ll be immigrating to an entirely different country with his family this year and therefore leave our country. 

But he still wanted to go on a date with me and we did go. Everything was really casual, this was the first time we had hung out outside of uni. On our first date we held hands and just drove around in his car and had lunch. We had been planning for a second date. And a month later there’s a lockdown in our country so we won’t be seeing each other till quite some time. We’ve started talking about kissing and cuddling and he says we’re getting closer, he wants to see me but lockdown lol.

What I wanna ask is, is this a friends with benefits kind of situation? Or are we casually dating, or what? Because he told me he can’t have anything serious since he’s leaving, but wants to go with the flow and see where things go. So what are we? It’s been agreed that there won’t be anything sexual without a relationship. We live in a religiously conservative country anyway.

Loving someone or dating someone just because of the looks is like loving a movie just because of the special effects. Yeah, it can be entertaining but when the credits come you will end up with that feeling of emptiness and disappointment.  


There is something for everyone, but loving someone for what they are is how you can transcend the limitation of their special effect.

Be story-oriented, not special effect-oriented, they are just a bonus to enhance the story, but if you love the story your mind will make its own special effect.

I'm not the type of person to go out to bars and make conversation with random girls. I naturally preferred online dating becasue right off the bat you know some things about the person so you can be more selective compared to walking up to random people.

I've had both tinder and bumble for the last 7 months and have gotten very little matches. All which lead to her no longer messaging me or most recently cancelling a first date without any communication afrer despite wanting to reschedule. Its frustrating, I put the effort in to continue the conversation, I put the effort to message back whenever I get the chance compared to other people that play that stupid wait a day between texts game. I l take the effort to look up fancy coffee shops in my area that I never been to becasue I dont like coffee but your bio says you like coffee dates so I put the effort to do something you enjoy. I put in the effort to schedule and make time to meet someone just for it to never happen becasue they cancel...what's the point? 

I just want to go out and get to know someone. I want to get to know someone to eventually form a relationship so I can spend my youth sharing my time with someone. I'm a simple guy I just want the normal things. I want to plan last minute road trips with someone, share all the new songs I learn on guitar with someone, go sit by the water and talk for hours and spin someone around in the headlights of my car with our favorite music playing, binge watch movies all day, so on and so on....At this point all I want to do is just sit down somewhere and get to know someone but even that is difficult.

I'm just craving the thought of meeting someone and forming a relationship becasue I value who iam and know what I can offer to someone. Iam a great looking guy, very kind and funny, I just graduated with a bachelors so on and so on but instead I mindlessly swipe all day and every once in a while I get to talk to someone and have hopes just for the convo to die or plans get cancelled and never rescheduled and the cycle continues.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n7tpvc/why_does_online_dating_have_to_be_so_hard/

I’m 36 she’s 30 and she has been my assitant for three years. 

We text non stop and these days since she has my life down our texts are 90% not about work. 

We hang out nonstop. After hours or on weekends we do brunch and dinners. We go shopping (she pays her own stuff most of the time).

She wants to take my kids to Disneyland with me when they fly from another stat here next month. She out of the blue suggested it. 

She asked me to go to Tulum with her. She said she’d pay her half. Then a few weeks later she asked if I minded if her best female friend came. That threw me off. 

She gets upset when I mention dating. She asks to see pics of whoever I’m talking to. She never talks about her dating life. 

Yesterday we were driving and she said “We should stop at the store down the street and get a sexy toy”. Which was confusing. 

We’ve never kissed. We have never even hugged.

I’ve developed feelings for her that really came out of the blue for me. Honestly, i think I’m falling for her. I always thought she was pretty but have kept it super professional up until recently. I’m pretty dang positive she feels the same way but there is a part of me that thinks she may not. I don’t know if/how I should act on them.

While he’s been away he hasn’t messaged me once, he did say he would text me once he gets back but I feel like if he wanted to talk to me he would’ve reached out. He also updated his dating app (bumble) profile the day after he left. I don’t have tinder so I don’t know but if he did bumble I’m sure he did tinder. We have only really known each other for a good few weeks/month and a half I’d say. We aren’t even close to dating and haven’t really established that we’re “talking” either. It did hurt my feelings bc I felt as if he really did like me and then to see him update his profile meaning he was looking for something while on vacation just made me feel bad/hurt my feelings. I see that he uses WhatsApp bc of his status but he hasn’t reached out at all since he’s left. I believe he’s supposed to come back in four days so I don’t know if I should just wait it out or if I should just send a little message through WhatsApp just being like “Hey! I hope your trip is going great and that you’re having fun!” I miss him but I don’t feel like he misses me as much, that could just be me being insecure but I mean with the update of the dating app and not reaching out even once it just made me overthink a little and by the way we were talking before he just really made it seem like he liked me. Idk am I just overthinking? Should I wait till he gets back or send him a message? Before he left he did tell me if I wanted to message him to do it on WhatsApp and he texted me before his flight took off and said see you when I get back. But he could also message me right, like why do I have to be the one to make the first move. Any thoughts? We also have been sexually involved since the first date, this makes me feel now as if he just used me for the sex. Is that still a thing, where if they have sex with you on the first date that means they are only interested for the sex? I do want to know if he hooked up with anyone while he was there but I don’t want to seem like I am insecure about it. I was thinking of just asking him straight up (if he asks me to hang out when he gets back) but I don’t know if I should ask him before we hang out bc I feel like if he says yes then my mood will just be kind of off and I definitely would not be in the mood to have sex or anything just because I would be a little upset at least at first. Is this reasonable or am I really just coming from a place of insecurity? How should I go about asking him or finding out if he did hook up while he was gone. Do I look stupid for wanting to talk to him while he’s out looking for other girls? I’m open to any input/advice.

32,n7v35y,1620497785,How dumb am I for constantly trying to annoy people/matches,"So, here's my dumbass question. Here's my reasoning for it. 

I generally like pushing slightly touchy subjects in a non-serious way to see how people respond, in the way of seeing how seriously they are taking themselves and if they can poke around the bush with me. Apparently this annoys people sometimes.

I also like to annoy people with my answers to see how they respond, not for the reason to see how far I can take them or for the fun of it all. More for the fact that I kind of want to see how they respond when annoyed/angry, and to see if they annoy me back. Also to clarify, not nagging, not insisting or whatever, literally just annoying someone.

I am also a fan of playing the devil's advocate. I like debating and throwing issues and ideas around, because I love learning or seeing and understanding a different perspective, or teach someone my perspective. I also like seeing if they are willing to see my point of view (be it something I agree with or not).

How absolutely stupid am I? I am doing this very early on when we just matched usually. I am asking because I honestly don't think it's that bad of an idea, but I probably am very biased.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n7v35y/how_dumb_am_i_for_constantly_trying_to_annoy/

It's hard to do what's right when you're scared and shame yourself plus if you have narcissistic personality traits.,I'm single now 26 female. I was with someone that I would hide from in the dark room of our shared apartment in another country with their family. It was his country and his home. Not mine. I really didn't listen to call the cops I even got angry with members in this group discord group. It sucked. But now I'm home with my parents. It's a little weird to ask parents about this stuff so I'll stick to here. But the relationship or should I say shared psychosis is what I want advice with. It was truly ridiculous and I'd like to be validated that I made the right choice. I'm disasociating a lot as well as withdrawing wanting to contact him. It was a you could say mutual neurotic relationship. We met online. I'd like for people to talk to me in this thread please I'm very vulnerable and I don't want to reach out to my ex.

I(20) can’t find a woman that I feel like I’m attractive enough that I won’t get laughed at for approaching them. There’s not one woman I’ve seen or spoken to that’s as unattractive as me so I’m stuck trying to speak to women who are out of my league which obviously is a bad idea so I don’t even try it.

Tinder and bumble of course don’t work for me. Even the other ugly and obese girls are too good for me to date. I’ve never gotten a match that didn’t unmatch or ignore me, which I guess I should’ve seen coming but it still hurts.

Because of this I feel stuck. I either just accept take no woman wants to be with one of the ugliest men alive and give up, or I can try going after women out of my league. But this will just lead to getting rejected, laughed at, “ew’d”, being viewed as a creep and other bad things.

40,n7vz8t,1620500370,How do you know when it's time to give up on someone?,"So I started talking to this guy last August. We met online and talked daily. And that eventually turned into weekly phone calls. He lives a few hours from me so we mainly just chatted through text or calls. He was everything I was looking for in a guy. I fell for him hard. It took months before we finally met in person. After the first time we met, he started going through a rough patch and we decided to put the relationship stuff on hold. We sort of picked things back up this January and we saw each other again a few months later. Only for him to tell me that he really likes me but he's not ready to be in a serious relationship as he's been super depressed and needs to work on things.

I respect that and told him I would wait for him as I don't want anyone else. And that I'll just be here as his friend for now. He told me he didn't want me to not be in his life and that he would do his best not to ignore me. But he told me that I shouldn't wait for him. It took him a month to respond to my messages. And now he's back to ignoring me. That should be my sign to move on, but I have depression myself and I know what it's like to push people out. And sometimes you need someone who won't give up on you. I have also tried dating other people but none of them have been like him. I just don't feel anything. But it hurts that I can't talk to him about stuff going on in my life like I use to. So I am conflicted on letting go or staying where I'm at. Even though I don't know when or if he'll get better.

42,n7w6lv,1620500947,My mental health issue,"I (19F) was getting to know a guy (24M) on Reddit whose profession is a mental health counselor. I thought he can ease my depression and unstable mentality if I get to know him. Talking with him was one of most wonderful experiences ever. I've never felt so much joy for a long time when I communicate with someone. He was like a unicorn, full of rainbow and positivity. He was such a happy man and I was such a downer. He makes me genuinely happy, but I don't understand why I always doubt him. I keep assuming he isn't the right person for me and he was just trying to get something from me by showing me positivity. I thought he love-bombed me. 

After a few days of communicating with him on Snapchat, I realized that I'm slowly destroying our connection with my tendency to push people away because of my mental health issue. I kept giving him hot and cold treatment, kept being a downer, kept taking advantage of him to put all of my depression on him, using him as a tool to boost my self-esteem. I hurt him while he was trying to support me and encourage me. I realized that I'm too toxic for him, and he doesn't deserve to be treated like this. So I end the conversation and silently remove him from Snapchat, as a way to protect him from the chaos of my mentality. 

Honestly, I'm bawling my eyes out while writing this. I don't want to leave him or end our conversation, but I knew what I have to do. Because the more we communicate, the more I will damage him.

46,n7wf2x,1620501630,Have you ever felt like an unintentional catfish?,"So, I've been mostly not dating since the pandemic began. My country has been in lockdown to varying degrees since March 2020, so I had 3 walking dates and all three guys didn't want a second date. No problem, that happens.


My issue is that I was a UK size 10 in December of 2019, I was putting on a little weight because of a leg and back injury but I was quite thin so I didn't mind and my doctor was happy to see me fill out a bit. Since the pandemic, my size has gone up to a UK 14. I also had my wisdom teeth removed, and my face swelled up like crazy for 2 weeks. My jawline hasn't looked the same since, even my roommate agreed that it changed my cheeks/jaw. I have started taking care of my diet, restaurants are closed so I haven't been doing that, and I didn't exercise regularly before the pandemic, but now I exercise daily. I actually don't mind the weight too much, I like my body more with curves.


My problem is, I haven't taken any recent photos since the pandemic because I havent been socialising and well it's been a rather boring time. I am afraid that my photos don't look like ""me"" any more and these guys think I'm a catfish. I try to send them some pics while we're chatting to give them an idea of how I look now, but the last three didn't seem to recognise me when I first walked up to them.

While I feel more like myself at this size, I'm so self conscious that men won't find me attractive. I have a date this week and I'm genuinely close to cancelling because I feel like I'm ""catfishing"" unintentionally but I don't know if this is just some sort of body dysmorphia or something. I'm not looking for diet or exercise advice, but can anyone sympathize with this?

50,n7x1tz,1620503547,Sex/Intimacy Following a Break Up,"I posted about a week ago regarding the sad, but doomed-to-fail nature of online dating. This sparked some great discussion and so throughout the week I was thinking of a different topic to post that’s been on my mind, and thought it would be interesting to see others’ take on it. 

I’m a 29M, now single for 4 months following a 30 month relationship. Sex and intimacy was a big part of our relationship - I’d say 2-3 times per week we would find ourselves engaging in sexual activity, even at this stage of our relationship (certainly was in the 4-5x/week range at the outset). Since I’ve been single, I haven’t had sex - partly due to a lack of success from OLD, but also just from the perspective of needing to foster a quality relationship before actually having sex with someone (not really into the hookup culture). 

I’m wondering how people who may be in similar situations manage this area of their lives, as we know that sexual desire and release are one the basic human physiological needs. 

Do you find yourself thirsty for human touch, and resort to OLD to get your fix (or trying to meet people at bars/clubs etc if that's a thing wherever you live based on COVID restrictions)? I would imagine this is much easier for women than men, based on the landscape of the social media age and women being in the drivers seat online with the volume of matches they get. Do you have a consistent FWB who gets you through these times? Do you find yourself masturbating more than you usually did? 

And further to the point on masturbation: One thing that I am really trying to curb, is watching pornography. I think it sets unrealistic expectations and is an overall unhealthy habit to engage in on a regular basis. I find myself currently, due to having to masturbate instead of having human physical contact, watching porn 2-3x/week - and I can see this being an issue if I were to keep things up (no pun intended) in this regard. Are people able to masturbate using fantasies in their mind? Reading erotic literature? 

Thanks in advance for any insight - this is a bit of an interesting topic and I’m hopeful that others may possibly be wondering how others cope in a similar situation. If you could also mention in your responses age/gender/how long you’ve been single that would be great to add some additional context :)",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n7x1tz/sexintimacy_following_a_break_up/

2. Different people get different treatment. Sounds like common sense but I’ve seen people deny this. Some people get the red carpet treatment from the start. Some women get offered a date at a nice sit down restaurant while others get offered Netflix/chill in that same guys apartment. Some men get to have sex with no strings attached for no real effort while others have to take that same girl out for multiple energy/money consuming dates in addition to long winded conversations over text to have any chance of any kind of physical contact. Even in day to day conversation, how people interact with you will depend largely on your appearance. I’m not saying it’s right or it’s wrong, it just is

3. When someone wants you to meet their friends, they’re doing it so they (their friends) can judge you. Again, sounds like common sense but people will deny it. It’s a potential trap so tread carefully

Wanted to get some opinions as my sis thinks I may have overreacted. 

I unfollowed / Unfriended him on everything because I thought he was basically ghosting me and I thought it’d make things easier to move on.

He barely texted me this week, so I let him know that makes me feel that he’s not into me. Keep in mind he used to communicate a lot more, and he’s literally always on snapchat.

So yesterday morning , he sends me a long ass text saying he isn’t sure if I’m “a good fit” for his farming lifestyle. I texted back I’m totally into him, and about his lifestyle. Didn’t hear from him for the rest of the day. 

This did make me very upset and kind of made me assume he was dumping me.

We also always hang out on weekends, and he made zero plans to do so. 

I call him later that night. He doesn’t pick up, asks if we can talk tomorrow.

I told him this morning I’ve barely been sleeping because of this and to please just call meASAP. He says he will call shortly. He doesn’t.

That’s when I did all the unfriending and bullshit.

He just got back to me now, saying he’s sorry didn’t mean to put me off, things got busy. I said I assumed the worst.

74,n7zvit,1620512178,"First date in ages today, she didn't want to go on another one afterwards, what to learn from this?","Hello,

So recently I've been trying to get into dating (hard enough with aspergers), and until recently have had little success until I matched with a women on Tinder and ended up chatting on Facebook for around a week. So far so good! (Both 23) Just to note, she has anxiety and I have depression. 

We spoke about a lot of things like hobbies, goals and what we want from a relationship. She had a good date idea that was adventure golf in our city centre, which sounded great!

Fast forward to the date: I made my first mistake by saying hello and hugging her; she didn't seem to mind it but I mentally chastised myself for the physical affection off the bat. We went and played through the adventure golf and seemingly had a good time!

After that I asked if she'd mind if I put my arm around her shoulder to which she said she didn't mind. I then asked if she'd like to hold hands and she also said she didn't mind. So we walked around trying to find a coffee place that wasn't just takeaway only and eventually got into one. We spoke for a good while about, well, everything! I asked if she would be alright if I occasionally just held her hands across the table and she said she was alright with it, although in hindsight it sounds weird. A running theme is that I don't know how to act socially in these situations, I just wanted to show that I was physically as well as mentally interested without going too far if that makes sense? I always asked permission before doing any of these gestures (aside from the hug which again was my absolute fault). We continue chatting from there onwards and have a really good conversational back and forth about our lives, family, friends and life in general!

Anyhow the date ends and after a while I ask her on Facebook if she would like to go on another one to which she replies that she's realised she isn't much for physical affection and doubts she would be able to mesh well with me due to that as well as not wanting to lead me on. Fair enough really we all learn something new about ourselves and I appreciated the honesty! She wished me the best in finding someone more ideal as I did for her but I wonder if I could have made it work if I wasn't as physically affectionate?

My biggest fear is coming off as creepy but I find it hard to pick up on facial and physical body language and I'm worried for my future dates if I don't improve on this. I found her really attractive as she was definitely my type of women but I suspect I'm rambling at this point. I just want to know how to improve from here on out? I think part of me wants a relationship so badly that I plan ahead without thinking that things might just not work out which happened to happen today, but yeah any advice or tips for what I could have done better as well as what I should do better in future dates would be much appreciated!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n7zvit/first_date_in_ages_today_she_didnt_want_to_go_on/

Straight away I knew he isn’t my type and probably I am not going to keep in touch after this date. The date went went on and it was nice. He seems nice, conversations flew, had a laugh, had a little bit of food and a lot of alcohol! 3 bottle of red between us. I didn’t eat that day much, red wine is way too much on me but done how carried away and ordered 3 bottles.

I'm not the type of person to go out to bars and make conversation with random girls. I naturally preferred online dating becasue right off the bat you know some things about the person so you can be more selective compared to walking up to random people.

I've had both tinder and bumble for the last 7 months and have gotten very little matches. All which lead to her no longer messaging me or most recently cancelling a first date without any communication afrer. Its frustrating, I put the effort in to continue the conversation, I put the effort to message back whenever I get the chance compared to other people that play that stupid wait a day between texts game. I l take the effort to look up fancy coffee shops in my area that I never been to becasue I dont like coffee but your bio says you like coffee dates so I put the effort to do something you enjoy. I put in the effort to schedule and make time to meet someone just for it to never happen becasue they cancel...what's the point? 

I just want to go out and get to know someone. I want to get to know someone to eventually form a relationship so I can spend my youth sharing my time with someone. I'm a simple guy I just want the normal things. I want to plan last minute road trips with someone, share all the new songs I learn on guitar with someone, go sit by the water and talk for hours and spin someone around in the headlights of my car with our favorite music playing, binge watch movies all day, so on and so on....At this rate I just want to sit down and get to know someone but even that is difficult.

I'm just craving the thought of meeting someone and forming a relationship becasue I value who iam and know what I can offer to someone. Iam a great looking guy, very kind and funny, I just graduated with a bachelors so on and so on but instead I mindlessly swipe all day and every once in a while I get to talk to someone and have hopes just for the convo to die or plans get cancelled and the cycle continues.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n80rud/why_is_online_dating_so_difficult/

I am 24 now and at 17 I was already so done with dating I didnt date for a few years (until 23-24). I have some very sepecific relationship rules, which are imo very mild and achievable. I am a heterosexual woman btw, my two rules are having a fulfilling sex life (ie: I expect to finish during sex) and to have chores equaly split.

I feel it is so easy, I am easy going, I am open minded and a freedom loving person. The thing is that I dont seem to find someone that feels those are worth it. I started dating and moved in with my bf, I told him about the chores and we split it equaly and even have it in the fridge. It ended up not happening, he cleaned like shit and when I was super sick he did nothing, not even his part, if I didnt reminde him he wouldnt do it.

I feel so hurt, not at him but at the world, at the cruel world he live on where just because I was born with a pair of boobs I get so much shit. I am officially done dating because being in a relationship makes my life harder than being alone. Everytime I have to say ""take the trash"" ""its your turn cleaning"" ""dont let your clothes on the floor"" I get so much shit.

He told me I saw him as an enemy or an inconvenience, and its not true I dont hate him for being him, I hate that he doesnt value my time or energy.

The third date which was today was the worst one where we met up and walked around then we talked at a table in her backyard before she made an excuse to leave. I thought it went well where we had good conversation but I made a mistake of leaving my weed pen in her car which I think may have made her mad.

How can I tell a difference between flirting and objectification? What can I ask my therapist to help me? I keep having short relationships.

I'm(18f) trying to work on being very clear of my boundaries. Because of a terrible traumatic past experience I'm not meeting people right after talking to them especially online as I want to feel comfortable with them as far as dating muchless friends.

I think a problem I have is I give everyone a chance. I really really really need to figure out how to not to keep letting people who want to just use me for their needs without regard for mine.

What is the difference between flirting and objectification? Because I feel very uncomfortable sometimes with how mostly men great and treat me right off the bat. Maybe it's because of love bombing in past familial relationships and romantic relationships.

I am in therapy, what are some things I could bring up to my therapist about this? I keep ending up in relationships that don't last more than a month. I have been justifying it as seeing red flags and running away but could I be just running when I see any sort of conflict? 

Idk it's a lot of questions but for now I'm taking a break from dating people just because I definitely had a terrible experience recently that really just made me scared of dating or anything romantic.

93,n82ase,1620519985,The many faces of the perception of bias and hate against promiscuous women,"Having grown up in a very conservative, traditional framework and later getting sick and tired of it and rejecting it completely, I get that part. There’s often piles and piles of sex negativity, especially in more puritanical traditions, and women probably get the brunt of it. Though my experience being raised that way as a man really fucked me up too. So it’s not like it was like that for women and cake for men. Seeing the way the women were treated in my upbringing, I’ll agree that they probably ended up even more emotionally abused by the process. And, as an extension of all of that shit, women that were discovered to be promiscuous were treated absolutely terribly. Whereas high status men that achieved promiscuity were able to hide it and suffer very little backlash. I don’t think that was all men though to be fair. That was just the ones at the top that were getting fucked non-stop.

Nowadays I feel like there’s an new extension to this where some women feel that promiscuous men are celebrated by society so promiscuous women should be celebrated too. First of all, sex doesn’t need to be all that. Maybe no one is a winner or should be celebrated by everyone for having lots and lots of sex. Maybe that’s just another way to be and it doesn’t mean anything. Anyone taking that attitude is basically wanting to become a new version of those shitty men from the old days that celebrated themselves while women were treated like shit. And what a small number of toxic fuckboys currently tell themselves they are. Celebrated for all the fucking they do. It’s offensive bullshit to both women and the majority of men.

Don’t be like those assholes. Because that basically will translate to the majority of men, the ones that have never been capable of being promiscuous like that in the first place, will be treated like absolute shit by everybody. And that’s some shit.

Everyone just needs to be honest and stop pumping themselves and let the truth out. How many people you fuck doesn’t mean jack shit. Particularly in a world with 7-8 billion people.

95,n82eqm,1620520358,What do you think?,"I met a guy on OLD. Our communication clicked right away. We started texting for a about a week. He said that he would call me the next evening. I said great. The next evening he texted me asking if i was home. I responded with “no not yet. I just left work &amp; was at the grocery store. Then headed home &amp; then dinner. I will text you when in all done.” After i finished with everything it was like 7pm &amp; I said “would you like me to call you?” He responds with “… ive been drinking can we talk tomorrow. I promise i dont drink everyday…”
Ummmm it concerned me that we made our first plans to talk &amp; he flaked because of alcohol &amp; then he had to qualify that he doesn’t drink everyday. I was done after that.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n82eqm/what_do_you_think/
96,n82jbm,1620520795,I've been seeing a lot of complaining and sexism,"There are a lot of bitter men out here on this sub reddit mad and bitter about women getting a lot of matches and themselves not getting any at all. My advice for you as a fellow cis male. LEARN TO MOVE ON. Rejection happens to everyone and even if you didn't get rejected and that person you think is hot is really a piece of shit what's the point of matching or being accepted by them??? Not every woman is a cuddly warm teddy bear.... they're human and have flaws too just like men...

Lastly learn to be confident and courageous and intelligent with your approach to women that's really all they're asking for. Just don't be a piece of shit, be kind (not nice because that's fake) and accept them within reason that's it",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n82jbm/ive_been_seeing_a_lot_of_complaining_and_sexism/
