I am currently in college and not necessarily looking for a gf but not opposed to the idea of having one. In my mind the only reason I would date currently is if I found a girl that I think is literally the one for me. I am choosing not to date right now, for the most part, because of my last relationship and realizing how much time and effort had to go into it and seeing how that time and effort could've been put into something else. My only concern right now is whether I am setting my expectations for ""the one"" too high. Sometimes when I'm falling asleep or waking up I picture my would be girlfriend but I picture her mostly as someone who doesn't have very many flaws. Not necessarily never had flaws but just worked on them. When I say flaws I mean issues or struggles, say depression or severe insecurity. So rather than be upset and bothered by that, my ideal girlfriend would've put time and effort into trying to get rid of or atleast improve her insecurities and such. My ideal girlfriend would also be super sexual and love that aspect of life. My question is whether I am sort of idealizing this person I've created in my head and set unrealisitic standards/expectations about the kind of person I want to be with?

So am I in a catch 22? What do other people do in this situation?

So a couple years ago I (M30) had a rough breakup and went to therapy to figure some stuff out. One of the things my therapist suggested was read ""Attached"" to understand my attachment style. I got from it that (I think rightly) I was quite anxious and always expected a lot of a potential suitor or was scared of meeting someone and it not working out. I'm better about that I guess but still to an extent I fall hard for people early on and then get quite depressed when it doesn't work out.

So one of the things that book and other people in general have said to me is date around and meet more people and that will make you feel more secure and also stop myself from having high expectations when going into dates. 

My question is, I tend to find it hard to get dates, so how can I ""go on more dates to lower my date expectations?"" - feels very catch 22. Dating apps don't seem to do it for me and lockdown and some introversion are both challenges I've tried to deal with.

I then followed up a few hours later and said, “to be completely transparent, I know I didn’t call it a date but I definitely didn’t invite you just to call. I’m down to talk and see how we vibe. Lmk what you think”. He left me on read for a while and then says, “Yeah sure, sounds great :)”

On the day of, he messaged me 40 min late, and I told him that if he didn’t want to call, he could just let me know. But he rescheduled, pushing the time an hour back. We had an easygoing convo that I let him lead, and he asked me things like “what are your hobbies?”, “what does a typical day look like for you?”, “how’d you become interested in your passion?”

After talking for 1.5 hours, he then told me he’d been seeing someone for years, and then started telling me that I’m amazing, and that maybe if he were single he might’ve been interested. I was in shock, and weirded out. He assured me that his girlfriend knew all about this, and was “pushing even harder than he was for this to happen”?! 

I told him he could’ve just told me he had a gf over text. He said it took a lot of courage to do what I did so he wanted to do it in person, though now he saw that he’d led me on and that “next time” he would tell people over text he has a gf. 

I messaged him a few hours later saying that I felt like I was being used as an ego boost, he said he wasn’t and that he was just confused about what the call was since I’d mentioned “getting to know each other”, so he didn’t know it had to be a date. 

So what gives? I said sorry for being confusing about the call. I know I could’ve been more direct- I (mistakingly) thought he’d been flirty with me (which I told him was my bad) so I hadn’t spelled things out. From my messages he did understand that I was interested in him though, and so did his girlfriend, so I’m still confused why he talked to me knowing I was interested and didn’t tell me beforehand about his gf.

I never say this stuff, but as time goes on it just gets more solidified.

1) Average women have significantly more and better options than average men do.

2) What women say and what women do are two completely different things. At least that's what I've observed by living with a bunch of women roommates. ""I want a gentlemen who's a good listener and takes things slowly."" Then they go and date a total douchebag who pumps and dumps on the first date.

3) Men already know how to seduce women. It's in their DNA from thousands of years. They don't need a stupid PUA book to tell them what to do. The problem is a lot of men have such horrible self esteem and anxiety nowadays that they second guess themselves. If they just got out of their own way and let things naturally happen, they would be fine.

4) ""I ghost because of safety reasons"" is just a BS excuse. Your safety isn't in jeopardy texting ""I didn't feel a connection, but wish you the best!"" The dude you met at Martha's Cupcake Shop was very nice and looking for love in the same respect you are. He's not Jeffery Dahmer. Show him 2 sentences of decency for he knows to unmatch and try again with someone else.

5) 30 years old and living at home with parents making $10.00 an hour as a woman? No big deal, but if you're a man in the same circumstance...immediate first date deal breaker.

6) Don't bother asking for clarification if you've been dumped after a few dates. No one, both men and women, are honest with it. They don't want to hurt your feelings. You'll just get a generic ""Our personalities just didn't click well"" excuse. The real reason, you'll never know.

7) People make assumptions without asking questions. I have a friend who has an etrade acct with a few million and he works in retail. He struggles getting past the first date when he tells women he works at Macys. They think he's broke when the dude can retire today.

8) Pictures are everything, so make sure you have good ones on your OLD acct. Buy a tripod with a clicker and have at it.

9) Dating as a single mom is very hard. Dating as an ugly woman is very hard.

I (24F) have been on dating apps on and off for years. Also been on Reddit forever.

I am so frustrated going on Reddit and seeing how bitter some men are here.
Just recently went to a post where one of the top comments are about how “all women cheat.” Almost every post has something like this, where men are simply hating on women because they’re alone and bitter. Grouping all women together how were judgmental, terrible at replying, ghost, etc. This is literally in the rules not to do this, yet I see it everywhere.

I’ve been cheated on, multiple times. I have had many men lead me on, lie to me, ghost me. I try to send thoughtful messages and often get no reply. I’m also tired of getting rejected. But you know what? Not all men are like this and not all men are bad.
So if women can accept that there are good guys out there, can men stop filling up dating subreddits about how terrible women are? I’m having a bad time dating too and just because I may have more options doesn’t mean they are quality options who actually treat me with respect, and coming onto a subreddit where an entire gender is hated on this much is ridiculous. If you wouldn’t say it to your sister or daughter, don’t say it to women on the internet. We’re real women too!

Im slightly above average in the looks department, I work out regularly, BUT I'm 5'8 so that definitely cuts down my matches. This is Just my experience, I'm sure its different for others. I am also located in a mid sized city in the southeast US that I just moved to about a month ago- so im using current stats for my matches/dates per week.

Tinder- In my opinion its overall the best option. Obviously its meant for hookups, however there are definitely exceptions to this. I've had 2 serious relationships come out of this app. The reason I say its the best option is because it has THE LARGEST consumer pool out of all the online dating apps, therefore giving you access to many more people... however a large percent of those people will lie outside of your preferences. This brings up one of the biggest cons tinder has, the lack of ability to set preferences. This makes tinder a much more casual app, you can set up a profile in under 5 minutes and just start swiping. This leads to TONS of people using it solely for validation or even just because theyre bored. (I probably get 10 likes a week, with 3 matches, and maybe a date a week)

Bumble- this app is definitely the common ground between hinge and tinder. It has an interesting concept, forcing the woman to make the first move. If you do match with a woman, there is an extremely high chance she will message you- as the chances are shes on bumble (instead of tinder) in order to find someone that fits into her type (bumble lets you display height, exercise, education, political leaning etc). It also allows you to set discussion prompts, which can really make you stand out if you put in the time to create some original content. Overall bumble allows you to find more serious possibilities, coming at the cost of less users- giving you less dates. ( i probably get 4/5 matches a week, with maybe a date a week)

Hinge- this is by far the most serious dating app in my opinion. If youre on hinge- most of the time you want a relationship- no hookups. This is one reason I like this app, as you dont have to waste your time with people that just want a one night stand. Like bumble, it allows you to set preferences and put in your own information. The biggest thing this app has going for it is that you get an extremely limited number of swipes a day. This signifies to the person you swipe on that you are ACTUALLY interested and not just there for validation or out of boredom. (I get maybe MAYBE 2 matches a week, that can realistically turn into 2 dates a week)

Here is some advice in general for all the apps. First, make it clear what your intentions are (fwb, casual, or serious) Second, dont lie- for example as i mentioned I'm short for a guy- so it turns many people away. THATS OKAY, what are you gonna do if you lie about something and then get into a relationship? Finally, and most importantly, vet the people you match with for a while before going out on a date. The first step to this is to move off the dating app ASAP, get their number or whatever you prefer. Talk to them for a few days- not excessively, but just make sure they are who they claim to be and that they seem like a decent person. I used to just go on a date the same day we matched, and that gives you many more catfish or just shitty people in general that you could have weeded out.

As the title says, i'm currently in the middle of one of life's cruelest jokes. I'll try be brief, I was recently accepted into a PhD program in Denver, so i'll be moving away in a few months. Because of this, I was looking to have as much fun as possible over the summer before I left (mostly casual dating).

Well, of course, life throws me a curve ball. A few weeks ago, I *happen* to decide to quit my night job, my friends *happen* to call me to go downtown and I just *happen* to meet a very wonderful and sweet woman. She tells me she's moving to New York in a month or so. I say i'm leaving for Denver. Perfect. No strings attached.

Naturally, these past few weeks with her have been some of the best ""dating"" experiences i've ever had. However, she's leaving this Sunday.

We both like each other and would be dating if life wasn't taking us in two different directions. I'm M26, so i'm under no illusion that i'll never love again or something dramatic like that, but it is a very bittersweet feeling to meet someone who you feel you could have a strong relationship with but it just won't work for reasons out of your control.

However, she has a problem that was not noticeable from the photos. She is really fat and really short. This is a huge turn off for me because I am very tall and athletic and I value physical fitness a lot.

I know that this may sound superficial, but I decided to not date her again because I did not feel physically attracted. 

However, I must have made a good impression to her because she kept calling me. After two weeks, she asked me if I want to meet her again.

Now I am really conflicted,  because I was sure to end the story, but her beautiful character and her persistence (she always writes very warm and gentle messages to me) makes me think that it will be difficult to find one with such great qualities.

I just genuinely wanted to spend some time with her. Everything is going well. We’re talking a lot it seems like she likes me (this was the first time we have hung out 1 on 1 btw). Then on the couch we were doing this like play fighting thing where I was trying to take something from her. She was laughing and it was all very playful. I decide to reach my arm behind her to grab whatever we were fighting for and when we stopped I just kinda left it there. So now my arms around her and I’m worried she won’t be into it but then she leans onto me and puts her head on my chest.

Not sure what I want, and I’ve been very open about that. They’ve all shown they want to be serious with me. How can I avoid hurting anyone?

Alright, so 28 year old bisexual guy with a deep rooted commitment phobia. I haven’t been in a serious, committed relationship since high school, but I’ve dated around quite a bit since then. 

At the start of the year, I was feelin’ a bit lonely and unsatisfied, so told myself I was going to start casually dating around again and meeting people. I set expectations for myself, thought about what I really wanted, and promised myself that I’d be honest with whomever I “date” about my intentions. And then I started meeting people. 

I never realized how messy it could get it. I’m currently talking to three people — two guys and one girl. They’re all so different from one another, but I get along with all of them pretty well. I’m talking to these individuals somewhat regularly, and have been pretty open and honest with each of them.

The stickiness comes from the fact that all three want to be in committed relationships with me. I’ve been totally open about dating around and not jumping into anything serious, but it’s getting pretty messy anyway. 

I tell them I don’t know what I want, and that it’s not fair for them to wait around for me to figure it out. I think one of the biggest hurdles is that we’re all in our mid to late twenties, and, from what I’ve seen, a lot of people are just ready to settle at this age. I have a hard time believing any of these three people have actually fallen in love with me, especially since I haven’t known any of them that long. 

Realistically, I could see myself being in a relationship with any one of them for different reasons, but I don’t want to do that until I’m sure of it. I don’t think I’m going to know that anytime soon though. I feel like I’ve put myself in a *The Bachelor* type situation, and it’s honestly not great.

Maybe it’s my fault or idk what it is. Basically I never talked or interacted much with guys till I was 20. I’ve had enough of it and I wished I could have a boyfriend and be in a relationship. So I decided to put myself out there.

I’m kinda introverted and quiet girl but I tried to become more outgoing and interactive and it did work since guys started paying attention to me.

Since I didn’t have any kind of previous experience with men, I was kinda naive in my thinking.

Not knowing why I always attract the same kind of male. You could describe them as a realistic “Mr Grays”. Yeah from the books/movies.

They’re dominant, like rough sex, can choose and pick in multiple women and the females will gladly fall into their arms, they’re handsome and so on but they don’t want anything more than fwb relationship.

As I said I was inexperienced and naive… maybe I still am since I keep falling in the same trap.

So I met a few guys till one managed to push the right buttons, crack the code and seduce me. He took my virginity and we’d meet from time to time… as you guessed for sex and spending some time together. 

After some time passed I started noticing he’s been keeping his distance more. He wouldn’t text with me as often as he used to, he’d only invite me for sex, etc.

It was because as an experienced guy he started noticing I started falling for him. 

So the last time we met (I didn’t know it’d be the last time at that point), we were cuddling and relaxing and I had my head on his shoulder and was looking at his face’s every feature and he’s eyes were closed. He looked so peaceful and I was smiling, happy I met him and that maybe there might be sth more between us.

I seriously didn’t know that this type of a man doesn’t do relationships… it’s just about sex.

So he probably felt me looking at him and he opened his eyes. He looked me in the eyes for a few seconds and said “please… don’t look at me this way”. 

I was like “what do you mean..?” And he replied with a serious statement “listen I’m not a guy you deserve.. someone like you deserve someone better, that’ll actually take you seriously.. idk if you’ve noticed but I’ve been keeping you at a distance because there can’t be anything more than that between us..”

I looked at him and actually deep down in my heart I knew that was the case all this time and I was just wishfully thinking I found a guy I could spend my life with. I just replied after looking into his eyes “I know” and buried my face in his shoulder. 

We laid this way for a few more minutes till my phone rung and I sat up to pick it. It was my mom asking me to get home cuz she had some business with me.

I turned to him and smiled saying “I gotta go”.. He noticed my smile was kinda forced and there was a tear running down my cheek but he didn’t say anything.

I got up immediately, packed my things and left after saying “goodbye”.

That night I didn’t sleep at all… I only silently cried. It was actually the first guy that I had feelings for as previously before I “put myself out there”, no man was ever interested enough to ask me out.

I was kinda numb for the next few days and then I just let it go. 

A few weeks later that guy texted me again being “sorry” he didn’t text me earlier and after we chatted about random stuff for a bit, he said that he wishes to meet with me and enjoy each other’s company.

I wrote him all I had stored in my mind and heart. It was a long message and at the end I tanked him for all the good time we’ve had and refused to meet for only sex again. I also added that I have no hard feelings nor do I think he used me and so on. 

That was the last time we talked. Neither him nor I texted again. Probably that was for the best. 

I came across another guy and he was same - sex is all that will be between us. So I left immediately after knowing that and turns out he ghosted me at the same time. I didn’t develop any feelings for him so it didn’t really influence me especially since we didn’t know each other for long,

Not too long ago I’ve met another guy. And I knew he was attracted to me as much as I to him. Today I got to know he’s also the same type of guy my first is. And all he wants from me is sex.

Truth to be said I’m kinda tired of this whole thing. At this point I can feel it in my bones that I’ll never be in a real relationship nor will I ever get married. I’m just incapable of finding the right kind of guy. 

I feel like not having a boyfriend during school years made “disabled” in a sense… I know it’s a strong word but idk how to describe it.

Before the third guy I’ve just described, I met a truly good guy and he didn’t pressure me with any sexual stuff or anything. He was really carrying and understanding to me.

We even started planning future together… But… after some time sth changed. And after I asked him “is sth wrong..?”, he admitted that before he met me, he had his future all planned out and he was actually planning on staying a bachelor till the end of his days.  

After I heard it I was already heartbroken because I truly felt we had a connection and all. 

He added that he can’t come up with how he could incorporate me in his dreams. And whatever to come, he’ll be there as my friend. Yeah I guess I understood what the meaning of being friendzoned really is..

And don’t get me wrong. It’s actually him that started giving me hopes and speaking about relationship and future together. I could imagine myself being with him so I thought “why not give it a shot..?”

But I really did grow in affection for that guy despite us not being together nor even kissing yet. He was really respectful and préfères to move slowly, which I actually appreciated. 

So hearing him saying all there would probably be between us is friendship hurt enough to shatter my heart.

All I did was put a smile on my face and say “I understand. Don’t worry, I’ll support whatever decision you’ve taken. Your dreams are really important and you should focus on those”.

He added “you know… if only I met you 3-4 years ago, we’d actually be together and you’d be part of my future”.

That night I cried again.

By now I just gave up and have no hopes. I probably keep meeting the third guy I described just because. After I’ll notice I’m starting to have feelings what will happen, I’ll leave again. After all, for those guys such feelings are only a nuisance, an unnecessary burden that they don’t want. 

Of course not all man are like that. The fourth guy is the prime example. But I’m just tired of it all. Why is modern society like so…

1. Met girl way hotter than me at a party. We bonded over common topics and started talking on Instagram.

3. She's way hotter than me and is seeing other guys. She's constantly telling me ""how cute I am"" but I knoe it's in a friendly way. (I'm definitely in the friendzone)
4. Last week I went for her birthday party where she paraded me as the 'nicest guy'. Spent the entire night talking to only me (amongst like 10 of her other friends). I left with her and dropped her drunk ass home and went back home. 
5. I can't help thinking about her, until her birthday I was okay being just her friend because I don't want to date her anyway (atleast that's what I thought) 
6. We are absolutely different, she's a party girl and I'm more of a have a quiet dinner kinda guy. I work in IT and she works at Versace lol. So there's pretty much nothing. 
7. I tried icing her out and not responding immediately, she messaged me saying how much she misses talking to me and we don't talk as much. 
8. She responds when she feels like and sometimes gets weirdly passive

The pandemic came along and obviously I’ve felt loneliness like most single folk out there. I have tried dating apps , Tinder being the main one, and over the last year while I’ve had matches , they have been with women who I just don’t want to date. I’m someone who’s educated, worked all his life, and my very last match was with a woman who’s been out of work for 8 years….  Nope, and it’s not like she was spending that time raising kids or caring for someone. And there’s been a crap ton of ghosting too.
So basically I ended up deleting Tinder, as I thought I might as well embrace singledom than damage my mental health during the pandemic 

The pandemic has made things a lot harder, I’m permanently working from home , in the past I actually met a girlfriend while I was just grabbing lunch,  but now possibilities like that are gone too. This thought actually saddened me. I don’t have a huge social circle, my best friend is 30 and female ,she’s in a happy relationship so we don’t really hang out as much as we used to, although we do try and meet up once a week. I do feel like a male Pam (The Office) in that I miss spending time with my bestie, and don’t worry I don’t have any romantic feelings for my friend, but I miss goofing around and talking about the most random things with her

Anyway this is a long post already, but I was hoping for some advice, I don’t care if you’re male or female, but some tips on how to cope being single and childless at 40 would help. Ordinarily I wouldn’t have been so worried about my future but now that I’m also working from home, I’m going a day or two often without interacting with a human and I know this isn’t good for my health. I would like to settle down with someone, start a family ,  but I honestly don’t even know how that’s going to be possible in my situation. It just seems like 2020 has wrecked my life.

Today she apologized and said “I’m sorry, you’re right. I don’t want to lead you on and I should just tell you: I don’t see a future relationship for us”

And yeah I should have taken the hints better,  probably, but it feels a little nice to have stood up and said “listen stop making plans and acting like you want to see me and bailing.” And have her recognize it and apologize. 

(We tried dating before but timing was off and she would send shit reminding me of our dates occasionally, send me excited things about doing things together and then stop talking when I tried to nail down problems)

I’m trying to analyze why I kept trying and figure out what to do going forward.The truth is, and this sounds a little pathetic, as much as I knew it was a long shot… it was the only shot I had. I don’t have a ton of other things going right now. Not else is on the horizon and SOME SHOT was better then nothing. At least it was nice to have hope. 

And it feels like a double edged sword because trying when you barely got a shot feels a little hopeful but let’s be real, made me feel and look desperate… cuz I was.

I mean I am. Honestly. I want something. I want love. I have had one real relationship and I loved being with someone. I loved being a boyfriend. 


There is a line of self worth. I wanna put everything I have in to it but man… trying to hard doesent look good. There is a balance I don’t feel I have. I don’t know how to not feel desperate because the chances just are far and few and that kind of sucks.
