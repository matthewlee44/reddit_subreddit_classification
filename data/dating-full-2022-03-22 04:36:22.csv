She really matched my energy and seemed to take an interest in me as much as i did her.

I asked her to lunch and she said she was down for that.

She also apologized for being so busy due to school which is why it took her so long to respond. We met up today, got coffee and went for a walk and it was great! We talked a lot and laughed a lot and I felt like we really clicked. At the end of the walk when we got to her dorm I ended up telling her that I like her and I want to take her out sometime. 

She asked for the where and when so we made plans to go to this place in town whenever her schedule is cleared up, possibly Friday. Before she left I asked her if I could give her a hug and she gave me one saying a hug was okay and that she liked hugs but it felt a tad bit awkward. It was kind of a side hug. She then said see ya and went inside. I can't help but feel like I kind of made a mistake in trying to give her a hug at this point but everything else went great and I think I might be overthinking.

One of the workers behind me asked if I needed any help and as I was saying “no I’m good” I turn to look at her and my gut does the funny thing yknow like it was a jump scare how cute she was. So i looked at the shoes and found a pair I wanted to try on and I ask her if she has any in my size. She goes away and comes back with 3 different pairs 😭 of different styles of shoes. I tell her thank you so much and I try them all on and I spend extra time doing so because I didn’t wanna up it and leave and never see her again. She asks how everything’s going and I’m kinda just stalling with deciding, her whole demeanor/energy or whatever was so positive and it kinda pulled me out of a shitty day I was having. I also snuck in a compliment on her sweater bc it was cool. So I buy the shoes and she rings me up and I leave the store (it’s in a mall) and I just feel like i missed a chance. 

So I go to another store for a bit and head back to the shoe store to get some socks bc I needed new ones anyway. And I walk in and a different female employee says “welcome back” so they obviously remembered me. I got helped by another guy for some socks, and I’m looking at them for a bit and the girl is walking around getting closer. I tell the guy that I suck at deciding “like earlier” and I look at the girl and we both laugh about me deciding about the shoes. So I buy a pack of socks and I tell the dude that if I like them I’ll be back another day to get more (excuse to come back lol). That was the end of that instance. 

I had some free time today so I thought I’ll go to the mall and worst case just get some underwear cuz I need some, and check if she’s even working when I pass by the store. I pass by the store and scan it and don’t see her. So I buy my undies and head back the other way and still don’t see her but I see the girl that said “welcome back” last time, and I’m pretty sure she saw me.

Big question is: do I go back like in a week or so (same weekday she originally worked) to try again? Or does that seem weird. It would be the 3rd time that the second girl saw me. I’m not scared of the whole “shooting my shot” part, like if the girl was there today I would’ve shot my shot and left. It’s just the “returning to the store (that nobody frequents) that the coworkers remember your face” part. Female advice would help because I don’t wanna be creepy.

His face isn’t ugly or anything like that and he had a nice voice so I was down to meet up. In person he’s a bit on the shorter side -I’d be taller than him in my lowest heels- and he’s not my typical type body wise he’s chubby and normally the guys I’ve been with have all been pretty anal about their workout regimen and things like that. 

We’ve hung out a few times and he’s really nice, unintentionally funny and considerate [this is the beginning so idk if he’s going to stay that way] but there was no immediate attraction so the other day I went over to his apartment with the intention of letting him know I saw him more as a friend than a partner. Somehow he got his mouth around my nipple and we ended up having sex with a condom and It was really good like the best sex I’ve ever had with a condom. 

I hate condoms because I’ve never had a good time with them on so I normally just wait until I’m in a committed relationship and we both know we’re clean and feel comfortable going raw 

Now I’m conflicted because we hung out tonight and had sex again and again 👨🏽‍🍳👍🏽🤪. If his personality stays the same I could see something long term but I’m not attracted to him until AFTER we start the foreplay and all of his foreplay isn’t all that 
•he was laying on my chest so his hand had easy access to my crotch area and he did this weird thing where he rubbed the hard part of his palm on the outside of my vagina kinda hard it started to burn a lil and that’s when I was like “this guys a virgin were for sure just gunna be friends”. This was literally right before the nipple sucking so I hadn’t said anything about only being friends yet• 
The thing is I like to be dominant at times, like I’ll lay back and take it no problem but when it’s my turn you better be ready,plus I know guys don’t always want to initiate the sex but I don’t see myself starting anything. When I was riding him the faces he made were kinda ugly and I know sex faces aren’t cute but…. 

I don’t want to ask him to change because he’s comfortable as he is or so he seems but I think I’d be more attracted to him if he were to gain some muscle. Also this is only the beginning of the relationship so it doesn’t feel right to even think about talking to him about it because what right do I have??? So what do I do?? 


Also side note our last round of having sex we were doing it from behind and he took the condom off and said he came (in the condom) but I didn’t feel it -he cums very animatedly so I’d’ve noticed- then he went to the bathroom and came back and layed down then asked me to give him head which I find odd because we just went 2 rounds and you literally just came so why???? I think he might have stealthed me if I hadn’t been paying attention but I didn’t say anything because I didn’t wanna be paranoid, I had an ex do it so I made sure to be on the look out since I admittedly dont know him very well.

I've used to tinder and bumble right now. Because I'm a shy guy and it's really hard for me to talk with women I don't know. Tinder is not a good place for me so I moved to bumble which has more elite people and no bots as I see. I got a good profile which leads me match at least 10-15 people (although I don't always swipe right). I'm lookin for women who wants a longtime relationship. I just wanna fall in love, write/say my good wishes for everyday. I've met Estonian, Russian, Ukrainian, Turkish women for years. Age range is 28-44. By the way I'm 39. So I don't think it's about nationality. Everything is normal while we are in an activity. Sometimes hiking, sometimes a concert or just walking together or drinking coffee, you name it. I also don't intend to kiss on first date. That may be my mistake because I think and tell them I wanna go forward step by step. I'm not brad pitt but I think that I'm a good looking guy with athletic body. Not rich but I could efford all the payments while we're together. As a negative thing I got some white hairs and not like a confident person when talking. They may think that I'm too shy. When I say that ""I wanna know more about you"", they say I'm a good guy but not the one they're looking for. They just want fwb although they don't say it directly. Always ends like that. 

So, today I lost my hope. Called my last date and offer her going to a concert together. She said yes but also refused my dinner together offer. She said that I'm just a good friend for her and I don't think I'll call her again. I think I'm searching in the wrong place. The apps are only for ons even their profile says the opposite way. I want to quit from dating apps and meet in real life even it's really hard to me but I think it will be the same result for me. I got a couple of real life experience too, with the same ending.

I don't think I can change myself. I don't lie, I don't cheat (but sometimes I do while playing cards), it's not in my blood. Ons are not for me. If I have sex at the first date, I don't respect her, so I just cannot do it. Still I got a little hope but I don't know how. Should I continue using apps or totally delete them? Should I just wait for a good one or should I do something else?

Warning: This is indeed actually quite long story ;)

**Prologue and some basic info about me**

In 2016 I undergone coming-out that I am not ""straight"" but actually yes after I got brief and low quality date with my 1st GF in 2015-2016. I realised I am an hetero-demi-romantic asexual, which means I like idea of being in relationship with girl, but I want to completly exclude sexual dimension from our physical intimacy and also I am not falling into love instantly, rather gradually and basically in sync with friendship quality build-up.

I also have since my 4 years diagnosed asperger syndrome. This means I have a lot of scientific interests, I am very pragmatic and also I am driven mostly by ""brain"" in relationship, than by ""heart"" when it comes to relationship and I mostly learned how to be in relationship from guides, advices and manuals. If anyone watches TV series ""Good Doctor"", I am basically Shaun Murphy in mild version.

This set of properties is quite hard combo to get ""compatible"" partner and I was completly aware of it when I calculated probability of getting compatible counterpart. ( I estimated it to 1 : 12500 chance taking into many variables and estimates )

**First time bumping into my current girlfriend (3rd one and current one)**

The story begun in Sep-2014 when I joined school trip into CERN facility in order to explore the LHC, whole facility and also Geneva after this. This was during my high-school studies (equivalent to CZ - gymnásium or UK - grammar school). After we had explored LHC we travelled into French town Annemasse in order to get back into hotel and Flunch (local fast-food). When I had been waiting on parking lot for our rented bus, I bumped into girl that attracted my attention because she completly ommited small-talk and I was feeling that she basically has more sophisticated mindset compared to average in her age range. For some reason I did not invite her to any kind of 1:1 appointment or started casually spending time together. Few months later I graduated (passed maturita exam which is required in order to pass certain types of high schools in Czech Republic) and on ""maturitní ples"" (prom equivalent here) I was only with my parents and friend. She kept studying, because as she was younger than me, she had to study this school for 3 more years.

**First relationship - fail but actually not, asexual coming out and 2nd attempt**

Meanwhile on university 2015) I got into short-term relationship after my friend attempted match-making. (Between Oct-2015 - Jan-2016) It was generally bad experience, but I finally satisfied my wish to experience romantic feelings, got first experience, improved soft-skills and it also opened topic of my identity. Which lead into my asexual coming-out as explained in second paragraph.

I discovered after breaking up with 1st GF, that I need to specialise on asexual girls and because of this I should be more ""systematical"" becauase meeting randomly asexual is quite rare (1 % of population is estimated to be asexual). For that reason I created account on one of Czech asexual forums which I also has online dating module. This was in Feb-2016 and few weeks after that I submitted post that I am looking for long term relationship with asexual girl where I also specified in about 2 little paragraph, what I would (not) like to see in relationship and what I can offer with refference to my account there.

**Second relationship (GF no. 2)**

I finally got some reasonable answer in Jul-2016 and when I saw she had declared herself as heteroromantic asexual and from her writing I noticed she is not too simple person and we have mutual interests I have proposed to meet each other in person still without intention to make a date out of it.

Meetup was neither fail nor success, because at time when we were supposed to meet sudden thunderstorm with strong donwpours had come and at the place where she had been wating, lightning struck only about 300m (\~ 1000 ft) next to her. Afterwards we moved to local café which I suggested. We exchanged more private information and that event confirmed me, she might be compatible with me.

After four more meetups we started feeling romantic attraction and we declared ourselves as couple. This was in Aug-2016. We had a nice romantic relationship, we loved each other, managed to keep alive middle distance relationship (about 2.5 hours by train) and I thought we were ideal match. However the downside was that she was not that eager as I expected to share information about her psychological problems (depression, using SSRI antidepressants) and she was quite moody, basically from super happy to annoying and grumpy, which I did not like. Partly because this was part of her personality and partly due to non-ideal antidepressants, which amplified that. This escalated up to few strong arrguments and after I saw there is no progress, I gave up on this we broke up. (Oct-2017)

**Long phase of being single and temporary fail**

This break-up was for me quite hard, because while I used to love her (2nd GF) I also hated a lot of her properties. It had taken me about 2 years to completly stop thinking about her and stopped seeing her in my dreams. Meanwhile I had to pause my university studies, I switched to full-time job and studies to part-time.

For my surprise I noticed, that during Prague Pride 2018 there was planned meeting of asexuals. For that reason I joined, I wanted to see who else has the same orientation + exchange experience. This was nice and important event for me. Which eventually lead into creating Czech asexual Facebook group next year (Aug-2019) in order to replace old forum, where a lot of people started being passive and got flooded by spam and sh\*tposts.

I noticed when there was large surge of welcome posts and among them was one, which attracted my attention, because she had as mutual friend physics professor from my high school. That was quite weird for me and after some public answers below the post we switched into private messages. We learned, we were those students, who had met on that parking lot in France during our school trip into CERN and that she is also asexual, which was for me great discovery and chance. That was in Aug-2019. Initially it looked promising, but after few days she told she was by that time taken, I accepted that and kept respecting virtual friendship but for some reason she stopped answering after about 2 weeks after I learned she is taken.

I assumed this was a forever lost chance, however due to fact I finally handled completly break-up with 2nd GF and I aimed more on getting independent counting with option I might remain single for long time it actually did not make me as much disappointed as I expected.

**Finally meeting old-new girl**

After that pause I posted a video on my personal facebook account in Jan-2021, where was my bird feeder swamped by long tailed tits. For some reason Facebook dropped that video in few minutes, probably because it evaluated ""tits"" from that bird specie name as sexual content, so I got strike, which I appeled and was eventually lifted (there were only birds :) ). I posted screenshot of this as joke post on asexual FB group. The same girl from section above also responded firstly under the post and later into private messages which also rekindled our chatting.

After this I started to like more birds, bird observing. From sporadic chatting we moved to regular chatting. I asked her indirectly, how she is doing well with her boyfriend (I assumed she was still taken). I got information, she had broken up with her boyfriend few months ago. After this I realised there is a chance as soon as she handles break-up, I get ready to dating / getting into relationship and finally COVID restriction are lifted up. There was regional lockdown in Czech Republic during Jan-Mar-2021, so any meetup / date in person would have been impossible.

From my point of view it had super slow progress and I was afraid, this will end up with eternal friendzone. I was almost at the point I wanted to give up, but that perfect match on paper was actually something I did not want to give up. The list of properties I liked was:

* Mutual interests
* Both PC gamers
* Both asexual and hetero-romantic
* Both having asperger syndrome (we understand each others abnormality :D )
* Being less than 10 km / 6 mi next to each other
* Being very nice to animals, especially to cats, birds and dogs
* Being 3 years apart in age (26M / 23F), rational approach but also open to romantic approach
* Being tolerant to meeting friends of opposite gender
* Direct, honest, transparent and pragmatic communication

Eventually we agreed on meeting us in person in local cat café in Jun-2021 (café where live cats can walk among guests and even jump on your lap) without intention making a US style date out of it. We repeated this several times. However the issue was, she was not very eager having physical contact (like hugging, cheek kiss, etc.), actually we started hugging on arrival and after escorting her to the bus stop after 3 months.

**Upgrading from friendship**

Frequency of our meetups started rising up during Nov-2021, I was introduced into some family secrets and our communication became more personal and some compliments slipped into our talking. In order to disrupt that stalemate I risked and wrote slightly romantic message where I mainly stated I was pleasantly surprised, I was feeling relaxed with her and reached break-even point being happier together than without each other. This opened question, whether we should move to relationship straight away or later. We postponed answer to this question to time after university exam period.

On 12th January 2022 we visited us at my home, so my mother could meet her in person. During discussion she called me ""boyfriend"". After we moved into my room and played some PC games, she asked if I am O.K. about status quo ""boyfriend"". I gratefully accepted her offer and asked the same question vice versa if she feels O.K. if I start calling her ""girlfriend"".

It's not you, it's them. Read on… 

Perhaps this is common wisdom here, but I'm new and this just dawned on me. My theory is that these people had no interest in you to begin with. They were bored and needed a conversation partner to kill time. You came along and they used you for entertainment. Here are a few tell tale signs:

1. Starts conversation over weekend. Typically Saturday or Sunday evenings.

2. Very enthusiastic to ask you a lot of irrelevant questions like your favorite pizzaria or where you go for a run. The interest is not real and is a way to keep the conversation going. Like pressing ""next episode"" on Netflix.

3. Insanely quick response times. Remember, they are bored and you are entertainment.

4. Very forthcoming but there is a subtle reluctance to share any type of personal information. However will be happy to complain about things in their life past or
current. They will throw you a tit bit here and there to keep your attention alive.

5. Ignores or jumps over texts that's hint at an Meeting in real life. Sometimes, engages in these topics in an overly playful manner almost making making it sound fictional or making slight of the situation.

If you can think of Anything else, leave a hint for your fellow redditors in the comments. 

So next time you get too invested in a person, or you are trying to dissect a ghosted conversation - watch for these makers. Remember to keep your emotional
distance and more often than not, it's really not you it's them!!!

4. Decently fit. Nothing Herculean, but I can comfortably jog 3km and do 8 pullups. I've gained 5kgs of muscle since new year, so I'm feeling pretty good.
5. Other interesting hobbies. I solve rubik's cubes, juggle, ride unicycle (the plan is to combine all three at once lol), and play piano. To be fair, the hobby I spend the most time on is gaming, but none of the toxic multiplayer stuff - I prefer single player.

She knew I was leaving town for a week to visit family after I left her place, but I still reached out once while I was gone just to catch up. When I came back I asked her out, but turns out she was busy and already made plans with her friends to go out and what not.

2 weeks later after I went radio silence she initates a text saying that she has been very busy lately, but that she hasn't forgotten about me and that I was on her mind. She was saying stuff like ""So Im guessing we're netflix and chilling soon? ;)"" So I set up another date for the next week because I had a lot of stuff going on, but she is unsure what she got planned for the next week and says it depends on her schedule.

it's been like 7 weeks and i have missed her, but i'm still unsure/ not confident about this relationship. i wouldn't mind continuing a casual relationship, however before i broke up with her she mentioned that she would like things to become more serious and have a real committed relationship and that is a big reason why i ended things, bc i needed to clear my head and wasn't confident with that. It would be hurtful to her to string her along when if i told her i forgave her but was still skeptical. I miss the intamacy + moments we had and she was like a best friend to me and was pretty supportive to my mental health overall. the sex was pretty legit bc it felt like i was having sex with my best friend. 

reading stuff on the internet doesn't help. i saw a reddit post on by some guy that classified himself as a serial cheater and he said a tactic he would use is admitting small infidelity to his partner to earn trust to continue his cheating. reading that internet shitpost made me question if she told me bc she is my bestfriend or if she is just tactical and that our connection just ""isn't that deep"".

After a couple of months he lost his mother so I reached out and comforted him and then his father also passed away and it was really hard he wouldn't answer any of our friends but me and we started talking again and got really close and that was in lock down. 
we met and talked and I bought him a gift to cheer him up and then I went home and I could feel that me bringing him a gift would freak him out and I only thought about it to cheer him up as a friend but he freaked out and stopped talking to me at all for about 2 months.
Then he reached casually with a message and I asked what was that and why did he disappear? He said that this his nature and it has nothing to do with me and he always does this to everyone including his family and once he has power to communicate again he reaches out, I told that it's not okay for me and I feel like he did that for me bringing gift and it's his way for pushing me away, he apologized and I said I can't do this anymore and we stopped talking.

For a year and a half I lost my grandma and I had my birthday and he never thought of reaching out and I was almost completely moved on then he called me last week and sending me messages that he wanted to talk to me urgently I didn't reply for a couple of days then he sent me a message that he's leaving out of country in a week and he wants to see me before that and then another voice note and a lot of missed calls so I replied he said that he misses me and he knows I missed him and he really wants to see me before leaving and that he's been dealing with depression and suicidal thoughts and he took a decision to share with me everything he feels or do and took an lsd (that was his third time) and he realized that I'm the only who can get him and see his true self we kept talking for like 3 hours telling me how much I'm different and special and there are other stuff he wants to share but he prefers to do it in person.
He told he drinks alcohol and hash from time to time and when I suggested that he needs therapy (I suggested before when we were friends) he said he isn't looking for an advice.
He also said he hooked up with a lot of women the past year but no one ever has the connection that we have. 

When I mentioned about grandma passing away he said he knew but didn't reach out to me as a respect for me asking him to stop talking to me which made me feel really bad .

I have a lot of feelings I can't figure what's right. 
I don't feel so in love any more all I could feel is fear and worry as he is a great person with a great traits and career I want help him out but I don't know how and I don't know if meeting him or not might affects him in any way. I'm thinking he might change and I have another voice in my head telling me that addiction to drugs and alcohol has no way back specially when he is refusing to get help.

But he has a gf now who he seems to be really happy with. As much as I respect their relationship, It hurts so much to see him with her. I basically cry every time I’m done hanging out with him because of it. I feel like I need to stop being friends with him because it’s hurting me and I feel like I’m lying to him. Although, I deeply care about him and don’t want to lose him as a friend. We have a really amazing friendship. If I could throw away these feelings and just have friend feelings towards him I would.

This is what I know love will entail. Working out differences in values and beliefs. Awkward, uncomfortable conversations. The pain of separation.

Still, though. Is my view of love a fairytale? Unreasonable expectations? As I'm typing this I want to just fall in love so I can see how mundane it actually is, and not want it so much anymore. Maybe then I can understand the joy of being single. Smash my rose-tinted glasses.

So there is this girl I like, same class but we aren't close, only typical stuff. A couple of months ago, I somehow confessed my feelings to her and immediately turned MYSELF down with grace 😅 (a story for another time). 

So one time, we had a break between classes at the time. She was sitting on someone's desk alone with her phone. I was exactly at the opposite direction of the classroom with my friends. And out of nowhere see calls my name and says ""can you come here for a little bit?"". No need to tell you I was taken by surprise but i approached her trying to be calm (My heart literally started beating so fast). And then she proceeds to write something in English with a pencil on the desk and asks me if I could tell her what it meant.  Basically to translate it (Context needed, I'm from a country in Europe, we don't speak English as a first language. And she didn't know English that well). So I read the phrase...""just tell me that you love me""...I looked her in the eyes for a moment and casually said to her exactly what it meant and then I just left and went back to my friends.

At that moment I really didn't understood anything, I thought that she really just wanted me to translate that for her. A lot of time has passed since then and I started thinking ""why didn't she ask her girlfriends, that were also in the classroom, to translate that?"" (they knew English well enough). Like ""why did she ask me of all the classroom? Especially after what had happened with me confessing to her, things were a tiny little bit awkward so it just didn't made any sense to me that she would talk me for that thing when her friends were there. 


For context, other things have happened too. I have caught her staring one time and joking casually with me (more like teasing, but I'm not sure). Also when I confessed she was in a relationship (I didn't know) but now she's not.

I ask you, would you stay or leave?

If I hypothetically would do something bad in the future and she starts to starve herself, is it my fault? I’ll feel that it’s my fault. And that’s too much for me to handle. I cannot see someone I care about starve themself with no power to change it. Would you?

It’s not worth it. But I like her, so it’s worth it. No, my energy won’t sustain when she’s in a bad place. The whole relationship will revolve around her mental disorder. 

I truly like her and we have a lot of things in common. Another problem is that she lives 2 hours away and she’s in a different place in life than me. Will a long-distance relationship work? Will mutual love be enough? 

She’s in a bad place and I feel that a relationship isn’t what she needs. But what do I know? Maybe that’s exactly what she needs?

Want to hear your thoughts.

I went on a first date on Friday but had plans before with friends (he took a while to respond so I went ahead and made other plans). We FaceTimed for an hour towards the end of the day and really hit it off (I think he wanted to make sure I wasn’t a catfish and i honestly wanted the same). We live only a few blocks from each other and go to the same gym (we live in a popular part of Manhattan for our age). I don’t typically have sex on the first date - I’ve only ever done that if I didn’t like the guy too much and didn’t see a future. If I was obsessed with the guy there is no way I would’ve succumbed. I haven’t gotten laid in a while since I’ve had my fun with casual sex and don’t particularly like it anymore, and don’t really like having sex with people I don’t like anymore. He was perfect because I was really into him but knew I wouldn’t be devastated if it didn’t work out. Plus after going out with friends I showed up with a few drinks in me. I was hesitant to have sex for the reason that I feel like it comes off poorly, takes away future anticipation, and may make the guy treat the situation like it’s more of a sex thing, and mostly I would be sad if I had sex with a guy on the first date and he ghosted because of that. He said he wouldn’t care but obv he would say that bc what guy wouldn’t. Obviously I know this is all rooted in misogyny and a double standard but it sucks that women have to feel this way regardless. I guess I’ve never had sex on the first date with a guy I was really into and I’m scared he’ll ghost because of it. I know some people get married after sleeping together on the first date, but I feel like that’s the exception. What is everyone’s experiences with this? Do you find if you have sex on the first date you more often than not get ghosted? I honestly don’t regret it but I guess I so badly want to believe guys don’t care about that, and whether they may not care consciously, I wonder if there’s some subconscious level that makes them less interested.

He was pretty clear and explicit and i had no reason to question what he was saying. He simply was not interested in me. But to be honest i was like wow, damn, that's harsh.
 the same text in which he rejected me (yes text...even though i'd see him in person 2 days later), he asked if we could be friends.  I respected his decision to dump me but I didnt see the reason to pretend to be friends, so I said it was ok, and we didnt have to be friends.   His response was ""LOL"" (um ok...) and he asked me what I told my other male friend. I found this perplexing. why was he asking me what I told my other friend? like how was that any of his business?  so i responded none of your business.  Now, I am not very good at texting and i forget that maybe it doesnt come off how i intended. I hadn't told my friend anything and wasn't planning to. if it ever came up i'd probably just tell him it didnt work out.  

so then the guy starts texting me all this stuff, like apologizing for hurting my feelings, telling me he's emotionally unavailable, and telling me to be ""civil.""  less than 5 minutes later I responded that he shouldnt worry about it, and i didnt tell my friend anything and it's fine, basically.  but apparently that 5 minutes was too long. He had already contacted my friend and sent him a long email saying how he ""really hurt my feelings"" and how he hopes we can be friends and bla bla bla.  (i requested that he show me, so he forwarded this).  I'm not THAT close to this friend, and I was very embarrassed.  I told the guy, ""are you trying to embarrass me?"" and he said no, and blamed me for being childish by telling him it was none of his business. he said he assumed i'd tell my friend something as he thought we were close.  

I was like ok just let it go, and i'd explain to my friend what was going on.  I was so annoyed and embarrassed. I didnt mean to be childish. this guy had JUSt rejected me. and I sincerely did not know why he was asking me questions. I didn't ask him what he tells his friends.. maybe it was my fault for saying that. but i was a little weirded out

well 2 days later i knew I was going to see him but i figured we'd just leave each other alone, and maybe it'd be a little awkward but we'd get over it.  well, instead, he comes right up to me acting like nothing happened, and is all fake and cheerful and even flirty with me. i was stunned. He tried to talk to me a few other times. he has invited me to a get together this weekend. (a group get together, not one on one).  he is acting like i'm being unreasonable not wanting to be friends with him

am I? or why can't he leave me alone? why did he said ""LOL"" when i said we didnt have to be friends?! like what's funny about that? is it really my fault that he contacted my friend? i'm really embarrassed but maybe i had it coming. 

but let's not forget that he REJECTED me. now it's MY fault? like does this guy have zero empathy? do i need to admit to him that i'm hurt for him to leave me alone? i sort of pretended it didnt bother me that much but i also made it clear (i thought) that i wasnt interested in being friends. i'm mortified that he contacted my friend",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1164273,public,self,"He already rejected me, so why can't he leave me alone now? what should I do?",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/tk7v2x/he_already_rejected_me_so_why_cant_he_leave_me/,no_ads,0,
