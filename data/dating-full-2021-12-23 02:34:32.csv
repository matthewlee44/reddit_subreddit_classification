I mean I did what I was supposed to... get advanced degrees, land a well paying job I actually am passionate about, built my own house, debt free, continuously take care of my health/fitness, travel, learn new things, etc.

People say when you don't search for someone, that's when they will land into your life. Well using that logic, it's been a long close to 4 years of being alone after a failed marriage that ended in divorce. In addition to numerous dates that ended up in either me paying for a meal, but most of the time getting ghosted.

I tried getting back on the online dating apps, and received a decent amount of matches albeit hard are bots with others trying to sell their only fans accounts. The people that I actually do connect with either dont want to put in the effort of doing something LD for the time being and/or ghost.

My fear is that over time I will just lose stamina and motivation to find someone because I'm putting the energy out there, but not receiving it in the end. Even typing this post feels like a waste of time at this point because what is the point anyways.

I (as well as many others) were sold lies about how life was supposed to be life...but it wouldn't be that miserable if we had each other around yet it seems everyone is afraid to make any form of connection despite saying that's what they want. Now I can see if you don't connect with someone or dont find them attractive as a means for not resuming a convo, but do you really think holding out on somebody else better is the best choice?

What happens is all the ""good"" guys like myself and others here will get tired, and grow weary of making any connection while the majority of women who put their career and passions first looking for Mr. Perfect will come crawling back. It's not an easy game to play and I know Im not owed anything - but damn, at least have the decency to follow up on messages you decide to message on.

With that being said, If you care to be with someone who isn't afraid to speak the truth. That is, someone who values truth more than lies - message me because I'll say things the way they are. I say all this knowing Im not perfect...Im not a 6 feet tall (5'7"") but I can't control that.... I dont have the fanciest hair - im actually losing it but I do sport a nice beard . I may not have the same level of fancy talk like others, but I sure can outsmart most ppl with an IQ of 142.

I might be obsessed with things, but I have an insane amount of self-discipline. I might not have balance in certain areas of my life, but it means the things I value - I put all my effort and heart into, which includes love.

I thought love died in me, multiple times in my life but their is all but a flicker left inside waiting for someone to ignite the flames...but Im growing weary and the light is illuminating dimly. I feel darkness entering in and its such a lonely existence which makes me wonder if this is even worth it.

last year- first couple dates were cool… i was attracted to her (me M24 her F27). we hooked up. then i started to get that paranoid feeling we didn’t click. shes very introverted compared to me. her occasional silence was typically when my anxious thoughts “not sure we click” etc came in. After about 3(4?) dates i called her and told her we should split.

fast forward a month, i realize im moving. i wind up texting her to see if she wants to get together strictly casually. we do that until i leave. i dont expect to see her again.


we keep in contact after i move. months pass. we wind up texting daily and calling every so often. she winds up coming on a vacation with me, but we agreed that would be final.


it isnt. we keep talking. long distance “talking” for a few months. we tell eachother we love eachother. i break things off with her because i dont want to become in love/commited through a virtual relationship—- (this is essentially the biggest problem/cause of stress) — its been 2 months since i ended things with her. i could buy a flight and go see her, im just terrified that those initial feelings of it “not clicking” will come right back, and therefore i will let her (and myself) down. i honestly came to lover her over text/calling, but would it be the same in person?

it makes me anxious thinking about it, but i could go see her. should i just do it? it seems like a big emotional risk for us both. i want to be responsible but i also want to love.

thank you for your thoughts.

I (f) have a crush on a guy that I see twice weekly at a regular activity. We have made small talk occasionally, our kids are friends, and we will continue to see each other twice weekly after the holidays

I had planned to ask him out one evening after the aforementioned activity, but he ended up not attending that night. I didn't want to lose my courage so I texted him afterwards, only to find out he had left that night on a work trip that makes him unavailable by phone except for short trips back to civilization. Haven't heard back in three weeks, so sent an IG request... Just in case? No acceptance or decline of that yet. I don't know if he's back yet or what his internet/cell service has been like. I am quite certain he wouldn't stay away over Christmas.

Seems I'm being ghosted, but I can't quite figure it out. There's no way he would have known I was going to ask him out, our kids are friends, and he's going to see me on a regular basis. If he is, it's a bit of an extreme reaction and I'm not quite sure what to do with it. If I'm genuinely confused, is it way out of line to ask him about it next time I see him? I understand that he is completely within his rights to not respond to me, but I kind of feel like I don't want to assume that given the situation.

I’m genuinely curious if somebody out there has experienced something similar and how did that make you feel? 

Both experiences had a lot of commonalities:

• Both dates broke up 3-4months ago.
• Both dates were with their exes for quite some time (1.5yrs &amp; 3 yrs).
• We had an intense month of dating with intense feelings, mutual for both parties 
• We spoke freely about their exes in the relationship 
• Both exes were girls who were emotionally unstable with suicidal thoughts, reaching out to my dates for “support” randomly one day 
• Both dates broke up with me overnight citing they want to give their exes a second chance and support them 
• Both exes were residing overseas and flew to him immediately when this happened

Even though both experiences were a few years apart, this has been shocking &amp; draining for me. Especially the following few days where I am aware that he is physically with his ex, it’s heart-wrenching with a mix of feeling betrayal.

So I've been talking to that girl on Instagram for about 3 or 4 months now. At first, I couldn't help but think about her all the time and was actually ready to be in a relationship.

But here's the issue, I think she had some apprehension meeting up because the first time we met was about 3 months after we've started talking because she was scared that I was a psychopath and that I would hurt her (which is normal to think about that when you meet someone online) 

And because we've taken too much time to have a first date, the feelings I've had died down and now, even though I have still some interest for her, it's clearly not enough for me to maintain a long relationship but I don't want to break her heart because I know she has feelings for me.

I think the next date, I'll be clear and will tell her that maybe we should separate, despite the fact that there's attraction.
It's selfish of me, you don't need to lecture me about it. But I don't want to date a girl to whom I'm doubtful of my feelings for.

1. We met at university 
2. We’re part of the same social group and have known each other for a few months, and study the same STEM university course. We are intellectually very compatible
3. We are well acquainted friends 
4. I’m tall (6’4) and athletic (average looking though)
5. She’s short (5’2) and very overweight and below average looking 

I’ve never had any affection or interest from girls before, let alone ones I was attracted to, so I figured I should bat within my league, looks fade, and personality is what matters most. 

This girl’s friend told me she’s into me and wants to ask me out. So I just went with it, first experience ever. 

Her personality is great, she’s super duper sweet. Did the whole intimacy thing. Kissing, cuddling and sex. I just felt profoundly grossed out. There were no butterflies, no heat in my stomach, no excitement. I did not want to kiss her, I did not want to touch her. It all just felt so wrong. 


It’s the two days after now, I’m sitting in my room in my apartment questioning if I’m just a shallow bastard, or if this looks thing is something I just can’t get over, or if I’m just not appreciating what I DO have in common with her, or no chemistry, or whatnot. 


The fact is, I have realised this about myself, I can’t be with someone, no matter how awesome their personality is, if they’re not conventionally attractive. And that hurts like hell, because I’m very average myself, so I will probably never find a girl who I’m attracted to who reciprocates my attraction.

I think i dress pretty well, but i havent been to succesfull in dating or better said; not at all. I dont get to go on dates, my tinder just does not get me matches and girls just dont seem intrested in me. 

Because of that im trying to rule the clothing aspect out (or blame it all on that). The way i dress is a shirt  buttond up all the way (yes even the very top button) and pants, never jeans but those cloth like soft pants (Brown, black, blue and grey). With ankle socks and sneakers, but not those running type sneakers, i guess the best way to describe them are skate shoes. The only other thing i always wear is my samsung smartwatch. Besides that i pretty much never leave the house without a parfum and/or deodorant.

Im a pretty slim person, not really muscular. I do have my height which is 1m86 or 6,1 (i believe). Hair is pretty short on the sides with a bit more length on top. Its combed to my left with matt paste (type of wax). Not that its flat, it does have volume in it, short side part is the best way i can describe it, no facial hare and pretty smooth looking skin. Light colourd eyes both kinda hazel but its hard to define the actual colour, they seem to change with the wa the light hits. One eye defenatly has some greyish blue tint on the left side my left eye (hard to see unless you look into my eyes). But the pupil in that eye isnt centerd and my eyelids also arent simetric, not a lazy eye, but one hangs a bit lower. I think i have a long neck (which i hate). And a slim face that kinda has the shape of an egg on its head. 

I know its hard to judge this through text, but if you could maybe tell me that it might be that the way i dress is to old fashioned (im pretty much the only 21y old that always dresses like i am attending a party) or my physique or a combination. That i look stiff, not fun to hang arround with? (Shy, quiet person. Been mistaken of being gay a couple of times when im certainly not. The one girl we had in class said i was the most masculine (dressing and acting) so i dont know anymore)

I would love for people my age to comment, not that i have anything against older generations, but they mostly love the way i dress. Especially old woman, so that might be a good indicator i dress like im from the 40's or something, so does this style give the impression that i am to much of a good guy/angel (doesnt translate well to english) that never would do anything bad and is not fun to hang around with, maybe even a ""know-it-all"" look or nerdy maybe? I dont see it like that thats why i need advice on what you think

(For those intrested this is what im wearing rn, but most of my style looks like this: Gant oxford shirt perisian blue, beige jack&amp;Jones pants slightly rolled up, so that the pants fit neatly on the shoe. Lacoste g80 sneakers, but most of the times i wear my Adidas daily 3.0 black, no jewelry exept my galaxy watch 1 and azzaro the most wanted as perfume)",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1139942,public,self,Can the way a guy dresses put girls of?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rmpwr3/can_the_way_a_guy_dresses_put_girls_of/,no_ads,0.0,,,

He is supportive and has been understanding and told me to visit a psychiatrist which I can’t as I live with my family and still a student who don’t work so telling my family who don’t take mental health seriously about having anxiety issues will lead to my anxiety issues becoming a joke or something they will laugh at coz Im dumb and especially my mom who will make a joke or two about my anxiety and call it a day. So, he knows it but he tried to understand well but then again one way or another he manages to trigger my anxiety very often and I feel absolutely miserable. 

Today we had a huge argument coz we were streaming an anime and we mute ourselves so we text each ither in between while we watch. He mostly don’t reply as his phone is away or he is busy being too focused on watching so I try to handle it but sometimes I get anxious and annoyed that he isn’t responding even after so much time been passed and it feels like Im watching the movie alone. I told him when he can, he should reply to my texts when watching. For more bg, he is busier in general and we don’t talk on phone coz I have strict parents so he occasionally gets busy and I have to wait for him and my anxious ass often hates waiting and I end up getting annoyed. Sometimes his Insta didn’t receive notifications so he replies back half an hour later, sometimes his phone is silent or sometimes his phone is away and he is on pc and he takes time to reply back which makes me anxious while I am waiting fir him to text but it’s nothing of a big deal to me. It’s just sometimes we had arguments when I really got anxious. He is impatient and would rather not have a conversation while angry while my anxious self wouldn’t want to be left alone.

So today I was confused about the plot so I texted him and Im also on my periods so He didn’t reply until the next episode and when he did, I was annoyed coz I was confused for the whole episode and didn’t get the story well enough then I told him he should have replied a bit sooner and he said he couldn’t coz his phone was charging so I told him I an annoyed (coz I was confused and he didn’t reply and also periods moodiness) then he stopped responding. I got so fucking anxious and annoyed over this and I lost my cool. I felt like crying. Then I keep texting him coz Im anxious and he still didn’t reply. I was telling him to reply on time but instead he stops responding and continues to watch the anime so I lashed out and I told him he made me anxious and then he decides to reply saying he didn’t get the notification and I told him that he could wait two seconds fot me to text him instead of just closing the chat and watching anime all while Im an anxious fuck. Then he was annoyed by me and I was mean to him then he told me “I don’t wanna talk to u” and disappeared. And this made me more anxious and feel worse than ever coz He always does it and when Im explaining how I feel and talking about the thing then he says “Imma go” and stops responding which has always made me anxious so I told him last time to not do it as it makes me feel so fucking horrible and if he wishes to stop talking about ut then he can say it but he shouldn’t ignore me completely and just disappear coz it triggers my anxiety. And he just did it and I was so fucking done. I mean I tell this man not to do something and he ends up doing the same exact thing. 

I fucking feel so horrible. Idk how to cope with my anxiety and I fucking feel miserable when Im anxious. I don’t expect my bf to be therapist and keep taking the hit of all my issues but Injust want him to try not to do stuff that makes me anxious even after me telling him not to. Idk what to do. He always keep doing things I tell him not to. Im fucking sick of being anxious.

We've been horny with each other every day pretty much, and as horny as we get, we're also wholesome and I think that's a perfect relationship, until last night when I accidentally fucked things up. We were being horny yesterday, that night I felt I was being horny too much and thought she doesn't like it if we're overreacting (what I'm trying to say I felt guilty because it looked like forcing from my perspective as she said I control her and don't even have to ask her if she wants to be horny or not). What did I do? I said ""enough is enough, sorry"" but I worded it so wrong. From that point she told me ""That was an instant turn off from now on till forever"" as well as ""I'm not gonna be horny anymore"". My heart was broken (so was hers) but I realized that she was sad and hurt about it so I went on discussing about the misunderstanding. She later told me ""I am very hurt but I do understand now what did you mean, of course I can't sustain from not being horny with you but now this malice is way stronger than me to the point of deciding there won't ever be sex before, during or after New Year's eve"". She's THAT hurt to the point of doubting in our relationship and saying ""I bet this is going to screw our relationship"". Today she went on to dry text me and tell me that we're going to talk tomorrow. She's a lovely girlfriend and we both did sweet things for each other but I strongly believe this isn't some kind of a red flag but rather a big mistake from me which, I'm afraid, cannot be fixed. That is, unless she actually ignores it and gets horny when we meet again.

Which has affected me most of my life so far in relation to women.

**Background:** I went to various schools in my young days...which were all boys schools. A lot of my friends had interactions with girls one way or another, (Meeting them from other girls schools, or mingling with them externally), from the ages of 4-17 I on the other hand did not. I definitely had opportunities to mingle with females when I was younger but unfortunately my confidence was so low (partially because I was overweight) and I was more interested in gaming (again partially to distract myself from the issues), that I ended up never tackling the issues head on.

**How it is now:** My confidence is definitely a lot better, as I've been working out for a couple of years, and have managed to become intimate several times. As well as over the last few years, coming into a lot more contact with females. However I still seem to come into issues, which are mostly internal.

* For example: When I am really attracted to a female, I crumble on the inside. One example of this, is beautiful blue eyes. Imo on a brunette they are extremely attractive, however whenever I speak to someone who would fit this build, I would get intimidated I think. This can cause me to tense up like stage fright, and start moving very unnatural (at least for me). Or I might come across as having boring chat/being shy (which isn't the case), when in reality I've lost my thought pattern of what I want to say next, and struggle slightly for conversation.
* Also me still not being happy in my own skin yet for myself and when around females, makes me feel that if I'm not feeling good about myself, then the girls that see me walk past or talk to me will also feel the same way. Which again makes me feel like I'm a 2 rather than a 7, and keeps that confidence from rising any further then it has.

In general these kind of issues have definitely had a big impact in regards to me and females in most social settings so far, and definitely makes me act and feel a lot more awkward then it should ever be in certain situations. As I said I have managed to make improvements and have masked it on the outside kind of well for the most part, but I'm fed up of feeling like this on the inside, when I know if I was confident and not feeling socially awkward or anxious, that I would do so much better around females.

So can please I get any advice on how to combat these issues, and overcome them sooner rather than later ?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1139965,public,self,Social Awkwardness/Anxiety around females.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rms59n/social_awkwardnessanxiety_around_females/,no_ads,0.0,,,

Let me elaborate on my logic before you completely decide if this is not wise. If we can just agree that opening a door, or even walking through one allows a person to be ... somewhere. I know how vague that is but its a metaphor against both a literal instance of location and the most stereotypically engaged upon form of chivalry. Now call me a feminist, and womankind should more often than not choose a door to open; Now juxtapose that with womankind to make first moves, and with only 50% of humanity making any real assertive effort to creating love out of thin air - all together our combined likelihood of  experiencing enough love is a lot lower, dramatically lower for single persons.

Can we also agree; If half of the population isn't utilizing enough human ingenuity  (and their opposable thumbs) to  open a door and choose a date whence and wincing at their own volition.

If you live in a city, go to any shopping center and there will be dozens of average/below average guys walking in with their partners every day, I'm a midwife, and tons of my patient's husbands/boyfriends are not very attractive. There are attractive ones too, but most people are with people of comparable attractiveness, but honestly, anything can happen, I asked out a coworker who I think is super cute and she said yes. If I can do it, the guys who claim to be average-looking surely can too, tinder is shit and designed to keep you single, go out and socialize and I'm sure you'll crush it.

I was working on the birth suite today, and I saw a short below average looking guy walk in with a gorgeous woman, and I also saw a tall hot dude walk into the birth suite and the woman who was giving birth was not physically attractive.

I went on two dates since getting back on hinge 3 months ago. The first guy I met we hit it off initially but he only really wants to keep it casual because of the place he is in life and I don’t really blame him. I’m also newly single so I wasn’t expecting to jump into a relationship either. The second guy I actually enjoyed our date and thought I’d end up seeing him again (especially since we talked about a 2nd date) but he just ghosted me out of nowhere and for no particular reason (to my knowledge at least).

The guy was definitely smarter and more well off than me but I thought there was definitely a vibe enough for a second date. Then I said to a friend “isn’t it interesting that the guys that like you are never the guys that you want and the guys that I want never want me?” And she mentioned that maybe I’m “shooting out of my league”

Is this truly a thing? Should I lower my physical standards? I just like attractive guys but I don’t know how I match up with them since I can’t really say if I’m a 7 or a 2 or a 9. But if I’m a 7 trying to bag a 9 or 10 maybe I am over shooting. The weird part is, I’m landing dates with guys that are pretty good looking so I don’t know if it’s me or what? Please help!!

FYI: I’ve always gotten positive attention from men but I’m not the type of woman who turns heads at the grocery store.

I'm 27 yr old female who is a virgin, never been kissed or on a date (I'm excluding school formals here). Why? Because I haven't seeked it out due to my introvert nature and some health problems. For the past few years, I've lost weight, and in 2022, I hope to lose more. Always struggled with self-esteem, but thanks to therapy and weight loss, I've managed to put my life on a good track. 

Recently, I've become interested in dating / courtship. But I'm worried my lack of experience will make me come across as naive or teenage-like, which is made worse by Asperger's (which I have). I don't know anything about dating etiquette, either. So... am I doomed? If not, please share tips or advice for a young woman in my position. I'm just worried I'll freak out a guy on the first date.    

The strange thing is, I used to feel so strange and weird over my lack of experience. Like something was 'wrong' with me. I no longer really feel that way, because everyone is different and has their own paths. As for sexual preferences, I am drawn to dominant (?) men who are older than me.

I'm a 5'3 girl, and I've been dating a 5'4 boy for almost two years. When we were a few months in, my boyfriend asked me if I truly didn't mind his height. He had made some of jokes about it before but, honestly, I had never given them a thought. I mean, I make them too, and I'm not self conscious about my height like at all. It's not like I didn't know the fact that he was shorter than most men I knew but like. Thats it. Never had an opinion about it. But, turns out that has always been the biggest insecurity of his. Apparently, all her exes had, at some point, made a comment about it and he even, to my utter surprise (because, I mean, he truly is A CATCH) he even struggled to find dates because of it!!

Now, my boyfriend and I are very very different. We are both huge nerds and enjoy discovering weird stuff together, but while he's your typical opera-enjoyer man, who is 5/10 times dressed in a suit and watches films in French without subtitles; I'm more of your local nerdy girl obsessed with bugs and trash horror comics who literally only owns 1 bra and 1 pair of jeans. And our social circles do really really reflect this fact.

A lot of people tell me that I would look much much better if I did my makeup and wore ""fitting"" clothing, and I know that but, honestly, if I'm healthy and feel normal about my appearance, why should I spend more time on it?

I wasn't really surprised when, last sunday, when asked my group of friends about this, and they were just as surprised as me about this. None of us would have any trouble dating a men shorter than us! 

We gave it a bit more thought, and we've come to the conclusion that it might be because of this:

Haven't you noticed how buffed gym men tend to only date fit women? And would you imagine a doctor in astrophysics dating someone who only watches keeping up with the kardashians? Yes, it can happen, but people are usually going to apply what they care for in life to their dating preferences.

My point being: if you, like my boyfriend used to do, only surround yourself with women that do really care about their appearance (which is not a bad thing) odds are they are really going to care about YOUR appearance too!

If you are asking for a woman to look beyond your height, why won't you try to look for women being their makeup, clothing style etc? I know a lot of you say that you do, but then you react totally different to her when she's on a full face of makeup and a skirt.

Last week I had a party at my place though and he fell asleep on my couch so i let him stay the night there. In the morning he woke me up and we started talking. That day he opened up so me about a lot of issues he has and some really personal stuff (I dont think he is the person to talk about stuff like that a lot).
Two days later I invited some friends including him over before everyone left for christmas break. When everyone left that night he kind of didnt seem to want to go so I offered him that he can stay at my place over night (as a friendly gesture and not bcs I wanted to hook up ot sth). He was really happy about that. It got really late and we talked again and eventually he laid his head into my lap so i could stroke his hair. We stayed like that for a while just talking and enjoying the moment since it was really intimate in a non sexual way. He also kissed me when we got up but nothing else happened. Wejust went to bed cuddled and kissed for a while and fell asleep after.
We never really talked about that again on the next day and everything went back to normal I think. I dont know how to feel about it since I told him I would never be in a relationship with him even though that night I definitly felt something for him. He also didnt contact me since then and i dont really get why. I feel like you wouldnt just act like that with someone you dont feel anything for romantically.

I realized that i have anxiety now. I would like to change that. In the past when i saw a couple kissing or in a party i didnt had problem with it. Sometimes i did that too. I felt the balance. But somehow times changes and now i have this feeling when i see a happy couple i instatntly feel that im a less person becouse i cant get anyone. I had several rejections but somehow i went through thoose. But now the last 2 rejections hurted more. And i dont know why maybe i was in love with them for real. But this brings up the problem that i fall in love easily. I just would like to know how should i change myself ? or which parts. Becouse the rejections without explonation doesnt help me that much. Or it can be that i found bad girls ? So yeah im between this situation where i try to find whats the problem with me and is there even a problem or its just unluck ? I would like to improve myself. And kill this anxiety about the dating. Becouse i know that its not serius abaout being angry for other couples. So can this be real that this 2 ""relationship"" totally broke me ?. Or there is something more behind it ? Before this i had nothing like that i was like okay next time i will be successfull. Why i lost that ? I think that i was so close with this to be a good couple and yet i failed that. And i think this is the hardest part for me. I felt like that i failed in the finish line. And i dont know the reason. Btw i went to a therapist severalt times becouse i thought it could help. So the question is where should i start ? I should rebuild my confidence somehow.

Hi all, what’s the best way to support my ex as she wants to try again with me after 3 weeks broken up as she realised she made a mistake breaking up with me after 5 years together.

Obviously I still love her so much and feel the same as I did prior to the breakup so I’m just abit unsure on how to support her best

I am black and he is Latino and traveling right now with his buddies seeing some family he hasn’t seen in a while. The topic of the N-word came up in conversation and i told him I’d prefer no one who isn’t black say that word period - preferably nobody at all say that word. 
His reply was that people were too sensitive about that and then, I guess I was on speaker, his black friend he was traveling with who they ‘lovingly’ refer to as ‘Black __insert first name here___’ got on the line and said I was overreacting. I told him to respect my wishes, this shouldn’t be an argument and we’re moving on for this conversation. Then he had to hang up and call me back bc they were preparing to do something.
When he called me back he did not end the conversation and instead kept trying to talk about the n-word and how saying it varies by context or if it’s in a song. He also went on to say Black ____ said I was overreacting.
I adamantly told him he didn’t know what he was talking about and needed to stop. I’ve dealt first hand with racism all my life growing up in the south and have some traumas from it. I was very clearly getting irritated and was raising my voice. He told me he was just trying to “have an adult conversation with me” and I was acting childish. I, ngl, yelled at him he had no leg to stand on here and doesn’t need to be arguing with a black woman on why him saying the n-word under whatever context is not right and disrespectful to the black woman you supposedly want to be with. He lost reception and i said it was for the best when he texted me and would not answer his calls back.
He kept texting me saying he wanted to talk this out like adults but I was so infuriated that this conversation was still going on. I told him repeatedly over text to stop texting me and he kept going. I told him I can’t be with someone who has that belief and he kept blowing up my phone. I got mean and told him to f-off, and idgaf anymore leave me alone. He kept telling me I was being a child and to pick up the phone and be an adult about it but I was so mad I knew talking to him would only make me more upset.
I messaged him the next day and told him to enjoy the time with his family and I hope it was great.
Few days later, yesterday, he sent me a novel of an email telling me I was “23 with the mindset of a 17 year old” and “no wonder i can’t get real friendships” and was asking me if I saw the work he did with the BLM movement and how his black friends had different conversations with him. He told me I was self centered and hurled many other insults my way. It was really hurtful 
I get I may not have handled it the best loosing my temper but I feel as though I had set my boundaries and he didn’t respect him. I feel like I told him repeatedly to stop and he kept poking the bear and wanted to turn it against me when I yelled at him in return. Did I mess up?

While we work together now, I've met this girl originally long time ago and we both were into each other but at different times. We originally met on a new year. I approached her, but she was not interested, then months later she approached me, but I was not single. A similar dynamic has taken place several times. Once we talked about ""where we know each other from"" (after we started working together), and she said she doesn't remember any of it and then in another conversations she would recall a very specific detail (like name of person I was with) showing me that she was lying to me when she told me she doesn't remember.

This is not carrier job and to me is as important as McDonalds summer job.

I've got an idea she does not want to date a coworker, so I didn't want to push anything after asking her on a date and she told me she does not have a need to hangout with people from work after work even for a simple coffee.  
I'm usually not a type of person that gives any attention to things that can be coincidence, but something weird happened this week (last week at work before vacation) that can hardly be coincidence. After I told her what place I will be celebrating this new year at like 2 weeks ago, she 2 days ago informed me that she and her friends will be at the same bar (there are like 50 places that will have something for new year, and she picks the very same I will be at) she is going with (3 friends she is close to the point I would not be surprised if they wipe each other ass after pooping that look at her as a forever single friend).  
When I share story's on FB I always leave them public as they were that way by default, but it always had only views from people I'm friends with anyway, so I did not care. The latest story 3-4 days ago was from a bar where we will be for new year. It had exactly 3 views shown as ""other people viewed your story"" and that happens when people you are not friends with watch your story (she have 3 close friends that will be with her on new year). After she told me she is going to same place, I've checked, and she did not see the story. Now at this point I would still not care, but today we talked how that bar is usually half empty regardless of great DJ, good location, ambient and that stuff, but I told her it was crowded last weekend and show her a video of that night to what she referred I've seen that, and then corrected what she said and told me she has seen similar video on Instagram of our mutual friend. And then when I sarcastically commented I hope we won't be too close because when we already hanging out at work, we don't have to on the new year celebration she sounded very angry asking me ""and what exactly that should mean""...",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1140003,public,self,Girl from work that I'm into started stalking me?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rn08if/girl_from_work_that_im_into_started_stalking_me/,no_ads,0.0,,,
