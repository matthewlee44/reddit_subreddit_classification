He texted me when he got home that he had a great time and thanks. I replied with I did as well and asked if he wanted to do this again? No answer. Then the next day I asked if he was watching the game? No answer and then texted even later something about the game. No answer. It's been two days and I just don't know what to do next.

That was until he brought it up, saying that he wanted to move forward more but didn‚Äôt want to put any pressure on me. He then said that he was going to let me make all the first moves so that I don‚Äôt feel uncomfortable.
In the past I‚Äôve been with people who have pushed me and my boundaries, so this caught me off guard. While I was glad he was trying to make feel safe, I‚Äôm still feeling frustrated. Not only is it stressful to always be the one initiating things but there‚Äôs something very attractive about when someone is bold and makes a move.

12,scvufj,1643166914,Crushed,"I am completely new to the dating scene and culture. Having just moved countries I figured I may as well give dating and online dating apps a shot since I have had more than enough time on my own. I was ready for something real but also realistic enough that it may be harder to connect with people through this method. I matched with several guys pretty quickly (I am 31F) and chatted with a few. Most stayed to texting and I had one Zoom date which was pretty fun but I did not feel the spark. Then there was one guy who looked like my type, I loved his pictures but also his descriptions and sense of humor. We decided to meet up pretty quickly. He was a bit shorter than I expected but that‚Äôs really no big deal to me. It was a really good first date, got through the awkwardness quickly end even ended up back at his place. We did sleep together on the first date but given the connection we had I didn‚Äôt think that was really a problem. We decided to meet up quickly again for a second date. That went really well too. Both had a few too many drinks and I ended up inviting him to stay the night after we already had sex. We did it once again that morning, all very good experiences. He told me he really liked me and I said it back.

He asked me about a third date and then went home. We did not see each other anymore since then. I noticed he was texting very little since then and then today I got the dreaded message, a week after we first met. He said his ex got back into his life and wanted to reconcile. He was apologetic and said he did like me very much. This really did hit me a lot harder than I expected. I know how hard it can be to find a good match with whom you share that instant attraction. Part of me is a bit angry because surely he could or would have known this was a possibility when going out with me? Maybe he was just looking for a hookup after all?

Regardless, this experience did really put me off dating already. I was perhaps a little too excited but dating like this doesn‚Äôt really happen where I am from. If you like someone you see where it goes and let it grow organically. This sucks!

19,scwagq,1643168231,I derive all my happiness from dating a girl I have an uncertain future with,"Hey guys I‚Äôm a 23 year old male who‚Äôll be 24 at the end of next month and I‚Äôm somewhat dating this 22 year old girl I met on a dating app in November. I say somewhat dating because it‚Äôs a really complicated relationship. I‚Äôll go into why first before I address my main issue. Although I guess this is a main issue too. Fair warning, this will be a long-ish read. 

So, we met in November and hit it off immediately. She was the first girl I‚Äôve ever really been into on the app and i was shocked when she was into me. We‚Äôve talked every day through text since November. Anyway, through our talks, we got really deep into childhood trauma and our bouts with depression and other stuff. Like complete into the weeds with this stuff and it felt natural. Our convos were/are still huge block texts that take like 30-50 minutes to actually read and respond to sometimes. So imagine that with information about childhood stuff and deep stuff. Through these talks I realized that her family is super protective and controlling of her, mainly her parents. She also has an older sister that lives with them too and doesn‚Äôt date or do any of that. Anyway, we talked for a month before finally meeting to go bowling. This was in mid December. We live about 50 minutes from each other, so I drove up and we had a decent time and I got my first kiss from her. Things escalated and we met a 2nd time a week later and she came down to me and we made out and hugged a ton. 

So things were going great, and it lead into Christmas and then after I had planned a date on the Sunday after New Years. We had planned it all out and I was stoked. Well that Friday comes around for New Years and I don‚Äôt hear from her. First time ever that we didn‚Äôt talk in a day. Then Saturday comes around and no word. I had to message her at night on Saturday and break the double text rule to ask if everything was okay and if we‚Äôd still be meeting on Sunday. And she texted back saying she had reflected on 2021 and she didn‚Äôt want to go on anymore dates with me and that it was a personal thing. I was completely hurt and confused and it broke me. So Sunday I was hurt and then Monday I woke up still hurt so I messaged her asking her why she told me I was a gift from god and that I made her life better and why she agreed to a date 3 days prior to telling me this. My friends told me it was another man, but it turned out that apparently she had told her parents about me and they had looked me up on Facebook and had found that I had posted some memes in 2012 when I was like 13-14. Which is nuts, but anyway they concluded that I was disturbing from that and for her not to see me. And they got into a fight about it. Anyway, I talked to her and she mentioned how I could probably meet them to show them I‚Äôm a good guy and I agreed. So we talked in secrecy for a week before she wrote this text and messaged her parents about it and they had another convo. In this convo they again denied her seeing me and said I had too many red flags and that her mom prayed on it and god told her not to meet me. 

So at this point I was really fucking hurt. And we texted all night having a long convo about how I still wanted to be with her and she said she wanted to be with me too. To make a long story short, we‚Äôve been talking and going on dates for the last 3 weeks since this happened. Without her parents approval. And we‚Äôve been talking every day too. She works when I get off, so the messages might take hours to come in sometimes, but at minimum we both send like 3 messages back to each other each day and they‚Äôre block texts. We‚Äôll talk about how we really like each other and how badly she wishes I was with her and like holding her in her bed and shit like that. To make matters worse, I can only see her on weekends one time and there‚Äôs the risk that her parents ask where she‚Äôs going and find out she‚Äôs still seeing me or her sister who always wants to be around her wants to tag along. So like even seeing her every week is an unknown although like I said, for the last 3 weeks we‚Äôve gotten to see each other for like 3 and a half hours each time. Before you guys start in, I know she should let her parents control her like this and I know my behavior is kind of crazy. This is why I‚Äôm seeking advice. I think I love her and I derive all my happiness from her, but I‚Äôm not confident that I‚Äôll ever have a future with this girl and it really fucking hurts me deeply. I told my mom everything and she tried to be supportive and tells me maybe I should walk away, but I can‚Äôt. And I don‚Äôt want to. I just don‚Äôt want my happiness to be based on a girl that could walk out of my life at any moment. And she doesn‚Äôt have social media so it‚Äôd be like she‚Äôd actually disappear. We sent photos of each other to each other last week and I keep looking at her photo whenever I get sad. I just don‚Äôt know how we can ever truly be together if she stays at home and lets her parents control her and like her parents hate me. She also tells me a ton of shitty things her mom has done to her/still does to her. I hate it. 

And let me emphasize that things between me and her are fine. She just texted me as I wrote this and she‚Äôs as engaged and in her feels for me as ever, I just can‚Äôt shake the feeling that the other shoe is bound to drop and I‚Äôll be really broken and messed up in the head. She mentioned last week that she felt guilty for all the stuff she‚Äôs put me through with her parents, so like even she‚Äôs feeling it. I just don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs gonna happen or like how to handle it when/if that other shoe does drop. Sorry if this was super incoherent or rambly, I just don‚Äôt know how to lay everything out succinctly.

20,scwbd2,1643168309,"My (23F) boyfriend (23M) can be abusive sometimes, but also the sweetest person in the world. I feel like it's my fault. What donyou think?","Here's the full story..

My boyfriend and I have been together 8 months and we're both 23 years old. We met back in June and we had an instant connection. We have so much fun together and he's usually the absolute sweetest person I've ever met. 

However, in the beginning he did tell me something that should have raised some red flags. He admitted that in his previous relationship he did choke her a few times, he put a cigarette out on her once, and he pushed her over a coffee table. He also said he was arrested for domestic violence one time with her, but that the time he was arrested for he was actually only restraining her from hitting him. I overlooked this because he said he regrets all of this a lot and it's just because the relationship was very destructive, she would attack him first, and he had severe anger issues. 

He never showed any signs of abuse toward me at all until the end of August. The first sign was one time when I brought up feeling like he wasn't attracted to me (I know, dumb, but I get insecure). He¬† got angry, took my pants off forcefully, and touched me while I was pulling away and said ""is this what you ******* want?!"" He didn't go any further than that though. 

The next time was in September. I saw messages between him and a girl that I wasn't okay with (nothing horrible, but he did ask her to come over once when I was gone but he claims it was only as a friend). I expressed how not okay with it he was and during the Argent he grabbed my throat and choked me twice. It left a small mark but nothing serious. Afterward I locked myself in the bathroom and cried and he yelled through the door calling me a baby. However, afterward he said he wanted to die he felt so horrible and I forgave him. 

Between September and Novemeber he choked me about 6 more times, but none were very hard. They never even left a mark or anything. I expressed to him several times how upset it made me and he would sometimes seem to feel bad, but other times he would act like it wasn't a big deal because he wasn't actually hurting me or beating me. He said he didn't realize why it would be fine for him to do that during sex but not during an argument. 

Then something a bit worse happened a few days before Thanksgiving. He was drinking a lot that night and I was being extra insecure and really pushing him (I know I sound like I'm taking up for him, but I really can be hard to be with). I was upset because I'd just dyed my hair blonde and he was saying how he loved it and didn't like my brown hair, even though previously he had told me he liked my brown hair. It upset me that he lied so I went off more than I should have. He grabbed my throat and said he was going to kill me, but he eventually let go. He squeezed harder than he ever had before though. It left a huge bruise that makeup wouldn't even cover up. During that argument he also said I didn't mean anything to him, he hated me, and no one would care if I died. He told me if I stayed with him I had to be a doormat for him to walk on from that point on. 

The next morning he tried to act like nothing even happened. He was just being normal and goofy. I told him that I wasn't just going to act like that didn't happen and he said he only remembered a little bit of it and that he never means what he says when he's angry and drunk and to just overlook it. I tried to forget it, but I couldn't and I wrote him a long note explaining how badly that hurt me and he cried and promised never to do anything like that again. 

He didn't touch me again until a few weeks ago. We were arguing.. it wasn't even that bad of an argument, but he ended up grabbing my throat and choking me again. It wasn't very hard though and afterward he immediately apologized, made me dinner, showered me with compliments all night, and cleaned the house. 

Then a few days later his ex messaged me asking if it was okay for them to video chat because he told her I didn't mind. I went off on him, probably a lot more than I should have because I looked through the messages later and nothing suggestive was said at all.¬† I went off and said I didn't trust him. I started asking him a bunch of questions and accusing him and he grabbed my throat, shoved me off the bed, punched my face, and kicked me in the side multiple times. He screamed at me to leave and kept pushing me while I was on my way out of the door. 

He's saying this last instance was my fault because I pushed him so hard and I didn't trust him. The thing is.. I know I pushed him and I know I can be very difficult to be with. He says I have no reason to be mad or upset at him. 

His ex also called to see if I was okay and explained that he would try to force me to have a kid with him to trap me. Low and behold, somehow the argument we were in got turned around to how I always get mad at my mom for being protective and he kept saying ""you have no idea how she feels because you're not a mother."" And he began berating me for wanting to wait until I'm in my 30s. I didn't even mention to him that she said that. 

After that I found a Tinder account we used to have together for occasional threesomes still on his phone even though he said he'd deleted it. I was curious and it's supposed to be OURS, so I checked it and he was telling girls he wanted to try stuff without me there. We agreed countless times if we did anything we'd both be there. I almost left him over this, but he told me that he only did it when he was mad at me and he never had intentions of going through with it. I checked and he really did always stop replying if they got serious about it. He promised to never never it again because he he realize how much it would hurt me. He doesn't understand why I'm having a hard time trusting him now though. 

After that things were perfect for about a week and a half. Absolutely amazing. He was the perfect boyfriend. Then today I was on my period and started a pointless argument and he choked me again. This time instead of apologizing he said that he's going to keep doing it until I grow up because it's my fault and it's what I need. 

The thing is, other than these instances he is the sweetest, purest human being I have ever met. It just doesn't make sense to me. He constantly shows me love and affection and tells everyone how crazy he is over me. We even do YouTube videos togeyher and everyone always says they can see the love in his eyes. Is this abuse? Is it my fault?

We hooked up the last time we hung out and he suggested we hang out again that coming week. We never ended up hanging out because he didn‚Äôt follow up on it when the time came. I messaged him a couple times after that though and he was receptive and responded normally (as in didn‚Äôt feel like a dry response, even suggested we do something in the future). Few days went by and I didn‚Äôt hear from him again, so I reached out and told him I really liked talking with him, but wanted to check if he was on the same page. Also reminded him it was 100% okay if he wasn‚Äôt feeling it anymore (I just wanted clarity so I could either move on or give him some grace). He messaged back saying he had a crazy week and apologized for not communicating. He currently lives a couple hours away, but will be moving to the city in a few months and said he would probably come to town in the meantime and hopes we could work something out then. He never answered my question though (re: are you still feeling it?) so I took it as an ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not that interested to be willing to drive a couple hours to hang with you or definitively wanna tell you when I‚Äôm coming to town,‚Äù which is completely fair and fine because, again, don‚Äôt care he‚Äôs 2 hours away, just want transparency.

1. I‚Äôm being put on the back burner

3. Wants me to ‚Äúwait‚Äù around in case it doesn‚Äôt end up working with someone else or doesn‚Äôt find anyone else

Originally, my plan was to continue dating other people and gauge how I feel if he ever even reaches out again, so also put him on the back burner, but now I‚Äôm thinking I‚Äôm setting myself up for failure by doing so.

I hadn't been on a date in over a year and just had a lot of situations that seemed promising that got shot down. That is until a couple weeks ago where I 1. Got a match 2. Took a chance

1. I had a date where we got a couple drinks, went dancing, had nice discussions and she stayed the night with me where we engaged in...a lot...of sex. I've had one night stands intermittently in that 12+ month span (yes I see ""a date"" and a ""ONS"" differently) and I just assumed this date was turning into a ONS but I kept acting like it was going to move forward cause why not? We've been texting and my behaviors and the boundaries I'm setting aren't scaring her off which is what I've come to believe my personality is best suited for: ruining potential relationships. We have a second date planned for Friday and she has already expressed her intention to stay the night. I am having the worst case of imposter syndrome I've ever experienced. Every text I send or receive, all I can think is, ""this is the one that ends it"". I have her on read right now because I'm so scared that there is literally nothing I can say that will be even at best a ""neutral"" response. 

2. In a different situation, I met a woman at a small concert a while back. We hit it off and I made a move but she had just broken up with her ex that exact morning so I didn't push. We had a few conversations and I asked her recently to grab some lunch with me, fully expecting to be rejected on the spot. To my surprise she said yes and, even more surprisingly, was active in making these plans. Due to some understandable circumstances, she had to cancel which was the, ""yep. Saw that coming"" moment for me until she asked to reschedule completely unprompted from me. We are meeting for dinner Friday. I have her on read for the same reason. 

These are not unattractive women! These are women would be the envy of any guy who ""locked them down"". I am genuinely so confused. My brain can not understand the concempt that this is could very well just be the result of people finding me attractive. I'm just waiting for the ""Gotcha!"" moment where I go back to pinning from afar and things make sense again. I know these thoughts are self fulfilling. I guess I just need someone to help anchor me to reality so I can go back to trusting that this can just be a good thing.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/scyc6a/i_am_falling_back_into_a_habit_of_self_sabotage/

This annoyed me so I broke it off - kindly and directly but with no specific explanation. I wasn't annoyed because they were dating other people (we met on a dating app so I just sort of assumed this might be the case - for better or for worse, it seems like everyone is dating 10 people at once) but because they were a bit cavalier about it. I was planning to talk about what we were looking for on the 3rd date - they wouldn't have known this - but it would have been a good time for them to mention they were dating other people. I sort of wish they had just said ""no I'm busy this weekend but next week would work"" - but maybe I dodged a bullet/future pain.  


Curious if other folks have opinions on whether it's cool or not to casually tell someone who you might be interested in seeing more seriously that you are dating other people.

47,sczfiu,1643178709,He does not want kids,"Hi Everyone,

So for the past year I(25) have been dating this man(29). We started dating and two months into the relationship I found out he doesn't want kids. Big deal breaker. So I left. I loved him but I tried breaking a bad habit of staying in a relationship that won't work. Well. Two weeks later we started talking again around my birthday and rekindled the relationship to a FWB deal which didn't last and led us to a situationship/dating space. Stupid decision on both ends. Come months later we're in love but he still stands with his unsure about children stance and may not ever want them. So again we broke things off in December after I gave him an ultimatium of deciding life with me and a child or ending for good cause we can't keep going on like this. We went a few weeks with out speaking as I had my last few weeks of school but again started speaking again.

At this point I hate the entire situation. I wish he could change his mind. I wish I was enough for him to change his mind, but thats not the case. I even deep down wish I was infertile or couldn't have kids so that I had a reason to not have kids in anyway. So how can I move on.

I have been through breakups before but I do feel like i'm losing my best friend and perfect partner for me. I am having a real difficult time moving on and cutting ties. I feel like deep down he'll change his mind at one point as he has said he regrets this and knows down the line he's gonna kick himself for this but he's standing by his choice. I am honestly even looking to go to a therapist at this point for my own health.

I also want to add he is the prime caregiver of his family and takes care of his parents. He also helps take care of his nephew and sister. We have been each others healthiest relationships and his friends and family love me and tried talking to him as well as they think we're a good couple but even with their opinions he hasn't budged on the topic.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sczfiu/he_does_not_want_kids/

55,sczxa4,1643180562,"Guy I matched with on Tinder, made me out to be a potential molester to my trainer","so, I'm going to do my best to type this out as I am very hurt, angry and shaken up by this.

for context I am a 30 year old female and this guy is the same age as me.
also I do not know if I posted this to the right sub as I'm a long time reader and a first time poster.

I do a sport with both men and woman and it legit saved my life and makes me the happiest and healthiest I have ever been. I have too been single for about 2 years. so of course I'm on tinder.

Awkwardly, ill admit, I matched with a guy I train with and we started talking and things seemed great! we even arranged a date!

he started going quiet and I barely heard from him, I also realised we had a show the day after our arranged date and I asked him if he would still like to go out seeing as we have a show the next day to which he replied with ""let's postpone"" I agreed and thought it was no big deal. we did the show fine together and everything seemed mellow. he stayed quiet after that and wouldn't talk to me.
I honestly didn't pay any mind as he confessed to me he just got out of a 4 year relationship and was conpeltley understanding of him not talking.

I went back to my normal self and treated the same way I treated him before tinder.

now I am a hugger, especially with people I've known for years, ill say high, fist bump, hug I'm a genuine friendly person

after not seeing him since the show (2 months) he came to training and I was myself and said hey (honestly cannot rememeber if I went for a hug or fist bump) and we trained like normal.

someone pulled out of a match and I offered to join in for more experience that he happened to be in as well and everyone was finalised.

I then the next day recieved a message from my head trainer saying I have to get pulled out of the match because the guys feels uncomfortable around me as I'm always hugging him and saying inapropriate things to him.

I was shocked, upset and mortified, I confessed everything to my trainer and I think she believed me but said maybe refrain from hugging people from here on out.

I cancelled my Tuesday night trainings and now booked classes I know he doesn't go to to avoid him.
I am not denying he was probably uncomfortable and I totally respect that but he has pretty much fucked with my passion and I am hurt by this. I feel this has made me out to be some kind of molester.

how do I get passed this? my anxiety is going through the roof.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sczxa4/guy_i_matched_with_on_tinder_made_me_out_to_be_a/

Throughout school I always just stuck with my friends and never thought about it. I never bothered using dating apps, and I rarely drink and never party.

Now that I‚Äôm out of school, I‚Äôve been thinking about my next goals in life and I‚Äôve decided that one day, I‚Äôd really love to have kids ü•∞ü•∞. I love working with kids and I‚Äôd really want to have kids to be able to raise and pass on a legacy.

Ideally I‚Äôd love to meet a really cute guy with his own career aspirations in the healthcare field. I think we would be able to bond over similar healthcare stories :D.

About myself: I would say I have several interests, including watching TV shows and movies, gardening, personal finance, and cooking. I personally rate myself as an 8/10.
I hate spending money or going shopping or wearing makeup. I grew up in a very poor (foodstamps, 4 people sleeping in 1 room) but caring family.

So... how do I go about getting a bf? I have 0 experience. Where do I meet guys? How do I approach them? How do I make sure a guy is looking for a long term relationship.

Our first date was absolutely spectacular, it lasted five hours and we went to three different places. He walked me home and gave me a kiss good night and texted me all day the next day. We went out again tonight and things were very different. We met a little bit later because we both had to work late but we still wanted to see each other and not wait until the weekend.. end it was good at first, but towards the middle of the date after about an hour or so there started to be a lot of pauses in our conversation. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because we‚Äôre not fully comfortable enough with each other yet or if it‚Äôs because I just saw him a couple of days ago and there‚Äôs not much to talk about that‚Äôs happened in our lives since then, but I didn‚Äôt know what to say.

66,sd0lic,1643183266,How to set the 2nd date and how do I break the ice on the 2nd date?,"Hi All,   


I (M23) went on a date with a nice guy (M22) on Tinder. We met up with coffee and just got to know each other. We talked a bit about work, our interest and what we did on our weekends. It was nice as the date went for about 2 hours and a bit. During the date there were some awkward pauses (longest pause was probably 10 seconds). But I felt we were very formal and polite. Felt like I was just chatting with a colleague I know from work but I'm not friends with.   


As we were leaving he joked he almost didn't messaged me and glad I did as he is very awkward. I laughed and said I glad I messaged him. I was about to reach out for a hug but he smiled, gave me a wave and said ""have a nice day.""   
Later that night I plucked up the courage and messaged him telling him a I had a really nice time and that I really liked his smile (my way of flirting haha). He responded that he was glad I had a good time and that he had a nice time too. I asked if he was interested in catching up again and he said ""absolutely let's find a good place with more food options"". The cafe we picked didn't have much.   
We're yet to set the date. So how do I go about this?   
Should I just say ""are you free this weekend, do you want to check out this place?"" or should I wait next week...seeing him twice in a week might be much haha.   
and how do I break the ice? Should we eat AND do an activity? If so what activity? He mentioned he's really into history and art. He also likes hiking. As I like hiking I was leaning towards this but still a bit unsure. Are there any activities that will help break the awkwardness?

Never thought the day would come that I would find out that you were actually not so giving. I never had the courage to go up to you and say I thought you were cute so the months just went by. It come a new year and I was feeling lonely so I made an online dating profile and there you were. Out of the blue, I then knew your name, age, interests and ours were so simialr. Little did I know that later on you would use these to manipulate me. I swiped, we matched and I was so excited. Finally, I built up the courage to chat to him and it was the most easy flowing conversation I have had with someone I'm attracted too in so long. So many common interests, humor was similar, I thought it was too good to be true. We scheduled a met up at my work and best believe you rushed down. You were giddy, I could tell. I couldn't believe it and kept my cool the whole time but lust took over and we were kissing like we have done this all before. It felt so comfortable. I couldn't stop thinking about it and neither could you, over flowing me with messages. Me smiling at eachone. I needed to see you again to get my next dose of dopamine in my brain so we scheduled another hang. The hang I wish never happened. I get to area we met and you were there but not there anymore. You mad fun of my car and called my a 'show off' ( I worked hard for my car), you made fun of me wearing a sweatshirt saying it looks so baggy (I enjoy being comfortable), I didn't even get to say more than 2 words from you and you were spitting out insults. I kept my cool and we walked to get something to eat I sweetly say 'what are we gonna have?', you angrily said to me 'I don't know what you eat?!' Waving your arms around. We find a Cafe, the kitchens closed, you were a mess. Again with waving your arms. I didn't know what to do, how to calm you, I'd only known you for 4 days... so I told him we will go back to his place and order something there. We head there, I compliment it. It was a mess but needed to lighten the mood. You didn't want to order anything to eat because it's 'too expensive' and made me a wrap with just a spread of hummus and 2 sliced tomatoes. I had to breathe. I felt, like reality was sinking in. You just looked at me and I took the plate and ate it in front of you while you just watched me not even talking to me. The end was coming but part of me was holding onto at least something. All this time, thinking maybe I should talk to him at work was crashing slowly. So I took him for a test and thought I've come this far, I need reality ro hit me in the face harder than a ton of bricks so my brain stops thinking of how perfect you are. Noone is perfect but for a 2nd meeting this was all so much already. We go on your bed, you had the blinds already down. I knew right away why. We chatted and I wanted to know what you wanted, you said casual but didn't want to open up about anything personal. I understood and said I would like to go on a date and get to know you more but am happy with casual. It was upsetting, yes, however I had nothing to lose so I understood. I looked into your eyes and knew something was up, you were a different person than the 1st time we met. I didn't force you to open up about it but the tension was so tense, I asked anyway and you told me 'I don't need to tell you my family problems, okay'. I unfortunately have them too and understood, starting kissing him, comforting him. I knew the perfect thing to do would be to help him escape. We took out clothes off, we foreplayed, we kissed, i pleasured you (you didn't me) you escaped, it was nice seeing you not angry. You just looked so hopeless, I thought it was cute, I knew it was what you needed. However it took a turn. Your mind left again. You checked your phone and your mum made you upset, you stormed off without saying anything to me to call her. I didn't know what to do. You didn't want to open up to me. You came back so distressed on your bed and all I could do was cuddle you. You looked in your mirror and your muscles become so weak. I then moved you to the back of your bed and out you in a seated position and went ontop of you, I needed to calm you down. You were like putty in my hand. I kissed you multiple times and moved my hands around your body. All you said to me was 'I could have sucked my own dick, or got my housemate to do it.' That's was it. The fantasy was gone. You looked right in my eyes and said that to me. I had to leave, leave without saying anything and the best part was you noticed. I was gone 30mins and you asked me 'are you angry with me?'. Best believe I was colourful. I had not one moment of fun. I had not one ounce of laughter. I had not one moment where I got to escape. You couldn't say anything to me. Not even an apology or a I owe you a better date. Nothing. It's been 5 years since I've been so attracted to someone so quickly that this was devastating but I knew deep down that it had to end. I was grasping, wanting something, asking, do we just call this quits now? And all I got was 'it's completely up to you, I won't mind either way'. That's when I knew, this had to end. I gave it my all to receive nothing.

74,sd1ism,1643187070,24M Serious Relationship? Need an Advice,"Hello Reddit,

I need an advice regarding a girl (24F) whom I might start a serious relationship with.

This girl is a very old friend of mine. We met back in middle school but she had to move with her family to another place. We stayed in touch for years and we developed a solid friendship since we value same things in life and we have many things in common. However, our relationship has never turned into a serious relationship since we lived far away from each other's and we were dating different people. Yet, we both struggled with finding the right partner (I've been single for 4 years). 

Last week I decided to visit her and see her for the first time since middle school. She insisted that I stay at her apartment since she lives alone (next to her university) and doesn't want me to waste money paying for hotels. I agreed and to be frank I wasn't expecting much from our meeting. Yes, I was very excited but at the same time very scared because I know that we like each other's and things might turn serious. 

She's perfect. She's intelligent, beautiful, artistic, and independent (but a little bit bossy and gets emotional quickly - in a mature way). She took excellent care of me and made sure that I was having fun. She made me breakfast and dinner every day and treated me like - a potential husband. She has everything I am looking for in a woman, and I fully trust her with everything. She knows everything about me, and I know everything about her. I know we will be great together. 

Things turned serious, and she confessed to me that she always wanted to be with me. I also want to stay with her, but I'm having a problem developing feelings for her. This is making me frustrated because I don't understand why I cant develop strong feelings for her as she's developing to me. I don't know what's wrong with me. Does love take time to develop? Is being single for four years caused me to have difficulties establishing feelings for someone? 

Yes, I'm a little bit stressed about life (waiting for grad school results/studying and working ), and that may have made me struggle with letting my guard down. 

Tbh, I don't know what to do but I know that the decision I'm going to take can make or break our relationship forever.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sd1ism/24m_serious_relationship_need_an_advice/

To make it worse, he updated his dating app profile within hours. I‚Äôm so fucking hurt and honestly done putting myself out there because no guy ever wants something serious with me. Even when I make it explicitly clear from the beginning what I‚Äôm looking for, I inevitably get the ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want anything serious with you‚Äù talk around now. I feel like men just use and sexualize me no matter what I do and I am always seen  as the girl they want to fuck but never as ‚Äúgirlfriend material‚Äù.

I relate sex with emotional attachment so I consider this hookup culture as a insult to the one‚Äôs character and it takes toll on thr mental health later ( its just my view). so I am hell lot of worried about this guy or even if I date any other guy here , I am sure he got involved in this hookup /casual fling in his past.

She stayed over a week ago, and I tried to schedule a date this week, she offered Wednesday and when I confirmed the day after she 'had dinner plans already' but offered to reschedule to the weekend (2 weeks since last meeting).

Was a bit of a breaking point for me and I raised the issue of relationship expectations and the possibility of meeting more frequently, and she seemed receptive to the idea. Will probably have a chat about it on Sunday.

91,sd3m27,1643195589,An interesting woman with issues I met?,"Wall of text ahead beware, might not make that much sense 

I met this person at work. For the first couple of months, we would make small talk and kinda harass each other in a fun way. At the end of October, we started hanging out with our group of work friends. Pretty much we started to kick it off pretty mutual, we both knew we liked each other and there was always a relationship type of tension between us, the problem was she had a boyfriend who lived about an hour away. As things progressed into the ending of November, we started to hang out more and more, like every day, we would hang out and just enjoy eachothers presence. When December rolled around, things got a little physical (she cheated on her bf with me), we had sex and things got more serious, but she still had a BF that she was having issues with. From what I was told, I guess their relationship was stagnating due to Staleness and the distance (they been with each other for over 3 years). 

Anyways skipping to the present, she left her bf as of recently (a friend she vents to told me it was because she liked me and kinda chose me, he also caught her by looking at her phone one day and they talked things through, couple days later she left him because he deleted our conversations and pictures). The thing is we've been kinda hooking up a lot and she's been sleeping over and kinda acting like we're a couple, but she told me her and her ex boyfriend are going somewhere together as a last good bye. We talked about it and I kinda let her go, told her I couldn't be with her and she started crying on our lunch. The thing is, I kind of went back to her literally the same day, and she slept over. 

I'm not really sure what to do at this point. I like her a lot, and I also like sex, but I'm kinda possessive over her at this point. The trip she's taking with him is kinda bringing me down. I've talked to her the day before she went (they're going for two days) and asked her ""if he knew we were still sleeping with eachother would he still take you on this trip"", she told me no. We talked and she told me she didn't want a relationship right now but she's like possessive over me as well. Again we've never stated we're dating or a couple, but it feels like it. After we talked, she was saying it's like we're fwb but with STRINGS ATTACHED. She kinda told me to wait for her to sort her shit out and that she won't have sex with anyone else except for maybe her ex bf which I was kinda okay with since we kinda started off that way but I'm kinda realizing how fucked that is

I'm kind of lost in life. I'm also emotional and in a bad spot and me being with her kinda helps me destress. I don't get affection at all besides from her. Any advice or thoughts? I know I'm kinda fucked for this morally and I do understand she's kinda lost aswell",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sd3m27/an_interesting_woman_with_issues_i_met/

He tells me he is studying another degree-even though I just finished one and we talked about that he never brought this up and he is based 2 hours away although said he wanted to buy a house near where I said-he is not even sure he will be able to come to where I live I feel like all of this should have been disclosed earlier especially because talked about it via the dating app. He seems to not have his life figured out at all

Has this happened to you?

I was not going to follow-up with him since we seem to be in different places.

96,sd45l3,1643197657,Should I date a guy who paid me,"Backstory: Okay, so I was in a strip club that a promoter invited me because it was an special event and when I couldn't locate the promoter,  I decided to stand at the bar and get a drink. As I'm standing there, a guy approached me and asked was I working for the night. I'm not a dancer, so I was confused at what he was asking. I told him that I was just trying to find the person that invited me. He then asked if I'm interested in hanging out... I said idk. He said I was very beautiful and he world like to get to know me. We chat a little more and then he again says, we should hang out. He said how about 500 to get out of there with him and we have fun. I agreed and we left. He actually wasn't a creep,  and held my hand crossing the street. I thought that was a very sweet gesture and made me feel relaxed. He even opened the door for me and brought me something to drink from the convenience store. 

He then stopped by a friend's house to pick up what I discovered were E pills and coke. But he trusted me to go with him and actually introduce me to his friend. I thought that was very cool of him. Once we got to his apartment, he asked if I would do some E and coke with him and trust him, so I agreed. He said i would be okay and he would even do it first. I felt absolutely AMAZING.  It was the best feeling ever! We talked so much and He started sharing personal stories with me (even things he probably shouldn't have shared like his horrible dating past) but he said he wanted to change and stop sleeping around and cheating. I told him he had some toxic ways but I believe he can change and he agreed.  His eyes looked sad and I felt that he was being genuine and I started to feel something for him. We did have a ton of sex and I even rimmed him,  which I never really do,  but I really enjoyed pleasing him. I would only do that if i really felt something for a person. Even when it started to hurt during sex he would stop and not force me. When I was going to leave,  he asked me to please stay. He said he likes spending time with me and I'm a great girl, the sweetest girl. I really felt like he was being honest and I believed him. So I stayed and we even cuddled. 

He started to act weird at one point and he kept showing me videos of him having sex with other girls and then bringing up threesomes. He saw he was making me uncomfortable so he asked am I okay, which I thought was really sweet. I told him I just wanted to spend time with him,  he said okay and stopped pressuring me about the threesomes. He said he had really bad anxiety and i really felt for him, so i have him a nice massage and helped him relax. I just wanted to soothe him and he let me. I also told him he was making me uncomfortable about the issues with his ex girlfriend leaving shit on his car when she found out he had a girl over his place, he said he understood and apologized. He said he only brought it up to me because they just broke up a day ago and he felt bad. I felt really bad for him too. He seemed to notice these little things and care about my feelings.  He said he just wanted to get dinner with me,  so we went out and ate together. I felt so happy to be with him, I know I was high but like I felt so happy when he would my hand and kiss me. I honestly never felt happier and I felt like the feelings were genuine. He was nice to me and would even rub my back and kiss my forehead. I felt like I was falling head over heels for him. We eventually fell asleep but when we woke up he was a little stand off ish and it made me feel a little awkward and sad. I eventually left but he did end up checking on me and asked if I got home safe. We talked and he mentioned getting dinner again sometime. I didn't think he would want to see me again, but when he asked about this, I felt that maybe he liked me too or he wouldn't want to see me again. 

So my question is should I see him again and try to get to know him in a normal setting or is he not a good potential date and I just felt something for him because of being high? I really do think he is willing to change. He's 40 now and says he's looking to eventually settle down and start a family. I just don't know how genuine it is if he was willing to pay just to spend time with me and I'm not sure if that's a great way to start a relationship. 

Sidenote: I haven't dated someone in sometime now,  I usually spend a lot of time to myself. I would like to get out my shell and date again, I could be quite introverted when people approach me. I would just like to give someone nice a try. 

Update: I paid for dinner with the money he gave me and then left the rest with him when I left his house. Also, I never took E before, so I wasn't sure if it was JUST a high or if some of those feelings are actually real.
