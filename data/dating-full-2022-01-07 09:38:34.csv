I told her I was ok with a FWB situation but not an open relationship. She agreed and now we are FWB. But only on paper. This was yesterday, we havent slept together since then and didnt make any plans.

How did I meet her?

The situation was actually pretty funny because iirc it was after a concert we finished with our band, that I was speaking with a friend and his mother came to basically say hello to me and leave with him to their houses after the concert. The thing is, she was with 2 women, one of them was the one I'm talking about in this post, and the other was her sister or something.

SO, his mother said to me: ""Hey this is Rosa (we are Spanish), how about you 3 go and hang out for some time?"" I said fine why not. The first time this girl saw me she was giving me this type of look in the eyes when you think someone is attractive to you and you kinda want the other person to know it. I was like ""Welp, I think I'm attractive to this girl apparently"". Not that I think I'm ugly, I don't think I am, but I'm always surprised when something like this happens because I have some low self-esteem issues. 

From my part, what did I think? She was attractive to me honestly, and I didn't think she was a bad person, which is always what I'm looking for in a person as a basic trait.

Remembering this, I kinda feel bad for my friend because she and me were talking the whole time, and he was kinda left out of the convos always lmao. What we call in Spanish ""sujetavelas"".

The thing is, I've been for more than a year with no contact with her, and I would want to try and get to know her, and maybe date her if we click. I've been thinking this for a lot of time, but there are some ""drawbacks"" I'm insecure about and I don't know if they are dealbreakers, or If I'm overthinking them.

First of all, we have the fact of how I met her. Did his mother introduce me to this girl with good intentions as hey, maybe you could have a new friend here? Or did she have some kind of motive?

I know his mother and she is a good person, so probably she did it for us to hang out and for me to meet a new person, as his son kinda has trouble when making friends and stuff. So probably I am overthinking this part.

The other ""problem"", is that as she told me, basically all her family worked in a house of an old person and they were doing housetasks and stuff. So she wasn't studying and that was her work (I don't say it's a low work or something, but hear me out on this till the end).

She is a latina, and her whole family apparently was working on this, so this sounded me kinda bad for some reason, and I started going crazy thinking like: ""Is this person in need of a partner or something and they want me to be or something like that?""

Probably I'm overthinking all of this, since we stopped talking and she didn't contact me anymore so if the situation was REALLY FISHY, I have no doubt she would have started ""stalking me"" or something.

Again, I think I'm overthinking, but I want to hear your opinions on the matter.

If I don't overthink, this is a simple situation and pretty normal: I meet a girl, we stop talking because of life reasons, and after a year I want to talk to her again.

How do I approach her without being creepy and being natural? Is it better if I first just text her and see how it goes before meeting in person? (even tho she lives literally 15min away from my home).

A long story short, I am now in a commited relationship with someone whom I have been seeing now for roughly 7 months. Everything in our relationship seems to be going in a reasonable pace, our boundaries are respected, and we love each other very much. We’ve met each other’s friends/families, travelled abroad on holiday, and there’s a lot of care there. 

I knew going into the situation that he had a previous relationship where an unexpected pregnancy had occurred (they were together roughly a year). He broke up with her even though he loved her dearly because they obviously weren’t working. After a few months she told him that she was pregnant. He stepped up and tried to see if their relationship could work again now that there was a child in the picture (couples counseling, friends/family), but he soon realized that despite they had a child together, that they could never be together as a loving couple. According to him, she cheated on him a number of times while he was away on business, he was financially supporting her throughout the relationship (as she never worked anywhere permanently, and lived at home as a 36 year old woman), and was very manipulative towards him and his family. Lots of gaslighting, not taking responsibility, etc

I know there are always two sides of the story. But I have heard the conversations that they have had via text/phone and I am completely shocked by the things that she says, how she treats him and his family, and how she is obviously using their one year old daughter as a means of controlling him. He coordinates/pays trips for her and his daughter to be flown into town (so he can spend time with her— and the daughter can bond with his family) — or plans to drive 6 hours to see them and 90% of the time she cancels at the last minute. This has happened several times since we started dating so I can only imagine how long she has done this. And when he cries and begs to be able to see his daughter, that’s when she allows it on her terms.  he basically bends over backwards and takes her belittling and bad treatment because he’s desperate to be in his daughter’s life. He has admitted it himself, he takes it because he is aware that the mother is not mentally or emotionally well. And if he were to stand
up to it, she will make it harder for him to see his child. 

There are some things that concern me as I want to have this man more involved in certain parts of my life. I eventually want to slowly start introducing him to my son, etc. But there is something he does in regards to his ex that causes me to feel uneasy. He’s not ready for her to know that he is seeing someone seriously as it may cause conflicts with seeing his daughter. I leave belongings toiletries at his place as we sleep over at each others places quite often, only to come back to his and find that he has stored them out of sight. I suppose it’s when the mother and daughter come to visit.

Although weird (after all he told me to leave some stuff at his place), I initially went along with it not wanting to cause any issues. But this last time it happened, it really hurt me as it was a day or so after we said we loved each other. As we were packing up to leave for mines, he asked me to “hide” a pair of running shoes I leave there in a closet. He has no signs of me on his social media (because of mutual friends of his ex), whilst I may not put images of him on mine... I do post dates, places we have been to and travelled together, or our experiences. He says he knows how she would take it if she were to find out. Which leaves me to feel like a secret. 


 I’ve  removed my things from his place and have now restricted sleepovers at his place to avoid the discomfort of that every time I come or go. Is there more to this than what he is telling me?

In the 3 weeks between we didn’t really talk as much as we normally do which made sense because we were both busy. He did reach out and wished me a happy birthday so I feel like that shows he still cared? I initiated a conversation a few times and we just had a back and forth once a day reply kinda thing. He came back from his hometown this past weekend and texted me when he got back and few days later asked me to grab lunch. However the texting is at a minimum and it never was like this before he left. I’m usually waiting 5-12+ hours for a response. The fastest he’s replied was probably the day we met just because we had to figure out a place to meet. When we did meet, I won’t lie I was a bit annoyed just because of how this whole thing is making me feel. He asked me if I would be free next week to do something and I said for sure. I kind of want to bring up the sparseness in communication. We’re both applying to grad school so that could be why he’s suddenly so busy but I kind of suspect he may be talking to someone else since it wasn’t like this before he left and was still busy with applications. And in that case I’d like to cut things off because I don’t want to be anyones second choice. Sorry for this long ramble, but would it be weird/too much if I texted, “Hey, I feel like things have been a little distant since you’ve gotten back and I just wanted to check in and see if everything is okay.

We’ve met up twice now, once in the city where I live, and the second time I went to his city. We had a great time, especially that second time. A long beachwalk, a movie and food at his place, and you know the rest. Everything was fantastic and he clearly made it seem he felt the same way. This was 2+ weeks ago.

We don’t text a lot and that’s perfectly fine with me, I figured that especially since he’s from an older generation he’s probably not as big of a texter (and to be fair, neither am I). What was really nice of him is that at new years he actually sent me a happy new year first. May seem like a small thing, but it made me feel good that he thought to send that to me. After some doubting whether I should initiate another meetup (at first I wanted to wait and see if he maybe would take that initiative this time) I figured I should just throw that idea out there instead of waiting around. And so I asked him if he’d like to hangout again sometime, last Tuesday. He read it that same evening but didn’t respond right away. This didn’t concern me because he’s done that before and then he would respond a couple hours later. But.. it has been three days now and I’m getting a bit unsure of what I should think about this. Maybe he forgot? Maybe he’s really busy? Maybe he isn’t interested anymore but doesn’t want to tell me (or this is his way of telling me)? 

I’m not sure what I should do now. Should I say something? And if so, what should I say?

Hi ______,
Happy Thursday :) I hope your day is going alright. 
I just wanted to say, like I said earlier this week, I had a great time getting to know you. You seem like a nice guy, and I hope I showed you everywhere you were hoping to see in the city of Nashville. Although I had a great time with you, I think we’re just incompatible in terms of what we’re both looking for. I was using Tinder in hopes of finding a long-term relationship, and that’s still what I’m looking for. I’m not exactly sure what you’re looking for. I’m sure you’re open to one, just not with me. And that’s okay. What we did on Saturday (oral) probably sent the message that I was looking for a hookup anyway, so I’m sorry if I made you think that. I've never done that before, and I'm kind of annoyed with myself that I sort of messed things up with you. I don’t want to force you to be interested in me. And I feel like I was doing that when I asked you to hang out this Friday, and messaging you. Your interest in me has seemed to wane a bit, so I think we should just part ways. I wish you good luck in Nashville, and I hope you’re able to find what you’re looking for :)

We  had are third date yesterday. So far things are great. first date went  3hrs, 2nd date went 3.5hrs and last night went 4hrs. There seems to be  definite interest and she has done things like checking her schedule and  throwing out ideas for next date.

But  her texting is so hit and miss and confuses me. We met on hinge and she  was responsive about once a day. Then after our first date it  definitely didnt pick up or anything. But after 2nd date we had some  goodnight texts and how was day stuff, but then she suddenly really  slowed down. We maybe only send one or two messages back and fourth, but  she started to only send me like one text late at night that was real  brief and straight to the point.

Look  I am not  huge texter and being in person is much better, but after  fourth date I sent her a text saying that I hope she had a safe drive  home and to have a goodnight. But no response yet.

It  feels like the more dates we go on the less responsive she is over text  which is weird to me and the one time I suggested a call it didnt  happen. But on the date things are great.

I  just thought I was losing her interest tbh. When things started with  smile faces and a bit more excitement but now straight to the point  short texts I really thought something was up, but the date went great  and she definitely seemed excited about meeting again last night.

I dont know how to take it. I probably should just focus my energy on in person, but it would help to understand a bit more.

Maybe since things feel good in person she doesnt feel the need to keep things as active over text or calls?

I just like to know how her day is going. Definitely if we discussed what she was going to do the next day.

There's this girl who I've known for a while that I went to a crazy boarding school with and we never talked a whole lot, but we've always stalked each other over the years and I've always had a crush on her ""from a distance"" because I was living my life in college with girls all over me and she was a few years younger at the time. 

Anyways, it was so random, I met a new friend and she happened to be co workers with her! I didn't even recognize her the first time I saw her (only because she usually wears her hair down and had it in a bun that night, and it had been a while since I've seen her). I messaged her the next day after I realized it was her essentially saying I knew you looked familiar last night etc, she had also asked her friend how the hell she knew me. A couple days later I said we should go out and catch up, no answer. A couple days after that I just tried to see if she was working so I could say hi because I felt bad that I didn't recognize her, she wasn't working though she said, I just said Bummer, next time! Then asked how she's been doing, again no response. (I don't have any expectations here or haven't been weird, I know how women work, but this situation is so different because we've known each other for a while.) 

Then a couple days later a mutual ""friend"" adds me on Facebook from said boarding school (a girl) with only a few mutual friends (one of them obviously the girl I'm talking about), instantly I go to, Well she must be talking about me to other friends too because I haven't received a Facebook invite from someone from that school in a loooooong time, it just seemed too coincidental, even tho the girl who added me said there wasn't ( I also noticed that she messaged my friend right after this interaction because I could see they were both offline for the exact same amount of time right after, can't be another coincidence can it? My friend also watches EVERY single one of my snaps and I know she's not big into using social media right now. 

I would consider myself ""high value"", I've always had women chasing me, working to better myself, decently good looking with a great personality, and now I have a great job and working with a lot of crypto. Since I haven't been dating for a while and I've never had to put myself out there since they essentially they all came to me I'm finding myself in a situation where it's finally the other way around. 

Basically either she REALLY likes me and is scared, or I'm making all this up in my mind and she doesn't. But I haven't set any expectations and we are friends so its weird that she is scared to go out and even catch up (yet anyways, we just saw each other last week). I don't want to play games but at the same time I think she's beautiful and we are ""cut from the same cloth"" kind of thing, lots of similar life experiences. Do I just straight up tell her I have always liked her and want to get to know her more? Is she mad at me for not recognizing her? Does she still think I'm a ""player"" and wants to play it safe? Never thought id be writing something like this but here I am. Anyone else with similar situation? Any girls chime in?

While we were texting, it just felt perfect, learned everything about each other in a matter of months, just had a connection, we opened up to each other almost completely. As things went on, she started getting less interested in me and things I like to talk about, which are history, deep subjects etc, which I do understand, she might not just care about such topics. But she mostly talked about herself, somehow every subject we talked about was mostly about her life or some side topic we both like talking about, for example animals, marketing etc, even we I tried talking about my day, my life, plans etc, she brushed it off after 1 or 2 sentences, while if she said ""I am going to get some wood for a fire"" I made the effort to find 10 questions about that sentence and keep chat going. My point is, she seemed to stop caring about my life and had not invested as much as effort in chat as I did. Felt like I was just someone she can talk to to spend her time, who would always be there for her, send her cute messages, ask her about her day, be romantic, go out of my way to please her, etc, while she did not do such things.

Anyway. I saw him, and swiped left, as I already have his name and last name, and can text him on social media instead of the dating app.

What would you do? 
75% of me wants to play hard to get and NOT be the one to initiate contact again. If he swiped right on me, he might as well text me on the other places, i mean, if he wants to talk to me he can, outside the dating app. The other 25% of me wants to swallow my pride, and confront him a little bit.

I’m very confused about the whole situation. To make things short, I met John on vacation over a year ago. We hung out over the course of several days, and I started to like him. 

One night, he introduced me to Jim and a couple of other people our age. Jim and these other friends have known each other since childhood. John and I just met them on the trip. I was drunk, and Jim was kind of hitting on me, putting his hand around my waist and my head on his chest. I had to get taken to bed, and after, Jim started talking about how he thinks I’m hot, and that he wanted to hook up with me. John got mad at Jim and told him that he couldn’t hook up with me because he liked me. 

Since everyone knew what he said, they all told me the next morning. I wanted to know details about what exactly he said, and how it happened, but they were very vague (I found out later that they didn’t want to expose Jim). When I saw John again, I pulled him to the side and asked him if he liked me, he said that they must’ve told me as a joke, because he has a girlfriend. 

I was shocked. He never mentioned her. None of our other friends knew of her either. I tried to request him on Instagram, hoping we could at least be social media friends, but he rejected it after a couple of weeks. I blocked him for a couple of days, and John got upset that I blocked him. He told everyone that I blocked him, including Jim. Jim later messaged me asking me if I was okay. 

John and his girlfriend broke up, and after they broke up, he watches my social media. Everything. He’s always looking on my Twitter, TikTok, and he’s always one of the first to view the posts. It’s been over a year, and he still looks at everything, despite not being in contact with me.

I understand online dating is difficult since you haven’t met this person physically, but it’s like I’m the only one trying and it’s soul-destroying. I’ve also never been in a real relationship before, so that’s also why I feel like maybe I’m missing something. Do I just suck at talking? Do I not seem interested?

My ex and I dated for about 3 years while in college. We were each other’s first relationship. Everything went very smooth, we rarely fought, got along really well, had a lot in common. He was my best friend and dream guy.

Alittle after the 2 year mark I could start to feel that I wasn’t the top priority anymore and it felt like he was getting complacent with me. I felt like he wasn’t “in love” with me. I expressed these feelings numerous times and he explained that he would change his behavior. As time went on nothing seemed to change and I grew frustrated and ended up breaking it off. I just couldn’t stay in a relationship like that any longer. I didn’t ask for much other than love and reassurance.

We have been broken up for alittle over a year now. We are on good terms but don’t talk. However, he did recently just congratulate me on getting accepted into graduate school which shocked me. I was over the relationship for the longest time, but recently feelings have started to resurface. Now that we’ve had some time apart and we are more established in life… I can’t help but think that maybe it could work now? At the same time, I have been peaceful with being alone and working on myself and I guess at I’m scared that if I open that can of worms it could interfere.
