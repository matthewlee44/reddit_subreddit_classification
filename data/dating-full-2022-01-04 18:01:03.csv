shes currently been staying at her friends house because of covid though too.  And the 30th we had a sexting session where things got pretty intense lol. 

when i do text her though it ends up with her saying how much she thinks of me, misses me and we sext.

Fast forward to October 2020, I decided to shoot my shot and she said she didn’t have feelings for me anymore, whatsoever. Now what I should have done is probably cut off communication and all ties with her, because I needed to move on but I couldn’t bring myself to do it so I just decided to try and be just friends. This works for a good while and then comes summer 2021, we decide to start hanging out with each other much more frequently. As I should expected, those feelings resurfaced and just kept growing stronger. College started up in august (I’m a freshman) and weirdly that seemed to make us closer. We started having 8 hour long phone calls, she would always set aside time to meet up with me, she started getting touchy with me and I did with her, posting pictures of us together on her socials (which she never did with anyone else), even getting to the point where she wanted me to meet her parents, whom I had on board with me within three hours apparently (apparently they wanted to meet me because she talked about me all the time to them and at work). So all of that obviously had me thinking, “damn maybe there’s a chance here, maybe her feelings changed again!” Spoiler alert: they didn’t.  I returned to our work for Christmas break where apparently me and her had been a subject of discussion for a few months, to the point where everyone agreed we were perfect for one another. Whenever she was asked about it though she would say he’s not my type, or that it would be weird to hold hands in public (which is bizarre because she’s fine with us hugging in public or if I put my arm around her). They would even ask her to describe her ideal guy and the description was spot on me so they would ask her why not give me a shot and she’d just say I don’t know. Now a few nights ago she went in for a hug, now I wasn’t necessarily prepared and my hand landed on the back of her head and I froze, at that point though I just sent it and rubbed the back of her head. This apparently made her EXTREMELY uncomfortable to the point she ranted about it to our coworkers the next day (apparently she thought I was going to kiss her). I did apologize and explain that was never my intent (and she knows I would never do something like that without permission). She said we’re good but then proceeded to cancel our hangout for Wednesday. My friends started pointing out that it seemed like she was using me for attention which I don’t completely buy but who knows. At this point I feel like the only thing I can do is to cut her off but I don’t know if I can bring myself to do it, she’s my best friend and I feel like I’ll never find someone I can connect with as much as her. I’ve been stressing so much over this and been trying to find another way even though I doubt there is. I’ve never felt this strongly about anyone ever and I just don’t know what to do.

They are both 21M and I’m 19F.  We all have been friends for 5 years. However, one is an ex boyfriend (I’ll explain). We like to laugh about it and call it dating lite because we never kissed or really held hands. We dated for 2 months when I was 14 and he was 16. After that we just decided to be friends although we both at the time said we loved each other. Since then we both dated other people. I recently got out of a three year long relationship (as of a year ago) and he has not been in a relationship for three years. However, as of a month ago I’ve been talking with this guy I grew up with, I’ve known him since I was 6 years old. He was my neighbor and friend growing up and we both have always had a crush on each other. The only downside is he’s in the army and so where he is stationed, he’s a couple hours ahead. We both decided yesterday that we were exclusive and I was so excited. We decided to call it that so then we could take this week to see if we could do long distance since it is a huge commitment especially with him in the army and me at college. It’s only been day one and I feel like everything is messed up. 

So here is what happened. I’m hanging out with my friends and it’s about 10pm. We all decide we need to go home because we all sat in my car and caught out since we closed down the restaurant we were in. We all say our goodbyes and my ex says “I have something for you”. This is very out of character for him but I’m like okay. We go back to sit in my car since it is freezing and he gave me all of his Twilight books he has since I haven’t been able to find a copy and he had them for some reason and I’ve always teased him about it. We talk for a bit about our up coming semester. He then grabs my hand a bit hard and rushed in and kissed me (like a peck type). I lurched back immediately and said I need to leave. He then said “that never happened okay?”.

I don’t know what to do. I’m obviously going to have to tell the guy in the army but I have no clue how. I’ve never been in this situation. I’ve never cheated on someone and I felt like this was cheating even though I didn’t kiss back and the kiss was god awful. What do I do? How do I go about it? I really like the army guy.

I’m a 22 year old male that just started recently living on my own in an apartment. 

During uni I used to live with my parents and I didn’t date anyone as I was focused on finishing my degree and working at my family’s business. So I’m sort of late to everything going on in the dating world.

I recently just started dating a girl who is 20 and still in uni. We’ve been on 4 dates so far. 

For our next date she asked if she could spend the night at my place and just hang out so that’s what we have planned. I’m gonna be picking her up as she lives in a shared apartment with her friends.

I currently have my car all cleaned up, all my rooms and bathrooms cleaned up, bed and couch all tidied up and everything overall clean. Also bought some candles that my mom used to buy from bed and baths and some room fresheners just in case to make sure the place smells nice.

Not sure how to dress like in casual or semi-casual clothes. We’re mainly just going to stay inside, she’s bring some food over to cook, and we’ll just watch some movies and play games together.

Consistency, availability, reliability, responsiveness, predictability, flexibility, agreeability, naturally giving, and easygoing.

Whether you are gay, straight, asexual, male or female….being a good partner is actually pretty standard. 

Telling women to make men chase scares away the good guys and specifically attracts men who don’t respect boundaries.

Telling men to chase teaches them that women are a prize to be won which devalues both parties right off the bat. 

The best thing we can do is try to be a friend to our partner, if you can do that you’re a good partner. All I had to do was refuse to chase women and start meeting more women until I liked one who also liked me enough to put in effort back and 100% of my previously unbearably insecurities are gone. I no longer get jealous, feelings of inadequacy, feel neglected, feel pathetic, worry that my partner doesn’t care….it just doesn’t happen anymore. My fear of commitment is gone completely and it is 100% because I refuse to be the only person putting effort in even if it’s just the very beginning “getting to know you process”.

But to add to the mix, I (27 F) also had my first real heartbreak during that year. I met a guy that I fell head over heels for. It was great at first, but I guess I didn't notice how toxic and mentally abusive he was until it ended nine months later. He showed up on my doorstep with my stuff, sat me down, and told me that it wasn't going to work, and that he'd tried to fall in love with me but never would. I get it, sometimes love doesn't happen, but the way he treated me throughout that nine months left me feeling unwanted and deflated, if I'm being honest. It was a good learning moment for me in terms of relationships, and I took a year and a half off to better myself.

Here's where my problem really starts. I've been seeing this guy and it's progressed to the fourth date. Not super crazy, I know, it's only date number four, but I like him and I really think he likes me. When he dropped me off after date 3, he tried to initiate more but I let him know that I don't really swing that way so soon. He was respectful of it, and asked me on date 4... which he is now suggesting we have at my place, just something lowkey with takeout. I feel like an idiot, but I'm kinda freaking out. I don't know if I'm ready to let my guard down for another person. If I'm being honest, deep down I'm still really crushed by the way my ex treated me and the rejection of my first love. I've been on dating apps for months and have been numb to it all. This guy I've been seeing has managed to slip past that defense. I'm worried that he'll want more than I can give tomorrow, that I'll make a fool of myself, or make the same mistake I did in 2020 and get stuck with another broken heart. I know this may sound panicky or rambling, but this man just texted me about the date tomorrow and I had a minor internal ""oh shit"" moment at my desk at work.

Any advice would be appreciated, thanks for taking the time to read this.

so I need dating advice about something. here are the hard facts:  


\- I'm working in Germany. A girl from India joined the company, shortly after moved to Germany  
\- We liked each other and opened up quickly  
\- According to her she is in a **crumbling open marriage** (no bad blood. she jokingly even suggested introducing me to her spouse)  
\- We flirted, hung out, had sex  
\- There are major difference in music/media preference and diet, still a strong connection  
\- We went to Rome together  
\- Sex was ok, was getting way! better  
\- With her husband returning (he was gone for some time) I couldn't perform anymore, knowing there is somebody in the background  
\- I said I wanted sth serious. She said to decide til the end of 21  
\- we grew a little apart, still in contact. I partly got annoying or needy I'm quite sure. (texting often, being impatient, now way more controlled)  
\- I'm leaving the company. Partly as I can't handle this anymore  
\- She is back in India now for a month. Returning soon

But this is a fairly typical online dating story for me these days:

I match with guy on the dating app that I use. Guy messages me. He sounds nice. We start talking about our families, hobbies, interests, any people we know in common - normal topics. It turns out we have a lot in common. A quality conversation develops and continues. We are both excited.

A few days later, one evening he texts me that he is in bed and he would like to do x y z to me. I am in the middle of doing dishes or hanging out with my friends or whatever when it arrives, so I'm not in an already aroused state, unlike him. Also, even in an aroused state, doing x does nothing to me, doing y is something I find more ridiculous than sexy, and someone tried doing z to me in the past and it was unpleasant. And again, while he sounds like a nice guy, we still haven't met and I have no idea if he even looks like his pictures IRL - and he doesn't know this about me either. To me, this is just gross and sounds totally disingenuine, as well as inconsiderate of him.

I say something about not being into sexting. He is disappointed. I go on to reassure him that he looks attractive on his pictures and I'm sure he is an amazing lover, and it's not about him. At this point, he either 
a., gets mad, accuses me of not liking sex and I drop him like a hot potato; or 
b., if he reacts normally and says sorry then the following happens:

I try to get his awkward sexts out of my head and I hope we can go back to the normal progression of this new relationship. Maybe we go back to a normal convo briefly, but after like 5 minutes he is again saying that he wants to put his finger in my butt. 
At this point, I know that I landed in the ""sexting buddy zone"" and there is no way out. Meeting up in person at this point is pretty much off the table, because I guess it would be awkward for him to meet and face in real life the person to whom he wrote all those weird things, and go roller-skating and eating ice cream and whatnot. He never asks me out, doesn't even initiate a hookup or any kind of IRL sex, despite me hinting that I would much prefer one or both of those things to just texting. Communication between us shrinks to him sending me a new yet very repetitive unsolicited sext every few weeks or so, despite me never reacting. I finally get fed up and block him.

The big drawback of sexting is that you cannot see the other person's nonverbal cues so you cannot tailor your reactions appropriately. During IRL sex, this is something that happens naturally (unless if you are a rapist).

I am convinced that these guys are relatively decent people IRL and it's the online medium that brings out this behaviour in them and they simply forget that they are talking to a person.

I think before sending an unsolicited sext, a man should consider how he would feel if a woman he had never been even on one date with started texting him about the colour scheme she wants for her wedding to him, the names of all 6 of her future children from him and how they want to be a stay at home mum in the suburbs (while he works his ass off). Any normal, sane man would run for the hills from something like this. Receiving an unsolicited sext from a man doesn't feel that different from this.

It seemed to be going well. We were into a lot of the same things, worked in the same field. Then she asked me if I could drive. I told her I had a moped but not a car and that I was planning on getting my licence this year. She then dived in and started asking loads of questions about why I don't have a licence and how I live my life like 'why didn't you learn when you were 17?' and 'how do you get to places?' I explained that it wasn't by choice, life had just worked out a little funny for me after school so I went to university, came home and got a job and saved up for driving lessons and then covid happened (apparently a worldwide pandemic isn't a good enough excuse). She also annoyed me by essentially laughing at me that I drive a moped. It gets me from A to B and is cheap so I'm perfectly happy with it. She told me she lives in the middle of nowhere so I need to be able to drive to come and pick her up for our date (which I hadn't even yet asked her on). It seemed me picking her up was the only way this date was going to happen. When I asked her if me being able to drive was a dealbreaker, she said yes. Eventually she relented and said that she would drive for this date but that I HAD to get to her (about 30 miles away from where I live), no possibility of her coming here or meeting somewhere in the middle. She made me feel like quite a loser and added that I needed to make learning to drive a priority because she didn't want to wait to meet me. Then she started asking when I was going to come down for this date telling me she'd like to go this weekend (which I still hadn't asked her on).

Is driving really that important? I get that it might be a bit unusual for a 24 year old not to drive and that quite often dates do pick each other up and take them home again and that men are meant to be chivalrous and plan the whole date and pay. But is it really not possible for a date to go ahead if the man cannot drive? I'm completely clueless with this. I've only been on one date in my life when I was 18. Was she right in saying that I HAD to go to her for the date?

I (f,24) have recently broken up with my ex (m,32) of 4 years. We were engaged but our relationship were very toxic in the end and we broke up. 

Coincidentally I have ran into the person who was his classmate in uni (they are acquaintances with my ex, but nothing near being friends . My ex actually doesn’t like the guy so much ) , we started a conversation and when he found out I was single, we went out on a date(I liked the guy as a person before but never romantically because I didn’t look at any guys this way). So far we had a lot in common, pretty good chemistry and ended up sleeping and then talking a lot after, hanging out. It’s definitely going towards a relationship vibe, especially from the guy, he’s really treating me nicely. I would even say he’s being very romantic,
More than me . I genuinely like him too but sometimes moments with him remind me of my ex and I feel extremely guilty and sad. I don’t know why.  

Technically they were never friends and I truly logically don’t see a problem but maybe it’s just me grieving my previous breakup? It’s just that with a new guy we are sharing some intimate moments (sex, spending time together almost as a couple) that it’s hard to imagine I’m actually doing it with a new man … and the fact that this new man is related to my ex, even slightly adds up.

I’ve always had problems regarding girls and dating in general. 

I always feel like i’m a waste of time of the person i’m talking with. Especially when i talk to girls.

I keep on working on myself… I regularly go to the gym, train a lot and study. I don’t have lots of friends at all… so i don go out during evenings. I used to have a friend but he was popular and never had trouble with girls. Our friendship faded due to his new gf ( about 1 year ago… ). I’m ok with that, i know it can happen. 

This friend caused me lots of insecurities, and i eventually deleted instagram. I feel way better rn regarding that aspect, but ofc my chances to meet new people or new girls decreased. 

I tried to meet people through courses, but they were all in their mid 20s with their lives and so on. Girls too.

Tried therapy for 1 year, didn’t work. 
I’ll have another meeting with my psychiatrist. I really hope she’ll give me drugs. I’ve had suicidal thoughts in these weeks.

It’s just that i hate myself. I like myself only when i lift. Walking on the streets and seeing couples around makes me feel very bad about myself, cause i can’t imagine myself holding a girl’s hand, or simply being on a date.

Feel free to ask me questions about anything, whether that be below in the comments or my DMs.

Some background: I am a 22-year-old virgin man. I come from an abusive background where I have consistently been taken advantage of. Because of this, I suffer with some mental health problems such as depression and anxiety. I have had to visit the hospital before, but I go to therapy, and I take medication. I feel pretty stable at this point. I am currently a sophomore in college but have no real home to call my own because I cut ties with my parents. I usually live out of state with my great aunt over breaks (I have few alternatives) so that also makes getting a relationship difficult. I have several friends, but no one I feel comfortable fully confiding in (apart from one online friend).

I have precious little experience with women, but what experience I do have is not that great. I have tried dating apps, but that has almost always ended with me being ghosted (I barely get any matches to begin with). I have been introduced to a girl by a friend, but that didn't end well either and I was just strung along. I have even stepped outside of my comfort zone before: I've attempted a cold approach before (bad idea) and even acted on trying to start a relationship with a little crush I had (she stopped talking to me). I cuddled with a couple different girls, but the experience wasn't special to them in the slightest, and it crushed me.

I honestly have no idea where to turn. I think having a girlfriend would be awesome and maybe even help me out in some ways. It would be nice to be held and feel loved, you know? I want someone I can feel safe with. But I have had no luck, and I feel this overwhelming sense of loneliness day after day. I've lived a dark and pretty hopeless life. I want someone to share my life with now, instead of walking alone. I understand getting a girlfriend won't magically solve all my problems; hopefully I am not giving off that impression. And I understand that relationships are a two-way street, and I would also be there for her.

In short, I feel like I have exhausted all of my avenues to getting a good healthy relationship. I don't know what else to do.

We caught up again and did the same thing before he went away for a month.

A few months ago I reached out to my ex and asked if he wanted to still be friends. We had small talk once every few weeks after that.

Anyways my ex reached out to me last week. He wanted to hang out with me and watch a tv series that we both were into since a new season was coming out. He planned on making us dinner and even was making me a gift using the hobby that he does. I told him I would return the favor and would make him a gift as well. He’s been really sweet and texting me with hearts which he hasn’t done since we were dating. I’ve been doing it back. He even said he wants me to meet his family to do a certain activity with them(which I didn’t meet them before when we were dating). 

Today he sent me a selfie and I complimented him, and then went cold on me after that. 

Should I ask him what his intentions are with us hanging out and making gifts for each other?  Or just leave it alone?

I don’t mind rekindling a romance but I don’t know if that’s what he’s trying to do or not.

A few years ago my ex gf dumped me. It was a long distance relationship and we disagreed on wanting a family but otherwise it was mostly perfect. 
I very quickly started dating as I was completely devastated and looking for a replacement. Stupid of course in hindsight . I pleaded with my ex to change her mind but she was resolute. I mentioned we could be fwb whilst seeing others but at the time she wasn't sure and said if we do I'd need to stop once I start seeing someone. I told my ex I was back on dating sites

Fast forward a few weeks I went on a date it went well and I had a second planned . My ex out the blue wanted to meet as a friend to which I agreed. We went to the beach and fooled around. She pretty much acted as she had done whilst we were together. 
The following week she stayed a few nights and we had sex. She just happened to be on holiday near where I lived. I assumed it was a final goodbye. She told me she hoped I would find a nice girl .
The following week I had my second date and she stayed the night. We didn't have sex but she went to kiss me and I didn't stop her. A few days later my ex asked about the dates and I told her about the kiss. She went mad saying 'you don't know what you've just lost 'and said I part cheated. She then blocked me. I was really upset but I thought I hadn't done much wrong as I was single and I thought because my ex knew I was dating she might expect it. I didnt think of myself as seeing this person at this stage. Being with my ex ws torture and I felt like I needed to know there was someone else.
Anyway I saw the other girl again thinking things were definitely fully over with my ex including the fwb. Still no sex but she stayed over again. I managed to contact my ex via Facebook and she asked if I saw the girl again. I lied and said no because I told her previously how much i loved my ex which was true. I told her I'd told the girl about my ex and didn't want to see her again. I did this but not at the time of the phone call as I wasn't sure if my ex was coming back or not and selfishly didn't want to lose the other girl in case.

My ex came to visit me after that as a final goodbye. We had sex again. She asked if the girl slept in my bed and I lied and said no because I wasn't sure she'd believe we didn't have sex and I couldn't face upsetting her again. A day before she was due to leave she said she would see me again and we ended up back together before splitting again a year later because we couldn't close the distance

We were both cheated on in our past relationships and have trust issues but for some reason we completely trust eachother. He is 1000x a better man than my ex. So the problem here is...My ex is his boss. My ex hasnt stopped texting me. He always reaches out to hangout or just ask me if ive found someone new or literally any kind of information he can get out of me. Its gotten so bad that he is texting my sisters boyfriend just to ask what im doing and if im with someone, and my sisters boyfriend also works for him as well. My ex also had an issue with my new man before we brokeup. We got into an argument over him and he had a dream that we were going to date if we ever brokeup. Guess that one came true.  My ex wants to get coffee in 2 days and i know he is going to ask me literally every question he can to get information and i dont know if i should straight up tell him im dating one of his employees or just lie until more time has passed. im worried that once he knows, he is going to fire him for being with me and maybe even fire my sisters boyfriend for lying that he didnt know anything. I dont want to be responsible for people getting fired...but my ex acts out of anger and makes poor decsions when he is angry so it is highly likely that there will be some kind of backlash from him.  what should i do? any advice helps",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1148142,public,self,my ex is my new boyfriends boss and i dont know what to do.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rwaq9y/my_ex_is_my_new_boyfriends_boss_and_i_dont_know/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,

I'm 26 m and she's 26 f.

2 month ago I go out with this girl off tinder we vibe. Before our second date we had a few phone calls where we talked about relationships and a bunch of stuff and what she's looking for. 2nd date we go on we hangout in my car as I drop her off I ask her for a kiss, she saids no and saids she wants to be friends because I'm a good vibe. I then made sure I clarified because I can be really straight forward that she was neither looking for a relationship or a friends with benefits/hookup.

Skip to 2 days ago where I moved to my new place and were still talking, were vibing on my bed and watching Netflix. I wanna clarify i made 0 moves on her, and was so uninterested i was in my pajamas didn't even dress up nice lol. At some point I look at her and say whats up (she made a weird noise like she's nervous) then she saids she wants to kiss me this was like an hour and half into hanging out. I ask her what changed before kissing her because I'm curious why she denied me before she saids she was feeling it tonight. We start with a kiss then cuddles then making out right into sex. Which was okay I wasn't really feeling it, idk why even though it was my first time having sex (virgin). I busted a nut in like 30 seconds in and kinda just stopped at that point which I assume was not the best experience for her but pre nut she seemed like she was having a good time lol. We also messed around for 30 mins pre sex (making out, touching). Over all wasn't feeling it myself but went through with it anyways.

After that she saids this never happened which I was like yeah it did lol, at this point I'm pretty blunt and meme around since I don't really care that much. My attitude was like that the whole night since im not really trying to impress anyone, were just friends or so i thought. I'm confused wdf is going on in her head. I'm not exacly crazy about her not like when I first met her, but what should I be expecting now after she said this never happened lol

I should also point out were freakishly similar in some things, which she pointed out as well and I was okay with us just being friends when she denied me that night two months ago then she hooks up with me.

Any advice is appreciated and let me know if I can clarify on anything!
