It went well and we had a great conversation (for a little over 2 hours). At the end, after she walked with me to the subway station, she asked for a hug. 40 minutes later, around the time when I came back home, she sent me a message on the app thanking me for coming to her neighborhood and saying she had a good time. It looked good for a second date, so I told her I had a good time too and that I'd like to do it again soon. She said that she would like to.

She was out of town the following weekend (Oct 2-3), so I wanted to plan something for last week (Oct 4-8). On Monday, she told me she probably could do it Wednesday or Thursday, but that she would confirm Tuesday. Tuesday comes and she tells me that Wednesday/Thursday wouldn't be ideal (I think it's because she had to leave work late), but that she could either Friday night if her dinner does not take place, or Sunday end-of-afternoon. I tell her I can't on Sunday (she knows I have my hockey league), but Friday after work would be doable. On Friday at around noon, she tells me that her dinner won't take place, but that she is very tired and that we should find another time.

At this point, I start to think something doesn't smell good. She started working 6 days/week recently, but at the same time, I know that when a girl wants to see you, she will try her best. Now, it looks to me like she either does not want the 2nd date to take place or that I am a backup plan, at best. Or maybe I am just making scenarios in my head? I told her that I had other plans anyway for the evening and I wished her a good rest. She thanked me, I gave her message a like and didn't plan to write back.

But Saturday, she wrote me back, asking me if I had fun plans for the weekend, so the conversation resumed, but I tried to keep my messages shorter and not asking as many questions back if any. She wished me a good game yesterday and this morning, she asked me if we had won. I still feel like there is a level of interest on her part, but she hasn't brought the second date topic back on the table yet. Her messages throughout the week were not short and seemed engaged and she gave a like to most of my messages. She has asked for a rain check before our first date (and we still had our first date), so I am willing to give her the benefit of the doubt.

Should I try one last time to plan a second date this week or is the ball in her court? I want this date to take place, but I don't want to lose my time and I don't want to be the guy that keeps asking for a date if she's not interested. If I should be the one to ask her for a second date, should I keep the conversation going and in a ""cool"" way, like ""Hey, I'm going to do X on this day, come if you want"" or should I do it in a more ""serious"" manner, like ""Hey, is this conversation leading to a second date at some point?

This is my first time posting and I need some advice/help. I'm not sure how to explain this so that way anyone who reads this would understand and without giving out too much info but I'll give it a shot. I'll try to keep this short but there's a person I'm curious about and she works at a restaurant I go to every week (I say I'm curious because I literally know nothing about her and she's always wearing a mask for obvious reasons).

Back story.
She used to work at a different restaurant I used to go frequently as well but she left and the restaurant is no longer opened on the day I usually go. Fast forward a few weeks later, the current restaurant she works at also turns out to be a place I go to every week as well even before she started working there (yes, I order takeout almost everyday because my hours at work are long and I get too lazy to cook most days). I was curious about her before but thought I'd never see her again after she left her previous job but now I'm even more curious after seeing her at this place too. She's given me signs before and I absolutely regret not doing anything when she was at the old restaurant because it would usually just be her at the front counter and the kitchen staff in the back but I'm an over thinker and suffer from anxiety so I didn't do anything. She's given me signs even now but the situation got worse at this place she works at now because this place is much bigger and  has about 6 to 8 people working up-front (2 to 3 of them working at the front counter and 4 to 5 people waiting tables and this doesn't include people working in the back kitchen). She seems really close to them all as well so it really doesn't help my situation at all. She definitely wanted my attention when she first started working there and I engaged the conversation with her first but once I did that, everyone who works there stopped and basically huddled around us at that moment and for obvious reasons, I felt really uncomfortable. As I was leaving I can hear her explain to them how we kinda know each other and let me tell you, that walk to the front door felt very long even though it takes about 15 seconds to get too. Now everyone's pretty much watching every time I walk in. 
I should also mention that the name they know me by isn't my name, it's my brother's name and here's why that is. They record the name and number in their system and my brother used to do all the calling before so that's the name and number that's saved. So they greet me with his name and not my own and didn't bother me until now lol. Yes, I know. It's complicated (to me anyways). 

So finally the questions. How do I approach someone (while suffering from anxiety) who is always surrounded by people who are always listening and while being really close? I do make the order over the phone and she occasionally picks up so if there's an opportunity there, please share but again, if they stare now when I haven't done anything, how awkward would it be if I did say something over the phone? And how do I give her my actual name and number? Lol

Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated and if you've gotten this far, thanks for reading! If there's any questions feel free to ask I'll try to answer as soon as possible.

I lean on what I consider to be more credible and objective sources, and I'm significantly more liberal than she is. In attempting to talk about politics, we seem to have have significant overlap in our attitudes about the role of government, but our interpretation of current events differs widely because of our the different interpretations that come from our respective news sources. Some things she believes that influence how she votes are conspiracy theories that have been debunked (though she seems unaware of that) ages ago.

She seems to realize Facebook isn't a great place to get your news from and appears open to taking in news from other sources. Being able to discuss current events calmly and rationally with my significant other is really important to me, and I think this girl is something special. If I can make this work, I would like to.

I (23F) had been seeing this guy (23M) for about 3 months, and yesterday he cryptically broke things off. We'd been mutuals on Twitter for about a year and a half, so we had known each other for a while but never met in person. I had always thought he was cute but we didn't live in the same city until recently, so I was on top of the world when we started seeing each other.

We had sex on the first date at the end of July. We started consistently texting, going out, staying the night at each other's houses, meeting each other's friends, etc. Yesterday, we went to a farmer's market before going back to my place, where he said ""we're only having sex because we're both hot, but doesn't think we have a strong romantic relationship."" He said he likes hanging out with me, but once again, didn't think our ""romantic connection"" was strong. I said I was confused because I like him a lot. He held my hand while breaking up with me, and then kissed me before he left.

We didn't do much in terms of hand-holding when we were out, but we kissed a few times in public, and were generally acting ""romantic"" when we were together. Arm around me in front of friends, I made him dinner a few times, he got me some postcards because he knows I like them, said he had missed me when I was out of town, etc etc. It just feels like it came out of nowhere.

He's generally reserved and not the most expressive, but is a little more so when we're just hanging out 1-on-1 in private. A few weeks ago, I thought he was becoming more distant, so I checked in and asked if he was still interested in hanging out, and he said yes. Today was the first day in 3 months that I haven't heard from him.

Whenever i try to talk to about it to anyone they give me the 'you are so lucky' or 'you must do something to deserve it' responses. It's so frustrating. 

A lot of them seem really nice and normal at first, but whenever I tell them no, they start insulting me or hitting me. They have done things like tell me how to dress, demand I get a different job, start trying to take up all my free time and telling me I'm an abusive asshole if I don't do everything they want me to do.

It's not constant, but it's so depressing to feel like I either have to be alone, or suffer abuse/harassment if I want to date anyone. I've never had a relationship that didn't end up this way. I have been physically assaulted by numerous girlfriends, and verbally assaulted by almost all of them. I do not believe in violence, so I do not fight back. I just leave. They have also harassed friends, family, and new people I'm dating after we break up. 

I would just like to meet someone who isn't abusive and angry all the time, but it seems like it's impossible for me. This has been going on since I was a teenager. Yes, I've been to therapy.

I get weird matches on apps from women make jokes about violence and rape as a form of flirting.

This occurs IRL as well as online, it's like my face only attracts abusive and hostile people. I know many people who aren't like this, who are my friends, and they tell me I'm not attractive, I'm boring, etc. But apparently that makes me super attractive to abusive people?

So I’m a 24 y/o Female doing a long distance relationship with 28 y/o male. We have been together for almost 8 months and things were really good in the beginning I guess... we have only met in person twice so we are usually on the phone 24/7.

But I’ve never met someone that i clicked with so quickly honestly. We have a lot in common and I know he loves and cares for me. He knows everything and anything about me honestly and has really helped me a lot with my mental health this year. Since we are long distance we have to try extra hard to keep the spark alive but sometimes I feel like he doesn’t want to try and it frustrates the hell out of me. The efforts in the beginning were there but after he finally asked me to be his girlfriend he completely stopped trying. For months I’ve been explaining how I feel about this and he says he is trying but he just does the bare minimum and it honestly just makes me kinda sad. He never makes me feel special or try to do something nice for me (other than just buying me food occasionally). I always ask for dates and just to spend time with each other but he doesn’t even try during our dates at all and we always just end up arguing. With anniversaries he only celebrates with me If I asked him to and i try to make shit special for him but he never reciprocates the energy. Another thing is, I currently make a great salary and I work my ass off everyday. He currently does not work at all and is always struggling to figure out what to eat and how he is going to pay rent for the month. I door dash/Uber eats him food and I try to help out as much as I can. Even when he comes to visit i paid for almost everything. But it scares me because as much as I want a future with him I don’t want to end up being the care taker of a grown man that barely takes care of himself or me. We talk about the future a lot and he wants to marry me soon. But I know my parents would never allow me to marry someone that can’t financially support me in the future, and i don’t want that for myself either.

We met on an app and have been on a few dates. From what I can tell, I think he is into me. We both still have the app however mine has been placed on “snooze” for some time. 

Duration wise, it hasn’t been a month - still super new. I’m finding myself to have a bit (ok… more than a bit) of a crush on this guy. 

I want to know what his intentions are and whether he would be interested in deleting the app/moving toward exclusivity status however from past experiences - this has ALWAYS been the doom of the situation I was in.

I want to give all the possible info for context.

In July I (24F) was invited to an old friend's wedding, where I got to know the groom's cousin (25M). Not my smoothest introduction as I made a sarcastic joke about his job without even knowing his name, but we made some small talk. A couple of days later I ask him to see each other for a drink, and in return he quite aggressively asks me if that was a date or what. I became defensive and told him to act like I never said anything. The following night he reaches out to ask if I wanted to go out with him and his friend, but I was busy. 

He works very far from our hometown (we are born in the same), so he went back and we exchanged some messages once in a while. In September he comes back for vacation and again, ha asks me if I want to go out with him and his friend. This time I accept and has a good night, he initiated some sort of physical contact, and also that the following night he passed by himself by my house to say hello before going out with his friends. After what I considered a successful outing, I asked him to meet again a couple of times but he always refused; I got the hint, decided to cut my losses there and texted him goodbye the day he had to fly back , to what he responded ""Thank you &lt;3"". 

In what seems like a joke, he got injured (badly sprained ankle) that same day and decided to return back to our hometown, but I didn't know it. He started to react to my insta stories, to text me once in a while, until he told me that he was back jokingly saying that I was mean to leave him alone in this situation. He proceeds to  invite me out with his friend + a colleague that came to visit him, he was touchy-feely when we were by ourselves and when we got back home he texts me that I turn him on. We then clarify our intentions to be YOLO, no-strings-attached ones (uni takes A LOT of my time and he lives far away), and talked everyday over text.

Yesterday I texted him if he wanted to go out but said no a bit rudely, so I again get the hint and calmly text him to have a good day, I will text him in the following week. He, AGAIN, gets defensive but tells me to pass by his house to say hello before his family comes back from lunch. I go there, we talked a bit, he maybe smiled once, I tried to make a joke but he scarily stared at me, all of this until I have to go home and, before saying goodbye with a kiss on the cheek (in my country this is normal also among strangers) I made an involuntarily sexual joke, to which he laughed a bit and I said:""You have time until november"", as in november he has to go back ho his job. He didn't try to kiss me or whatever else.

The same night he texted me this:

him: what do you mean with having time until november?

me: that if you go away we won't have any

him: Would you really say that?

me: Yeah, I think 

him: All right &lt;3

My rationality suggests that he does not like me, and that I should leave him alone. If he did, I guess he would have tried to kiss me, or for the most part not be so closed off in his body language. For reference, he is in the military.

Long story short i used to be really good friends with this guy, we sort of lost touch a few months after i started dating my ex, but i always viewed him as a good friend, me andy ex used to discuss opposite sex friends and both agreed he was a good friend and had no issues if we ever started hanging out again. the last time i saw this guy was like 3 years ago as he was the server on my ex and i's anneversery, i ended thimgs with my ex last year in may. recentl i saw my old friend at the bar and we started hanging out again and now we are seeing each other romantically. im wondering if this looks fucked up, its not like i ever saw this guy this way back when i my ex wnd i were discussing him and we havent even talked on years prior to this, we just reconected and hit it off well.  i guess it would be different if the whole lt relationship we were hanging out and iconstantly told my ex not to worry then when we'd broke up went straight to him? am i overthinking?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1059665,public,self,"Seeing someone i used to be good friends with, is this bad?",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q61n2m/seeing_someone_i_used_to_be_good_friends_with_is/,all_ads,6,

She's been my friend for as long as I can remember, been with me through 2 breakups of mine. And I'm still recovering from my last one, taking my time focusing on myself. Anyways 

She hasn't been dating anyone and is a Nerd (sorry for the slang but she's a straight A student who really loves her books) 
She last dated (just online texts and no calls) when she was like 16 . She's from a Conservative family and I haven't seen her for a while and we only talk through text and she lives around 140 plus kms from me. We do not call because conservative family of hers gets suspicious of her and she doesn't want to hurt them. 

Last week things got really heated up between us during a conversation via chatting, and she confessed to having feelings for me and was quite upfront about it considering how close we are.
I didn't reciprocate (yet) but I did manage to ask her if she'd like to go out for coffee sometime and she told me that she liked me very much and would very much love to hang out with me and hug me when she sees me next but she's really afraid of getting into a relationship because it might affect her grades and her studies because she says emotions affect her a lot and she made sure I wasn't hurt or upset by her response and she made me promise I won't force her into a relationship because if I did she might have to say yes because it's me. 
She continued to write me a paragraph on how special I am to her and how much I mean to her and I am really touched by all those.

So now my dilemma,
I've also been very engaged in my studies recently as I'm studying for college still and,
I know I cannot stick to just one girl and I'm wondering if I'm doing the right thing by letting things be and not force anything between us. 

What do you guys think?
Should I stick by her?
 Does anything sound or look fishy? 
Should I know anything?

He was an ex-boyfriend of mine that I dated when I was like 16. When I was a young I remember being so ‘in love’ with him because we got along really well, but things ended because he just wasn’t interested in a relationship at the time being also 16 years old.
Before getting into a relationship with said ex again in May of this year, I was in this weird situationship with a guy I had really strong feelings for. It was more like fwb, he was using me and we weren’t even really friends because we only talked when he wanted something from me. I really liked him for some reason though, I found him very attractive and I guess for some reason I fell in love with the ‘idea’ of him even though he was this narcissistic man that only cared about his own interests. Was just a mess of a situation, and he was very toxic.
This ex boyfriend of mine I just left wasn’t very different, was also narcissistic but in a different way. He always would find little ways to put me down. He would start little arguments with me after getting mad at something I said, and then blame me for starting it. My final straw was when he yelled at me for being ‘fat, lazy and unmotivated’ because I said I was finding it hard to find time to exercise since i’m a full time student spending 50+ hours a week on school work with a part time job as well (Why he thought that was any of his business is beyond me) 
Fast forward to now, i’m having a very difficult time getting along with men. I have major trust issues from the pattern of abusive relationships I’ve been in. I feel as if I almost don’t deserve to find genuine interest and love in a person. Every guy I talk to only wants to hook up with me and because of previous trauma surrounding that I avoid them at all costs.

I learn from my friend that my crush communicated with his girlfriend ( they are besties, same my friend and I), and told her to go for a coffee all together before letting me know if she can ( which i find a good sign since she wanted to come for a coffee). Well we went for a coffee we had a talk as usual, then my friend had to leave so its me and the 2 girls (my friends girlfriend and my crush), me and my crush had a general talk but with very humorous way and me making ""fun"" of her in a good way. My friend's girlfriend didnt talk much, she wanted us 2 to talk ( which i can see as a good sign as well). Then a few days later i message her again if she wants to join me on a ride in town, and if she wanted to tag in, i told her i wanted company, Unfortunately she couldn't join me since she was with her family, so she told me next time. I replied to her ""Hope so :D"" and she replied ""Yes why not!"". So know i want to tell her that i am interested in a her and i want to meet her more as a person.

Me and this guy (30, M) have known each other for years and now he has relocated back to my home state and I'm here after being gone a while. For years he flirted with me and even wanted to meet up in my previous residential state 2 years ago. A the time I sabotaged it and he ended up flying out without as hanging and we lost touch. He recently moved to my current state for work and said he finds me attractive, wants to take me out on a date etc. We are super flirtatious on text and he makes me laugh a lot, he's physically attractive etc. 

My thing is I keep doubting the authenticity of his interest. I keep thinking he'll loose interest once we meet, that he's just bored and lonely, that he might even cancel the date before and once I start going down this rabbit hole It never ends well (I cancel dates, ""reschedule"" hoping they'll forget to reconvene, etc. ) This only ever happens to me when i find a guy attractive before the date. 

I really like this guy and want to at least finally go on this date, he's asked for a while and I'd love to. But my brain is telling me a lot of reasons why I shouldn't even bother and at this rate this date is looking very cancelledish. I think what triggered these thoughts was that all weekend we texted and the vibes have been good, then yesterday night he stopped responding and liked my last text to him. It's reinforcing my assumptions that he's not into me etc.

29 y.o male, ive been single for 13 months now. I dated my ex for 6 years, we bought a place together and raised 2 kittens. It was an ammicable split and were still really close friends. We havent ""fooled around"" or done anything more than a bear hug since weve broken up September 2020. 

She moved out, she took the cats first, but her place was too small so they're back with me. She helps me take care of the cats and i help her keep her old crappy car running. We have a few hobbies in common but overall we have very different beliefs and values. Regardless, we enjoy eachothers company, even if its purely plutonic. It is obvious though that we both still have feelings for eachother. We both understand we both need to grow individually if we ever want to get back together (we dont talk about it like were going to tho, we want to keep expectations realistic). 

Why did we breakup? Jeez, well it happened during the lockdown so im sure that had an effect. But it was mostly small things that added up to both of us wanting to do more stuff in life before settling down (we had pretty much settled down when we bought our house). We both kinda freaked out i guess, we both have busy careers and hobbies, we didnt plan to have kids. So we thought if we didnt do this now we would grow to resent eachother and be a miserable married couple (or have kids as a desperate way to salvage things). Neither of us wanted that outcome. We had more things we needed to accomplish on our own. 

We both tried dating, we encouraged eachother to meet new people. We talked about some of our dates with the good and bad (avoided the gritty stuff). I won't go into her feedback. But for me i just wasnt into it, i went on some fun dates with very attractive people, i got laid a lot. But honestly I was miserable, as soon as i had confirmed a date i was regretting it. I didnt want to meet these people, let alone date them, even if we ended up having fun... it wasnt fair to me or them so i just got out of dating all together. 

Now im in this wierd limbo, i dont want to date anyone new, mostly because i dont want to start a whole new relationship with someone and go through all that with someone else. Its like i only wanted to do that 1 time and whether it worked out or not i dont want to do it again. I have great memories with my ex, but at this point in time i enjoy being single and i dont want to get back with her.

I've known him for six months but we weren't romantic. It was a friendship since we were both involved in a group for people who like building computers. He had shown interest in me but I had made it clear that I was not interested. He was nice enough to respect that. I knew he had a girlfriend so I thought there was no chance so why even bother. But during the friendship he will always tell me his problems and how he didn't love her, but he still cares for her. Then he told me that he was in love with me and that I was the women of his life. Although, it was a nice feeling I didn't understand why he will tell me those things if he barely knew me. He said that he felt it in his heart. He repeated that various times during our friendship. But I always told him that he needed to take care of his home. And that I was not going to be with someone who had a girlfriend and to think of me as his friend. 

Then after 6 months of knowing him he broke up with his girlfriend. I was in shock but I knew it was coming cuz he away seem so unhappy. So then he started getting closer to me and we began dating. It was more to get to know each other. Since he has recently broken up with her I didn't want to be a rebound. We had already built up a friendship so it was easy to date. But after one month the brake up started hitting him hard and he asked me to give him time. That he needed to find himself and to get use to her not been there. So, I told him I understood and to take his time.

I really like him but I'm not going to put pressure on such a delicate situation. Im the type of woman that takes a relationship serious. I like to take my time to know the person and to make sure we share the same values. But I had never dated someone who just broke up with someone.  

Our forms of communication since we met had always been phone call and text. Everyday he will call me since the first day we met to talk about computers and our day. Mostly he will talk about his girlfriend problems at home. Then when we began going out after his brake up he will still call me. So when he asked for time, we stopped texting. He use to text me all the time and I was use to it. We will often have conversations about computers and tech. Also, he will text me randomly I love you. He has said last time that he wanted to build a future with me. But that all stopped. However,  he still calls me everyday.

That is what’s making my head spin. Why would he ask for space. Keep calling me, But stop texting me. I’m not a huge texter but I do miss our normal convos comparing computers, the random I love you etc. I just find it so weird. On the phone he talks about his day at work but that’s it. He doesn’t really mention anything about us or the relationship.  I suppose is because of needing time to figure his life. I had already a convo with him when  He asked for space so I’m not going to repeat myself.

I’m independent, I got my own home and I got a career. But I’ve only had one long term  relationship in my life. I’ve been single for four year. So, I may be a little lost with modern dating.
 

Keep in mind I don’t ask him this questions because I don’t want to pressure him. I believe in respecting the time and space he asked.

TL;DR
Why will he keep calling me even if he asked for space? (Don’t give me wrong I love that he calls me I really like him, I just don’t get it)

The reason being that she said she's easily scared and that she can't even watch horror movies. I believe her because we both have extremely conservative parents who never tried to celebrate Halloween, so I wouldn't put it past her parents to ban something like horror movies. Anyways she holds my hand by interlocking our fingers together and I'm just thinking the whole time that only couples hold hands like that. The haunted house comes and goes and we talk for a little bit about anime and stuff like that and we exchange goodbyes as we drop her off at her place. I would like to talk to her some more but I don't have a way to message her. 

So here's the part where I ask for advice. How would I get in touch with this girl again? If I do get in touch with her how do I ask her out? I know the answer is a super obvious ""Just ask her out man."", but Keep in mind that I've never gone out on a date with another girl so I'm definitely lacking in experience. I guess what I'm really asking is how do I ask her out without freezing up due to anxiety. I already have somewhat of a plan in mind. I'm going to tell my brother that I have a crush on Jas, and I'm gonna ask for some help from him and his girlfriend to try and set us up in as natural a way as possible. Then I'm gonna talk to her some more and ask for her Snapchat/number. then I'm gonna try to escalate things to a date. I would really appreciate any advice/ pointers. Also please ask questions for additional missing context as I've written this many times and every other time it was a jumbled unorganized mess so I've trimmed alot of fat from this writing.

I met a guy off of bumble - I wasn't in town at the time we matched, so we texted on and off for a couple of months before I went back indefinitely, he had asked me out even before. So when I came back, we went out almost immediately. And when I say it was great, it honestly was.

I thought we clicked super well, we had a lot to talk about, we sat on this bench overlooking the city and we talked for hours about literally everything, like what happens after death, deep shit like that, so it definitely didn't feel on a surface level. I thought we'd be outside only for a couple of hours, but we ended up talking non-stop for 5+ hours, and we both agreed that time passed super super quickly. 

I asked him out again right after that, and he enthusiastically agreed, so we saw each other the next week, he invited me to his place, we watched a movie, again talked about a lot of things and time passed really quickly, like spent 10+ hours together quickly. He asked me out again in 2 days to watch another movie. Repeating myself a lot here, but again, spent a lot of time together, laughed a lot, talked about deep shit, seemed to be in understanding.

I'm going to be honest, at that point I was a bit worried because we hadn't really done anything but hug for bye/hi, I thought he didn't really want to make me uncomfortable since I was at his place, and we did actually have a conversation and he thought I felt uncomfortable but I was just being polite?? But I tried to assure him that it's not the case.

At that point, we were texting pretty much every day, but after that, I guess something happened and he stopped initiating conversation, he did for a couple of days, then stopped, I let it be thinking he was just busy, but a week passed and he didn't. So I just messaged to ask how he was doing, he didn't really seem that enthusiastic about talking to me. I just wanted honesty and to get things out of the way, so I asked if everything is ok because he doesn't really seem that interested in talking to me, and if he's just kind of not feeling it or if anything was up because I would really hate it if I had done anything to offend him or turn him off when we were out together. He was like ""oh nono don't worry, you didn't at all, I just have a really all or nothing personality and sometimes I just don't feel like socialising for a while"". Which I understand, I can be like that too. 

He said he still wants to go on a walk with me to a specific place when his leg gets better (has leg issues). I said I understand and I let him be, I don't really want to be annoying.

Well, cool beans, but that was two months ago, so obviously he was just ghosting me. And it's fine that he doesn't like me as a friend or as anything more, it really is, but I feel like he just lied directly to my face and that really angers me and offends me. I specifically went ahead and asked if I had done something wrong, and he just lied to me.

I assume it's not just the social thing - it's my birthday today, he knows it is, he didn't say shit so obviously he doesn't want to talk to me. I kind of unfollowed him anywhere I have him, but he's still following me on Instagram and watching all of my stories. If you want me to be gone from your life so badly, just do me a favour and disappear completely, what the fuck is this shit.

She would get close to me for a few minutes but then slowly pull away and would bump into me however when I went in for a kiss she didn’t pull away. We kissed a few times but I made the moves and it wasn’t a short kiss. She texted me after saying to let her know when I got home. She also added back on snap immediately after I added her.

I had to decline because I had other stuff planned but promised to get back to him later.

A couple of weeks later I asked him to play golf with me and he was like sure. We played golf for an hour and so and then he invited me to his friends place to meet his friends. They were friendly.

I had fun etc and time went by when a week later I asked him to go on a walk with me in the evening, it was like 7 pm. And he was yeah, answered very fast and all. We went on a walk for an hour and just talked, it was flowing so good and never felt stale or awkward.

A couple of weeks later we went out for drinks and pool. Before I arrived he sent a snap, a selfie of himself with tons of heart emojis. I just thought it was a joke so I didn't think much about it. 

And then two weeks ago he sent me a text telling me to come to a student bar that he works at. I went there and saw him in the bar and we talked a lot and I held him company for a while before I went to a table and talked to some students rest of the night. He texted me and was like ""where did you go?"" And I answered I was at a table with some students.

When the bar was closing and I was going out, Kind of drunk, I saw him, he approached me and put his arm around me and was like go home you're drunk which was funny.

And then the day after, kind of late, it was 11 PM, he texts me again telling me to come to the bar again. I was sleeping so didn't see the text until the morning after so I couldn't come. The week afterwards I asked him if he wanted to hang with me and a friend at the bar. He was like probably if I'm not busy. However some things came up so I had to decline the whole thing unfortunately.

A couple of days ago I put on Facebook that I would attend an event. He wrote to me the same day asking me if I was going to the event. I was like yeah why? He was like can you get me tickets? I was like sure if I can, can't promise anything. And he wrote something like thank you❤️ with a heart emoji.

As you may have noticed she is older than me, also she was in a 8years relationship and since then she is single.

So when we are going to go out this week, i want to get a bit flirty etc... so i can build up a bit for what i want, because i definitely don't wanna be just a friend.

How can i flirt with her, knowing that we just started talking so i don't look creepy ?

I (29M) met this girl (29F) at a live music show last week and we immediately clicked. We also found out we have mutual friends and are from the same city abroad.

I asked her out on a date this past Wed. It went super well and we both had a great time but we but kept it slow (no kissing, little touching).

We've been talking over text everyday since and agreed on going out again, but come Sat evening she told me she was with her girl friend in my neighborhood and that I ""should come and say hi"". So I meet them at the bar and we're drinking, dancing, and getting pretty close. She was telling me how fun I am and that she's liking me.

Her friend told me she had a date coming so I jokingly told her I'd be her wingman. Her date came with his brother, which was unexpected but I had no issues with it at all. So I was getting to know them and I let the brother talk to my date and get to know each other. I also ran into a couple of my friends at the bar. We were all dancing and having a good time. Then after I came back from the bathroom I saw the brother having his arm around my girl at the bar and then they started making out! It was such a shock and I felt SO disrespected and frustrated but didn't show my emotions. I told my friends that I couldn't be there anymore so they just took me to another bar and we left them.

She called about 20 min later and I didn't pick up. No other calls or messages since. We had plans for this upcoming week.

I obviously don't want to pursue her unless she REALLY goes out of her way to justify what happened, but I am just curious to know:

1. why a girl would do something like this given that she was the one inviting me out.
2. Should I confront her about it via call/text or just move on at this point? There's a high chance of us running into each other again due to mutual friends.

So is it like a thing where we just wait for the right moment? Do I ask to kiss him, do I wait for him to ask me? Should it be a goodbye kiss or like a mid date kiss? How long should the first kiss be? Should It be like a quick peck, a few second kiss or should it be longer?

There's a guy (20M) that I work with. He’s a friendly guy, but also a bit of a nerd. I consider him a friend. We know a lot about each other, and we've gone through very similar experiences. When we first started working together (he and I started around the same time), I would almost always be the one initiating the conversation. He'd answer, and he always asked me questions back, but he would almost never initiate. So I stopped approaching him. Since I stopped, he’s been the one coming up to me. Usually, I come into work later than him. When I come in and he's not busy, he’ll immediately come over to my work area and start talking to me, asking me questions about my weekend plans and such. There are even sometimes where he'll come over to me, but he'll stand next to me and won't say anything, so I initiate then. While he’s on good terms with our other coworkers, he’ll normally only greet them hello when they walk in and that’s it.He doesn’t have a conversation with them like he does with me; only about work related things with other workers.

He’ll also help me at work, to the point where he almost goes out of his way to do so. Of course, he’ll help other coworkers as well, but they usually have to ask for his help, and if he does help them voluntarily, it'll usually be when he's not busy. One time, he was restocking items, and I was helping a customer at the register. I made a mistake and closed it, forgetting to give the customer their change. I didn’t have the code to reopen it, and I didn’t think he had it either, so I was about to make my way to the back to ask another coworker who had more experience. But before I could leave to the back, he stopped what he was doing and walked up to me and asked what happened. I explained to him. He tried to open it, but wasn’t able to, but he tried even though it was inconvenient for him to do so. Another time, he and I were both at registers helping customers. A customer asked for a beer, and without me asking, he got the beer from the fridge and opened it and bought it to me. I could’ve gotten it myself, and he was busy with another customer, but he helped me anyway. The same day as the customer with the beer, another customer asked for coffee. I was at the coffee maker station trying to fill up the coffee cup. Again, it was busy that time, so there was a line of customers. I tried pouring the coffee, but one of the machines was out of coffee and the other one was wasn't pouring. Even though he was helping package food, he took the coffee makers and transferred the coffees for me so that way I would be able to pour it. Even that in itself took like a good five minutes. Another time, a customer asked for a dressing for her salad, and I had to get it from one of the drawers. The drawers were only a couple of feet away from where I was, so I could've easily have gotten it. He was at the register, but he overheard the woman asking for dressing, so he left the other customer at the register and got the dressing for me.

Another thing that I've noticed is that he'll find little ways to touch me. I don't mind at all. When we work together, sometimes we'll be close to the point that our arms graze each other. While it could be accidental, he doesn't get as close to other coworkers. Another time, it was time for his fifteen minute break, and it was only the manager and I working. As he left to take his fifteen minutes, he lightly tapped me on the shoulder and told me he was going to head out. Another time, I was packaging food, and he told me that a customer wanted a specific dressing for the food. But when he told me this, he whispered in my ear, to the point where he was less than an inch away from me. Not that I mind any of this; he's respectful of boundaries, but I just found it interesting.

Tl;dr - coworker speaks to me more than anyone else. When I come in for my shift, he'll immediately come over to me and start talking, or stand next to me and not say anything. He also helps me at work, without me asking for assistance and when it's not the most convenient for him.

In the past few weeks I have asked for advice on how to meet men online who were not just interested in sex and how to navigate all the men who are. I explained that I put in my profile “seeking a relationship” and how a lot of men would still try to have sex with me on the first or second date. I’ve explained that I have had to be super careful on dates just to be careful to avoid sexual assaults. And I also explained that I was looking for a guy who doesn’t engage in casual sex himself and is also looking for a relationship. A few people made suggestions that I go on Christian mingle website. Said I’d be more likely to find a decent guy on there. 

I followed all your advice . I explain that the first guy I meet off the site shoved his hand down my pants in a public mall where people were walking and driving by. I explain that I’ve come to the conclusion that there are simply a lot of sexual predators and desperate guys out there and some will go to great lengths to prey on women. And that I’m just giving up on dating. What do some of you do ? You victim blame. One person said that my profile saying “seeking a relationship” isn’t enough. That I should be saying “not going to have sex for x amount of time” in capital letters on my profile. Do you know how ridiculous that sounds? It is not the men misunderstanding my profile . They don’t fucking care what I want and think they can manipulate me! They know exactly what I want. At least this has been my experience. How do you not get it ?  Two others were  saying, (I’m guessing they were men), that if I’m experiencing things like this so often (another guy shoved his hand down my pants on a date earlier in the year) then I must be doing something to attract these types of men or I must be attracted to these types of men. Are you fucking kidding me? That is your first assumption ? I say on my profile I’m seeking a relationship, I dress modestly, don’t take a lot of pictures of myself on social media ,but somehow I’m attracting men who assault women or just want women for sex? 

I just want a regular guy who treats me with respect, is honest with integrity, isn’t a bum, has goals, is funny and intelligent. What part of that does it sound from this post that I’m attracted to men who treat women like shit? Did you ever think that your wearing a pair of blinders all the time and your completely oblivious to the other option, that maybe it’s difficult to navigate dating as a nice and attractive woman and that men can sometimes try take advantage of you? That there are tons of sexual predators out there? I suggest that some of you go online to your local sex registry where you can see how many sexual predators there are around you . These are the ones who have gotten CAUGHT. Both times I was assaulted the guy did  not get arrested because I know from experience, unless someone witnessed it or recorded it or you have bruises on you , etc, chances are the guy is going to get away with it. There is basically no point in even reporting assaults that don’t fit that category. 

1 in 4 women are sexually assaulted at least once in their lifetimes, again these are the assaults that women are reporting. They don’t represent reality, the numbers are thought to be much higher. Even that is a lot.

I'm a 25M, every month I go to the same barbershop and I got accustomed to choose the same barber who's a 25yo or so woman (who I think is attractive). It's been a couple of years now that I'm her customer and I know for sure that she's single. I know that because I'm following her on Insta and she's following me back and there hasn't been any post or story that can let me think that she's dating someone (I might be wrong but I consider that there's a slight chance that I am).

A few days ago I went at my barber to get my hair and my beard done. When I sit on the chair, instead of asking me ""What do we do today?"", she asks me ""What do we do tonight?"". When she realizes what her question implied, she started to have a laugh alongside one of her coworkers and seeing the chance to tease her a little bit with her lapsus I then said: ""We can do whatever you want"". After my answer we all shared a good laugh and then the rest of my appointment was going like every time: we were talking about different subjects, I got updates on her life, she got updates on mine and that's it. The only noticeable thing that happened was when I was saying everyone goodbye, her coworker teased me by replying: ""And have a good evening!"".

I'm not that good at dating nor am I good at seeing the ""small details or signals"" that women can show when they feel attracted towards you. Should I consider that her lapsus revealed something at that moment? What should be my next move, next time? I feel really attracted to her and I'd like to know her more. But I'm a little bit shy and I don't want the next appointments to become awkward because I got rejected when asking her out. I'm introvert and finding a barber with whom I feel comfortable is difficult for me so I don't want to ruin that.

I'm also curious to know if any of you M/F have ever taken advantage on a lapsus to take things to the next stage?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1060012,public,self,Can a lapsus be a hint about what a person can feel towards you?

When we first started working together, I noticed that he would always stare at me. As in we were in a crowded room standing on opposite sides of it, and I caught him glancing at me and then he looked quickly away. I definitely have seen that look before and know it means a sign of interest/attraction. The other time is when we were in the hallway and there was no one around and he was leaning against a door just staring at me for about a minute. It actually made me a little bit uncomfortable so I kept walking. Ever since then I sometimes catch him glancing at me and we lock eyes out of the corner of our eyes. He also looks me up and down a lot. My friend recently confirmed to me that she saw him starting at me at work and then they made awkward eye contact because she ""caught,"" him looking at me and he looked away. Sometimes I feel like he tries to act ""cool,"" around me/ he can be hard to approach mostly because the staring is so intense. I just don't understand it-- why not ask me out or stop staring? I've noticed at meetings he'll sometimes talk to other people and not me when we have to work together. It's just so weird.

During the first two weeks of school he was in my room and we were venting/talking and he told me that he was single. Last week I tried to ask what his plans were for the weekend, but he didn't mention hanging out.
