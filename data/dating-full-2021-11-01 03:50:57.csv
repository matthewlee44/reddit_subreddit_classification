Need advice on asking out a friend

Ok this may be long but please help me out here‚Ä¶

I should note I have 0 dating experience. I did not date in high school (not that I was rejected or anything, I just never tried to date). And my college was all online so I didn‚Äôt meet anyone there. 

Basically I 19M have a friend 21F that I have known for like 6-7 years. We have never had a romantic relationship or gone out on a date. I think that throughout our friendship there have been times where we both had feelings for each other but never acted on them out of fear of losing the friendship or making it awkward. (Its came up in conversation a few times, us teasing each other about dating, lots of my friends and even a family member have told me to ask her out on several occasions, her parents like me, etc) Now, she is in college about 2 hours away from our hometown where I currently live. (i know some people frown on the whole LDR thing but it would be temporary just while she finishes college) I want to ask her out the next time she is home like for Thanksgiving or Christmas break. Should I ask her out as like a casual date? A formal date to a nicer restaurant? Not ask her out at all? Other suggestions? I think Id want to do it at the beginning of the break so we could then go out a few times during her break if the first one went well. We have known each other so long, I feel like if we mutually wanted a relationship it would progress quicker than people that say met online. 

I‚Äôm really at a loss for what to do here but I‚Äôve gotten to the point where I‚Äôve tried meeting other people (through online dating) and the few matches I‚Äôve gotten are ok, but I usually end up thinking about her again. So I feel like I just need to give it a shot with her and if she says no or if we go out and it doesn‚Äôt work out and we decide we‚Äôre better off as friends then maybe I‚Äôll have more confidence to move on looking for someone else.

I should note I am not looking to hookup with her as a 1 time thing. This is someone I have known for a long time and care a lot about. I would do anything for her whether we were in a romantic relationship or if we just remained friends. 

Thanks for the help!

About 2 months ago, when his sister and her boyfriend were visiting she cried out of no where that she can‚Äôt have any friends in the relationship and has no alone time. To my understanding, she cheated on him early in the relationship and doesn‚Äôt trust her. Their always together because he doesn‚Äôt trust her and doesn‚Äôt like her friends. He stated that their married in the ‚Äúeyes of god‚Äù. And he won‚Äôt dump her. 

A week ago her best friend reached out to me to see if I could talk to her. Her mother called her and tried to arrange a girls dinner. That didn‚Äôt work. The only answer we were given by her is that if her boyfriend can‚Äôt come she‚Äôs not going. 

My boyfriend is not against me randomly showing up at their house to see if I can chat with his sister. I understand how hard it is since she has not been speaking to her best friend and doesn‚Äôt have any sisters. All I have are sisters, no brothers. 

It appears that she is being mentally abused and doesn‚Äôt want to leave this guy. I don‚Äôt think we could do a welfare check on her.

I think I'm reaching a point that I'm trying to understand his personality rather than date him. lol. and below is what happened. and i try my best to be as objective as possible.

\-----

So I matched with this guy on tinder and the conversation flowed well at the begining, he mentioned that he was very shy and he love comedy and had been taking some improv classes so that he could break free of his shell and have long conversations. 

Then we've pretty much seen each other every weekend, doing outdoor activities together. And about we hang out 5/6 times, gradually, he started to share little bit of personal things with me, for example, he comes from a nonsocial/emotional divorced family who always fights, and he needs to do surgery in the upcoming year. Because I personally don't like sharing too much personal information in the early stage of dating(i value privacy), so I am pretty much just being a listener, and he said he felt heard and safe and got some emtional support from me.

Just because I felt like every time we hang out is just doing activities together, I wanna something deep, so I decided to initiate more conversations with him. and I noticed that the more questions that I try to ask, the more defensive/sensitive he becomes, the more ""conflict"" that we have. I'm not sure if this is gaslighting/manipulating or he just has low self-esteem or he's shy or he's oversensitive or im being too intimidated?

\-----

exhibit 1: we were on the phone call, he was randomly mentioned that he got a gift from a female friend, and she confused his birthday got him a month early. then i asked him what are you going to do tmr, he said, im going to play this gif (it's a toy). for some reason, my instinct is telling me that he wants to test the water to see where he stands between us, so i answered pretty aggressively, ""well! enjoy your toy then!"" and he said, he felt attacked by me. (to be fair, i was using an aggressive tone) so i confront him, saying, ‚Äò‚Äôare you trying to get me jealous?"" he said, ‚Äúpartly, yes, but i didn't expect you will have that emotional reaction and i did feel uncomfortable.‚Äú i said, ‚Äúbut what's your expectation then?"" he said, ‚Äúwell, there is no expectation, people won't mention anything about it. and I do have some female friends, and i hope that's ok with you. i want to let she know that she's not the only girl in my world.""  i said, ""i also have guy friends. but by telling me that is to show you're popular???""  he said, ""hmmm, yes. i just want this girl to like me more.‚Äú  (then we hung up the phone)  (please help me to analyze his mentality lol)

&amp;#x200B;

exhibit 2: just because i did have that emotional reaction before, so i felt like i need to be a more mature person to address this, so i explained to him that my ex was often doing those tricks to make sure i still care about him, but when it reaches to a point, i just feel annoyed, that's why i got triggered for this emotional reaction. then he said, well, i forgive you! (i was like what??i wasn't apologizing. idk, i feel like usually, guys will say, oh, no worries, it's not your fault, i promise i won't do this to you. or even lol, you don't need to explain, i got you! something like that? but not like I forgive you???) but he did follow up with what reaction were i expecting from him. i said i would like to see your raw reaction.

&amp;#x200B;

exhibit 3: recently, (in text form) he said, he picked up a new hobby, which is crossword game. so i said, you love mental stimulation, (then we played a few rounds), i asked, why you are into those mental stimulation? he answered, ‚Äúthis question feels like you are looking down on me.‚Äù (i didn't reply immediately) he then said, ""but you probably don't mean it that way.""

&amp;#x200B;

i viewed myself as a non-confrontational person, more of a passive-aggressive person. so whenever, i felt so uncomfortable by those random conflicts, i just gave him the silent treatment (by not replying him). then after 1-2 days, he will reach out to me, to ask if i am ok. is there anything i want to share, about my feeling and stuff. he would like to hear it out. 

\-------

so I'm just not sure if he is a narcissist who tries to gaslight me to play this power dynamic game or he truly is being so sensitive so that he just wants to share all his feelings with me but does not know what kind of emotional support a girl wants?

This is such a vapid post and I never thought I'd say something like this but I have met my dream man, he ticks all of my boxes and we connect like crazy, its wild because I just got divorced after 7yrs with my ex so I'm very aware of the fact this guy is an exceptional fit for me.

I really could spend my life with this man but.... I can't get past the fact he has a small, thin penis. I know I'm awful.
My ex husband was a tall guy and his penis was about 9inches. And this guy isn't even half that.

My question is, is there a way I can get past the penis size? I enjoy penetrative sex more than any other style.

I wish I could get over it and be with him properly but it's definitely holding me back.

He's also quite big and not my physical type, so that also doesn't do much for me?

Ticks all boxes except the physical and I wonder if it's possible to be with someone long term without that attraction?

During this time I haven't had much success, I've only been on 3 Tinder dates and they all led nowhere. 

I am 5ft 9inch (175cm), but I struggle to attract women. I have ginger hair and pale skin with some freckles (although they are fading, thankfully) I was in great shape in my early twenty's but I struggled to attract women anyways. Now I have gained weight, so I'm carrying a few extra pounds but I'm determined to lose it.

I have signed up to eHarmony and messaged lots of women, I am hopeful as after one month of using the service I found a match, I am hoping it leads somewhere. 

Should you still go on a date with somebody if you don't find them physically attractive? The reason why I am asking is that, I am realistically an average looking guy. I feel like I have to take my options avaliable and that I can't be too picky.

my question is how shall I do it, I had 3 plans, your advice on which is most appropriate will be greatly appreciated 

plan a) I send flowers + Teddy + chocs
with a card that has a nice message in it but anonymously signed. then the following day I print off a blank prescription, write her name 

then where the medication detail and dosage usually is, write my name, my number and the dose/duration.  I.e until the sun sets in the god damn west ü§£. followed by a hint the flowers were from me.


plan b) I do that minus the flowers( is that too strong?)


plan c) I call her out after work, we walk to her car and I tel her how much I like her, and that I want her number and want to take her out.( issue with this one I'd iv been told by several people its putting all my cards on the table which is a bad idea)

It's really hard on me because I know I deserve happiness, support, and respect as a human and that has no bearing on my dress size.

Mainly just a vent / shout into the void type of thing. Anyway, I matched with a very attractive girl on Tinder on Saturday morning, we chatted for a bit and she'd asked if was going out that evening as an early Halloween. I did have plans with friends and so I said yeah, turns out she was also going to the same place and seemed keen to meet up. Evening rolls around and the club we'd ended up at was super busy, and I was trying to contact her whilst I was in there to meet. However had no luck, she'd said she had to leave early due to her friend getting spiked, which is obviously understandable. During that evening I'd also managed to dislocate my knee at the club, very painful and went to A&amp;E yesterday to get that sorted. I'd kept chatting with the girl yesterday who was being very nice and supportive given my injuries and had offered to help me out if needed. I'd politely said there wasn't anything I needed but if she wanted to hang out at my house and stuff the company would be much appreciated. Again, she seemed keen and asked for my address so I provided that and said take out was on me. I'd asked what time I should expect to see her but got no reply, couple hours later she messages saying sorry she fell asleep. So I'd said that's okay and asked if she still wanted to come over and she'd said ""if you want me too"" so I'd said yes of course and asked her to let me know when she'd set off and stuff. Another hour or so passes so I sent her a voice note just asking if she'd gotten cold feet as I understand I am basically a stranger still. She'd sent one back saying she didn't have cold feet she just had hangover head. Not entirely sure what that is, but I can take a good guess. Anyhow, I left it at that and tried to get some sleep, following on this morning I'd sent a fairly lengthy message just saying I hoped she felt better this morning and that I'd still be up for meeting sometime when I'm more functional. Unfortunately though, I've been unmatched and removed off of Snapchat. Am I right to feel slightly lead on here? Or is there something I've done drastically wrong here? Despite only chatting for a couple of days I think I'm taking this more to heart due to how nice she had been, also the first girl to compliment me on Tinder.

I figured this out pretty quickly on (years of watching Catfish teaches you a thing or two) and called him out on it. He semi-came clean but I learned after that he still lied about multiple aspects of who he was. One day he sent me a snapchat and his work badge was in the background. Fortunately, my friends work in the same place and after a brief description of what I knew physically, I found out who he truly was. He had a girlfriend of five years. 

He and I got on really well, our personalities are very similar and interests. I felt quite upset by this after giving him several chances in the past, he said he felt insecure and didn‚Äôt use his real pictures (he is attractive) and I believed him but it was because he had a girlfriend instead. 

I messaged the girlfriend, they split. 

He recently messaged me as him after three months, apologising and saying he wants to properly try again. We do have such a unique way of connecting but I‚Äôm just not 100% sure I can commit to someone who has lied and cheated. He said he‚Äôs willing to put in the work to prove himself but at the back of my head, the only thing I can think about is how would this effect his ex-girlfriend.

Today is one of those days which started on a pleasant note but had a sudden plunge of mood (I think it‚Äôs PMS coz that‚Äôs when I only have such mood swings and start crying for no reason) I have been dating this man for a month and for some reason I haven‚Äôt been able to open up to him. I am generally reserved and don‚Äôt share anything personal, but with him I want to without scaring him off (I have a had a terrible relationship before him which was 3 years ago and didn‚Äôt date anyone after that, still scarred by it). With this man that I am dating, he is sweet, caring but I am always on the edge with him. After three dates or something we got physical and it‚Äôs been good except during sex which was a bit awkward for the both of us because I was tight as hell (hadn‚Äôt had sex since 3 years) and we didn‚Äôt have sex after that or a conversation about it. Now the other things have been good but anything personal I am unable to open up or talk about. Today is just the day when I feel like everything is dawning upon me. I want things to be more than physical between us. How do I open up to his man? 

Also I struggle a lot with self doubt and confidence so please bear that in mind, before helping me out.

I‚Äôve (22F) recently been dating a guy (26M), this my first time dating after 2 year dating break and therapy.

I‚Äôm very determined to voice concerns and remain true to myself this time, without going to from one extreme (ignoring my needs) to another (not compromising at all)

We‚Äôve been dating for a month now, We‚Äôve hung out about 4 times, I really like him, we seem to be a good match with a lot of things, conversation flows well, the sex is really good and we seem to already be quite comfortable in eachother‚Äôs company.

The last time I saw him, there was some conversations about recreational drug use. Him saying he occasionally likes to participate since a lot of his friends are into it and that it‚Äôs interesting but he‚Äôs careful about it. My first thought and reaction was that I‚Äôm not very comfortable with anything beyond weed and alcohol but I was open to hearing his point of view. 
I didn‚Äôt take any strong stances yet because I wanted to go away and think about it first.

This is the first time I‚Äôve been put in a situation to figure out to what extent I‚Äôm comfortable with drug usage. I grew up in a sheltered home and have honestly not had much interest or curiosity to break out of my ‚Äúdon‚Äôt do drugs kids‚Äù mentality and the circles I normally hang out with are the same, so I understand some of my discomfort comes from lack of exposure but I also don‚Äôt want to dismiss the usual concerns like addiction, general safety etc.

I was hoping to have a proper conversation about this next time to figure out what his definition of ‚Äúnot very often‚Äù is etc. But as someone that isn‚Äôt really part of that world, I‚Äôm not sure how much is too much, what is concerning and what is not and generally what to look out for and was hoping you could help me with that.


My initial thoughts are:
1) how often does this happen?
2) what drugs does he normally take?
3) what occasions call for this for him?
4) how often do his friends do it? Would I eventually be able to hang out with them without all that?
5) what‚Äôs your definition of ‚Äúcareful‚Äù?

Ultimately i feel I could deal with it if I wasn‚Äôt ever pressured to participate, i knew he was safe and wasn‚Äôt reliant on it and it basically wouldn‚Äôt have major consequences on him or us, and that this is a truly responsible once every now and then recreational activity. But as you can tell I‚Äôve acknowledging that I don‚Äôt know enough about it so I don‚Äôt want to blindly draw a red line.

I just want to know how to gage these things.

The reason why I broke up is because he wouldn't stop making snarky jokes about my spending habits, so it was easy to break up than to explain myself

He's wealthy, so the way he handles his finances is an absolute disaster. I can't believe how extremely reckless he was with money. A jug of milk half full is thrown in the trash; half of the food he orders is found in the garbage; overpriced coffee every day of course; useless clothes weekly; lazy af to keep track of tax filings; nothing goes to savings; insane spending on alcohol; doesn't shop around, only picks what's available at ridiculous premiums; and a bunch of other reckless habits.

I don't mean it in a derogatory way, of course. He's free to do that, I just want to highlight the contrast here so I can get better advice.

Me on the other hand, I grew up dirt poor. Lived between basements and studio apartments w/ mom &amp; sister, barely had anything to eat for years. After school however (which I finished last spring lol), everything improved dramatically, something I could never dream of. This year is the first year I don't have to worry about food or shelter for me and my family. As I started getting into dating, my spending habits from my childhood are showing huge contrast. I am naturally extra cautious with money, really really cautious, but within a reasonable band. The subject ex kept making jokes about it, and it was really hard to swallow. I'm sure he didn't mean to offend me, but it just weighs me down. Just to give you a sense of ridiculous it was, one time I baked mini pies for a party and there was an extra piece of dough left. I got it together and made other things out of it, he joked that I'm too cruel to let the garbage man earn his wage....... Seriously...... üòë (Rich people are henceforth not allowed to make jokes)

I'm kinda anxious about how my being not splurgy will affect how people perceive me. What do you think about this?

The waitress came up to me, we exchanged smiles and pleasantries and I guess my girlfriend must have thought she was hitting on me or something because she started looking the opposite way.

It was only when I touched her on the upper arm she'd turn her head and smile. Most of the time I just sit there like an idiot and I don't know what to do or say.
