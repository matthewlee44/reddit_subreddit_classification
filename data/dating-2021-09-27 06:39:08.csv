3,pwfdnz,1632743399,He has chosen another girl over me,"I met a guy about 6 months ago. I wasn‚Äôt interested at first but he was pretty persisted (double texting when I wasn‚Äôt texting back, reacting to all of my Instagram stories or making a whole lot of compliments).. Which ultimately lead to us texting for, as mentioned above, nearly 6 months. He even confessed his feelings for me, which I reciprocated a few weeks after.

About 2 weeks ago his texting habits seemed to change. He wasn‚Äôt complimenting me anymore and exclusively replied after about 4 hours, while frequently being online. I asked him about it and he confessed to be involved with another girl again, he is unsure about his feelings for me and rather sees me as a friend. This girl ghosted him a few weeks/months before we got to know each other and contacted him again about 1 month ago. Yesterday I ghosted him and have been crying since.

Two days later and I never heard anything. My instinct, since the date was only fine, was simply that she wasn't that interested enough to text me afterwards. Was it a mistake to expect her to text me, instead of me texting her?

And regarding her safety and me not checking in on her afterwards, this date was during the day, in a nice neighborhood, and she was going to meet up with a friend right near out date spot immediately afterwards, so I don't think there was any danger in which I needed to be touching base with her about.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pwfe6g/girl_didnt_follow_up_with_a_text_after_our_first/

6,pwfrn8,1632744865,"False hope? 12h shifts together after saying NO, yet we continue to have great time ...","Me (24M) and my colleague(23F) (Lets call her Eva - not her real name) have really good time together on our 12 shifts where we talk the entire time. Same sense of humor, sarcasm, personal things and we had both a lot of genuine laughs (We work together for half a year, became a bit closer in the last month) . I asked her on a dinner and she proposed a bistro she wanted to try out, but did not wanted to go solo... We had a great time.  


Long story, but a 9yr old sister of my friend cut my long hair that I had in ponytail... The next day on a shift with Eva, she wanted to fix it. Invited me to the  women's locker room after our shift...  
ME: ""So bellow?"" (Floor -1)  
Eva: ""Yeah, just knock, I will open so that you are not seen on the cards registry.""  
Oh, the faces of the night shift that had no context - we had laugh for the rest of the night... we went out after 40 minutes and that is when I took her to that dinner. She wanted to pay for her stuff, but I sooth-talked it as a payment for the cut. I walked her to MHD and she thanked for the wonderful night.

On Monday last week, there was this Corpo event and... we were close, like whispering all sort of stuff to each others ear, ""those"" deep looks to each others eyes (Damn, I love her brown eyes). After the event, I wanted to invite her to another dinner, but she refused, that she is sorry and her fem. friend is already on her way to take her home by a car (That was a fact, not an excuse)  


Eva is also heavily allergic to gluten so I tried to do some research, joined a FB group to learn something and asked for what I should be aware of so that I would not get her to hospital. (I will just point out that Eva does not have a social media). 

So, I invited her to a Theater. She loves Theater(Live action acting), but hates cinema (movies). Found a Glutton free Italian restaurant nearby beforehand and visited it to double check a day prior...  


... at first, she was super excited, truly, her face lighted like a Xmas tree, but then with confusion declined, that she is sorry but that I am too much reminiscent of her ex that she was 7 years with and broke up just a year ago, that she ""Does not want to go through that again"". From the conversations we had over our shifts, the last year, he had her just for sex, totally stopped caring (Left her half drunk on a party with ""just take a bus"" at 1am, 30km from home...), fucked another etc. ...  


That hurt not like a knife, but like being impaled on a stake but I tried to hide it. Another colleague interfiered and we split off each his own way home...  
I send her a pm that night, that I don't know what I did to her that I reminded her ex and that I am sorry, asked for a chance to prove I do not want to exploit her or anything. (I  do not seek ""just sex"", I really do care for her, She bursted my bubble after 4 years)  


Next day, on our shift together, we had the ""normal"" convo we always had. Tho, we both were looking at the other when each thought the other did not knew... at the end, she spoke out, trying to clarify that I did not remind her the ""bad times"" with the ex, but the actually the good times, that I look, talk, behave and have very similar interests like him. That was a bit of relief for I genuinely though I hurt her somehow and did not even knew how... but she said she is confused, does not want any romantic relationship, that she needs time...  


So, today, a week after that ... not only that we have those awesome convos and good time at our shifts, but as well over text since she herself on her own, out of the blue, gave me her number the day of the corpo event, before I invited her to the Theater...  


And it is killing me from inside. I want to respect her decision and I would like to say I have come to terms with the NO. But just being in her presence, looking into her eyes... I would do whatever and wait whatever time she would need... But I kinda know that the answer was NO.  


The thing is, it will be 2 months before we get separated because company is reshuffling manpower. (Each goes to different city). But I am gonna have more shifts than ever with her since a colleague of mine quit entirely. 12h shifts, 3 days in a row ...  


I tried to do everything to not hurt her in any way but because of that false hope, it is eating me inside and I really do not know how to get through/what to do in the next 2 months that we are gonna be spending soo much time together.

7,pwfx7i,1632745434,Am I wasting her time?,"I‚Äôm 23 y/o [M] in a relationship with a girl same age.

We have been dating for about 3 yrs. 

Over the years we‚Äôve built IMO a great relationship, which I can elaborate on if needed.

However when I started dating her, I wasn‚Äôt thinking about marriage - we just met, found each other attractive and it clicked. 

Recently in the last few months, I came across the idea of how wrong it might be to spend time in a relationship with no clear goal. Essentially wasting precious years of the other person‚Äôs time.

It‚Äôs not like I already know I won‚Äôt marry her - but I‚Äôm just not sure, and I think maybe that means I have to decide to commit or let her go ASAP.

I‚Äôve been up front with her about the fact that I‚Äôm not ready, sometimes she mentions she‚Äôs ready to get married. She said she‚Äôs known for a while now.

Still, I‚Äôve started to feel guilty cause I‚Äôve been back and forth on this for a few months.

Essentially my gut is telling me I‚Äôm not ready and that it‚Äôs time to let her go.

Does anyone have any advice on how to discover what the best path here is? Questions to ask myself? I understand it‚Äôs ultimately my choice but I‚Äôm curious about people‚Äôs thoughts on this.

Reasons I‚Äôm not sure I want to marry her:

1. Simply ‚Äúnot ready‚Äù / personal immaturity - not sure I‚Äôve gotten it all out of my system with regards to dating other people (short term fling type stuff)

2. Not sure if she‚Äôs truly ‚Äúmy type‚Äù physically. I know nothing is perfect, but I think I have to be honest with myself here.

Long version: I had a really close guy friend of almost 4 years that I fancied. We are very comfortable in our friendship and tbh I could've really seen a relationship forming. That is until I had a moment with him (just cuddling) and the night after I felt sooooo fucking repulsed by the idea of him that even now when I think about him I cringe lol. I don't think this is exactly normal lol.

This is reoccurring. I've yet to have ANY romantic feeling dissolved because of anything else but an illogical ick. I've only had one relationship and it ended because of this. It lasted 3 months, I think it didn't end earlier only because it was 50/50 long distance and I didn't have much opportunity for the ick to form. This is starting to annoy me a bit. I love being alone but I also just lowkey feel sorry for the people that are into me because I truly hurt them without reason. 

Maybe I've yet to meet anyone I truly liked, that's why this is happening.

Maybe I have some sort of commitment issues. ( I do. I'm extremely independent. Sometimes I get annoyed with my dog because she is dependant on me - that's the extreme to which my commitment issues go lol. (I love my dog it's just that sometimes... i don't need her attention haha))

Maybe I'm lesbian lol. ( I haven't got the ick with a girl but I also didn't have too many experiences with girls so idk )

13,pwgskr,1632748418,You attract what you are,"For the longest time, I had low confidence, low self esteem and low expectations of myself. So I always attracted depressed, mentally unstable, unattractive women.

I thought that was all I could ever get. In fact it was easy for me to regularly have sex with 1-2 different women a week who were maybe a 4 or a 5.

The problem is that when you attract low self esteem people they tend to self sabotage the relationship. They will become completely dependent on you and make you feel like you‚Äôre the best option for them. Unfortunately what ends up happening is me feeling like I can do better.

I recently attended a seminar and was blown away by how i could speak to very attractive women and feel confident doing so

16,pwhjp1,1632750795,How do I get over a long-term relationship more quickly?,"I'm still reeling from my exbf(23m) breaking up with me (24f) 2 weeks ago. He was the love of my life. But I was not for him I guess. We had a 4 1/2 year relationship. I have a 8 year old son, not his.


He needed to ""find himself"", wants to be able to see other people freely, move away if he wants, disappear for weeks without having to ask anyone, worry about others feelings or how it affects them. (Mind you hes a caretaker to his grandmother with declining dementia) 
Do what hes ""called"" to do, whatever that may be. Said hes been aware of this for about 3 years but didnt know what to say.


I'm gutted. I told him 3 years ago, if you cant see yourself with me and dont wanna be with me, we need to breakup NOW. I dont want years down the line for me or my son to be closer to him and get heartbroken.


But he stayed with me. Moved apartments with me, moved us into a home with his mother and grandmother. When I couldnt stand being with his grandma anymore and moved in with my family, he and I begun therapy. He never really came out with this and strung me along. He could of said this at the very least, at the beginning of couples therapy. But no not until 2-ish weeks ago. Then we went from seeing/speaking everyday to not. 


My cat is still at his home, bonded with his cat( I cant have animals where I am and I'm trying to change that. I have truama with cars that I'm finally getting over, but I still have no car or license and the test isnt until December. I just got a new job I'm waiting to start at. I have no friends. Most of my family is just truama and not help to me, little to no support net. He was our support net. 


Hes still helping me get places sometimes and we go to church together and i feel like that's contributing to the pain. I've broken down many times begging to fix it but he doesnt want to and I feel shame. I'm working hard on myself, my mind, body and spirit. But I'm still hurting SO DAMN MUCH.


Im isolated in my room still, primarily, hes moving on, seeing people everyday, working everyday. Hes had time to move on and come to terms before breaking my heart. I havent I was under the impression things were getting better. Then this. I cry everyday, I move through it. I still eat and am doing my best to not drink and I no longer smoke cannabis, havent for a month, except one slip up. I cant sleep well at all. Hes always on my mind. Last thing I think about at night. Very first thing on my mind even before I wake. 


I'm angry, so sad, so lonely, so confused. He has still cried with me, just yesterday I came to visit my cats, cried because it's been weeks, then he broke down. He ""misses me"". I comforted him, quietly, angrily, shamefully. I still love him. I hate to see him hurt, but he brought this on us himself, he COULD change it. But no he thinks it's the best for him. Us be damned. He doesnt WANT us. He doesnt WANT me. I'm so hurt. He wants us to go BACK to couples therapy today, first time since he broke up with me, to ""learn to cope"". I'm already doing all I can but cutting him out. I dont think the therapy would help me at all, only help him. Just make me feel embarrassed. 


I feel like hes SO selfish. SO self-centered. I feel so angry, upset, conflicted. I'm leaving out a lot of his good qualities, I dont think itd matter to name them, and I frankly dont want to go back over them. 

How do I make it go away faster? How do i cope with this everyday? Its wearing me down. I feel so awful.

I was not dating anybody nor was trying to for the past three years. Quick to last month, I met a girl (22) on a college trip we had together and I found her attractive and cute right away. 

So, I have been chatting with her for a while on IG and also met her for a quick dinner at school last week. The next day we were talking about some food and she replied that she would like to try it with me that night. I read the message and left her on read for what may have been 20 seconds because I had plans for the evening with friends and I tried to all put it together so I can be with her but also with friends. 

She saw I was not responding at first and she immidiately started to apologize for writing it that way and that it was innapropriate and when i asked her what was she responded that girls should not ask boys out and that she is sorry. I have not been talking to her since that.

My question is, what signal does that give to you? I would like to meet her and to get her know more because we have a lot things in common.

28,pwiq9y,1632754319,Love doesn't get people to stay. Money does. So put money first if you want a relationship.,"I'm sure you've seen a mountain of romantic movies that may argue otherwise, but please do not fall for it. In the real world, relationships are mostly based on gain and very little if any love. You might be the most loving, caring, and attentive guy ever, but the hard pill to swallow is that if you don't bring money to the table, your wife/girlfriend will leave at some point. Now on the flip side, what if you were a complete asshole who treated everyone like shit, but had millions of dollars to throw around at any given time? Well, I can almost promise you that you will keep whatever partner you get. I lost my wife because I don't make enough cash. Yes I work hard but my wages are average. What stings the most is that if I had more money, she would still be with me. I know you have to pull your weight for damn sure. I am not condoning dead weights, but what I am saying is that relationships can and do work without love as long as plenty of money is present. The other way around will never end well.

I turned around and we had an at least 5 second mutual stare off eye to eye. No blinking. Never happened in my life. I was so nervous I froze. Then I took my cart and walked away. The next time he saw me he looked away very quickly. Avoided eye contact. Seemed tense and treated me like I had the plague. After the stare last time was he thinking like, ""Oh close up she's not that cute and she looked better from far away?"" He is a perfect 10 in looks. I'm definitely not. But some guys give me attention as I'm tall. Thin side. Asian. I know this sounds so dumb but I'm really sad about it all. I'm sure on his end it's all a fun game. Like bored so does this to many female customers. I don't know.  Prob doesn't think much about it. I'm sure he is attached and has people tripping over themselves trying to get his attention.

38,pwjln3,1632756822,Got ghosted by a girl on the day of date,"Matched with a girl on tinder about a week ago. Exchanged numbers and chatted on the phone. Conversation flowed easily and we had a ton in common. We spoke for almost an hour. This is on Wednesday and at the end of the convo I asked her out. She‚Äôs free on Sunday. That‚Äôs good with me, I suggest 9 PM we go to a busy park in her area overlooking the skyline and near a beautiful river. She wants to go earlier but I‚Äôve got my sister‚Äôs birthday that day and I‚Äôd meet up right after. She says ok.

Anyway Thursday we talk again and we‚Äôre both having a great time. Conversation is flowing really well. I bring up the date on Sunday and she said she didn‚Äôt have a good first impression when I asked her out to go to a park at 9 pm because she thought it might be unsafe to go with a stranger to a park at that time, not to mention she‚Äôs a single girl that moved here from Arizona just a few years ago. I remind her she‚Äôs  been there many times and it‚Äôs near her home. That place is packed with plenty of people and it‚Äôs well lit. She jokes that she wants to hear me say that I won‚Äôt murder her. 

Conversation moves on to something else and we talk another 15 minutes, laughing about other things. She tells me she‚Äôs be free to talk again Saturday afternoon.

Saturday afternoon we have a bit of phone tag.  call her but she must‚Äôve not been near her phone. She calls me a few minutes later but I don‚Äôt notice till hours later. I call her back, no answer.

Sunday comes and I text her around 3 PM that I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing her. I don‚Äôt get a reply so around 7 PM I give her a call and no answer. I understand that people ghost but to ghost on the day of a date is as bad as it gets. I moved things in my schedule for you, prepared by getting a haircut, going to the mall for a new shirt.

I delete her number and move on. Around midnight she sends me some texts.

‚ÄúHi!! I‚Äôm sorry the whole day got away from me‚Äù

‚ÄúBut to be totally honest. I didn‚Äôt like how you reacted when I said I was uncomfy going to the park with a random tinder guy at 9pm on Sunday for a first date‚Äù

‚ÄúLiterally every single woman I mentioned it to was like ‚Äòhe‚Äôs a murderer‚Äô‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not that unreasonable and you should have wanted me to be comfy‚Äù

I think ghosting on someone on the day of is unforgivable. I would never do that to someone. Where are the communication skills? If you still felt so strongly about it, why not respond to my texts? Why not offer a suggestion? How can I trust her the next time? I‚Äôve been to this park many times on first dates and it‚Äôs great.

Let the way they communicate and carry themselves in a conversation stand for something before jumping to conclusions. Even if they are using their body to bait in a hookup, let them have it and do their own thing.

Other than her, all of the women that have tried hitting on me come on *way* too strong to the extent that it makes me feel uncomfortable. They often behave in the same ways that make me feel unsafe around men. I don‚Äôt think them being lesbian or whatever excuses this behavior. 

The most recent example: one of my classmates saw me on Bumble and outed me to the entire class (she super swiped me and I swiped left because I am not interested and announced in front of everyone ‚ÄúI saw you on Bumble!‚Äù), which is really difficult because I have a couple of really good friends in that class that I had yet to come out to. The same girl was really pressuring me to tell everyone whether I like girls more than guys (the honest answer is that I don‚Äôt know‚ÄîI‚Äôve only ever made out with women and I am trying to explore and I do not think that is anyone‚Äôs business other than my own). She also kept pressuring me to tell her what some of my tattoos meant, and when I told her they‚Äôre personal, repeatedly kept asking until I gave in. We were at a bar with other friends the other day, and she kept stroking my hair and telling me how pretty I was. I was really fucking uncomfortable. 

This isn‚Äôt the first creepy experience I‚Äôve had with women‚ÄîI‚Äôve had similar experiences with men as well. I just feel like I keep attracting creepy people. I think the main difference is that I at least get seemingly normal men hitting on me occasionally. 

I guess my question is, how do I set boundaries with women (or people) that come on too strong without being rude?

Life long partner: 

-Emotional stability and kindness (do they have empathy, how do they treat you, how do they treat other people) 

- Loyalty (old friendships) 

- Growth mindset (do they have the desire to improve their intelligence and skills? Do they like to learn? Are they motivated by challenges? Do they see failure as a sign to stretch abilities? Are they resilient and comfortable taking risks?) Pay attention to how they handle themselves in different situations: how they approach challenges, do they persist or give up?  Are they inspired by challenges? Do they have self-compassion? 

- Does their personality bring out the best in you? (what qualities they bring out in you? how do you feel around them and after you hangout with them?) 

- Skills to fight well (long term versus short term issues) do they make repair attempts during a fight? Or do they ditch when the going gets tough?

There was a time I walked in and as I soon as she noticed me walking in she did a hair flip as I walked by while mistiming eye contact. Another time I checked in with her, I was reaching into my bag to get my card and I noticed her looking up directly into my eyes for a few seconds, after she was super friendly and gave me a thumbs up.

During the summer we stayed in touch and texted a lot. He would occasionally send Snapchats when he was out of town. One time he asked me for advice regarding which selfie of his to put on social media so he sent me like 10 selfies which was hilarious.

Most recently, E started working at a college bar and last week he texted me friday afternoon, asking me if I could come. I arrived and saw him in the bar and we chatted for like half an hour, laughing and joking around. I then went to a table with two guys and introduced myself  and had a nice chat(I didn't have any of my friends there). E texted me, asking if I left. I answered nope, sitting at a table.

My Girlfriend(25)  and I (25) have been dating for 2.5 years. We have gone though so much together and we have gone through a lot dealing with personal/family stuff. 

I think for the past several months, neither of us felt like we were good enough for each other. We felt like we were tying to change each other. 

And then it just became resentment towards each other and we both didn‚Äôt make any effort. I tried effortlessly to make her satisfied but nothing was really working. 

We agreed to take the time and work on ourselves in hope that in the future we can reconnect a relationship that we both still want to be in. 

The next day I was asked to go out to lunch with a few childhood friends , one of them was a girl I always had a crush on in HS and as a kid. We ended going out to the bar all day and drinking and catching up. One on fallacious comment led to another and we ended up going back to her place and ‚Äúhooking up‚Äù. Tbh the sex wasn‚Äôt even good and It failed to help me feel better. It made me feel worse. 

All I could think about after  was my ex at the time after it and get like a literally piece of shit. I ended up calling talking to her that night and spilling the beans and telling her what happened because I was so confused and didn‚Äôt really know what to feel. I knew eventually she would find out and I couldn‚Äôt keep it in and lie to her.

We talked it though and she is absolutely pissed at me and has every right to do so and as you can imagine, she is questioning our whole 2.5 years together. 

For what it‚Äôs worth, we were technically broken up and the hook up did not make me feel better and It confirmed I have no interest in doing it again. 

This was first ever relationship with someone I truly loved and I‚Äôm not sure how to get over her. Time heals, but will our relationship?

&amp;#x200B;

We met in a pub one night and got chatting. He walked me home and asked for my number. We arranged for a date the following week. Throughout the week he was texting me and we got on well.

Went on the date and it went well. Ended up going back to his. Stayed until 4pm the next day. A few minutes after leaving his house he text me to say he had a lovely time and that he missed me already. Then he met me later in the evening to watch a football match.

We were texting as normal the week after that and his last text to me was a lengthy one ending in ""how are you lovely? xx"" I responded and it was unread. The next day I WhatsApped him again because he usually replies by then but just one tick. I wasn't blocked on WhatsApp as his picture still showed etc. I tried calling him and it just rings out. So hasn't blocked my number. Called on withheld and managed to get through. He said something bad has happened and he couldn't talk but promised to call me back. He never did.

I sent a text about a week after saying that I wasn't sure if it was the bad thing that happened that meant he wasn't responding or if he just didn't want to hear from me. No response. I just deleted his number after that.

I was genuinely concerned as it seems extreme to delete your WhatsApp just to avoid one person, unless I was the only one he was talking to on it. But to not get back to someone in three weeks, unless there is an apocalypse I can't see what is so bad so deduced he is actively avoiding me.

78,pwnmcr,1632768311,I (26F) caught my boyfriend (31M) texting prostitutes,"Before I begin, I have written this down multiple times and then deleted it - multiple times. I'm trying to figure out the best way for me to come to terms with this and move forward to either a) salvage my relationship or b) walk away.

My boyfriend (31M) and I (26F) have been together since December 2020, and have been living together since end of April 2021. However, we met three years ago and have been great friends since then. Here's the kicker, we have an incredibly active and healthy sex life. Usually, we have sex 4-5 days a week and usually 2-3 times during those days. We can be passionate, we can be rough, but it's always open and freeing. No judgement. We keep conversation open for experimentation and it's as far as I would say, healthy.

Last week (Wednesday September 15, 2021), I had an appointment with an OBGYN mostly to discuss my fertility since I'm 26 and infertility is prominent in my family - and I wanted to be active and on top of my health. During this appointment, I was poked and prodded and left pretty sore. However, came home and decided to have sex (not the smartest idea, I know). We had pretty rough sex that night and a day or two later, I noticed a hard lump on my vulva. Due to this, I decided I wanted to monitor it and wait to have sex. I have also been incredibly anxious and stressed with work as my role has changed, and I'm being trained on these changes. I vocalized this to him and he was super supportive. I thought.

Friday morning (September 24, 2021) before work (7:30am), I was browsing birthday present ideas for my boyfriend on my phone but wanted a bigger screen to view this properly. My laptop was dead so I decided to use the iPad we share, it's his but I'm allowed to use it whenever I want and he's shared the password with me. I was browsing the present, and was going to send myself the link and then delete it from the texts before he sees it. As I went into the messenger app to do so, I noticed three texts from three unknown numbers which seemed weird to me especially since I saw the words ""GFE, BBJ and Greek"" including one that said ""Hey babe"". (GFE = Girlfriend Experience, BBJ = Bareback Blowjob and Greek = Anal). Greek is what he specifically asked for, an hours worth for $200.

I'm very aware of sex-worker slang so I clicked on these immediately, and I was correct. He had messaged three different prostitutes for in-call bookings around noon, he didn't want to pay the deposit for two of them but settled with one of these girls. And said he would message them in the morning which would have been Friday morning. I went numb. My heart started racing and I felt dizzy. My first response was, ""it's been a week since we've had sex.""

I immediately texted him and said we need to talk, he asked if everything was okay and I said no. I then called work and took a sick day, grabbed a bag from the basement and just started throwing my clothing into it. He called me, and I told him I was packing a bag. He said he was coming home and he begged me not to leave, I hung up and he kept calling and begging me not to leave.

When he got home, he said he messaged them but he wasn't actually going to meet up with these women, he just wanted to feel wanted and desired sexually. He said he didn't view these women as people but as porn stars and he didn't realize that even texting them would hurt me. He said he was broken, and that he didn't want to lose me that he couldn't lose me and kept begging me not to leave.

I told him that my trust in him was non-existent at this point and that I was hurt, and my heart felt broken. I have been cheated on in the past, and been a victim of SA. I said, ""it's only been a week without sex and that I was sore still from our last time and had developed a cyst on my vulva."" He apologized profusely and continued to beg me not to leave, he started crying at this point. For the last three months, we've been planning a life together, we picked out my engagement ring and only that Thursday we'd discussed wedding bands and children, and our timeline for engagement and a wedding.

I just feel so lost and numb. I didn't leave but I'm having a really hard time coming to terms with what happened. I can't look at him right now without picturing him touching or kissing or fucking another woman. He told me he had found these women on LeoList which I already knew since I googled the numbers and even texted them, one of the girls even told me to leave him.

My trust in him is just non-existent right now, and my heart hurts. I love this man so much but now, I'm questioning my own self-worth. This weekend he's been so affectionate and amazing, but I can only wonder what happens next. I've wanted to be with him for so long, my entire life is in our house together. I gave him some ground rules, and he's even blocked and deleted someone I had concerns about (which I was happy and surprised with).

It's now Monday, (September 27, 2021) and he's been sending me hourly updates of where he is and what he's doing. Sending me pictures with location and time stamps, now sharing with me his location as well as we both have iPhones. He keeps saying he can't lose me and that I am the best thing to ever happen to him. He keeps telling me his family loves me and keeps asking him when we plan on getting engaged, when we plan on having kids, I love his family too and my family loves him. I love him more than anything but my heart hurts so much right now. I genuinely don't want to lose him, I love this man so much but I'm aching.

**EDIT:** I'm an aspiring author and previously have written a character who is a sex-worker, I did a lot of Google research behind this and even watched a few YouTube videos on sex worker terminology.

**EDIT:** He also stated he's messaged prostitutes in past relationships as well, but never actively cheated on any of them. The way he views sex is very skewed and stems from childhood trauma, which I understand but doesn't validate cheating in my eyes or in general.

**EDIT:** Yes, I'm on antibiotics right now for my cyst.

**EDIT:** As far as I can tell he has no dating apps, that I have found or seen on his phone. Just to clarify, I don't go looking through his phone. I know his passwords though, and vice versa.

84,pwo2et,1632769612,Morality of racial preferences,"I briefly dated a friend who told me that he found women of Race A attractive and Race B unattractive (I am Race C).

I felt that his preference was dehumanizing, because there are billions of people in every racial group and it's weird to generalize attraction toward a huge collection of people who are grouped based on fairly arbitrary criteria. Within every ""race"" there's huge variation.

He argued that he found general traits within Race A attractive and Race B unattractive, but for every example (body shape, facial features) I could provide lots of examples of celebrity women of the opposite race who had such a feature. I said he was fetishising and stereotyping women and he got angry and said he's allowed to have preferences. He would never consider dating a woman from Race B. We did not date long.

I found out he's dating someone from his preferred racial group, and I remembered our argument.

It gave me the ick, but I guess it's not racist to only date people you're attracted to. It still feels wrong to me but I can't exactly figure out why. I figure it's internalized racism from society, because we can't be born with racial preferences, right? Race doesn't really exist.

85,pwo6xt,1632769977,This girl gave me the best compliment someone has given me up to date,"I've been talking to this girl for about a week or so, and I genuinely can't remember the last time I've felt this attracted to someone. She understands my complex humor, she's really smart, honest, and she's cute as well. We had a deep conversation the other day about love and relationships, and what we expected when dating, and she said _who taught you how to be everything I'm looking for in a guy?_ and I said that I don't know, it's just who I am. She then proceeded to ask why I was single, and I told her that I have spoken to some girls recently, but I wasn't really into them and they weren't into me either, and told her that maybe those girls just weren't interested in what I had to offer. She then said _poor girls, they're not ready for you yet :)_. 

Now, I've been complimented many times about my hair, my eyes, or whatever physical feature, but the fact that she complimented my whole personality is just in another level. I have some self esteem issues, and I've gotten to the point where I've thought that I'm just not enough for anyone, so, the fact that this girl feels so attracted to me because of who I really am and seems to value me in a way that nobody has done for a long time, really melts my heart",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pwo6xt/this_girl_gave_me_the_best_compliment_someone_has/

 She's in the school 2nd year now but because of C*VID-19 I saw her for like 4 months combined and feel like it's to late to make moves.

Sometimes I catch her looking at me (for a longer while) when I walk by. Also I found her instagram and followed her and she followed me back and only liked the posts that include me (my face to be speciffic). 

I honestly am terrible at reading signs and I would really appreciate your help from both men and women point of view.

90,pwoeny,1632770587,How the FUCK DO I GET GOOD PICTURES,"I‚Äôm 20m and decent looking I think. I‚Äôm short but buff and have a good funny personality I think. I‚Äôve used bumble and hinge for 5 months now and got 15 total matches on both apps. Which lead to one possible date that I cancelled on because I was settling hard. 

I think it‚Äôs because my pictures are shit. I am introverted and hate taking my photos. Not to mention this past 2 years I‚Äôve had a big glow up, sadly during covid so it‚Äôs EXTREMELY hard to be social and find a way to get good pictures.

Right now my hobbies are going to my regular gym. My local rock climbing gym. And that‚Äôs it. I go to work as well but these three things are the only reason i go outside due to fucking covid.

I would love to join clubs in college and volunteer at my local animal shelter for enjoyment and making friends. But they are both closed due to this stupid fucking lockdown. I also feel like these two would
Lead me to getting really fun and social pictures.

I don‚Äôt have many friends although my new climbing buddies suggested we take pics for each other‚Äôs dating profiles so that helps. I will probably take them
Up on their offers soon.

But still what am I supposed to fucking do, I would think maybe a festival could lead to me having good fun pictures of me but none are happening right now. 

I can‚Äôt afford a expensive photographer to get my pictures taken either. This is making me so fucking angry and depressed. I can definitely say my biggest weakness is my dogshit pictures and I want to fix it but idk how.

I also have a beautiful park near my house. Should I literally just go there pose and take a pic for one of my shots?

I've dated quite a bit in the past and in college I screwed around a lot. If you asked me if I thought I'd be in this position 5 years ago I would've laughed because I had a lot of women in my life. Ever since med school started, my love life went to shambles. 

I have my problems like anyone else but it feels like nobody wants to get to know me in that deeper, intimate way and it's sad. I've also just been really lonely the past couple years especially after covid and the fact that I need to study so much/stay so busy. I think I'm kind and thoughtful, if a bit melancholy but I'm quite loving when I care about someone.

It‚Äôs just very frustrating and I‚Äôm starting to feel like there‚Äôs no hope for me of finding someone. 
Now my question is, is it possible that I‚Äôm so unlucky that I only meet women who are still stuck on their exes? Or is that possibly just an excuse to indirectly reject me or end things?
