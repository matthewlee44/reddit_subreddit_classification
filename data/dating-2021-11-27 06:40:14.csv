0,r3ctbi,1638016911,Is it over for this one?,"Been seeing a girl for about 3 months. Seen her about 8 times, each time has been great, spent many hours together, got on good, like her.

But now she just doesn't respond to texts out of the blue, for about a week now hardly a word. I asked her if she was busy and doing alright and just dead air.

I guess she lost interest or decided she wasn't ready, but after that amount of time I think a clarification text is reasonable no?

The only thing is she asked to be exclusive recently, so I would adhere that obviously if we were still a thing, and if she met another dude, she could make that clear in some way at least.

Should I assume it's KIA or keep waiting like a pleb?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r3ctbi/is_it_over_for_this_one/
1,r3d3sb,1638018021,I can‚Äôt tell if my best friend is into me or not and I want to tell her how I feel,"Okay so here‚Äôs some backstory. Me and this girl, who for privacy‚Äôs sake we will just call tori, have been friends since 2019 when we were both seniors in highschool. We met at a school dance and kissed but nothing ever happened and we stayed friends.  Both of us had a series of crazy events happened in our lives that we helped each other get t through. 

She had not one but TWO horribly abusive relationships, as well as numerous other things that I would sort of be there and help take care of all the fallout of. 

When I was addicted to drugs she was one of the only people to help me sober up. When I broke both of my arms she would always be there to kind of help ‚Äúbe my arms‚Äù. Up until this last may, I was splitting time between Pennsylvania and Florida. And since the breakup of her second ex (which ended in her ex threatening to kill both of us  even tho we hadn‚Äôt ever had sex) we both have started to grow closer. We hang out all the time now and we talk to each other about our childhoods and fav memories and the vibe hasstarted to change between us I feel. I can‚Äôt really tell if she‚Äôs into me, but we are always ‚Äúaccidentally touching‚Äù and she always has this beautiful big dumb smile whenever she looks at me but she also is constantly (indirectly) saying things like (it wouldn‚Äôt be fair if I started dating someone right now because I don‚Äôt know that I‚Äôve dealt with everything yet) 
 
We‚Äôve been friends since 2019 but only now is she sitting in my bed on a nightly basis and I feel like she wouldn‚Äôt be bringing up the concept of dating with me if the thought hadn‚Äôt at least crossed her mind. 

She told me last night tho that when she feels herself or other people start to get attached she panics and self sabotages. I‚Äôm just trying to figure out what I do from here I guess",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r3d3sb/i_cant_tell_if_my_best_friend_is_into_me_or_not/
2,r3d68b,1638018268,Is she not interested,"So I went on a date earlier this week. I thought the date went well and she said that she had a good time. After, we started texting and she mentioned how this restaurant was really good. So I took that as her subtly saying that she would like to go on a second date at that restaurant. I replied back saying that I was down and asked when‚Äôs a good time for her. She replied back that she‚Äôs not sure bc she‚Äôs busy with finals 

Is she turning me down? Was it wrong of me to assume that she wanted a second date? Did I scare her off when I asked her for a second date? 

I can‚Äôt help but feel that she was nicely rejecting me. This is my first date since June this situation has got me very anxious.

6,r3dwbl,1638020870,Do you think he's (28M) interested in building a relationship with me (27F)? Advice?,"Was talking to a guy for a few months on Instagram before we met. He had messaged me first quite a few times before I had responded. I then realised it was a few months and I hadn't responded so I messaged him. We spoke for probably a whole month before the meeting. He has offered breakfast/study dates before too. We ended up going out for dinner. Had very good chats, seems like a really lovely guy and nothing sexual. The odd compliment, but in good taste. Some cute messages to each other, like him sending me photos of what he does for work and him telling me that he often thinks about me. He told me he was a bit nervous before picking me up. He picked me up from my house and before he got to mine, he texted me saying would I like him to meet my parents or just pick me up. He paid for dinner and it went really well in terms of chats, felt like a really caring and respectful guy, talked about family and all those nice things. One thing is that he takes great interest in my life and wants to make things easier for me (or so it feels at times), for example wanting to help me out with studying etc.

He dropped me home and did not indicate anything about going back to his which was good. He asked if I would like to do this again and I said yes. When we got back to my house to drop me home, my mother was just coming home and he waited and said hello to her. He then said she was lovely. I could tell he wanted to kiss as he sort of just kept looking at me, I said something and then we kissed. He messaged me a few hours later thanking me, kept in on and off-contact for the week, he told me he was tired but good. He asked about my plans for the weekend and I did the same, he is very busy and works in the medical field. He hasn't mentioned anything about catching up again. He asked about a job interview over the weekend and I didn't respond till about 5 days later.

In one of our messages, I sort of implied that I wasn‚Äôt sure when I would be seeing him next and he sent a sweet message saying he hopes to get to know me better and see where things go. That he was busy but should have more time once exams are finished and that he does want to see me again. I told him I supported him and that I don‚Äôt expect him to keep in contact.

Then almost 4 days later, I sent a message saying that it appears this is all too difficult and that I‚Äôm sure he can find other willing participants but it‚Äôs not going to be me. Exam is in 2 weeks and I would have loved to have hung out with you after. I realise I have been hot and cold. In about 2 weeks I‚Äôll have a lot more time but I‚Äôm going to ask you to wait‚Äù and then asked me if I want to study with him (this was September I believe) we wanted to study this weekend. I said after his exams is fine and he said that‚Äôs very gracious of me. I didn‚Äôt respond. I left it and gave him the space to Then about 2/3 weeks later; he asked how I am, I didn‚Äôt respond and he sent a follow up message. Anyway I don‚Äôt have much to complain about and things feel good but we‚Äôve been extremely busy with exams and he told me he has to resit; he initiates a lot and has initiated predominately. He'll message, we'll talk for a bit and then maybe I won't respond if it doesn't require a response and then he'll send a follow up message asking about something. He asked about studying together and some other question. I responded saying after my exams which were end of last week. He didn‚Äôt respond till about 2 weeks later asking how my exam study was going. Unsure if he did this because I had done this to him when he had exams. We chatted about a week ago now about something, few laughs but nothing concrete. He hasn‚Äôt asked to see me since exams. Growing frustrated because yes I could ask him to catch up but I already indicated after my exams and they finished not this Friday but the Friday before. Find it strange too how he‚Äôll leave the conversation for a week or so but if he messages me and I don‚Äôt respond, he would send another message. We laughed about something and that was last on the 10th, I was the last one to respond and hadn‚Äôt heard anything until he responded to some story of mine about purchasing an apartment which was almost 2 weeks later. I liked the message and he messaged again asking if I bought it and told me he passed exams. I suggested we should go to the beach/study together and he said his body isn‚Äôt beach ready yet and asked me a few other questions, asking where the apartment is etc.

He travelled over 2 hours to come and take me on a date which was really good and we did end up getting close but didn‚Äôt sleep together, before the day he had been calling me everyday and texting me everyday too. The day after our date he said how he had such a good time and was already looking forward to seeing me again.
This was on Thursday but we haven‚Äôt spoken as much as we usually do, I dropped him a text yesterday to see how he was and he said sorry he hadn‚Äôt messaged me earlier he had been working as he was hungover Thursday from our date so didn‚Äôt get a lot done and he was just chilling at home with family.

8,r3edr3,1638022456,"Dated for a few months, amazing chemistry, she wanted a relationship but I wasn't sure, now that I want one she says she doesn't. What's going on?","Honestly I don't know where else to go at this point so apologies if this isn't the right place. I don't know if I'm just looking for support or for advice so both are welcome. I dated this girl for a few months, she told me about some sexual experiences she had and I kind of felt insecure about it and at some point she asked me if I was looking for a relationship or not. I was, always have been, but I guess my feelings started to be stronger and didn't want to get heartbroken again so I told her I didn't know, maybe I wanted the same experiences she had before committing to one person because I figured, at least if we actually start something I'll feel we're at the same ""level"" (stupid I know but bear with me).

Anyway we kept seeing each other but after a while she started distancing herself. I asked her why, she told me because she didn't want to do ""halfway"" so I asked her if she didn't want to see me again but she said nope, I still want to see you but I also need some space so I don't get hurt and that we would discuss a potential relationship only once I got this stuff out of my system. I did **not** date anyone else throughout this, let me be very clear. A week later she went back to her family. Fast forward to yesterday (so \~10 days after she left) I sent her a video (felt it was the best way to convey what I wanted and let her watch on her own time instead of having a call) explaining how I felt, why I wasn't able to fully commit in the beginning because of this stupid insecurity but that I realized how silly it was and that nothing would make me happier to start dating each other exclusively because we have amazing chemistry (to which she agrees).

This morning I find a long ass text with the usual ""it's not you, it's me"" BS where she clearly states she's not sure anymore she wants a relationship and that I'm great, bla bla, I'll find someone. Needless to say I'm in shock. I immediately thought she probably fell for someone else so I didn't insist, just asked her if she means she doesn't want to see me again, even as friends and she said ""no of course, we can hang out as friends but only after a while because we need to forget"". Alright, I understand, first thing I did was to unfollow her on Insta cause that's one of the first steps I take when I want to get over someone. After an hour she asks me ""did you really unfollow me on Insta??"" and now I have no idea what to say.

I guess I just need someone else's perspective on this because I'm fucking clueless and I'm totally unsure what I should/can do or if I should just ignore her and move on. I understand she might be taken aback by this sudden 180 deg flip so I want to be careful about conveying that I really want this and it's not out of loneliness or whatever other fleeting emotion that will lead to me changing my mind a couple of weeks later.

Now, if two people choose to have sex before becoming exclusive then that‚Äôs fine. Not my business. But I personally don‚Äôt agree with that particular notion because I remember the last guy I dated gave me a pretty subpar fuck the first time we hooked up. I had to tell him what I liked and where I like to be touched and he understood and after a few more tries, it became one of the best sexual relationships of my life.

And also, there is also a thing called sitting down with your partner before becoming intimate and telling them in full detail how you want it.

Our relationship was going so well at the start it seemed like she genuinely liked me and she initiated lots of steps in our relationship. 

Then one day I hung out with her and she seemed so uninterested in me. She‚Äôd still tell me she had fun and would try and stay with me as long as possible but I could just tell she was uninterested in me. She didn‚Äôt ask to hold my hand like she used to or kiss me for nearly as long. And she didn‚Äôt want to do anything we just drove around.

So at this point I feared for our relationship but hoped it was just a one time thing then the next time she hung out with me it was the same. Then a week later she broke up with me.

I feel so hopeless and worthless as a person. She‚Äôs been in a past relationship for much longer and the guy broke up with her. I wonder what I did wrong and what‚Äôs wrong with me as a person. And I don‚Äôt understand why she started acting so different, before she seemed to really like me and we had a great connection and chemistry. 

And I feel bad about this but I also wonder how someone could be so cold and distant. She left me open on Snapchat so it‚Äôs clear she doesn‚Äôt want to keep snapping me like we used to. I‚Äôll probably never talk to her or see her again and it‚Äôs by her choice. How could she go from liking me a lot to being content with never hearing from me again? I could never do that to myself or the other person.

Based on this why do you think she broke up with me?

I met her at a party after we made eye contact across the room a few times and she introduced herself to me when I walked past her. A day later, I slid into her dms and asked for her snap and she gave it to me. However, after I got her snap, I found out from a mutual friend that she had a boyfriend so I texted her infrequently just to get to know her better and talked to her at parties, but did not flirt with her. After a month of knowing her, I found out that she broke up with her boyfriend so I began to text her more frequently and flirted with her a little bit. For example, I asked her what she was gonna be for Halloween and she told me and I said that it was a boring costume for someone so interesting and she saved it in Snapchat. I was at a Halloween party with her and I flirted with her and put my arm around her and she flirted back with me because she put her hand on my chest for a few seconds, was comfortable with my contact, and shared a drink with me. Many Redditors agreed that she was flirting with me. 

I decided to ask her to dinner as friends because she just got out of a relationship and didn‚Äôt want to rush anything and make her feel uncomfortable. She said she‚Äôd get dinner with me, but added that she‚Äôs not looking for a relationship right now. I said that I understood and we‚Äôd get dinner as friends and she agreed, but the day before the dinner, she texted me and said that getting dinner together was a bad idea because we have different expectations and that we don‚Äôt get along that well. After she rejected me, I cut contact with her for two weeks except saying hi in passing. 

Then at my friend‚Äôs birthday party, I talked to her and had a casual conversation with her for 5 minutes and planned not to talk to her for the rest of the night. However, when I walked out of a room, she was standing nearby and walked up to me and started playing with my hat for not reason and I asked her why she was doing it and she said why wouldn‚Äôt I be playing with your hat. During this conversation, her face was really close to mine and we were making deep eye contact. My drunk ass really wanted to kiss her, but I decided to go for a hug and we hugged for a good 10 seconds. Then, I came to my senses and realized I should be moving on and walked away. Problem is that I‚Äôm finding it really hard to move on. 

Was she just using me for attention or just looking for a hookup and got scared off by my feelings? Is she attracted to me or is she only flirty because she‚Äôs drunk? Why did she say that we don‚Äôt get along that well, but flirted with me and initiated touch and conversation? How do I get over her? Sorry for ranting, but I just wanted to get it off my chest.

I‚Äôve been taking to this girl for a month I really like her.It went great we went on dates she came to my place many times so did I.It‚Äôs great so far.Recently she‚Äôs been slowly canceling plans and all she wants to do is stay in bed and watch movies with me.She also told me she‚Äôs not in the best mental health state and I can tell she‚Äôs depressed generally.I don‚Äôt mind staying at home all day but when we do she‚Äôs so low on energy and in a bad mood and it fucks me.After 3 years of high functioning depression I finally decided to make a change in my life but now being with her is pulling me back and making me worse and it feels like a lot of weight.

However, I really like her and no girl has ever showed this much interest in me for a while so I‚Äôm lost. Also I feel like o won‚Äôt get any other chance in relationships or love after this because of how low I am generally and unmotivated for things.I really understand what she‚Äôs going through like I felt the same at points in my life.So her wanting to be alone sometimes is understandable.It‚Äôs just I overthink too much and I have anxiety.So when she says she doesn‚Äôt want to go out and she‚Äôs sad I feel like it‚Äôs my fault and that she hates me or I‚Äôm pressuring her too much.It sucks really but I can‚Äôt stop my brain from going to these places.

So should I text her and ask her if she sees this going anywhere because I‚Äôm starting to feel like she‚Äôs losing interest.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r3faf2/maybe_i_should_leave/

22,r3ft3y,1638026920,Am I being lied to?,"So I know the guy I'm talking to is who he says he is. He uses his own photos, definitely uses his real name and lives where he says he does. 
But, His photos never truly show me what he looks like though. They're always filtered and taken in such a way. But I like him enough to overlook the fact he may not be as good looking as he appears in photos. I've sent him 100s of photos that show him exactly what I look like. 

We both live in London , I am in central west and he is in the south east. So only around a hour from eachother at best, so we aren't what I'd call long distance.  
I'm 21 and he is 25.  
We both work and I also go to uni so we are both quite busy. We've been talking online since September 20th and recently moved to phone calls which last up to 4 hours. So anyway 10 days ago,  We organised to meet on the 12th December at winter wonderland in hyde park.  It was my idea, so I paid for the tickets and extras coming in at about ¬£50. He said hed pay for drinks snd food, I thought that seemed fair especially given he has to travel an hour to hyde park and its basically across the road for me. he agreed to meet me and seemed very excited. The day after organising everything he started saying his sister had covid and he felt like he was getting it. He took some tests and he was fine. Then 2 days ago he messages me saying he has covid and has to isolate for 10 days.  Which yes leaves enough time before meeting but he is making a big song and dance about my rather weak immune system a gift from being a premature baby. So we basically agree not to meet. He never offers to pay for the tickets, nothing. Which I thought was pretty shit given he earns 3 times what I do and is very successful in his career (yes he really does what he says, found him I'm on LinkedIn and has over 100 connections) everything adds up as far as I can tell but I feel like he is avoiding meeting me. He spoke to me for 4 hours on the phone last night, granted he sounded a little sniffly,  but didn't cough or sneeze or blow his nose once the entire time and seemed completely fine. We stayed up till 4am. 

Am I missing something? Do my suspicions seem warranted   or am I just being paranoid.  I have never dated online before,  I have one ex, who was a great first boyfriend who never cheated or lied to me so I don't feel like I have a past that would influence paranoid feelings for no reason.

24,r3fuws,1638027066,I need advice on how to proceed with a relationship without hurting the person I care about.,"Friend (21F) and I (21M) met roughly a month ago. We hit things off immediately at a party, talking all night until both of us blacked out from alcohol. Nothing romantic happened that night but it set the path for what came next. We started texting all day every day and after a few days started hanging out after work, all day and all night. We took things slow, first kiss on the second date. Make out on third and fourth. Nothing ever passed laying on the couch together though.

After the fourth date I went on a work trip (7 days) and things started to change. Before I had left we would talk nonstop throughout the day, usually talking until 2-3 in the morning. With the time change and distance so early into the relationship though things were different. We still texted all day but our convos were a lot less involved and FaceTime never really passed the 2-3 hour mark. She was going to parties while I was gone and after getting drunk she told my friends that she was concerned that being in a relationship with me would hurt her friendship with her other male friends. (She told me originally she wanted the relationship, not me asking her.) She also believed that our relationship could hurt our work performance. We don‚Äôt work in the same office but we do work somewhat close for the same company. For some reason my friends actually agreed with her (maybe they are right, idc) one of them even drunkenly told her I was a virgin for some fucking reason.

A few days after the whole party stuff she told me she wasn‚Äôt ready for a relationship right now. I handled things well, we had only been talking for a monthish so it wasn‚Äôt the end of the world. Although I was hurt I just told her I wouldn‚Äôt be mad at honesty and that I‚Äôm glad we tried. That night my friends told me about the party and what was said, all the good and bad about me. The next night I flew home from the work trip and tried to be positive. I knew either one of two things were true. She truly didn‚Äôt want a relationship right now or she didn‚Äôt want one with me. I chose to believe the first one.

I called her later that night and told her how confused I was. She said she was being honest and she just couldn‚Äôt do it right now, wouldn‚Äôt tell me why though. After that things were okay, we spoke for 2 hours on FaceTime before she left for a party. I asked if she would mind if I showed up (my friends were there.) She said she would get drunk and kiss me and she didn‚Äôt want that, so I stayed home. Around 10 she called me and asked for a ride because she didn‚Äôt feel comfortable staying at the party house and her dd fell through. I picked her up and took her back home, and this is where things get juicy.

Being drunk, she finally started opening up. I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm a dick for not telling her to shut up but whatever. She told me she just got out of a relationship with someone who was cheating on his girlfriend. She was super ashamed that after she found out she was the ‚Äòside-chick‚Äô she didn‚Äôt end the relationship right away. She told me how she doesn‚Äôt deserve someone who treats her right and she said she needs time. She was extremely hard on herself and told me about how much damage relationships had done to her recently. Around 2 in the morning I decided it‚Äôs probably best to not let her tell me everything about her life while drunk so I walked her up to her front door and gave her a fist bump. (I tried for something that she would remember specifically as not intimate because of the whole kiss comment earlier.)

Next day I called her and told her how I care and that I‚Äôm always here to talk to her and she didn‚Äôt even remember what she told me that night. Now I really don‚Äôt even know what to do. I‚Äôve been talking to her daily, (Im gone again btw, at home for thanksgiving week) FaceTime and texting but it seems like we are going down the friend route hard. I invited a couple of my close friends over to watch a movie tomorrow and only after they said yes did I invite her. I made sure to tell her my other friends would be there and I just wanted a friendly movie night. She told me she would give me an answer later.

Now I guess the question part of my post. What the fuck do I do next? I really care about her, I‚Äôve never spoken of anyone for 8 hours straight days in a row. I‚Äôve never felt this much about anyone my whole life. I want to tell her these things but it seems so selfish to do so after she said she isn‚Äôt ready for another relationship. I haven‚Äôt moved on yet and I just NEED to know if I should. If I tell her these things and she says it‚Äôs never going to happen I won‚Äôt even be upset, I‚Äôd be relieved. Should I wait a week, a month? I just don‚Äôt know.

What do you do when youd get the obsessive thoughts about your np leaving you for someone else? Or Someone you both invited in and liked together. 

What potential problems can you see arising I should know about so that I'm not blindsided?

How do you deal with jealousy in general? I feel like I've read a lot about this, but it's always good to hear more points of view. Especially if you have BPD. 

How do you guys deal with that part of having multiple partners?

I have a question just for bi guys

30,r3gcpn,1638028560,AITA for getting with my close friends stepbrother?,"Backstory, I met (call him A) a year ago on tinder while I was away at school in a big city. We hung out one time last winter so I could help him go Christmas shopping. Fast-foward a year, he's grown to become a close friend and is in a groupchat with myself and my old college roommate. I have never flirted with A nor show any interest towards being with him. We always joked that one day we'd get married, mainly because neither of us could keep the relationships we were in for that past year. We'd gotten into arguments before but always made up. Long story short, it always felt like a completely platonic relationship and I viewed him as a brother.

A couple weeks ago, he invited me to his sisters birthday party. People asked if we were dating but we both made it sure that we were just good friends. There, I met his stepbrother who I connected with instantly. We ended up talking until the sun rose. That was when A began to act weird and left me at the house (he was my ride) and didn't reach out until late afternoon the following day. 

A's stepbrother and I continued to see each other after the party, and A went back to where he had been currently stationed (he was in the army). Once A found out that we had been continuing to see each other, he blocked me on all forms of social media, even spotify, and expressed distress to his siblings after finding out what happened. It turns out he had feelings for me the entire time and ""saw a future with me.""

I was surprised hearing this and thought that maybe I was just being naive and never picked up the clues. I reached out to my old roommate and she agreed that A being in love with me was the last thing she would expect, since our relationship had always been platonic and never in any way serious.

I continue to see his stepbrother and we just recently agreed to become serious together.

If you have a newer date over and you know you guys won't be hooking up during the movie then you want to put something on that's good. So instead of spending an hour debating what to watch and having a good chance that the movie isn't even that good go to your go to movies. That way you know it will be something that encourages comments and laughs throughout the movie. Try to put something from your list on that they haven't watched before. Also, you dont know if they'll like it?  No problem,  just point out the things you love about the movie as it goes on, like ""Lol she spit in that girl's soda XD"".

It's always great to watch a good movie vs mediocre movie on a date with a newer person.  Good movie= good date

Like, sure you could put something up from a list of the 100 best movies,  but some of the best movies may not be your thing. Like, 10 angry men for me. It's good,  but it's something I'd rather watch when I know someone and I wouldn't go out of my way to watch it again


My list is
gone girl, if you haven't seen gone girl go watch it. Really just put this movie on your list now. I can already tell you it's good for these kind of dates. Especially if you like mystery &amp; true crime
My cousin Vinny
Jojo rabbit (this one's kind of iffy. It's a certain kind of humor) 
The wolf on Wallstreet
The Truman show

43,r3hs7a,1638032681,If any of you women have dated a man with a ‚Äúgay voice‚Äù how did it go? I‚Äôm torn on a current situation‚Ä¶,"I know this sounds shallow but it‚Äôs truly not a value judgment in any way, it‚Äôs simply looking out for myself in not wanting to invest into a relationship with someone who might not be straight. In asking people about this I‚Äôve been told by a couple of friends they automatically assume that a gay-sounding voice = gay man so I‚Äôm on to reddit. 

I started talking with a guy on a dating app and he seemed to really like me. He‚Äôs a a whole 7 hours away (matched because was browsing while in my city but I didn‚Äôt pay attention to that before answering) so we didn‚Äôt want to jump to meeting and we moved to phone calls‚Ä¶and his voice sounds‚Äî to put it bluntly‚Äî like he‚Äôs gay. I thought at first maybe he was just nervous because he is inexperienced with women (both in early 30s so I figure that takes a toll eventually). I was willing to give it a chance despite all of this as we got along talking. 

I thought if it was just nerves it would fade away with time but no, now we‚Äôve been talking regularly on the phone and it‚Äôs still there and even worse sometimes. My best childhood friend is gay with an unmistakably flamboyant voice and yet he has less of a pitch raise at the end of sentences. He wants to meet now (would fly) and I feel like I should given all the time we‚Äôve spoken and the anticipation but I‚Äôm honestly so turned off by this. Again, not because of any personal thing against him‚Äî I think he‚Äôs great and would be happy to meet him if it were easier and lower stakes‚Äî but because I started thinking back and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever known a guy to have that tone and manner of speech and not strike me as gay. 

So‚Ä¶I ask you: is it possible? If you‚Äôve dated a man who talks like this how did it go?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r3hs7a/if_any_of_you_women_have_dated_a_man_with_a_gay/

At first I noticed she seemed to be attracted to me, I was attracted to her as well. We played staring games for a few months. We both have a mutual friend. A few months went by and I  kept noticing her staring at me a lot. One day I was talking to our mutual friend and he mention that she told him that she was very attracted to me and she was crushing. He told me a lot about her and pretty  much described the type of women I‚Äôm into, smart, mature, reserve, fit, plenty of goals, etc, not to mention that physically she was my type. This motivated me to start talking to her and breaking the ice. 

I had no idea how old she was, I thought she was at least 23. An issue I have is that I mainly attract 18-22 year olds. I‚Äôm pretty sure it has to do with me looking like I‚Äôm 21 at 29. I‚Äôve always looked 5-8 years younger than I am. When I was 18 I looked 13, when I was 23 I looked 18 etc.

We‚Äôve been talking these past few days a lot, I can tells she really likes me and makes thing really easy as in I don‚Äôt have to try hard and qualify myself to her. She hasn‚Äôt asked about my age, and I haven‚Äôt due to fear of her being turned off. I‚Äôm really really starting to like this girl and I‚Äôm actually scared of her stopping all contact if she finds out I‚Äôm over 8 years older than her. I believe she has half of year of college left while I‚Äôm working in the industry I want to work in part time waiting to be promoted to my goal job possibly next spring if it all goes right. I‚Äôm a college grad from the same school, and I‚Äôm goal oriented.

I know it varies, but do you think if a girl likes you, an age gap of 29 m and 21 f would be a deal breaker for her?

51,r3ik9s,1638034883,Not sure where I am going wrong with men and it's making me feel inadequate,"I'm not sure if this is par for the course, but my dating history has left me feeling down. The most recent person I was intimate with basically ghosted me (maybe?)... this feels like the straw that broke the camel's back.

Just gonna give some quick history on my dating life and where things have gone wrong:

lost virginity @ 18 ... I was very clear that I would only have sex w. a condom, VERY clear... the guy said 'we don't have to have sex we can just mess around', then proceeded to have sex with me anyway. I really just felt defeated at the time so I just lied there. I still feel guilty - like i disrespected myself. 

First serious bf 18-23 (\~5 years). He ended up leaving me for his lab assistant. At the time, I tried to be super reasonable and just said ""make a decision"". He ended up taking 2 weeks of space and in this time, asked her out on a date which she rejected. Then, he wanted to get back together with me and even mentioned marriage. I said no, too late.

Next guy I dated after this ended (25-27) up being extremely emotionally abusive. He came on really strong at first (first red flag)... and then everything slowly started getting corrupt. He told me I was like a vampire and that people can tell there's something wrong with me within seconds of meeting me/I was a joke/people don't like me... etc. He really made it seem like I was the problem and that I needed to go to therapy etc. It was on/off again and he later told me he'd sleep with married men every time we broke up and that I should get tested. He also would sometimes do just strange/unnerving things like one time he randomly bit my face... it didn't cause pain but it definitely made me feel scared and anxious.

Then dated (briefly) a player. Then dated this guy who refused to commit, was hot-cold, and ended up leaving for someone else he met on an app (who he got engaged to) and 'breaking up' with me via text. He still reaches out to me on messenger to send me funny things, etc. I recently decided to ignore his messages so I don't see them and respond anymore.

Most recently, I was intimate with this guy I met a few weeks ago at a bar. He seemed really caring, and like a good guy. We were intimate last weekend (after the 2nd date - I feel like things definitely moved too fast and I made a mistake here), and this week he's been distant. He very genuinely and enthusiastically said he had a great time. I was a bit quiet @ first when he was going down on me... in fact, he said ""maybe we aren't compatible"" and I just felt very exposed because it was bright, so I suggested we move to another room, and things went a lot better after that and he said that actually he did think we were compatible. We didn't have sex because we didn't have a condom. 

Overall, I thought he was respectful and communicative (even if I wasn't too open @ one point) - I also told him that I don't usually do hookups and it takes me a while to warm up to a new partner, which he seemed grateful to know. The next day I texted saying I had a great time and was up for hanging out again. No response... then a few days later, I texted to ask how his day was going. No response again. Eventually, I got fed up and said no response is the most hurtful response and if he wasn't interested, he could just let me know. He texted me back saying ""Morning, I'm really sorry I've been bad at responding. I've been in that position before and it's no fun"". So I said, it's fine if he wasn't feeling a connection, it would just be good for me to know because I appreciate honesty and that I wasn't trying to apply pressure or anything, just didn't want to be ghosted. Again, no response (it's been \~2 days). Not sure what to do at this point, I really liked him and his text didn't clarify things. If anyone has advice, I'd love to hear it. 

It's kind of messes with my mind, because I worry that maybe I'm a bad judge of character or something. This is something I'm working on with a therapist, who's male, and who I am strongly attached to (and this actually makes me sad because I just want to be with him). But, I think it's also good to have a man who's really supportive in my life and it's definitely a protective factor for me... I don't want to like hate men or anything. Tbh, this relationship feels weird in a good way. He's really protective of me, always answers my texts, sends me books to read, and we are so complimentary to each other. It really saddens me that we can't actually date. 

Also... more to my history... my stepdad was very emotionally abusive to me growing up, and my bio dad was an alcoholic when I was younger... my mom eventually left him for it. One of my earliest memories is my dad being physically aggressive to my mom (choking her) and me yelling ""STOP"". This happened like once that I saw, but the relationship between them was terrible and my dad was very emotionally abusive towards my mom. 

Yeah... I guess that's my story sorry it's a bit dark. Also sorry for the length and thanks for taking the time to read it. 

I don't really understand why I have such bad luck with relationships.

Oh, also I'm 32... great with young kids (teacher), doing a master's in psychology, lived abroad for a few years and I'm successful, I'm super compassionate and empathetic, guys tells me I'm attractive. I feel like I should be a catch. But, my history with men is just terrible and I feel like I keep failing...

I met her at a party after we made eye contact across the room a few times and she introduced herself to me when I walked past her. A day later, I slid into her dms and asked for her snap and she gave it to me. However, after I got her snap, I found out from a mutual friend that she had a boyfriend so I texted her infrequently just to get to know her better and talked to her at parties, but did not flirt with her. After a month of knowing her, I found out that she broke up with her boyfriend so I began to text her more frequently and flirted with her a little bit. For example, I asked her what she was gonna be for Halloween and she told me and I said that it was a boring costume for someone so interesting and she saved it in Snapchat. I was at a Halloween party with her and I flirted with her and put my arm around her and she flirted back with me because she put her hand on my chest for a few seconds, was comfortable with my contact, and shared a drink with me. Many Redditors agreed that she was flirting with me. 

I decided to ask her to dinner as friends because she just got out of a relationship and didn‚Äôt want to rush anything and make her feel uncomfortable. She said she‚Äôd get dinner with me, but added that she‚Äôs not looking for a relationship right now. I said that I understood and we‚Äôd get dinner as friends and she agreed, but the day before the dinner, she texted me and said that getting dinner together was a bad idea because we have different expectations and that we don‚Äôt get along that well. After she rejected me, I cut contact with her for two weeks except saying hi in passing. 

Then at my friend‚Äôs birthday party, I talked to her and had a casual conversation with her for 5 minutes and planned not to talk to her for the rest of the night. However, when I walked out of a room, she was standing nearby and walked up to me and started playing with my hat for not reason and I asked her why she was doing it and she said why wouldn‚Äôt I be playing with your hat. During this conversation, her face was really close to mine and we were making deep eye contact. My drunk ass really wanted to kiss her, but I decided to go for a hug and we hugged for a good 10 seconds. Then, I came to my senses and realized I should be moving on and walked away.

Was she just using me for attention or just looking for a hookup and got scared off by my feelings? Is she attracted to me or is she only flirty because she‚Äôs drunk?

I've talked with her about that old ex and she shared that the only reason they broke up was because they didn't have much time for themselves while in school.

78,r3l5sr,1638042084,Told the guy Im dating I dont want to see him every day and he is hurt,"Ive been dating for 3 weeks a nice guy. It was going slow but well, although he is very into constant texting and I am learning not to run when guys do that. On week four I told him the public library where I go to do freelance work (we both do the same). He started coming with me. After three days working by his side, I freaked out and texted him that while I enjoy being with him, I cant be work buddies and date him in the weekends, its too much too early for me. Having him all day by my side is making me see him as a friend or a coleague. I need a lot of concentration for work, and Im not into flirting in that setting. I told him I need some mistery and distance and he was a bit hurt.

I think one of the problems is that Im not very physically attracted to him and was hoping with time it would develop (sometimes I do feel a spark). But I need proper, relaxed, intimate, fun dates for the spark, not ugly fluorescent lights, excel talk and bad cafeteria food. Plus the thing I really like about him is his smile (and values,goals, personality), but we are wearing masks when we are at the library so I dont see the only part of him that physically turns me on.
He told me he doesnt get why we cant be work friends and date, that he is turned on by me anywhere. 

I know I should have discussed this in person but I would have had trouble not burning it all down face to face.

(in case someone suggest it, yes I know I am an avoidant and Im trying to get out of it.

That goes for men and women. It goes for profile creation, choice of photos and first messages.

87,r3loxu,1638043588,"At 24 years old [M], I'm embarrassed to admit that I'm still too scared to talk to girls and I can't pick up/read ""signals"". How can I improve?","About me: 24M, average to maybe slightly above average looking, would benefit from losing some weight, good hygiene, laid-back personality, nursing student, have a job, good sense of humor (one time my friend said word for word ""you're a funny guy you'll have no problem getting laid if you go up and talk to them""), overall a decent person- not terrible, not amazing.

I didn't have my first girlfriend until a few years ago and we broke up earlier this year. We met through mutual friends. Now that I'm single again, I'd like to go out and meet girls.

Here are the problems: I always either miss signals from girls or I'm too scared to approach them. When I was originally in college (graduated a few years ago, back in school for a career change), there were a few opportunities I missed from classmates, at parties, clubs, etc. I'd be glad to expand on some of these events in the comments. Some missed opportunities were in part due to me not being sure if the girl was being friendly or flirty.

I'm also too scared to approach girls because a million thoughts go through my mind such as ""will she think I'm creepy?"" or ""what if she has a boyfriend then he tries to act tough and causes a scene?"" or ""what if she makes a scene instead of politely saying she's not interested?"". To be fair though, sometimes there just aren't good opportunities to talk to girls.

Things holding me back:
* I'm not actually sure how attractive I am. I see myself as an average looking guy but people tell me I'm a good looking guy. For example, there are people in our ethnic community who have basically said to me ""you trying to get married? I know a girl"" (and one time they showed me a picture of this girl that was an absolute smokeshow, which left me too stunned to speak lol). I dress decently, get regular haircuts, facial hair trimmed, eyebrows cleaned up, nails are clean, sometimes wear cologne, etc. so hygiene is not an issue.

* I legit have no idea on the difference between a girl being friendly or flirty. For example, one time we were leaving a concert and I felt a hand on my arm. I turn and see it's this cute, short, blonde girl and when she noticed me looking she apologized, stating she thought it was the rail and then said ""you have nice arms"" and I just said ""thank you haha"". another time in class we were signing in for something and a cute girl was like ""oh you're a leftie too!"" and I was shocked she talked to me so I just said ""yeah there's a handful in here"" and then went to the room. I feel like the girls were just being friendly in these scenarios.

* How can I develop a ""screw it I'll just go up and talk to her"" mentality?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r3loxu/at_24_years_old_m_im_embarrassed_to_admit_that_im/

89,r3m4jq,1638044821,Guy I was supposed to hook up with bailed at the last second. I feel stupid.,"I'm (23F) from the US and going to grad school abroad in the UK. I came here knowing no one and became pretty damn lonely despite having 2 flatmates. I only have class 3 times a month so I don't really socialize with my peers much.

I matched with a guy (21M) on bumble who I really clicked with. We talked casually for like 3 weeks until he became flirtatious and the conversations became sexually suggestive. Then, very sexually suggestive. Over snapchat we would sext (I never showed my face or took off my bra/underwear) and we would talk about what we would do to each other in great detail and made plans to hang out. The first time we had to cancel because he was on vacation and his plane got severely delayed, which is fine. He seemed genuinely remorseful and asked to reschedule for next week.

Next week rolls around and the day comes, I ask him if we're still good for tonight. He replies a big lengthy message saying how he doesn't know if he can handle anything casual right now and is so swamped with school stuff, then said he wouldn't mind casually hanging out and offered to show me around London if I wanted.

I was so, so confused. How do you go from sexting every day for a week and hyping up the day you hook up, to saying you ""can't handle anything casual.""

We've gone from talking all day to maybe exchanging one text daily. I'm so confused. Did I do something? Am I not desirable enough? I feel played. I let myself be so vulnerable to a man who I never even met and then he gets cold feet out of nowhere.

Do I keep speaking to him and hope maybe a friendship is at least salvageable? It's so strange, like sir you just showed me your dick less than 24 hours ago, what changed?

90,r3m8b0,1638045116,Awkward first sleep over‚Ä¶ think it‚Äôs time to block him,"So a guy I‚Äôve been speaking to invited me to stay the night for the first time last night, and a dinner date. I was super excited about this, I purchased lingerie for the night and was buzzing about the night we were going to have, because so far things were going great. I liked this man loads. 

Anywho, yesterday comes, and having spent the day working from home, I didn‚Äôt realise there was a train strike. Meaning it was only upon getting to the train station that I realised the only way I could get to his was by bus (taxis during strikes are ridiculous and the traffic more so). We had plans to meet at 8 at his home, I messaged him mentioning the strike and said I was running late and would keep him updated. I hadn‚Äôt showered or shaved, and wasn‚Äôt wearing makeup because I had plans to get ready at my Health club / spa, where I would wear the lingerie. I have a super heavy bag full of clothes and makeup, but I still run around London to try and get to him. 

It takes me almost 90 mins of running and catching buses to get to my club and begin getting ready. And in doing so, I forgot to reach out to him. 8 comes and we are texting, I called him  and updated him and apologised. He seemed annoyed so I rushed out of there asap, without finishing my look, grabbed a black cab and headed over to his place.  

I kept giving him ETAs and eventually there was a miscommunication in what he said his address was and where I ended up. He was standing outside and I had been taken to the wrong place. Because of this, we finally agreed to meet at the restaurant. 

I get there with my super heavy bag and he‚Äôs annoyed, angry. It‚Äôs 8:45 and he‚Äôs angry and I explain how I‚Äôve been running around for an 2 hours and a half to get here. He mentioned he was upset because he thought I wasn‚Äôt taking it seriously, and thought I was in the gym because I didn‚Äôt respect his time. I explained what I was trying to do, but I‚Äôm almost in tears and after five mins of bickering, where he tells me he was tempted to cancel and was thinking of me pay for the whole dinner, we continue to restaurant . He‚Äôs still super annoyed, and conversation is awkward. He makes a couple of weird comments about how he doesn‚Äôt like his Indian boss (I‚Äôm Bengali) because he‚Äôs rude and doesn‚Äôt respect time. He said Asians clearly have this problem, making a dig at me. He calls me bipolar and autistic. He mentions he‚Äôs tired from work and he only slept 3 hours the night before. 

After awkward dinner, we head back to his place. I kind of wanted to go home but this train strike and it was late, and I was kind of stuck. I mention I didn‚Äôt have time to put of his present (the lingerie) so he closes his eyes for 10 mins in his room so I can put it on. He goes gaga for it. Eventually we start having sex and he comes after 2 mins (which he says hasn‚Äôt happened in years). And then starts to fall asleep. It‚Äôs barely 11. 

I‚Äôm so annoyed, frustrated and let him know, and we are still bickering. Eventually I find a way for us to have sex again and it‚Äôs ok, I spend 30 mins massaging his back, arms and hands. He mentions that i did really well to turn the situation around as he thought he was out for the night. He wakes up at 6 briefly, we have sex again, and then I massage him before he goes back to sleep in my arms. 

We wake up and it‚Äôs awkward af. He needs to leave, but as we discussed over dinner I wanted to leave after him. But he starts pushing me to get dressed and leave with him, I‚Äôm expressing my shock at this initially and then he backs down and says I can leave after him.  He tells me not to bicker with him in the morning, he calls me weird for struggling to look at him when he‚Äôs talking to me. Whatever, I tell him we will remain friends, and he says something about seeing each other again. 

He leaves. I leave 15 mins later, and text him to tell him so as he asked me to. He texts straight back saying he had a nice time, and thanks for the massages. 

Grossed out and disappointed that it went this way. I was so excited, purchased lingerie and made so much effort and this guy just didn‚Äôt give a fuck.

However, after I got her snap, I found out from a mutual friend that she had a boyfriend so I texted her infrequently just to get to know her better and talked to her at parties, but did not flirt with her. After a month of knowing her, I found out that she broke up with her boyfriend so I began to text her more frequently and flirted with her a little bit. For example, I asked her what she was gonna be for Halloween and she told me and I said that it was a boring costume for someone so interesting and she saved it in Snapchat. I was at a Halloween party with her and I flirted with her and put my arm around her and she flirted back with me because she put her hand on my chest for a few seconds, was comfortable with my contact, and shared a drink with me. Many Redditors agreed that she was flirting with me. 

I decided to ask her to dinner as friends because she just got out of a relationship and didn‚Äôt want to rush anything and make her feel uncomfortable. She said she‚Äôd get dinner with me, but added that she‚Äôs not looking for a relationship right now. I said that I understood and we‚Äôd get dinner as friends and she agreed, but the day before the dinner, she texted me and said that getting dinner together was a bad idea because we have different expectations and that we don‚Äôt get along that well. After she rejected me, I cut contact with her for two weeks except saying hi in passing. 

Then at my friend‚Äôs birthday party, I talked to her and had a casual conversation with her for 5 minutes and planned not to talk to her for the rest of the night. However, when I walked out of a room, she was standing nearby and walked up to me and started playing with my hat for not reason and I asked her why she was doing it and she said why wouldn‚Äôt I be playing with your hat. During this conversation, her face was really close to mine and we were making deep eye contact. My drunk ass really wanted to kiss her, but I decided to go for a hug and we hugged for a good 10 seconds. Then, I came to my senses and realized I should be moving on and walked away. Problem is that I‚Äôm finding it really hard to move on. 

Was she just using me for attention or just looking for a hookup and got scared off by my feelings? Is she attracted to me or is she only flirty because she‚Äôs drunk? Why did she say that we don‚Äôt get along that well, but flirted with me and initiated touch and conversation? How do I get over her? Sorry for ranting, but I just wanted to get it off my chest. Also, I understand people might see me as the bad guy for going after a girl who just got out of a breakup, but I would rather get rejected immediately than wait around for her so that I can move on.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r3mjrr/is_she_attracted_to_me_do_i_have_a_chance_in_the/

95,r3mths,1638046789,Intuition,"I need some advice‚Ä¶

I recently ended things with a guy (I‚Äôll call him W) I had been seeing the past few months, though it was nothing serious. I have been also seeing this other guy and felt a true genuine connection that I wasn‚Äôt receiving from W. Everything kind of just feels ‚Äúright‚Äù, where as with W I couldn‚Äôt exactly pinpoint what was wrong but it felt like he was putting up a barrier that wasn‚Äôt allowing me to connect. 

When I ended things with him, I was fully upfront in explaining I had deep feeling for someone else and I mentioned that I didn‚Äôt feel like he was that interested in me. He then said that he was bad at communicating and the drive (40 min) was difficult for him to make all the time so he wasn‚Äôt able to see me as much as he wanted to and probably is what led me to think he wasn‚Äôt interested. He then added that he cares about me and wants what‚Äôs best but also to let him know if things don‚Äôt work out with the other guy‚Ä¶.. 

Though truthfully there was some kind of internal guide, my intuition, that was telling me it wasn‚Äôt gonna work out with W even though there was a major attraction there. Whereas with the other guy I felt safe to be authentic from the get go and even though I didn‚Äôt feel an initial attraction it was one of those situations where I was like wow I would‚Äôve never imagined I‚Äôd fall for this person. 

But I feel conflicted. On the one hand I have someone who I feel in my gut is right but W‚Äôs response has been gnawing at me. Idk if it‚Äôs cause I crave some sort of chaos and ambiguity but I‚Äôve entered into relationships in the past where it didn‚Äôt end well because of that. W also is leaving for a job out of state in a few months and I didn‚Äôt wanna risk missing out on someone who I could see a relationship with and offers stability just to stick around on the possibility that W would pursue something with me. 

Did I make the right choice? I feel like I may just be doubting myself because W likes me but there‚Äôs also a sort of passion there‚Ä¶. But again I feel like the other guy gets me inexplicably and I find that he‚Äôs the first person I go to for advice and reassurance",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r3mths/intuition/

97,r3n106,1638047355,im in a confusing situation,"There's a girl in two of my classes that I have a crush on, we're both 16. Sorry this is long, I just wanted to provided detail if I could.

In the first class, there are two sets of three rows of desks, facing each other, and we face each other at an angle.

The teacher's desk is on my side, but by the other wall where the whiteboard is. She doesn't really have a reason to look towards me because of whats going on in class, but I would see her look my direction a couple times each class. It wasn't a lot of staring or anything, but more than normal. I tried to avoid eye contact so im not being creepy, but it would occasionally happen, and typcally we both looked away quickly.

This goes on for about two weeks, and there was a time when I was working in the hall alone, she looked back at me over her shoulder. Again we didn't make eye contact, but I was alone so I can't imagine she was looking at something else.

So, I go sit at her table in the the second class as she sits with a few of my friends, and we can move around to collaborate on worksheets. The first day, I ask the whole group if I should stay to do a mini presentation with them, or go back to my group. She's the first one to tell me to stay, but my friends do too. Normally she's quite shy around people she doesn't talk to, she'll talk really quietly and that sort of thing, so this kinda surprised me.

Over the following couple of weeks, I go to her table when we have worksheets. I could get her to laugh, but that was when everyone else laughed too. We've got a good bit in common, we both play soccer, we both have a lot of the same classes, that sort of thing. There was a time where a sub incorrectly said my last name, and she brought it up later when I went to her table. So, she's paying at least a little bit of attention to me even when I wasn't at her table. She also would lean over to watch if I was coming over to her table when my friends invited me over.

I see a lot of good signs, and I ask for her number after a class. She gives it to me, I immediately text her so she has my number. That weekend I text her asking a question about soccer, as it's something we have in common and we can start talking more outside of class. I get no response.

So, I think she's not interested and I messed something up. But then she's staring even more in the first class. She'd glance over while laughing with her friends, she'd angle herself so she could face me, and she'd even lean up and over people at times to take a glance, and I noticed her messing with her hair sometimes, something I didn't previously notice. Again, I avoided directly looking at her as I thought she didn't want to talk to me and I didn't want to be weird.

A week goes by of this, but we moved tables in the second class so I no longer have an excuse to talk to her. I do manage to catch her before lunch one day, and I asked her why she didn't respond. She said she was at a soccer game so she couldn't text back, and apologized quite a bit. That doesn't really make sense why she couldn't text back later.

Another week goes by, and I decide to text her again, as I don't think I'll have a chance to randomly talk to her, and I have no other choice. I ask her if she didn't respond because she didn't want to talk to me, and tell her I don't mind if thats the case. Again, no response.

That was a thursday, and the day after she's staring waaaay more, and its pretty excessive. With the new seats in the second class, when she turns her head to look at the board she has an angle to look at me before she looks at the board. When im looking at the board I see her in my peripheral vision, and every single time she looked to the board from her notes and back, she paused for a moment when she had an angle to look at me.

I am not exaggerating here, even though I wasn't directly looking at her, I could clearly she her head turned towards me, she was touching her hair a lot, and sometimes looked at something irrelevant like a wall after she paused for a moment, and sometimes staring for several seconds. Again, I never made eye contact as I thought she didn't want to talk to me.

This goes on for the following week, just toned down a bit. She's still messing with her hair frequently, and glancing over very frequently. We get off wednesday for thankgiving, so I finally decided I should try to talk to her before the break. I stare back that tuesday to get her attention, we made eye contact a few times and I'm pretty sure she noticed.

She left the first class a good before I did, but she was walking usually slowly and ended up right in front of me. I still was unsure of what she was thinking, so I just chickened out and slowed down too. After the second class we both go the same way again, so I figure I'll just try to talk to her then. I usually leave first, but this time some people I know wanted to talk about a recent test. She was about to leave behind me, but sees this and stops to look at her phone. As the group leaves, she follows, and I see her staring at me the whole time when I look over my shoulder at my friend. I figure I'd just wait for the group to leave to talk to her, but she goes home early. So, I feel like and idiot for letting the opportunity slip twice.

Based on that, is she interested or not, and just being weird? I know all I can do is actually talk to her, I'd just like to see if someone else has a better understanding of wth is going on.

Normally i'd just let it go by now, but she's a very nice person, she's also in like the top 1% of kids both academically and athletically, like she probably has an equal chance of getting into a D1 college for soccer or a 10% acceptance rate school. Plus, she's very pretty so if I have a shot I definitely dont want to quit before I figure out what's going on.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r3n106/im_in_a_confusing_situation/
