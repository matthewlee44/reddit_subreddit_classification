She texted me again today, two days later, suggesting a new date for next friday. But she mentioned that she did not feel a spark with me when we met. She said she still wanted to see me to develop a friendship and to see where it would go and to see if things would develop over time. She mentioned that she always went for guys where there was a big spark at first but it never worked and that she wanted to try something new.

I replied to her that I believed primal/sexual attraction was there at first or it was not. I thanked her for her honesty, wished her good luck and unmatched.

I think that even if there is a small chance that some attraction can grow over time, the fact that there was no initial spark on her side is a telling sign. And guys with whom she has that spark initially would always have a edge over me If I can put it like that.

- Power struggle: we begin to notice our differences, annoying habits and finally red flags. Couples tend do drift away from each other if they don’t communicate their issues in this stage. Here’s where you decide if it’s worth fighting for or letting it go.

She ended things primarily due to religious differences (she’s Christian, I was pretty agnostic leaning atheist). We’ve stayed good friends since then, but it’s been extremely difficult to completely get rid of feelings for her. At one point a couple months ago, I drunkenly confessed that I was having a hard time moving on, and she said that she thought we were best as friends. We’ve discussed the topic of our past couple times and have a healthy friendship.

The situation: We went on a work trip to help a refugee organization this week. I’d recently thought I’d finally moved on from her. But when I’d look over and see her playing with some of the children, feelings for her would start to leak back into me.

Then at one point I saw her with a child laying against her side as she talked with a young woman, with a look of true compassion on her face. It felt like a switch went off. I felt more for her in that moment and since then than I had before for her, or for any woman I’ve ever had romantic feelings for. I thought to myself that she was the person I wanted to truly be with. We spent time playing with children together and I became even more sure of what I was feeling.

I haven’t been in a relationship that’s lasted long enough to get to the point of being in “love”, so I don’t know if I really know what being in love with someone means and feels like. But if what I feel isn’t that, it’s the closest thing to it. And now I don’t know what to do. I’m obviously not just going to go up to her and say “hey, I think I love you, do you want to get back together?”. I don’t know what to say, if anything at all. We’re still friends, and I value that first. We’re also coworkers in career job positions.

The work and week was extremely draining and I frankly felt emotionally spent and broken after I left. I’d imagine that’s playing into why I feel so strongly, as a reaction. But I don’t know.

My ex was married 15 years to a guy who did heroin and sold coke, acted embarrassed by her, wouldn’t really kiss her except for sex, wouldn’t be romantic, was a dick, and eventually cheated. She stayed with him because she probably felt inferior to him and had to cling onto him, and probably for sexual reasons. He eventually cheated on her. 

Many women will have the option of respectful men who are available and loyal and will make them feel good and secure, but those men are “too easy” or “too nice” and psychologically don’t attract them as much because they might even feel superior to these men who like them so much and give them plenty of attention and affection.

She's smart, funny, mature beyond her age and we hit it off great.

What started as a casual dating turned a little serious. There's emotions and attachment involved now.

To give you a context, my girlfriend has never had any romantic relationship/dating before. Only far off crushes she never spoke to.

So when we first kissed, held hands, or any of the cute romantic stuff, she started getting more emotional. 

She's an introvert in a slightly conservative family (not allowed to go out much) but since she's extremely close to her mom, she told her mom about me. Her mom approved and her parents and her home have become a hangout spot for me with us having frequent dinners as a family.

Her mom tells me stuff like ""She constantly talks about you/misses you"" or that ""She'll cry a lot if you leave her"". It sounded sweet but made me think a certain amount of manipulation.

Anyway, most of my friends around me are in disapproval because of the age gap. While I'm not in the one to be in the false illusion of relationship lasting forever, but I would definitely want to put in efforts to try for a long term commitment. 

But is the age difference going to be a significant Barrier? Because the more time we're together, the more we invest emotionally and the harder it becomes to cut if off.

Last week, I (M20) started talking to this girl (F19) on instagram, we had met on tinder. The both of us are very shy and don't have a lot of dating experience. Also, it was my first date ever with anyone.

We texted a bit and got to know each other. She was very sweet from the start, would ask if I slept well, how I was doing, stuff like that. She had just removed her wisdom tooth, so I figured she would not be up for a date that weekend, but still I proposed that we could go out for some sushi when she got well.

Two days later (saturday) she said she was feeling good and asked if I was going to be busy that night - I said I wasn't, and we went for a sushi date. We were sitting facing each other.

The beginning was a bit awkward, as I expected, because she had told me she was very shy and would not talk much in the beginning, and I realized she was also using her phone when she was feeling shy. It was fine though, I would ask her stuff, she would answer, ask about me, it was pretty cute tbh. I was able to speak with her while looking at her eyes, which was a big step for me. After we ate, I asked if she wanted to sit by my side so we could be closer, and she did, we spent a few more minutes talking and showing cat pictures. At one point, I had my arm around her shoulder and asked if I could keep it there, she said it was fine.

After we left, we walked for a few blocks and decided to sit in a bench in the park. We stayed there, getting to know each other, talking about what the other people in the park were doing, it was a fun moment. She was talking more at that point, which was good, and at that moment I was not feeling shy at all. It was a very good sensation of not being afraid of rejection or what she would think of me.

Then, we stayed there while I had my arm around her shoulder and we were holding hands and talking. At one point, I was looking at her eyes and I asked her if I could kiss her (I have no idea how I had the guts to ask that), and she said we could give a peck on the lips (I figured it was because she was shy and not too comfortable for a kiss yet). After we had that little kiss, we talked for a few more minutes, it was pretty fun, I felt great being there with her and it was very enjoyable. At one point I asked her if I could give another one, but she said we could do that at the end of the date.

A few minutes later (3 hours into the date, around 10:30PM) she wanted to go home (it was cold though), so I walked with her and we held hands the whole time. When we got to the front of her house, she gave me another peck on the lips (did not ask, and she went in my direction), we hugged and she went in.

I went home, feeling really happy, and sent her a message telling her I really enjoyed it and apologizing if I had done anything wrong. She answered me saying it was great, that I didn't need to worry. The next day, we were talking about our pets, she said ""next time you can take him with you (talking about my cat)"", implying we could hang out again, so it was great to know too.

After that (4 days ago), until now, we are still texting, she's very attentive and cute, asks me how I am doing, how my travel was (I had to go to another city for a few days), if I slept well, stuff like that. We don't exchange a lot of messages on a day, I guess she's very busy, but we send a lot of those cute stickers with hearts and she still asks about how I am doing and shows she's interested in me, which is good :)

Also, I can't stop thinking of her. It was so great to hang out with her, that I keep remembering those moments and wanting more.

I am very insecure, but I figured if we are still talking she probably wants to go on another date. I'll ask her if she'll be free on friday or saturday, but still don't know where we'll go. I'm not worried about getting too advanced with her yet, it's totally fine for us to just hold hands and kiss for a while, also I want to make her feel comfortable with me. But as we had a few pecks on the lips on the first date, it would be nice to be able to give her a real kiss on the second one.

Sorry if it's a novel to read but it's a lot of pent up emotions and thoughts all in one.

&amp;#x200B;

My girlfriend (27) and I (M25) have been dating for around 2 years now, We started out pretty strong the first few months and have had our fair share of ups and downs. Recently we had an argument that upset not only me, but my parents as well. My parents and my girlfriend don't like each other due to the argument and she has thrown out the idea of me leaving them and disconnecting myself from them completely, even though we have made up over it and are good. My girlfriend does not trust my parents due to their toxicity (Since the argument they don't allow her inside the house unless I am there and she is only allowed to shower in the house when I bring her in upon the approval of my mom). My parents have unplugged water and power to the camper that we pay rent for monthly and have threatened to kick us out several times for no reason. My parents have been super supportive of me throughout my life, but I have never been treated the way I want them to treat me (Like an adult). They still insist on being involved in a lot of my health problems as well as generally everything in my life. I've always felt a disconnect from them and have wanted to move away from them since I was 16 (Mostly due to my extremely bipolar mother who threatens me and is angry out of nowhere for no reason. and my Dad who becomes violent and borderline abusive when he drinks).

I love my girlfriend, but sometimes it seems that she doesn't feel the same way about me. She has been married in the past and has a kid (not biologically) with her ex-husband. None of that bothers me and we have talked about getting married and having kids of our own. We would love to have kids due to both of us having extremely rare chances of it due to health problems on both sides. She continues to talk to her Ex-husband and is planning to send him money to buy her son a Christmas present. She insists that a part of her will always love him but she will never get together with him ever again. she also has said that she would never go anywhere or leave me for any reason and that she's ""in it for the long run"" and has talked to some of her friends about me who know her very well along with her past traumas, (they say I am the best thing to happen to her). If that's the case why do I feel like something is off? She has had hookups in the past and has had a lot of trauma happen to her (Rape, car crashes, domestics, abusive ex's, 2 miscarriages). So she can be very emotional and hard to read. I think I'm mostly panicking because the thing we were told would never happen might be happening. The past week or so she has been having SEVERAL pregnancy symptoms, and I couldn't be happier to find out if she is pregnant. If she isn't then no big deal. If she is then that is amazing! But idk if I'm making a mistake or if I'm the terrible person for not trusting her.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess at this point I'm mostly ranting but I'm not sure what to do about any of this. It feels like I have to pick sides. Do I pick my parents? Do I pick her? What about her being pregnant, do I tell anyone? 

I've had a lot of anxiety attacks and restless nights about all of this and need an outside perspective to help me sort this out. I've even had thoughts of just leaving everything behind and starting a new life somewhere else with no contact with anyone.

I am really sorry for my English, as it is not even my 2 language. I would love to have an advice and constructive criticism. 

Okay, a little backstory. We graduated the same school, but we never had real a conversation, and never heard of her until the moment she reached out to me, appeared out of nowhere. Later on I was told, friend of mine gave her my contacts, she was kind of interested in me. We have been messaging for 2 months from now on and much has happened within, explicit(sometimes) photos and conversations. We started talking on the phone frankness went on another level, she started telling me about her previous experiences with her exes, things she used to do (sexual enjoyment), things she wants to do with me, she likes my voice and enjoys talking to me (I took it as a flirt). Later on, we agreed to meet, I think it went okay, considering that was our first meeting, at first it was a little rough, then it became smoother. She told me that I have nothing to worry about, it would be fine. We continued chatting with same intensity, a couple of days later, I asked her thoughts about our meeting and if she is ready to relationships, she responded that everything was fine, the way act and talk, except she kind of did not like appearance of mine(not handsome enough, from what I have understood), that she loves me as a friend/relative but boyfriend(got a feeling of being friend zoned), I was kind of mentally done, told her, that I would need some time to get over it, she responded that she would wait as much as it is possible. We did not chat 4 days, tbh I was considering to say goodbye and move on, but she texted me (asking whether I feel alright and etc.) she told me that she needs me, learns a lot of things from me, that her exes were never like me, I am cool and she enjoys spending time with me and so on. Everything went in circles, she again started flirting with me, couple of days before she asked how I feel about her, I told that I have still feelings towards her and I love her, gave her the same question, to which she responded she would never tell openly about her feelings towards me and told me that actions speak louder than words. Ngl I don't know what to do, to move on or continue talking with her, I feel like am getting emotionally exhausted of going circles again and again, and fell into a trap of unrequited love, I have been rejected a lot and it hits hard on my self-confidence. I want to clear things up, I am talking to her not just for the sake of having sex, all I want is love, tenderness and affection.

We both made it clear we were looking for a serious relationship.

Then little amber flags started to crop up.

- He said he doesnt enjoy nightclubs because there's usually a woman trying to make her boyfriend jealous. I thought it was odd that he attributed his dislike of nightclubs to women's behaviour (behaviour that I rarely see).

- He kept going on about not wanting to meet a woman who's ""crazy"". I asked him to clarify on what he meant by crazy; he said threatening physical violence. I thought that's fair.

- For our first date, I offered to pick him up because his place was on the way from my place to the bar. He said, ""I'd rather walk than have a girl pick me up 😂"". I hoped he was joking.

- We're both Black. He joked about Black women who wear weaves, calling them hair hats and saying they look trashy. He justified this by saying he'd had bad experiences with weaves as an ex had a weave, the hair got everywhere, so he broke up with her. I pointed out how this doesn't take into account difficulties Black women have with hair. He tried to smooth talk his way out of this by saying, ""But you're all natural. You're too good to wear a weave."" I said no I'm not *too good* to wear a weave, it's not a moral choice i make because I think I'm better than Black women who wear weaves. At this point I was seriously getting the ick.

- On our second date, we agreed that I'd pay as he'd paid for the first date. Then he grinned and said, ""It's all about equality! Isn't that what you're all for?"" I felt like he was taking the piss out of feminism.

- He said most men don't rate women who put out too soon. I asked are you one of these men? He said yes because these women aren't long term material. After pointing out the hypocrisy of that mentality, I asked - so if we'd had sex on the first date, after all your talk of looking for a long term relationship with me and how I'm so wifey material, you would've changed your mind? He said yes and he would've seen me as short term, but its ok because we didn't have sex so he knows I'm long term material. I told him that's not the point and if he'd changed his mind just because we'd had sex I would've felt massively deceived. 

- In amongst all the above, i gave him the benefit of the doubt and figured perhaps he's unaware of issues women face. So I explained to him several times whenever an issue cropped up and he'd seem to listen patiently. Even though I'm a feminist, I'm not one for talking about feminism and sexism because I find it exhausting and assume that the issues women face are so glaringly obvious that I shouldn't have to educate you. Anyway, after explaining things to him through news stories, personal anecdotes and statistics, he said, ""I do like you but I'm not sure if I wanna date you right now. You seem to have a lot of unresolved issues with men that you need to address. But once you've had therapy I'd love to date you.""

I was like fuck off I'm done.

I (22M) am a first-year teacher, and so far I absolutely love my job (although the long hours are a bit grueling). Recently one of the best parts of my day has been chatting with the school’s front desk receptionist (23F) who was hired a couple of weeks into the school year. It’s now been two full months since then, and she and I have developed a very friendly working relationship. I constantly find myself stopping to chat with her, and it’s reached a point now where as soon as I step out of the elevator (it opens onto the front desk in the lobby, my office is on the second floor of the building) she looks up from her desk and instantly smiles at me, and I smile back (it’s possible I could be reading into this, but this feels like a more genuine reaction than a standard “work smile”.)

Maybe I’ve just Pavlov’d myself into this, but I find myself looking forward to seeing her look up from the desk and smiling at me every time I have to go downstairs. I’ve started subconsciously (and sometimes consciously) finding excuses to talk to her (i.e. handing her something directly when I could just put it in her staff mailbox, or taking the elevator when the stairs are closer to where I’m at in the building.) After doing this for a while, I realized that I’ve started to develop a crush on her. From all of our conversations, she seems like a very genuine and kindhearted person, and I really want to get to know her better.

So here’s my dilemma: I’m not sure whether she likes me too or if this is all in my head. As I’ve said, she always seems genuinely happy to see me, and is extremely sweet in all of our conversations. However, I recognize that as a receptionist, part of her job is being nice to everyone, and I worry that I may be reading too much into things. If circumstances were different, I might just suck it up and ask her out, but since we’re coworkers I want to be very careful not to make the situation uncomfortable by saying anything if she’s not actually interested. Right now I’m thinking that my best option is to just be patient and keep developing a friendly workplace relationship with her, and not worry about anything romantic for the time being. But another part of me wonders if that isn’t a mistake (she seems very traditional and not likely to be the type of girl to make the first move, so if she was interested she’d likely be waiting for me to say something). Any advice is greatly appreciated.

So this is going to be a long one but this is has been eating me up for years and I could really use some advice to help me find a way to end this. Also sorry English is not my first language but I will do my best to be understandable.

There is this girl I have been madly in love with since high school (started in 9th grade, 15 years ago). We were in the same class and were part of this group who will often hang out together during study hour and recess. She was the only girl in that group. I immediately fell in love with her. Her smile, her laughter, her demeanor, her looks. She had a really radiant personality. She eventually began dating one of my friend from the group and it would kill me every time I saw them together. But I kept my feelings for myself. I had a really low self esteem back then and though that she was out of reach for me anyways and that I did not deserve to have her as girlfriend.

I was really shy and socially anxious I would even sometimes avoid talking to her one on one because I did not want to be awkward in front of her. Eventually after 2 years of dating she broke up with my friend but started flirting with another guy from our group. It did not last long and high school ended.

In my country, most people go study abroad after finishing school (those that have the money). So her and the majority of my friend and my classmates went to study in Europe. My family was going through tough times and could not afford to send me abroad.

I felt really down and kept speaking with my friend online. One night I could not hold inside my feelings for her so I messaged her how I for her. She was surprised because I never showed it and said that she felt flattered. We kept talking and she finally said that she was not interested. Some times latter I got to go study abroad, my social anxiety grew since I was in a foreign country but I was good at studying and graduated quickly.

Years latter in 2015 (I was finishing my master's degree) she came back into my radar. I heard that she had an operation and was really sick so I called her to cheer her up and get her news after so long. At first I was only friendly but then my feelings came back. We got close and talked often on the phone. I felt like I was taking advantage of her while she was down but it seemed that she enjoyed our calls and chats. So I tried to hook up with her again. At first she semi went along with it.

One summer she organised a night out with friends just so that we could hang out but I was too shy to make a move. Sometime latter she told me that we were too far appart (she was in Europe and I was in North America) and that it would not work. I kept insisting until she told me one that I was not her type. It hurt me so bad... I decided to cut communication with her and told her that it was better like this. She agreed and we stopped speaking. However a year latter she called me and tried to be friends again. I got into her game and again tried to have her as my girlfriend. She told me that she still was not interested. 

Since I have never dated, I am not good at playing the dating game. I am bad at keeping my feelings inside, especially with her. I stopped talking with her again. She got a little mad as well and told me that it was unfair and that she really enjoyed talking me. She hoped I got over my feelings for her.

Time passed and I have even forgot about her. I focused on my job and came back to my home country where I started to make a comfortable leaving for someone my age. I made some new friends and everyone around me was either married or dating. I felt really lonely so I made the same mistake again. I contacted her and started speaking with her again. Sometimes she replies fast to my messages and calls me. Sometimes she replies days or weeks after saying that she is not good at replying and apologizing. She told me that she has a boyfriend.

My jobs is sending me to Europe in a month to a place somewhat close to where she lives (other country but not that far). I offered to come visit her and she liked the idea. She told me that she misses her friends and family since she is working abroad. She talks about marriage and wanting to come back to our home country. She even offered to come meet me in the area I will stay and make a 2 hours drive which I found weird since she has a boyfriend. Would a girl make such a long a trip for a guy she is not interested about? She asks me questions about my job and sometime even asks me for advices for her work. I really do not know if I should go meet her or if I am just imagining stuff and being obsessed. Does she only want friendship? Am I seeing signals where there a none? Should I just stop talking with her and move on? She is the only girl I truly fell in love with and would do everything to make her see me like I see her. But after having been rejected at least 4 time by her, I feel this is getting unhealthy and bad and that I even if I get a chance with her I will only be a good stable plan B. What should I do? Why would she keep talking with me if she is not interested and she clearly sees that she is hurting me? Why doesn't she just block me, ignore me or tell me to stop chatting with her? She even added me in her close friends group on Instagram when we stopped talking with each other for years at a time. I am really confused and do not know what to do...

Thank you and sorry for the long text.

Some information about me: I am 28 years old, never had a girlfriend or relations with a women. I am neither good looking nor ugly, just your average Joe. I have been rejected by a few ladies (about 3) and also got some opportunities and dating offers (2 clear offers and 2 or 3 signs of interest). So I do not have much experience in dating and never really tried hooking up with someone.

So this is going to be a long one but this is has been eating me up for years and I could really use some advice to help me find a way to end this. Also sorry English is not my first language but I will do my best to be understandable.

There is this girl I have been madly in love with since high school (started in 9th grade, 15 years ago). We were in the same class and were part of this group who will often hang out together during study hour and recess. She was the only girl in that group. I immediately fell in love with her. Her smile, her laughter, her demeanor, her looks. She had a really radiant personality. She eventually began dating one of my friend from the group and it would kill me every time I saw them together. But I kept my feelings for myself. I had a really low self esteem back then and though that she was out of reach for me anyways and that I did not deserve to have her as girlfriend.

I was really shy and socially anxious I would even sometimes avoid talking to her one on one because I did not want to be awkward in front of her. Eventually after 2 years of dating she broke up with my friend but started flirting with another guy from our group. It did not last long and high school ended.

In my country, most people go study abroad after finishing school (those that have the money). So her and the majority of my friend and my classmates went to study in Europe. My family was going through tough times and could not afford to send me abroad.

I felt really down and kept speaking with my friend online. One night I could not hold inside my feelings for her so I messaged her how I for her. She was surprised because I never showed it and said that she felt flattered. We kept talking and she finally said that she was not interested. Some times latter I got to go study abroad, my social anxiety grew since I was in a foreign country but I was good at studying and graduated quickly.

Years latter in 2015 (I was finishing my master's degree) she came back into my radar. I heard that she had an operation and was really sick so I called her to cheer her up and get her news after so long. At first I was only friendly but then my feelings came back. We got close and talked often on the phone. I felt like I was taking advantage of her while she was down but it seemed that she enjoyed our calls and chats. So I tried to hook up with her again. At first she semi went along with it.

One summer she organised a night out with friends just so that we could hang out but I was too shy to make a move. Sometime latter she told me that we were too far appart (she was in Europe and I was in North America) and that it would not work. I kept insisting until she told me one that I was not her type. It hurt me so bad... I decided to cut communication with her and told her that it was better like this. She agreed and we stopped speaking. However a year latter she called me and tried to be friends again. I got into her game and again tried to have her as my girlfriend. She told me that she still was not interested.

Since I have never dated, I am not good at playing the dating game. I am bad at keeping my feelings inside, especially with her. I stopped talking with her again. She got a little mad as well and told me that it was unfair and that she really enjoyed talking me. She hoped I got over my feelings for her.

Time passed and I have even forgot about her. I focused on my job and came back to my home country where I started to make a comfortable leaving for someone my age. I made some new friends and everyone around me was either married or dating. I felt really lonely so I made the same mistake again. I contacted her and started speaking with her again. Sometimes she replies fast to my messages and calls me. Sometimes she replies days or weeks after saying that she is not good at replying and apologizing. She told me that she has a boyfriend.

My jobs is sending me to Europe in a month to a place somewhat close to where she lives (other country but not that far). I offered to come visit her and she liked the idea. She told me that she misses her friends and family since she is working abroad. She talks about marriage and wanting to come back to our home country. She even offered to come meet me in the area I will stay and make a 2 hours drive which I found weird since she has a boyfriend. Would a girl make such a long a trip for a guy she is not interested about? She asks me questions about my job and sometime even asks me for advices for her work. I really do not know if I should go meet her or if I am just imagining stuff and being obsessed. Does she only want friendship? Am I seeing signals where there a none? Should I just stop talking with her and move on? She is the only girl I truly fell in love with and would do everything to make her see me like I see her. But after having been rejected at least 4 time by her, I feel this is getting unhealthy and bad and that I even if I get a chance with her I will only be a good stable plan B. What should I do? Why would she keep talking with me if she is not interested and she clearly sees that she is hurting me? Why doesn't she just block me, ignore me or tell me to stop chatting with her? She even added me in her close friends group on Instagram when we stopped talking with each other for years at a time. I am really confused and do not know what to do...

Thank you and sorry for the long text.

Some information about me: I am 28 years old, never had a girlfriend or relations with a women. I am neither good looking nor ugly, just your average Joe. I have been rejected by a few ladies (about 3) and also got some opportunities and dating offers (2 clear offers and 2 or 3 signs of interest). So I do not have much experience in dating and never really tried hooking up with someone.

Ive dated a bit on and offline and have varying experiences but no one yet who fits the bill of a long term partner. In a lot of ways this is because ive not been ready but im now at a healthier point.
I can take a bit of time to open up to someone and I try not be too fast with physical stuff but ive found a happy medium in the time ive been single. Ive found some people you have almost instant physical connection with but ive found these tend to burn out quickly for me.
Im in a peculiar situation at the moment where I matched with a guy online last year and weve almost built a friendship and we make time for each regular.
In lots of ways hes exactly what im looking for in terms of a long term partner - good values, common interests, we work in the same industry etc. Weve built up a nice friendship and I do find him attractive so im perhaps hoping for more now.
The issue is on his side theres been no moves made at all and for me men always approach me and make the first move. I just personally dont feel comfortable making the first move as a woman.
I always make an effort looks wise for the times weve seen each other.

As I know I can be slow too and may have sent out reserved signals I have started touching his arm when talking to give some very subtle signals. We hug at the start and end of meetups and we keep in touch regularly between meet ups too.
He lives a few hours from me so weve always met in public he instigates a lot of the meetups /plans them /pays for them.
Im quite confused as never been in a situation like this but I feel weve built a nice connection that we would both be sad to not hang out anymore.

I want to have the conversation but its difficult in public and when we are trying to enjoy a fun day /new restaurant etc.

He does come across as shy in terms of relationships and hasnt been in one for Years either. Hes very focused on his career and I wonder if this is part of it.

Stop listening to dating advice**

Oh the irony of this post, to stop listening to dating advice from someone who’s about to give some dating advice…but hear me out. 

Lots of men and women in today’s dating world are struggling to make genuine connections, that’s no secret; Whether you use dating apps or meet people in person, we’re all subject to ghosting, indecency, lack of common courtesy and self-respect 

When things get hard or we find a problem, we seek out advice. The problem then becomes that said advice messes with our heads. 

For example, when we come to Reddit or ask a friend for advice/opinions about specific situations, we’re getting it from on all ends of the spectrum that could ultimately confuse your judgement and make things worse. 

Stop looking for red flags, stop showing up to first dates with a checklist of preferences, stop setting expectations and things he or/she needs to fulfill to be considered dateable or worth your time. Instead, start taking the time to get actually get to know people and let things flow naturally. 

Technology, social media, dating apps and everything else about the modern world has made human beings more disposable than ever. We don’t care about anyone else’s feelings but our own, especially if they’re not in our immediate family or circle of friends; giving common courtesy to complete strangers is just not a high priority for most people these days. We walk around with headphones in everywhere we go, stare at our cell phone screens and are becoming more introverted. 

I challenge everyone here to STOP searching for a boyfriend or girlfriend, but instead enjoy your life. Forcing a woman or man to be interested in you is the worst way to date. Go out hiking, join a club, walk your dog at the dog park, go to the gym, pick up a new hobby…anything that will allow you to yourself and surround yourself with others who are being themselves. 

Before technology you had to be social, you had to make new friends and you especially were more likely to take time getting to know people. Your best chance for making a genuine and meaningful long lasting connection with someone is to follow your heart and do what you think is right for you and your own situation.

He was still smiling a lot at this stage. I get on my bus and he texts me a few minutes later 'you get moving ok?' I said yes did you catch your bus? and thanked him again for the food &amp; drinks.

Ever since he asked I've gone down a rabbit hole of negativity and low self esteem. ""He's too attractive, he probably only wants to have sex with me"" ""What exactly does he see in me?"" ""Why would he ask me out?"" Etc etc are all thoughts swirling through my head. As I type this, I'm about to pull out of this date and hope he won't ask again, by saying how unavailable and busy I am. When in reality I just feel very afraid and anxious of putting myself out there and be hurt by someone I can tell I already like. 

Then comes ""Love on the Spectrum"" on Netflix, a show about people on various ends of the spectrum looking for love. Watched Season 1 last year and have been watching Season 2. And it makes me really ponder. The simplicity of their intentions: ""I just want to love and be loved and I'm taking step ABC to make it so"". So straight to the point, no clouds, no b.s. They commit to dates and they show up with all the positivity. They hope for the best and they determine very quickly whether they want to see each other again, then they just do. I think I watch this show because deep down it makes me happy to see people find love after intentionally looking for it. But I also think I envy their openness to love and vulnerability. My experiences have taught me these things are harmfulness and stressful and not with it to me despite wanting love and connection, to them this is not even a factor to dwell on. 

I realize most people are probably like that, securely attached and open and I just can't relate as someone who is Fearful Avoidant and part of me truly believes I'll never get out of this rut and find meaningful relationships.

I’m also not into the whole casual dating thing that’s popular now. I don’t care for hookups. I’m looking for an actual, serious connection.

I really want to pursue a serious relationship, but I really don’t think I’m cut out for OLD. I’ve used tinder, bumble, hinge, you name it. I’ve given it an honest shot, even paid for the premium and some boosts. Out of the 3 years I’ve been on OLD, I’ve matched with a couple people each month. I never get responses. I get it though, I’m not gonna be everybody’s cup of tea and that’s ok. I think OLD isn’t gonna lead anywhere to be honest. 

I didn’t limit myself to OLD either. I’m a very outgoing person. I have no problems getting people to laugh. I’ve asked female friends at my college if they had any single friends, but either they don’t know anybody in town, or they’re already in a relationship.

I’ve got my shit together. I’m in school for computer networking making straight A’s. I make around 38k a year after taxes working full time too.

I worked really hard for it so I’m proud, but I’m humble.

I’ve got hobbies. I like working on cars, drifting, racing, and going to see live music. And I have lots of traveling under my belt. 

It feels like I’m doing everything I’m supposed to. I’m outgoing, independent, exceeding academically, and financially smart. I just seem to be having no luck.

My last relationship was wonderful and even though we didn't work out, I learned a lot about myself and how I deserve to be treated and how to treat other people. I recently moved halfway across the country and due to loneliness, have started to seek out more social spots to make friends. Being a lesbian though makes dating in most spaces really difficult, so I did what I knew would open up the possibility of findings relationship (Online Dating).

I met this beautiful girl (24F) and we spoke for almost a week before our first date. Texting, calls and video chats. Everything seemed to be going well and we were both excited for our first date. 

My plan was to take her on a picnic in a park or by the river, but she managed to convince me to have the picnic by her pool instead. So I get there and everything is going amazing for the first half of our date. Then everything took a nosedive. She lied to me about a lot of things (her story was mostly the same as what she told me before the date but the changes were noticable enough to be concerning) and then proceeded to watch TikTok videos for almost an hour, instead of talking to me. A lot of other things happened of course but when I finally said my goodbye, she was very adamant that she wanted to continue to date me. 

On my drive back home that night I was angry, I had essentially wasted hours of my night on a date with a girl that 1) lied to me about important things and 2) preferred to treat our date like we were just best friends hanging out or an already established couple.

The next morning I decided to end things quickly, over text, and just move on. I know it probably makes me a shitty person doing it that way, but I felt justified in it because I felt like she was only using me for the attention I could give her.

My social skills atrophied. My ethnic group is heavily centered around churches and I am an ex-Christian so I lost touch with my people. And I want to date out of my racial group. Unfortunately I am located in LA.

And I never ventured out to bars or clubs because I am super sensitive to noises and I fear DUI. Heck, I don't drink at all. I have obsessive fear of getting stopped by traffic cops so those things discouraged me from going out.

Most of my friends are out of the area or online friends. All my female friends are from Social Media and I can definitely tell they are real deal. 

I am 5'10"" and weigh 195lbs. Somehow medium shirts fits best and people say I look taller than my actual height. I worked as an extra for a popular medical drama for many seasons playing a doctor and I even got groped by a female cast. So I guess I don't look that ugly. But I have a very low self esteem and damaged ego thanks to my cultural upbringing where corporal punishment and verbal abuse using expletives was norm.

I am venturing out to a popular spot tomorrow night. Definitely not a swanky spot in Santa Monica, but a fairly popular single bar in Sherman Oaks. I never get a match from online dating so I will have better luck with meeting people in person.

My life has turned around a lot, at least career wise and situation wise. But I just haven’t bothered with the realm of dating at all, it feels like a loss and completely hopeless to me.

I even started caring for myself more, although not as much, I’ve been working out and gone primarily vegan and I’ve gone from gaining weight to losing it all again but also losing muscle. I’m working on getting that back. Otherwise I try with whatever clothes and personal care I’m able to afford right now (I’m getting offers for more)

I can say that I’ve learned a shit ton through books and educational podcasts. When I talk to other people I tend to know a lot more than the average person especially when it comes to history, and I’ve discovered I’m extremely empathetic with a deep emotional understanding towards humanity.

I just struggle to see a lot of hope in a lot of it. A partner would be nice to at least not be alone while we witness the collapse, but I pretty much stopped caring and don’t have a lot of interest in sex anymore.

I used to work in a pub with this girl, we both started the job at the same time but worked separately (me in kitchen her behind bar) at first we by chance had a couple of breaks together and got to have a few good conversations. We got closer over the course of 2 months (only speaking in person though). I wanted to make a move on her but I was hesitant as it could make work awkward. During this time I had ran into her outside of work but she was with this other guy who I took to believe was someone she was talking to romantically. I was kind of disappointed but got over it pretty soon as I got an offer for my dream job. I put in my 2 weeks as soon as possible and when I told her she jokingly said “You were my favourite part of this job” but her facial expression showed she was disappointed about me leaving.

I ran into her in a nightclub around a month after not seeing her since I’d left.
I said “hi” and we immediately hugged and it was obvious we were both excited to see each other one thing led to another and we were kissing in the middle of the club. After this she was called over by a couple of her friends. I left to find my friends as I felt awkward about her immediately walking away. I walked by her later that night and she was kissing someone else, I was disappointed. To be honest it completely ruined my night, I went from such a high to such a low and it felt horrible. 

After this I hadn’t seen her for around another month until I saw her in a pub, we quite literally bumped into each other. We were both excited to see each other. We both had obviously drank quite a bit by that point. She told me she missed seeing my face everyday and nobody makes her laugh as much as I do. Hearing that made me feel incredible and I couldn’t have been happier. She started to feel one of my arms saying I looked bigger from when I worked with her. But her “boyfriend” came over who isn’t the guy from earlier in the story and was now someone I know well and really like. I only found out about him when he came over she hadn’t made any intention to tell me about him. I then had an awkward interaction with them pretty much trying to just get away from the situation.

I then sat with my friends and she came over not long after introducing herself to everyone saying she “loves me” and “I was the one who got away” I reacted awkwardly as her boyfriend was literally at the other side of the pub. She then moved from the bottom of the table to the seat beside me as my friend went to the bar. And we just had a casual conversation recalling on work stories and she slowly held my hand under the table and sat in against me. I suddenly shook her off as I felt so awkward with the whole situation I whispered to her (so she wouldn’t get embarrassed) “you need to remember you have a boyfriend” she then replies with “I’d leave him in a minute if I you wanted me to” and then got up and left.

There’s a lot of factors in this story and of all the people that I’ve told I’ve heard a lot of different advice. It’s worth noting I do actually like this girl and would like a relationship but she’s very “unpredictable” and I don’t know if that should be a red flag

My boyfriend has doubts about the relationship. We talked about it on Tuesday.

He said I‘ve been amazing and he still thinks it can work out. I asked him today how he‘s feeling at the moment and if he still has doubts and his reply was “I guess but it gets better every day :)❤️“. That “I guess“ just frustrates me because I honestly don‘t want to be with someone who has doubts about me. Another thing is that he didn‘t tell me that spending more time alone thing before so he basically hid the problems inside him and allowed them to develop into doubts. I always told him to be open to me when something is wrong and he said he will but he‘s still not doing it and I think that‘s unfair.
