Her profile checked all the boxes of what I think I want, and so I sent her a message. 

Initial conversation was a bit slow - I was definitely steering the conversation, but again, she seemed to be just what I'm looking for and was responding positively, if not very quickly. I didn't think too much about it - I was still a stranger after all, and she has a good career that is notorious for long hours and stress. 

I asked her out the following Saturday night to a place that I knew we would both like that had only just reopened. She said yes, and sounded enthusiastic about it. I got there early and she got there about 10 minutes late. Not ideal, but like half my dates are late to meet, so again I didn't read into it too much.

We go inside, and it seems like she wants me to lead the date, so I suggest we start by getting drinks. ""First round is on me"". I continued to lead, based on her verbal and non-verbal queues, and eventually we get more drinks (she reciprocates), and find a quieter place to chat after having played a couple rounds of pool. Things seem to be going really well - there's a lot of laughing and playful contact, and we have a lot in common, so I ask if she'd like to go somewhere else for a late dinner. We find a restaurant a few doors down, that goes well, and upon discovering that we're practically neighbors, decide to split a cab back. 

I get out of the cab with her, because my place is just a few blocks away, and she asks me to kiss her! So we kiss a little, agree to go on another date, and I head home from there. 

In my mind, that 5 hour first date was a resounding success. 

The next day (Sunday), I decide to be a bit bold and text her to tell her I had a good time and make a joke that referenced something from the night before. It's several hours before I get a response, but again it seems positive. She had a good time too. I follow up with another light joke, no response, but it wasn't exactly something that required a response, so I sigh to myself and move on with my day.

By Wednesday, I haven't heard anything from her, so I decide to just go for it, and ask if she wants to go out again. She responds enthusiastically, and says that she had a draft message written to me, and that she's just been overwhelmed with work. I propose Saturday again to give us time to decompress from the week. Her mother is having a party that afternoon, and she isn't sure how long she's expected to be there, so tentatively 7 PM. Sounds good. 

Another few days pass with no communication, and Saturday (today) rolls around. I ask her if we're still on for the evening and she tells me that she had been involved in a car accident on Friday. She's ok, but is feeling sore today and wants to cancel so she can go to urgent care. I respond that I understand and that I'm glad that she's ok, and that's basically where things are now.

At this point I can't help but wonder about where I stand. I'm willing to accept that the cancellation was for a legitimate reason, but if so, why wait for me to ask? I may be reading into it too much, but she said ""cancel"" rather than ask to reschedule. I don't think I said anything in the week between to change her opinion of me, so I'm at a bit of a loss.

I don’t drink and used that as an excuse… ie “all the girls are at the bar and that’s why I can’t get a girlfriend”

In reality, that was clearly a way for me to justify not getting out of my comfort zone.

3 weeks ago I did my first cold approach… I locked eyes with this girl at the store and went for it… no pickup line or smooth talk… simply “I’m sorry to disrupt your peaceful shopping trip… You caught my eye and I wanted to introduce myself.”

Walked away with her number and now approach once a day. 

I sat down and asked myself “where would the girl I want in my life hangout?” That gave me the starting point of places to visit more frequently.

I have yet to get a date from  approaching but averaging getting the number 90% of the time.

Now, I know I need to work on texting as that’s where the conversation falters…

When I first saw her, I walked up to her immediately and said that I love her outfit. The second time seeing her that same day, I pointed and looked at her up and down very comically and said allright now, and she started laughing. The third time I saw her, I said hey, come here. You know who you remind me of wearing that outfit? Princess Jasmine from Aladdin. She said awww youre gonna make me blush, and we carried on the conversation for a few minutes, she then asked for my number. I learned that she was celebrating her birthday and wanted me to join since she was alone, sadly I had to work a closing shift and wasn't able to make it. 

She flaked the next two days. The third try, we went out!... and had a fucking amazing time. We drank, bummed cigs off of random people, she took me to a hotel and played the piano for me ( while we took shots off of it, and she was good at piano!), and she even ended up singing songs to me, for me. Tennessee whiskey being sung to you is fucking hot. She sounded amazing. Various other songs as well. 

After the night was over, we went back to my car on the 7th floor of a parking garage. I ended up being too drunk to drive, so I played it safe and just chilled there. We fell asleep. Car off, both phones charging. My battery had died! I drive a Cadillac CTS, my trunk is battery operated. My battery is in my trunk. Back seats won't go down. I called state farm roadside and they sent someone out. They said that they had to have access to my battery. I was still drunk, stressing hard; thinking I blew the date and she was asleep in the passenger seat the whole time! I ended up finding a small pull switch right above my back center console, and I opened the trunk! Popalock came and popped my hood, and jumped my car from under my hood on two terminals. I felt silly for opening my trunk at that point. We ended up going to some docks that I know after my car was cool with food and ate there. It was a 13 hour date. 

The next 3 times were just like that. Very long dates. Something more happened on the 3rd. Tonight was the 4th or 5th, I don't even remember I've been so fucked up. I never drink, after all. It's like we go out all the time now. 3 times now she has passed out in my car. It's fucking impossible and I wanted to go home. I literally waited and woke her up every 10 minutes, but nope.

She is not that kind of girl who is always on her phone. She is a person that ""hates"" it actually.

So I wonder if it's generally quite common to don't chat much between dates.

For me its quite strange, because when I'm into someone then I want to be with her as much as possible and want to speak/chat with her as much as possible.

me and my class had a project with some other classes last week. There was a pretty attractive Girl in my group who immediately caught my attention. On monday afternoon I waited at the entrance of the Schoolyard and asked her if she would like to join me for coffee. She responed with ""I would love to"".  Then I got her number, we had a pretty nice talk and after we went home.

So at first I was f\*\*king happy that she said yes, because I never ever asked a woman for her number / meeting for coffee etc. before and it worked. When I asked her when she would have time for it she said she **might** got time on thursday. (This and next week we bove got exams in shool so we are quite busy). 

On wendsay I texted her if she got time for thursday but then she postponed me and said that we **might** could meet on monday because she need to do stuff and also want to meet up with some friends before she will drive home to her parents in the school holidays. She said she will definitely let me know if she got time short-temed and if not then we could meet at the end of the school holidays (In about 1 and a half months).

My actual question now is. I know its not a good sign if she postpone the meeting but she got a valid reason. If she postpone me again I think its quite akward if you dont see that person for over a month and then text her if she got time now. 

Should I text her in the holidays a few times? Im just horrible at Smalltalk stuff and never know what to text a girl on Phone. (Also I didnt texted with her at all beside the question when she got time).

Don't really want to tell my friends about this, so I thought I'd try here.

I  matched with Sarah on an app almost a year ago and at that time she had  just broken it off with this guy, the main reason being he is religious  and wanted her to move in with him and his parents. This was a  dealbreaker for her, but I think maybe she had strong feelings for him  or even loved him not sure.

We've  been dating, but it's been patchy. This is mainly due to covid lockdown  and at times I didn't see her for months on end, although we did talk  almost every day, due to a lack of physicality, it kind of felt more  like a friendship. Since April and restrictions lifting we've been doing  really well, normal dating stuff and I feel like I'm really getting on  with her.

Anyway the one thing I  kept saying was that she was very guarded emotionally and finds it hard  to express herself. She was basically left at the altar and has had some  bad experiences with guys, including being sexually assaulted, so I  just gave her time.

She also finds  it hard to end things, so with the religious guy she has tried to end  things with him multiple times, but he is I guess tenacious? Finally he  has now said he is willing to change things, and not have her move in  and wants her back. I guess it's like he can't live without her, and  that's a big deal?

She told me she  knows she has to make a decision between this guy and me. I don't know  what to do, I feel terrible, though I try to keep looking strong. Should  I just leave the situation? Should I stick around and just keep going  with what I'm doing? I stopped talking to other girls maybe 2 months  ago, just because I didn't feel like it.

I  don't know why she has two guys in her life? If it was me and I'd be  like well I like this guy more? Maybe women don't work that way? I  really don't know, any advice or words would be helpful

thank you

I'm a 20m and have never been in a serious relationship before. Around 2 weeks ago, I met this girl through my summer job and I more or less instantly started crushing hard on her. In the beginning our conversations flowed naturally, I'm introverted but am good at listening, relating and asking followup questions and she couldn't stop talking so we were a good match. She was also really flirty, but I've later learned that she's like that with everyone. Anyway as our friendship grew she became less talkative which is difficult for me since I'm mediocre at starting conversations. Nevertheless we were still having fun and I remember her saying that we get along extremely well (basically I started talking about my parents and she thought it was cute that we were in ""that state"" of our friendship). Anyway, I start noticing that she's being very inconsistent in her interactions with me, from cold to passionate.

At this point I start getting kind of jealous, I notice that she's still being really social with other people while being more reserved around me so I'm starting to think she dislikes me. I distinctly remember one event that broke me pretty bad, basically we do promoting which means that we stand outside and try to sell products to passerby's. I had had a horrible day at work (0 sales in 90F from 10:00-18:00), this day we had stood together. I was so done, and the only thing I was looking forward to was talking with her on the bus ride home. On the station she had to take a call and she made plans to see one of her guy friends (not romantically) that evening and that fucking killed me inside. There I was, after a horrible day hoping for some consolidation / something to take my mind off work and she was speaking to some other dude. I'm usually not possessive but that made me feel sooo bad. The fact that she was very aware of how bad my day had been, but still decided to not even try was the worst. The ride home was very quiet. 

Anyway, I shook it off and we had a really fun time the next day. She keeps being really inconsistent, one moment she acts like we're best friends while the other she's talking about how many other friends she has. At this point, my mind is starting to think that she's just confusing and that it's probably just better to leave her alone, but my heart is still drawn to her. 

Come yesterday. We were supposed to have a big afterwork party/dinner. Me and this girl decided to meet up at the train station to get there together. Our ride was really fun (although in retrospect, we probably ended up talking a bit too much about her anxiety which could have made her uncomfortable, although she didn't act like it). Anyway, once we get there she starts drinking like a maniac, which is fun at first (but weird since she really isn't the type that drinks). After a while she starts talking to anyone and everyone (but me) which is making me feel more and more left out. At this point I'm still crushing hard on this girl, and although my mind is telling me it's not worth it my heart is screaming her name. I end up getting extremely jealous and try to brush it off by talking to other people and leave her alone. I figure that she probably doesn't like me, and I shouldn't barge in and interrupt her conversations just because of my insecurities (although it's really difficult). I try to interact with other people but I can't keep my mind off of her so all my interactions become very shallow and I start feeling very alone. As the night continues she drinks more than she can handle and becomes really sick. After a while of playing parent, I'm tasked with bringing her home which is sort of annoying cause I wanted to stay longer. Still, my dumbass sees it as a big W since it's  a chance to get to know her better, and walking a girl home is always fun.

As we get on the train she leans her head on my shoulder only to find herself and straighten up. The ride home was generally really cozy. On the way toward her place she's very talkative and goes on about the weirdest things like how she wants to ""be in a fistfight"" and ""wet her bed again before she dies"". These stupid rants are kind of what made me fall for her in the first place so I'm feeling somewhat whole again. Anyway, I leave her at her door with a hug and she apologizes for getting so drunk.

I honestly have no idea how to read this girl, one second it feels like we've been lifelong friends and the other it feels like she doesn't even care to acknowledge my existence. I feel like such a fucking ""support"" it's insane. Personally, I'm so emotionally invested in this relationship that I can't get an objective view of it. I love being supportive, and it feels good that she can rely on me, but at the same time I feel like I'm being manipulated. Something that really weirds me out about her is that she's really not the manipulative type as far as I can tell. If anything she seems really genuine most of the time. Basically, is she interested? and if not, how do I get over her???

 I'm happy to answer any questions.

Due to the complete lockdown here, we couldn't do anything so we just kept it at texting/calling. We text every day, and in the last 6 months have not missed a single one. 

But here is where I don't know what the hell to do. I took her out about a month ago, and we had a great time together. But due to her getting close to graduating, she wanted to wait until that was done before the 2nd date. So back to texting/calling we went. She recently graduated and now we've planned the 2nd date.

But here's the thing. First, I have to initiate everything. The calling, the date planning, ideas for dates, etc. She NEVER initiates anything, except for texts. I have tried the whole ""Put the ball in her court"" thing, and she'll text me if I don't text her. So at least she does that. She always asks questions and wants to keep the conversation going. But next to that, nothing.

Secondly, she DOES wants to go on dates. If I proposed a spot to go to after her graduation, she'd agree and tell me that sounds like fun. Before anybody says anything, yes I do explicitly tell her DATES. So no ""friend zone"" or whatever. I should probably mention she's not the kind of girl to do such a thing. She's really down to earth and sweet. Her dating profile also has gone inactive for quite some time, so I'm taking that as a sign she isn't seeing anybody else. I also asked her to be upfront and honest about everything at the start, which she agreed to.

So I'm super stressed about this. I really want this to work, but I can't by the life of me tell if she's interested. If she's still texting you after 6 months, that got to mean something right? Am I in the wrong for expecting ""more"" after that amount of time? I know I haven't seen her in real life that much, but if it wasn't for the complete lockdown, I would've asked her out way, way sooner.

Sometimes I just want to straight up ask her how she feels, but then I read ""No! Never do that!"" online.  I read all these posts about ""If she's the one, you'll know it! She'll do everything to see you!"" and that makes me even more conflicted. Why won't she initiate anything, or show any signs of interest, but still wants to go on dates that last 6 hours?

First of all, this might be pretty long, so if you are in a rush, you better hop to the TLDR at the bottom ! 

I have been thinking about posting this for a long time, and this is really important for me (for obvious reasons), so I really appreciate that you are taking some of your time to help me. 

## Let me give some context :

She is a 20 y/o biology student, hard worker, good education from a traditional family, the perfect student style. 
I am a 22 y/o engineering student, sometime in classes, mostly in parties (before covid of course), not really the perfect kid, however I have a good education, and everybody is seeing me as a smart guy. 

We met roughly one year ago, she was recently out from her previous relationship and her roommate wanted to change her mind. Her roommate was dating a friend of mine at the time and we ended up all four at the local bar. 
After a few drinks, some music, we ended up kissing each other the first night. 
After a week of texting, flirting, and some dates, we ended up at my place and had amazing sex. 
This was my first time and second kiss.
I was her second sexual relationship and fourth kiss. We were both inexperienced.

You have to know that at that time, even if I was a virgin, I didn’t want to have a exclusive relationship. I was mostly looking for hookups as I travel a lot and am only 40% of my time in the city where I work. This was one of the first things that I told her, and she agreed and that is why we continued. 

After 4 month of hooking up regularly (and despite of what I wrote just above) I decided to be with her as a couple. This decision has been made with three factors : 

1. I felt there was something more 
2. Covid made me stay 100% in my city so that would not be a LDR half of our time. Also it was convenient to spend the lockdown with some company 
3. She was pressuring me to be with her. Even if I specified I was only here for hookups at the beginning, what she ever wanted was an exclusive relation

So here I am, in a relationship, who would have guessed ? 
And you might be asking yourself, what is going wrong ? This looks like a perfect story ! 

Don’t be so impatient ! I’ll get to it…

The problem is divided in two parts : the emotional and the sex 

## The emotional part :

This part is mostly pushed by my gf. I feel like she emotionally gives much more than me, and she gently tries to make me feel bad for this so I will give her what she wants. It might be hard to understand, but here is some examples : 

-She told me she loved me around 1 month after meeting me, while we were not in a clear relationship. I waited 5 month and she was trying to make me feel bad for not telling her that I love her 
-For personal reasons, I don’t want to introduce her to my family. However, she told about me about her whole family even before we were together, she tries to make me feel bad about me not wanting us to go public. She refers to that at least twice a week and show me that it hurts her. 
-She always wants us to show that we are a couple and I don’t want to. I am not ashamed, it’s just that I don’t like to show off. 

## The sex part : 

This is the part where it is blocking for me, and I will be 100% honest, which is not really easy ! 

At the beginning, when we were hooking up, everything was perfect. But with the time, the new experiences has been rarer and rarer, the routine installed, and the time between two sexual encounters became longer and longer. 

I have a pretty high sex drive, so I quickly got back to my old single activities (porn, masturbation, etc …) to release the pression at least once a day while some weeks we only had sex once. She is aware of it but this is still not normal (in my opinion) at a such recent stage of a relationship. 

In the end, I don’t think I am made for exclusive relationship. I tried to talk to her about threesomes, swingers, etc… but it’s a total no go. 

And this is where it blocks, as I said before, she is my first sexual relationship. I am young, probably addicted to discovering new things, and I don’t want to stay (sexually) with the same woman my whole life. 

The question is : am I able to change ? Because I feel like she will never change on that topic. 

##Where you have something to do !

If I told you all this, it is because I am facing a dilemma… and a pretty simple one (ironically) :

Should I break up with her as soon as possible, or should I wait and try to arrange things knowing that I will hurt her even more if I have to break up ? 

If you made it this far, I really thank you for reading this and see you in the comment section to have a discussion ! 

Cheers, 

H4

For background we are both 20, but he will be 21 very soon though. We matched on Bumble (I have now stopped using the app) a month ago and everything was going so well. Replied to my text in a timely fashion despite working multiple jobs, staying active, having an avid social life, etc and apologized if he had taken a bit long to get back to me. We realized early on that we had a lot in common and he told me multiple times about how much he enjoys the time we get to spend together. We went on what I would call creative dates. Our first date was pretty run-of-the-mill lunch date but the second and third dates is what really had my interested. He took my to a park with old WWI monuments and then next week he took me to an arboretum, even being so much of a gentleman as to leave a $20 tip in my name. It was great and I seriously appreciated the time we spent together. Fourth date I took him out to dinner and to the mall and he was quite taken aback, in a good way of course, by how I had paid for our meals since no one else had ever offered to do that. I loved our deep conversations and we both geeked out on similar things. We share the exact same sense of humor and I felt like spending my time with him was such a good investment of my time (that sounds kind of cocky, I apologize but that’s the best way I can explain it). 

I highly considered having him in my life (if we would’ve made it official, it would be my very first relationship and he’s aware of that) but a couple days ago he just disappeared and went off the radar. I wasn’t freaking out texting/calling him or anything but I was the last person to send a text and it was asking him about his work schedule for the weekend (keep in mind this is Thursday night). He didn’t respond. I texted him the following morning telling him I hope his day goes well since Fridays for him are rough. He typically works 15-16 hour days on Friday so I wanted to wish him well. Well, it’s Sunday morning and still radio silence. I’m just confused at this point, not even hurt or offended because when someone just drops communication like that it’s a massive turnoff and I get over it very quickly, despite how nicely it was going.

Basically, I’m not hung up over it, but I just want some answers. What went wrong and how could this be troubleshooted for the future? He was mainly the one initiating the dates until I told him I’d like to plan the fourth one and now nothing... I don’t imagine I said anything that potentially set him off. The last two things I texted him about, minus the texts I talked about earlier, was about my mom potentially having COVID (I only told him this because if she has it, I’m going to quarantine myself since I live with her and we may not see each other for a little while) and me talking about getting a bit more “physical,” not sexually, but about him playing with boundaries and him touching me more (I made another post about this and I’ll link it right [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/oigto8/physical_touch/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf), please read for context). 

I just want to get down to the bottom of this and see what happened and how this could be fixed when I meet someone else new. But I also do recognize that people can be very flaky despite showing a loyal side of them and it could purely be on him. Not sure. Can I get some insight on this please?

We met about 6 months ago and it took me a while to get here because I needed my passport and to get some things in order. We have maintained a very romantic relationship in all of our talk and texts leading up to this but now, there’s a lot less of that. Which could definitely just be my own unwillingness to put myself out there out of fear of rejection.

I arrived here on Wednesday night and they met me at the airport. We have had really good chemistry when it comes to talking and hanging out. Very friendly and fun. 

What I think is really strange is that I’ve now been here for 4 days, the last 3 of which we’ve had sex, but we’ve still never kissed. 

This all seems backwards to me. I like to kiss. I like romance. And I think it’s weird when I’ve cum inside someone but never locked lips. It worries me. Do they feel like they have to have sex with me because I traveled all this way to meet them (especially when we’ve talked so explicitly about sex since we first met)? Are they willing to do that but don’t feel enough of a romantic connection to want to kiss?

I remember maybe a week before I left for my trip, we were talking about what it would be like when I finally got there after waiting all this time. They asked me “what’s the first thing you want to do to me?” I said that I would want to kiss them. They said “of course that, but what’s the first thing after that?”

This is funny to me now, but also sad. Because I’ve done some stuff with this person sexually that I’ve never done before. And here I am wanting so badly to kiss them but feeling worse and worse as time goes on. Feeling like it’s becoming like less of an option with the more time that passes. And I still have 2 weeks here, so I don’t know what to do.

TL;DR I traveled 3000 miles to finally meet someone that I’ve been talking to for 6 months (met online). We get along great. We have had sex 3 days in a row now but still haven’t kissed.

Instantly there was a great connection and she speaks fluent English. Eventually we had a great first date no sex but we did get intimate.  She said she had a great time and looking forward to seeing me next,

The second date comes along, and I was abit more nervous this time as we wasn’t drinking but the second date was even better, no sex again. But very close so with her withholding sex I thought she would like something more serious so I thought great. She text me when she was home saying she had a great time. 


The next day I did text her a bit too much because of me being excited to see her again but she tried to call it of on Tuesday so I faced timed her and we sorted things out and all is well again and she tells me she been in a lot of failed relationships, she is scared of getting feelings for me, so I backed off that week and thought I won’t put any unwanted pressure on her.

She calls me up again and one things leads to another and tells me she wants to have sex with me, so to me everything feels fine. fast forward to last weekend when I try to plan out 3rd date she calls it of.

I get and apology text saying that she thinks I’m great but she scared of affection  and I shouldnt be with. Someone who runs away like a little scared girl and admits she a little messed up. wishes me all the best 

I sent  her a message saying I think she just overthinking things and needs to relax. I haven’t heard from her since,  she goes on holiday next month and I have a trip at the end of the month also . I’m moving on with my life  and will date other women. 

But could this be still repairable? I was not going to message her for a month and maybe send her another message and take it from there.

I am 39 F and would say I have had a mixed bag when it comes to relationships. My first important one was from age 22 to 24 with my eldest child dad and we both had fitted that we should have just been best friends (well besties who got drunk one night and made our child). He had many an issue and, very sadly died 3 years ago, wed been apart over 10yrs but still very very close. When we were together he made effort for me to feel beautiful and sexy and loved during the good 1st half. The next half was just trying to admit we both wanted out but with a newborn you try longer than you should sometimes. 

Next was my husband. I met him 3 months later. We were together 10yrs and had a son after 5yrs and got married. This relationship was not good. I am an honest person and, naively, assume others are too. He used this and bullying to be eg.egularly unfaithful. I did not feel loved, special or important. I was told I was useless and stupid and a psycho etc. I liken this to the frog in the water.... if you pop a frog in boiling water it will jump out whereas if you pop it in cold water and s.owly turn up the heat it will just sit there and cook. Anyway, I started to gain a little confidence through studying as I realised I was not stupid and, eventually, kicked him out. I did have and, still do, have hang ups from this time. I was so very unhappy and felt truly worthless  I have never felt more alone in my life and it pretty much broke me.

Then, I met a guy.... total opposite to the husband.... who let me be me and helped me to heal. I trusted him... very much a new feeling for me and I have to say once you've experienced a relationship with complete trust you will not put up with less. It was,  obviously, a huge thing for me and blew me away. However, turned out he was  not actually the good guy I believed and that ended after 1.5ys.

Since then I have had the odd online dating chat and a couple dates but never really had any interest. Over the last 2yrs I have had several periods of 3 months or so where I've gone nowhere near a dating site, I just couldn't be bothered. I realised that I would rather be alone than be unhappy coupled up.

Then, around a month ago I was having my quarterly flit through a dating app and received a message from  a guy not to far away and just a couple years older. We've been seeing one another since. We chat and joke and it seems pretty easy. I dont think he would lie or mistreat me. He seems like a great dad too. He was I  a 16yr relationship he later. He is fairly placid so he just kept his  mouth closed  it seems where she spoke to him like an inconvenience, someone to drive her around d and pay the bills. He wasn't really loved or appreciated it sounds. Due to this be has a lot of self doubt and doesn't have a very high opinion of himself.

My concern here is that he seems to be falling hard. He is very vocal about it. That is nice, of course it is nice, but I am  not quite there yet. I like him but I find him very very intense with this stuff. He had told his ex and kids he was seeing someone already... he did it after 1 week and 3 dates... I am just struggling to think how to put it to him that I need him to chill out because I am feeling a lot of pressure. I like him, I could fall in love.

I'm fun, exciting, and can keep the conversation going while having them laugh, and blush without too much effort. Every weekend I'm trying something new or doing something interesting that I enjoy. Unlike most guys here, I'm entirely content with being single and value my alone time as opposed to filling that void with meaningless social interactions. Now like I said in previous posts, I'm a very attractive young man, with quite a handful of people that I consider my friends. 

Now that that's out of the way. Enjoying the challenge of dating is half the fun. Getting rejected is exciting, and kind of a rush in a sense! Just last week, I even downloaded 6 dating apps to supplement my day game since everyone knows most dating apps are flooded with men, the competition is fierce! 

**Here's where the issue comes into play.** 

Shoveling through all of the turds to scoop up some diamonds has only happened basically once since I began dating. I've met some really cool ladies, but none of them were really interested in taking it further than a little flirtation here and there, (just for validation I guess). Only a few were actually somewhat out of my league in terms of social status, but nothing drastically different. Even so, they carry themselves like they're 4+ above their actual number. So basically, in reality, and virtual life there's a bunch of 4's running around really believing that they deserve much, much more than they can actually get. *Actively avoiding these women is little to impossible.* I mean, I can't believe the number of women with that suffocating, inflated ego prancing around, using social, and dating apps for validation, demanding much more than they 'deserve', and emitting the most toxic aura I've ever seen.

Luckily a few diamonds in the rough restored my hope in humanity as a whole, but **my god** I feel sorry for other men out there that believe they have to put up with that! Being a young man in this market is **rough,** not that I don't love the challenge, but repeatedly dodging all of these crazy idiots is just tiring. I haven't even got more than 2 dates this year.  I work 40hrs a week, I don't have time for that bs, it's either you're in, or you're not.  If you're not in, I couldn't care less what you want, or think as opposed to my fair expectations, they never surprise me with how much they fail.  I'm not gonna lie, I used to have an optimistic mindset, but excuse me if I'm more cold, and calculated, but meaningly fair from now on. 

(If you're thinking that I hate women, hate is a strong word, I like everyone equally, if anything, I can't help but be more less tolerant of these women in general with their impossible expectations.

Some of them lie to get their way (either because they feel they have to, because they suck as people and lack enpathy, or haven't grown up enough)

But what about women? Is every girl looking to turn every good catch into ""prince charming who checks all the boxes""? 

I'm divorced, i was married from 25-29 (probably not the best schematic but here we are) 
I am now 32, after  a marriage and 1 relationship i was ready to be on my own. It's been a solid year where I was just on my own. But here's the thing I'm not at the point where I'm ready to just jump into something long term all over again. I'm sort of in an in between stage where I would like to date have fun meet people and not really have any extra committal expectations. But it seems that almost any woman I meet that's over 25 thinks I'm the next one for the long term relationship bus (despite my leading with, yea I'm still figuring it out, not ready for that). Now I know the obvious answer is that I should aim at younger women. But while I take care of myself and I look good for my age, I simply don't appeal to younger women. 

So what are my options? Do I have to conform for something I'm not ready for? Because the climate isn't flexible (that sounds like a recipe for disaster). 

I asked a really close friend of mine the same question (I usually value her directness brutal honesty and comedic with). This is the way she answered

""You have an awesome personality, That’s what leads. Your height is second, Your body... then your smile,That’s your traits in priority. You make them feel good. You’re not really “sexy” like that (for them to just want to sleep with you and not take you seriously) They are always going to want to husband you up. You’re way too nice. In order for women to want to just hook up with you and use you for a good time, You’d have to change your vibe. You’d have to pull back significantly, Less words, less interaction, Less care. It’s not you, you’re not sexy, You’re lovable."" 

I don't know if she's right, and I take her words with a grain of salt. But it does make me wonder if there's any truth to this when it comes to women.

Friday night, we were both out and about and were talking like normal. She asked if I was okay (we were both out drinking with friends) and I said I was hanging by a thread. She told me ""nooo stay alive please"" and the conversation continued for a while longer after that then stopped. It was a good flirty convo for sure. She opened the last message I sent that night in the morning because she likely went to sleep. 

I sent a mass snap of me and my friends at the lake yesterday. She opened it and didn't reply. On her private/regular stories, she had posted about her being frustrated/family drama going on. To be honest I have no clue what happened because I didn't ask. 

She likes to dance. On our date a couple weeks ago, we went out and then came back to my place. She taught me how to ""half step"" in my living room and we danced for a while then cuddled watched a movie and had a hot make out sesh. Last night, I went salsa dancing. I sent her a selfie of me and the caption said ""first half stepping, now giving salsa dancing a try. Wish me luck!!"" (I was trying to Refer to when we danced in my living room) She read it and didn't reply. 

I don't know if I am over analyzing this or not but she's never left me on read like that before. On Wednesday, we were texting and talking about making plans for another date. She is traveling out of town the next 4 weekends and she's been talking about it for a while and I know she's being honest about that. She told me ""we will find time though"". 

After our last date I texted her wanting some clarification as to where we were at. Neither of us are wanting to commit right now (she's 20 and I'm 23), but she told me that she wanted to see me again. She also explicitly said she isn't friendzoning me and wants to go on more dates. I ended that conversation with ""I think what we've been doing is great &amp; id like to continue this if you do as well"". She said ""yes I would love that too"". 

We used to have a really long snap streak but that got broken. Idk if that's something worth mentioning. Since she opened my last 2 snaps, I feel like i should back off a bit. 

After maybe 2-3 days (if I don't hear from her at all) I may just reach out and say ""hey how are you? Haven't heard from you in a while and just wanted to check in and make sure you're okay"" or something.

We decided to get dinner at a restaurant that we both like. I picked her up at her place. I sat around while she finished up getting ready to go. 

Dinner went great. I felt like at first both of us were unsure how to proceed. After a while though we were laughing and joking with each other like we usually do.

She asked me when I first started liking her and I admitted that I’d always thought she was pretty even back in high school. She told me in high school she thought I was obnoxious even though she thought I was cute. I laughed at this and told her she was right. I was obnoxious in high school. Then I told her I really started liking her as more than a friend at a concert we both went to a couple years ago. So I asked her when she started liking me.

She said it was a few years ago at the same concert. Me and a group of my friends ran into her and my sister. We got separated from everyone for a while and she and I hung out and talked most of the night. I gave her a ride home after the concert. She said that night she started to like me as more than a friend.

When we finished dinner I could tell neither of us wanted the date to end so I suggested we drive around for a while so we could talk some more. We talked about our jobs, my hunting for a house and her search for a new car. We ended up at this place with batting cages, go karts and mini golf and spent the rest of the night doing all that stuff. I forgot she played softball in high school and this girl raked in the batting cages!

At the mini golf place we started holding hands as we went from activity to activity. We finished the night by having ice cream cones. While we sat there she rested her head on my shoulder and said she’d had a great time. I told her I did too and I hoped I’d earned another date. She said of course we’re going out again. Finally she said I’d better take her home. The mini golf place was getting ready to close and she had to work Sunday morning.

So we walked out to my truck holding hands. Once we got in the truck she grabbed me and we kissed. I felt great driving her home. She kissed me again before she got out of my truck and told me to call her Sunday evening.

I was a bitter angry hateful troll who lurked here for years. I left nasty comments in reply to anyone who threw the age old advice of ""OP WORK ON YOURSELF FOR GOD'S SAKE!""   


I was like oh yeah? I never tried that buddy!!! You all are full of shit buckos fuck all of you!!!

""DATING ONLY WORKS IF YOU TRY TO DATE AND LOOK FOR PARTNERS!!! MEN DONT FALL FROM THE SKY I KNOW THIS!!!!""  


Obviously you dont sit on your ass and use law of attraction to manifest a partner into your living room right??? RIGHT????  


I was so jaded. Thought I was gonna die alone. Ugliest piece of worthless shit on the planet. So fat. Cant work out enough. So horrible. No social skills. Poor me. Poor poor me. Woe was all me.  


All the dudes on tinder and okcupid wanted to do to me was use me as a living fleshlight  for one night then ghost me after  


I had attended weekly therapy session since I was 15 and did so for 11 years. 

I attended groups for people with relationship issues  


Paid for courses and mentoring on healthy relationships  


Read thousands of self help books.  


I was working on myself. I WAS. I was doing my best.  


  
Until one day I finally snapped. and said you know what if I am meant to die alone I will. I am open to it now.  


One of my buds used to say ""say so what to your fears. Say ""So fucking what?"" any time you  have a fear and keep repeating that till you realize the fear is lame as fuck""  


So I die alone. SO WHAT? Its lame? SO WHAT? It's pathetic? SO WHAT? I will be miserable? SO WHAT? Its uncomfortable ok? SO WHAT? Well I guess I have been uncomfortable before and had shitty things happen to me so its not that bad I guess?  


So I gave up. And committed myself to dying alone and single. Deleted all the apps from my phone.  


and in a roundabout twisted way I did end up focusing on myself lo and behold. and this time not  to get a partner.  


&amp;#x200B;

I made myself my own priority for once in my whole life. Learned some new hobbies and skills. Got into painting and writing. Had my work shown in galleries made some money. Got published in some magazines and poetry collections.  


Spent the whole pandemic alone utterly alone. Day in and day out. Fell deeply deeply deeply in love with myself and solitude. Meditated for hours. Sometimes cried and cried for three days cleaning up all my childhood trauma. Read more and more books. Went for nature walks. Went hiking. Walked on the beach went for swims. Took myself out on dates. Ordered italian on uber eats and made myself a candle lit dinner date.  


I am not gonna say I wasnt lonely or horny. Or didnt cry myself to sleep some nights.  


but being alone felt good. I was the type of self hating freak who couldnt spend 5 minutes alone without wanting to off myself let me tell you. Meditation forced me to sit still with my self hatred and evil thoughts. And hatred for the rest of the world.

&amp;#x200B;

some days if I went out if I saw a happy couple I would want to collapse on the pavement sobbing and cursing the world and God  for denying me that happiness because I wasnt worthy.  


So I youtubed what do if you feel jealous cause of other people's love. And a youtuber say start blessing them and praying for them and being happy for them. And I did do that. and It worked and helped a lot and made me a better person who is able to feel happy for others instead of being jealous bitter and hateful.  


You can enter any phrase you want on youtube and someone has made a video on it. You can enter any problem on google and someones written books on it.

Start looking up every problem you have on the interwebs people have worked through the exact same problem before and here to  teach you how to work through it yourself now.  


so eventually since lock down lifted a bit I started hanging out with more friends and making new friends here and there  


I met my current long term commited partner that way. Organically. No dating app. In person. We weree great friends first then partners next. As I think is the best way really.

&amp;#x200B;

It worked out. I took the advice every one on this sub repeats like a fucking broken record to bitter people and it worked. I am sorry comrades and fellow trolls I hate to let you down. But this advice of focus on yourself really works.  


you should always work on yourself. even if you have your soulmate beside you. It never ends. But you have to be wiling to start. For yourself. Not to catch a mate.

It seemed mutual at first, she would actively reach out to me and engage with me. 

Until one day, early in our program, it turned sour.  Every time we would go out there would be a strong but tensions energy between us. Like when we went out in a group she would maintain closeness to me, but she would also have an attitude about it most times. Or if we were in a group she would say things to get on my nerves, which it would. However when we were alone, she would be pretty calm and pretty nice. And when we were on a break, apart from each other, she would Snapchat me and share what she was doing unprompted. 

This behavior made it hard for me to connect with her like I wanted because I thought she was always being hot and cold. I didn’t understand her behavior and never knew how to react besides ignore her sometimes. But I’ve recently heard that women test the guys they like by behaving this way and getting on their nerves to see how they react or they like you and don’t want you to know it because it makes them feel vulnerable. Is this true? 

If so, is it too late to connect with her and pursue a relationship with her? I still feel how I felt about her when I met her, but  It’s been over a year since we graduated with only occasionally chatter between us.

Where the information that particular day was so crucial it was hard to continue without having been there. Obviously there is no such day in school where you’re taught how to flirt, but I feel like I really missed the boat on that somehow. 

For clarity I’m a 30 year old male in the US. Flirting just feels so unnatural and I really don’t get what I’m supposed to be doing. I’m a bit more introverted by nature, not shy by any means but just quiet in social situations. This changes a bit when it’s 1 on 1, but even then I’m not a flirt at all unless I’m already involved with someone. I suppose my way of flirting and or being funny is just being really goofy, but doing that with someone I’m not very close and comfortable with feels like trying to speak a foreign language. My way of communicating interest has always been very direct, ie telling someone I’m interested in them. Obviously this almost never works. 

It’s frustrating because once I’m “in” I do really well and everything feels very natural. The banter only comes after I’m well acquainted with them. Now that I think about it, it’s only come after I’ve had sex with them. But getting there and gaining a woman’s interest has always been a wall for me. A wall in which I can only climb with rope I never have. Im also not an overtly sexual person until it’s “safe” to express myself that way either. I’ve gotten lots of dates in the real world but they havent gone anywhere because I haven’t been able to create the spark on the front end of things. The 2 real dating experiences I’ve had came from tinder and I saw both women for a good amount of time. I know from those experiences that I do have a lot to offer and have learned some of my weaknesses as well. 

All that being said, I’m not sure how much better I’ll get at this. There is one improv class locally that I do plan on attending. Unfortunately I missed the last signup and there are only 3 or 4 signups a year. This is the only route out of this I can see and I’m excited to see the potential results.

I’m researching for an upcoming video on the challenges/misconceptions adult industry workers encounter when dating – (for my new matchmaking company “The Little Glass Slipper”) – and wanted to check in here with you gals and guys in the industry to see if I’m on the right track. Are there are things I might want to add to the list? Or any stories that you guys have that I can share? Basically, any input would be much appreciated! xoxo!

Challenges/Misconceptions:

\-People thinking you’ll “put out” right away, or take them on as a client if things don’t work out

\-People thinking that you want to be saved from your occupation

\-Being seen as emotionally damaged (beyond the average person)

\-Not being taken seriously/seen as relationship material/someone to bring home to family &amp; friends

\-People not getting that your work is just work. It’s fantasy work, and not reality

\-STD Stigma

\-Being seen as nymphomaniacs/always in the mood for sex

\-Potential partner thinking that you won’t have energy for intimacy with them

\-People thinking that your occupation is your only interest; (no hobbies, spirituality, goals, etc.)

\-People thinking that you’re morally bankrupt

\-People thinking that you can make them money

\-People thinking that they’re the only one “willing” to date you

\-Potential partners expecting that you’ll perform for them in the same way you perform at work – not getting the difference between sex/fantasy work and real intimacy

\-Potential partners thinking that they’re not experienced enough to satisfy your intimacy needs

\-Finding someone who’s secure with themselves and trusting

\-People thinking that your workplace is a good place to meet you 

\-People thinking that you have daddy issues, drug problems, or lots of drama (beyond the average person)

\-People assuming you’re up for a polyamorous relationship",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,905353,public,self,Challenges and Misconceptions Adult Entertainers Have to Deal with When Dating,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/omw4qh/challenges_and_misconceptions_adult_entertainers/,all_ads,6,dating
