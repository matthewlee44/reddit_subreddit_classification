1,roi905,1640469066,He (28m) did not message me / contact me (25f) after our first phone call,"I (f 25) have been talking to a guy (28 m) for the past 2 weeks. I live in the Netherlands, and he lives in Germany, so we're rather close, but not nearly as close as we could be. We have never met in person. Just for some additional information, we are both very good-looking and accomplished people. We had been following one other on social media for about a year when I eventually responded to his direct message and we began chatting. I've been really enjoying our discussion; we get along well so far, he is funny, and asks me meaningful questions, he hasn't said anything strange, he appears to be ideal on paper, and there has been a lot of flirting. I had already begun to like him and he is definitely boyfriend material. No red flags so far. At the beginning of this week, he seemed to really enjoy our conversation and so he asked if he could call me to hear my voice. I thought that was a great idea since it would allow me to get to know him better, see if there is a connection, and ultimately bring us closer together. As a result, we scheduled our first phone call for today. Prior to the call we were texting and he was replying instantly and I could tell he really likes me and was excited to get on a call.

As a result, he video calls me, but I decline and call him back using a regular call because I am not yet comfortable with video calls. The talk flowed despite the fact that I was asking most of the questions without giving him chance to ask me something (I was scared), and so I sort of dominated the dialogues, but my responses were extremely fascinating, we made jokes, laughed, and then he asked me about the video call again telling me he wanted to see me, I told him ""I'm not in the mood to do a video call right now, I thought we were just doing a call for today"" he replied ""hahaha okay okay no problem"" so he seemed very understanding. My plan was to make the phone call short and sweet leaving him wanting more. Therefore, after 30 minutes I said ""my aunt is calling me, I need to pick this up as she probably wants to wish me a Merry Christmas, but it was absolutely love speaking to you and we can chat later. I hope you have a good day"". He said: okay, you too have a good day.

I also told him I had plans later on with my family to cook and spend time with them and he was also with his family and grandparents. But he could have still sent me a sweet text as he was texting me early in the morning a lot while he was lunching with his grandparents and parents before we got on a call.

It's been 7 hours and he still hasn't replied to me which I find rather odd. I thought that maybe he would text me something later but nothing. I'm getting worried that maybe I did something wrong and he lost interest. Now I feel like I'll never hear from him again. What do you guys think? Am I overthinking? Maybe he is giving me the space to enjoy Christmas? Maybe we already spoke so what's the point in talking more today? I'm very upset as I really thought we were getting along well.

TLDR: I had my first phone call with a guy I've been talking to the past two weeks, things went well but he hasn't messaged me after our phone call.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/roi905/he_28m_did_not_message_me_contact_me_25f_after/

After being in a dating rut for a couple months, I decided to try a different approach. Earlier in the year I was taking things very slow with new dates. Never kissing before the third date, and only having sex around a month into seeing someone. Things just did not seem to be going anywhere with this approach.

The past 3 people I have started seeing, I initiate physical touch on the first date, and really try to show I’m interested in being a romantic partner immediately. This seems to have really captured potential partners attention much better. The connections I have had with this approach are much stronger, and the women seem to be chasing me much more.

Is this the same experience others have had? I feel like the slow game just was not working for me.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/roidw1/a_males_observation_in_the_modern_dating_scene/

16,rojv6w,1640474486,"How to interpret? “Friends, but more if it happens. Interested, but not trying to force anything”","So, for reference the guy does say on their profile they’re looking for friends/good vibes. We’ve hung out 5 times. They did use the term friends during our first hang out, but paid for the food/offered to pay for an Uber back for me, and made physical contact several times. 

Started hugging me on the second hangout, split the bill, offered to carry my bag.

On the third hang out hugged, paid for the food. Called me pretty.

Before the fourth date, I decided to text them asking their intentions and they said “friends first, but if it leads somewhere they are all for it. They are interested, but not trying to force anything.”

On the fourth hangout, we paid for our own food, watched Netflix in their basement, I did hear them lock the door (they live with family), but they didn’t try anything, hugged, grazed my fingers, gave me their jacket since it rained and I didn’t have anything to cover myself.

On the fifth hangout,they texted me the night before and said “they’d be home all day/won’t be working and if I’d be free to hang out.” When I met up with them they had a guy friend with them, which I was not expecting. I think maybe they might’ve apologized. I know the asked if I was angry. It’s still not clear to me whether they knew the night before that they would be hanging out with their friend. Played video games (he asked if I’d be interested in doing discord with him in the future), watched netflix, ate pizza, he tapped my knee slowly, like 5 times when I apologized for something and they were comforting me. Said “after you m’lady” when I went up the steps

Now, I know this is all very detailed (and possibly overly analytical), but as a woman with very little dating experience (early 20s,kissless virgin, only have met up with 3 other guys, each only once, did not date ever pre-covid)I don’t know how to interpret any of this. This is also the first time I’ve met up with someone from an app more than once. Initially, I took the friends/am interested as a soft rejection, but now idk. Then I’m not sure if maybe they just have me on standby while they pursue someone else (hence, why they haven’t kissed me)",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rojv6w/how_to_interpret_friends_but_more_if_it_happens/
17,rojyvz,1640474822,Is he in to me and should I say anything?,"I matched with a guy on Tinder a week and a half ago and we hit it off. We talked everyday throughout the first 4 days. After we got off work we’d be almost constantly chatting and usually stayed up after 11 talking. He initiated almost all the conversations and would message me good morning, make sure I got home safe when it snowed.

Tricky part, on the second day of talking we were just chatting about food and he tells me his life’s a bit complicated right now as him and his ex split but he’s staying over here at her parents place while they fix up the house to sell it so they can move on. The parents don’t know they’re split and they have a 2 year old. I knew about the kid and I have one too so not an issue. He wanted to be upfront, no funny business but he understood if I was uncomfortable. I’m totally fine and get it, doesn’t really bother me I know life’s complicated. He goes back weekends to work on house and it’s almost done but his ex and daughter came back this past weekend to stay at the parents place too for the holiday, of course parents don’t know they’re split. Talking has dropped waaaay off to like twice a day because while ex knows he’s on tinder he doesn’t want to be disrespectful which I also get.

My thing is he hasn’t flirted or asked for my number or really mentioned wanting to go out at any point. I’ve hinted at showing him around and he responded “ uh yeah! Don’t worry I expected that😛 don’t want to come on too strong” and then we were chatting and he said “ why do you have to be so cool? If you find a better guy on tinder can we still be friends? 😂” a week ago.

I really like him a lot and he’s easy to talk to which is rare for me, especially online. I really would like to meet him and see if it’s there in person too. I’m wondering if I’m just being an idiot and getting strung along? Like because he’s knew to the area and stuff I’m a distraction if he’s bored or if he’s simply taking his time because of his situation.

19,rok8tk,1640475726,Asking the right questions.,"I (30M) have been dating a really cute girl (27) for about a month now. 

Things were of to a great start. We were supposed to be FWB, but it escalated quickly because we matched on a lot of stuff. 

For a bit of background she is a mother of 2 kids, 3 and 8. She's been struggling mentally (depression) and physically (injuries). 

I myself am in a really good place now, and was happy even before meeting her. Sport/Work/Hobby/Friends, I'm in a really healthy routine, and I can project myself in the future and am building something out of my life. 

So pretty naturally I stepped up to help her on cleaning, tidying, cooking and other chores. Plus, even if I don't have kids on my own, I have a really good feeling with them in general and her kids love me,  I spend time with them and give them a lot of attention and am really playful. It's really a second nature to me. 

But I don't like to hide my feelings and I'm done playing games. I want to keep my healthy lifestyle/vibe I have going on, so I'm honest in my relationships. 

So I told her I started to caught feelings. 

And since then, something broke. 

We are about to have a conversation about our relationship. She told me things are going too fast for her, but she doesn't want me to disappear.

31,rolhm6,1640479891,More redflags? (Christmas version),"Hey guys,

I previously posted a separate request for advice about a guy I’ve been dating:

https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rnekla/redflags/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

Was just checking in with him and I was asking how his Christmas was going and he told me he was at home eating dinner alone lol Which is a little strange to me, hear me out: he told me he had plans last night for Christmas Eve with his parents who flew into town a few days ago to visit so I figured he was hanging out with them today as well, so I was surprised when he just told me a little while ago when I texted him that he was at home “eating pizza and drinking some wine” alone (well with his dog to be more exact). I asked him where his parents went and he told me they were visiting with other family in town (his moms sister/his aunt and his cousins and their families). I asked him why he wasnt there with his parents enjoying the Holiday with his cousins and the rest of the family and he told me, “Im not really close to them anymore”. So I asked him why and he said “We used to be when we were younger/kids, but just life I guess, just grew apart. Dont really have that much in common with them anymore, they’re all married and have kids and in another point in their lives. And we dont really keep in touch that much anymore to be honest or have any kind of a relationship really, so I really dont see the point. I don’t mind it, I had a good dinner with my folks last night, so that was nice.” So I asked him “but your parents still have a good relationship with them and maintain contact?” and he said “yeah, thats why they’re over there”. I also asked him about presents and he told me he didnt get anything lol because they didnt really do the presents thing since he was a kid.

Anyways, is this a redflag? Just think it’s a little weird he’d rather be on his own on Christmas rather than with the the rest of his family (even though he did have dinner with his parents last night). And it’s Idk it seems sad and lonely to me even though he says its perfectly fine to him.

I was thinking about inviting him over to my parents place where we’re having leftovers and chatting and having a good time with my siblings and their families (because I kind of feel sorry for him) but I think it’s too soon (because I havent introduced him to my family).

I know the guy is a bit of a loner or independent and an only child, but idk seems a little strange to me. he’s great and I like him a lot but sometimes I feel like hes a bit like Batman (he doesnt have a butler though lol), but yeah just too comfortable being lonely and distant from most people, I suppose.

First Christmas with my serious (I think) bf of one year and we spend Christmas separately. He goes home to be with family and I don’t have any family in the states so I do a warm beach Christmas vacation alone, using an excuse that I want to be alone for the holidays to de-stress. Anyway, on Christmas day, I texted him in the morning to wish him a merry Christmas but no response, so I call a couple hours later but he doesn’t pick up nor does he call back. So, being as upset as I am, I angrily text him that he is ignoring me and decide not to talk to him for a while until I figure stuff out. Am I just overreacting to all this and is it ok that he is too busy with family to call or even text me back when he knows I’m spending Christmas alone?

Only problem?

He's my friend's ex. They dated briefly, also off a dating app, before he said he couldn't catch feelings and left it at that. Oh, and also said he is emotionally unavailable and rarely catches feelings. So we barely talk for two hours and agree to be friends, mostly out of respect for my friendship. We continue talking and I feel something I haven't felt in years. You know, when you fall deep for someone you just met because they're the je ne sais quoi you were searching for for ages?

We couldn't meet due to the virus obviously but continued to talk and have ""online dates"" via video and just generally being on the phone together. Since then we've been on and off talking via messages but have never taken the plunge to meet for virus, busy schedules and I guess general dating nervousness reasons. 
I personally have been single for over 4 years now and haven't dated anyone in that time. I like her and think we'd be a perfect match once we get over that initial ""awkward"" date but that also scares me because my last relationship was around 4 years before my current single streak and I don't feel like I've achieved a proper ""single person"" life like casual hook ups and whatever. I'm not really that type of person but it's part of the reason I broke up with my ex because it was getting serious to the point where I didn't think I would ever get the opportunity to do those things before the cliche ""settling down"" (sorry for all the air quotes). 
Think I'm mostly in my head about this one but just wonder if anyone has been in a similar situation before or can provide an outside perspective.

43,romol9,1640484014,Did I scare him away for good? Will he come around with space. Is there anything I can do to fix this?,"
I (F26) Met guy(M26) about 3 months ago the beginning he was perfect. Pursuing me hard core. If anything he was moving a little fast; he was mentioning me meeting his family in the first week. He lets me stay at his house and sleep in even when he is at work, he has offered to give me money if I’m running low, I’ve met all his friends, met his boss etc. So a lot a “couple” type things. 
I was surprised when in week two I brought up exclusivity and he hit me with the “I’m not ready for a relationship” thing. I was OK with it because I realize that we’ve only known each other for two weeks. He also went on to talk about how he just got out of a relationship that lasted a year 5 months ago. I told him it takes me a while to decide on a relationship and I also got out of a relationship recently. 
So he continues pursuing me after that conversation but then I noticed he would do this thing where he would invite me to come spend the night with him but then last minute cancel because he was too tired. But then randomly he will contact me to go on these very “couple-like” dates. For example I went to meet his boss one evening. Then we go another few weeks of him being flakey with meeting up and then he invites me to come to dinner to meet his parents. 
So after I meet his parents I try to make plans with him the following weekend and he basically wouldn’t hold down any committed plans. But then last minute on a Friday night I run into him at a pub and he ends up taking me out to this super nice restaurant where we have a super romantic evening and he probably spent over $200 on me. It was nice but just out of nowhere. 

Then where the drama starts is the following week I try to make plans with him again and he basically did the same thing where he wouldn’t commit to a plan. I was upset with him and told him that I would like a little more time with him and he replies that he “isn’t ready for a relationship” I tell him that I am not asking for a relationship I would just like to spend more time together. Then a week later I ran into him at a party. The whole time we are getting along great and he is introducing me to a lot of his friends and then towards the end of the party I get really drunk and clingy. When I could tell he was getting annoyed with me I told him that I don’t wanna relationship and that we are both free to hang out with whoever we want and that I am going on dates with other guys myself and this whole time I’ve been seeing other guys. That is definitely not true and I don’t know why  said that.
The next morning I apologize to him and told him that we are both free to hang out with whoever we want but that he is the only guy  I’ve been hooking up with. He said it was OK. I tried to be casual and fun again and asked if he wanted to meet up with some friends of mine and he declined. I know he just started a new job so he’s busy with that but I would’ve thought he would’ve reached out to me by now as I haven’t heard from him in a week which is the longest we have gone.

46,roms4h,1640484335,(19m) can’t stop thinking about her past,"
Hi,

I met a girl about 2 months ago who is a really a nice person! However, I have a feeling that I am being used as a rebound and I just can’t stop thinking about her past.

She broke up with her bf earlier this year (January) and she was with him for 4 years. A few months later (May) she meets another guy who she had a summer fling with. She claimed it was fun but she would have never gotten with him. They are no longer together.

Fast forward to October, she meets me. Currently we’re friends but she has been wanting to meet me for a while now. She wanted to go out with me which we plan to do but I can’t help but think that I’m a rebound. She initiates almost everything which i find very odd since I’m not used to that.

The way I see it is that she had a LTR for 4 years and found another guy 4 months later and stayed with him in the summer. Shes created memories with two other guys who she loved/ liked where as I have never had that ever. Now that they aren’t together, I think that I am “next.”",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/roms4h/19m_cant_stop_thinking_about_her_past/

Who does this? I didn't ask further but he said he has no interest in dating her again. Okay. I do not care what genitals his friends have, and I don't wanna come off as controlling or getting into his business but I'm just curious because I'm looking out for my sexual health.

Didn't really take enough shots in high school which lead to me being single for those years. After HS and into college I felt like I didn't really have any opportunities to date since I didn't go to a college away from home and my hometown didn't really lend itself to a great dating scene, so yep somehow still managed to remain single. Its probably important to say that although I tried in HS and college I really wasn't putting enough effort into it and having a relationship wasn't what I was laser focused on. I continued to age with the opinion that I actually wanted to remain independent and single going forward.

Shorty after college I finally found myself in my first relationship after a female co-worker began making moves. The feeling was obviously mutual at the time but I ended it bcuz she traveled way too much. 

Anyways, now Im really kicking my self bcuz i've got a really really strong desire for a connection/relationship with someone im crazy about that I never fully established the first time. I wish I made more of an effort when I was younger. What was I thinking? Reading all these wholesome posts and stories has me feeling some type of way. 

So now im stuck trying to find someone in the midst of a pandemic. I've got myself on a few popular dating apps but am finding myself feeling hopeless after not getting any matches after the first few months. Fuck. Maybe I just need to convince myself that being single isn't so bad and the cards just aren't stacked in my favor.

62,rontb8,1640487881,Should i try to date strangers?,"I'm a very shy and antisocial person. Whenever I see someone that I'm interested in, all i can do is watch them from a distance and do absolutely nothing. I've never dated someone before nor have I kissed someone. I think that making out with a stranger or someone i barely know or have feelings for is futile and won't add anything in my life. And as i have communication problems i don't think I could pull that off even if I tried either. I'd like to date someone that understands me and loves me despite my flaws, but sometimes I feel like the perfect person doesn't exist and waiting for them would be meaningless. I usually just fall for a friend that i think would be a nice partner for me, but we usually end up being just friends. And i go on until I find a new friend and repeat the cycle.
So the question is: should i try to take the risk and date new people or should I be patient and wait for this ""true love"" to come?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rontb8/should_i_try_to_date_strangers/

About 6 months ago i met this guy online
We live pretty far away from each other and have never actually met. We started talking and really hit it off. Things seemed to be going pretty well we talked everyday and after a couple of weeks he said that he loves me
Since then things have changed he has been a lot busier with work, so we barely talk to each other these days andwhen we do it’s about him being so tired that he can’t talk much longer and has to go to bed
I try to understand that he is a responsible busy man but he doesn’t give me enough attention. When he’s not working he is drinking and gets way too drunk
I don’t think I’m asking for too much i just want him to pay a little more attention to me and we have talked about it but nothing changed.
He still says that he loves me but i find that a little hard to believe since he refers to me as his friend and that makes me so sad because I genuinely love him and want to be with him but that’s not possible right now.

We’ve spent the last week building furniture and we live about 2.5 hours away at the moment.

The only thing left to build is the wardrobe. She’s planning on coming up to the flat with her parents on Tuesday, to bring her stuff up and her dad is going to help build the wardrobe.

Our parents haven’t seen the flat yet, so I was planning to bring my parents up there on Monday, and she’s planning to bring hers up on Tuesday.

I suggested the idea to my parents today that they should stay over a night when they come on Monday just to experience it. Because the place where we are staying at now, is old compared to our new flat which is very modern. Just thought it would be nice for my parents to experience it for a day before we move in.

We currently have a sofa bed and I said I’d have to bring something to sleep on.

I told my GF my idea today, she didn’t like it at all. Said she wouldn’t feel comfortable having my parents sleep on our sofa bed, when the bed hasn’t arrived yet as we’d still be sleeping on it.

Then I said I can tell my parents to bring duvets etc to sleep on if she didn’t want them sleeping on our sofa bed. Then she said they have no reason to stay.

I felt a bit hurt by this, felt she’s rejecting them or have no respect for them.

Am I thinking or seeing it wrong? Or is she right?
I just thought it would be nice for my parents to stay there a night before she moves in otherwise it would be more awkward?

69,roog4r,1640490070,Should I Stay?,"So I (26M) and my girlfriend (28F) have been together for a little over 4 years. The majority of the begining of the relationship was long distance but we ended up living together for about the last year before i had to move out of the country (for work). We ended up having a lot of problems once we started living together. We weren't like we were before, and it wqs mostly my fault. I suffer from fairly severe depression and went through a really bad spot for a long time. I wasnt attentive. I was very distant and didnt put in nearly the effort i should have and ended up pushing her away. To make things worse, 2 days before i moved away i found out that she had been having a romantic relationship with someone else. Not physical as far as she says, and i believe her. I decided to not leave because i truely felt guilty. I felt i pushed her to this. Despite everything, she said she still wants to make things work. Fast forward to today. Ive been out of country for about a month. She hardly talks to me anymore, shes actively messaging other people while ignoring my messages, leaving me on read, etc. And the only times she does try to talk to me it always ends with her needing me to do something for her. Send money etc. Im beginig to think the only reason she wanted to stay together was to be taken care of financially. Ive made efforts to change (maybe too little too late) and often bring up that im doing things that she wanted to do with me. (Mostly outdoor stuff. Hiking etc.) To try and connect with her and show her im trying to change and be a better partner. But its just making her resent me more. I understand her reaction, but i feel like nothing i do can make up for before. The only emotion i feel from her since i left is resent. And i feel like nothing i do will make up for before. What do i do. Do i stay? And if so how doni bring up how im feeling without her feeling like im making excuses to leave her?

TLDR: I feel like my relationship is going to fail because i was a bad partner before i left the country and nothing I makes any difference in making up for it, and i dont know what to do.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/roog4r/should_i_stay/

I met a boy at an event (we are both 16), I was very attracted to him and we had a lot of things in common (we are both very passionate about music and really into post-punk), he showed interest in me in private (he replied to my ig stories all the time, texted me and paid attention to everything that I posted). Like a week or two after this event he went to a party with my friends and  he told them that he thinks im pretty and that he would kiss me. A week after this we (him, my friends and me) hanged out, it was the first time I saw him in person since I met him, and he treated me really bad (he interrupted me all the time, ignored me and told me that I wasn't funny)  but he also asked me to go get some beers to his grandma house, just the two of us (my friend, who I think is interested in him, said no and told him go with my friend whos a lesbian). After that day he started talking to me less, hardly replying my ig stories (but still doing it and treating me like usual, and he even recomended me music. Then we made a group chat with him and my friends so we could hang out in christmas, and in front of everyone he said that he thought I disliked him (sadly i have a rbf) and that he didnt like me because he didnt know me well, and that he only liked my friends (even when he talked with me more than with them).

My brother met a girl - tall, great conversationalist and outgoing - in a social soccer league. His team went out for drinks after a game and she was super friendly with him and told him about herself.  She is from Bolivia and immigrated here with a visitor visa 6 months ago, lives with her family and works in catering. Back in her home country she was a paralegal. My brother didn't read too much into the situation since he figured she was only being nice to me because he spoke a little bit of Spanish. However, she then asked him out to get drinks with her friends and he had a good time. They started hanging out after that - both in groups or just getting food occasionally.

They have hung out for a couple of months now - nothing has happened btw, as she thinks American dating culture moves too fast. Yesterday she told him she was undocumented over text. He didn't really know how to respond, so she continued and said that she feels really strong about him but doesn't want to do anything unless he can be absolutely certain he is okay with her situation. He actually moved on and thought they were just friends, so he started talking to another girl in the league. She noticed this, and he thinks this is what precipitated her opening about her situation. Since my brother came home, the conversation is on hold.

So this girl we've talked to for a year maybe? Like very on and off. I catched feelings for her and confessed it. I tried to move on and was on the edge to move on. So she texted me and was like can we meet finally. I was like okay we may have a chance. I was like hyped up for a week. And all of a sudden she cancelled the plan

Im not sure what she is trying to. She wants us to meet on january but i have my things to do.

This maybe a probable date but not sure.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ropmj5/im_confused_about_her_behaviour_help_me_yall/
92,ropnvz,1640494437,Should I be concerned?,"Hey, this is my first ever post, and I’m on mobile so sorry for the weird formatting.

My (16f) and bf(16m) are going through a bit of a patch. I know I’m young and I shouldn’t focus on relationships or worry about it, but I can’t help it. 

So some background info. We have known each other for 4 years, both of us have had crushes on each other for 3. Neither of us ever attempted to make a move, until this year when I finally took the chance and asked him out. The first month and a half was great, and I was really happy. But more recently he has been kind of drifting. He is less responsive, kind of borderline ghosting me.  Whenever I give him small pecks on the cheek, he never bothers to return them. But before he would try making a game out of it, making sure to always get even with me. It’s been going on for the past 4-5 weeks.  I’ve tried talking to him about it, but his main excuses were finals and family since he was really busy around this time. And I completely understood, I mean, who isn’t busy with family around this time. 

After school ended, and our winter break started him and his family traveled out of state. And are going to be gone all break with distant family. When I first figured this out, I was kind of scared. Mainly scared of how communication was going to go. And I was right to be afraid. So far he hasn’t attempted at all to text me, even on Christmas. I sent him a Merry Christmas text and a couple of hours later he finally responded the same. I'm convinced if I hadn’t texted him, he wouldn’t have bothered to. 


I’m not sure what to do. I’m just hoping whenever we get back from the break our communication gets better. But if it doesn’t, then I’ll be lost on what to do.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ropnvz/should_i_be_concerned/
93,ropo7r,1640494469,Confused About “pre” dating,"So, as the title says I’m pretty lost when it comes to the crucial moments before dating. I am at most times just feeling hidden in the dating world and feel like it’s getting pretty hard especially with Covid &amp; all. Im conventionally attractive [m], early 20s, decent personality, and built a foundation to be well off-ish in life so far. The problem is that I just can’t get past the “talking” stage at all. These “pre-relationships” go well (in my eyes); lots of common interests, overt flirting, reciprocation of feelings and sometimes sex. The problem kicks in right around the month mark each time, after excellent dates or conversations they either just ghost or state that they’re just not in the right mind to continue. Even after something as personal (to me) as sex, they’ll be extra sweet and nice but then just leave after a few more times. Keep in mind that I NEVER push to relationships and remind myself constantly to respect boundaries and just relax. Is now just not the time to pursue relationships at all? Are men and women of my age group just not ready for relationships? I’m pretty sure both men and women have experienced this so I’d like to ask you guys &amp; girls what’s your strategy for getting out of this cycle and/or just dealing with it.

96,roprw8,1640494846,Men either just wanna hook up with me or marry me and it’s never in between.,"So my problem is this; men are either 0 or 100. They’re either like damn baby you’re so hot i wanna fuck the shit out of you etc which i mean that’s ok but they’re very objectifying about it. OR they’re like wow you are so beautiful and intelligent and hardworking and you love Jesus etc let’s meet up today and start a life together like literally that just happened today i’m not even kidding.
But never in all the time i’ve been in this dating game has someone been middle of the road. Like id love for someone to be sexually attracted to me while also recognizing that i have a brain and personality, but don’t want them to immediately put me on a pedestal and just assume i’m The One after like 3 texts. lord, men what is with y’all?? can we take it slow? can we just go on a date and see what happens?? why do you think there is such a dichotomy in mens approaches to dating?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/roprw8/men_either_just_wanna_hook_up_with_me_or_marry_me/
