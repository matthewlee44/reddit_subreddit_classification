Having said that, i also appreciate the elimination of ambiguity, knowing that we have something setup. 

Now i expect the feedback that this sounds like desperation, and i agree there's some truth to that, but part of it is really just not wanting to leave things unambiguous.

With that in mind, anyone have a way of closing out a date and expressing that you had a good evening, but without committing to the next activity?

6,qx3p5a,1637281490,Confused about why she ghosts me exclusively at night,"I started talking to a girl from a dating app 4 or 5 days ago. It was effortless, mutual conversation about our shared hobby of writing and some other stuff for a day or so then she asked to take it off the app. So she seems interested in me for sure. She gave me her number and mentioned I‚Äôm the kinda person she‚Äôd go to a bookstore with, which could be a good way to bring up a date. Maybe I‚Äôm delusional, or she‚Äôs interested in me. What stumps me though is the way she texts and how there seems to be a routine time cut off on replies... We‚Äôll have a steady conversation during a few hours of the day, usually mid morning to late afternoon. Then she just disappears until the next morning. I don‚Äôt want to be texting all day long (healthy boundaries and all) so this isn‚Äôt exactly a bad thing, but it is weird? She‚Äôll be engaged over several texts for a few hours, then the conversation suddenly comes to a halt, there‚Äôs no ‚Äúlater‚Äù type thing, lead up to a pause in conversation, and no ‚Äúafterthought reply‚Äù you‚Äôd expect one to send once their day has wound down. Then the next day she‚Äôll just pick it right back up again lol. It‚Äôs the weirdest texting pattern I‚Äôve ever seen.

7,qx45j1,1637282922,How do I get him to step up the game and try to get closer with me??üòñ,"We have many good damn looking guys in our football team at school. I constantly see them around the campus and of course some guys do stand out and look more appealing to you. One day I had a PE class and we had to go out to the track to walk laps. In the middle is the area where the football players have practice like 24/7. So the guys were kinda chuncked into groups and passing the football to each other. When we came to the track, I straight away went to the rest room which was right next to it. When I came out I decided to wait for my friends who were about to finish the first lap. As I was standing I saw a group of football players chatting and looking towards my way.. it felt awkward to make eye contact so I looked once or twice and kept looking away.. as my friends were about to exit the track, one of the guys from the group exited before my class went out and as he was exiting he stopped by the door and tried to get an eye contact with me. Once I've noticed him there , he gave me a smirk so I smirked back although I was kinda surprised. Didn't know if he looked at me or someone else or did I just look funny. It felt weird to be noticed by one of the football players. So after he exited and as my class started to exit too, couple steps further I was walking and I saw him walking towards me so I stopped and he asked if we met before to which I answered I saw him on insta couple times. He shook my hand too and asked for my name~ so when we parted, I saw him follow me back. The next week I got sick so I didn't go to school. And the week after I saw him unexpectedly thought the crowd and we were right next go each other.. so I saw him smirk when he saw me there. Not gonna lie.. It's so hard.. most of the time I had in mind that I don't really have much chances or they wouldn't be interested so I never had any expectations. But that one time I understood that I do and couldn't stop thinking about him since then. Saw him just a couple more times too but faked it like I didn't see him but tries to walk close to him. Today we by accident met each other again and he said hi for the first time which I didn't expect from him. It was sort of a shy hi since he wanted to see how I'd respond. The other time I saw him today was when my class ended and he showed up there too and took his seat as people started to leave which was exactly a row over from my seat and I said hi to him and this time he was like excited to see me when he said hi. I don't want to be straightforward with him but I want to look approachable and give him an understanding that I'm interested in getting to know him. Although we technically don't have any classes together either. We get to meet be coincidence most of the time. And also tomorrow is the last day of school before a week of break for thanks giving.

I didn‚Äôt reciprocate. But I did kissed her before I left. Shortly after she texted to never do that again. I told her that she never said no, then she says that we aren‚Äôt even anything and that she want so space and that is better being friends. I Told her I would never do it again. After an hour I apologize. She hasn‚Äôt responded. Two days ago I texted her a paragraph apologizing for my faults and that she should take as much space needed.

Through years we kind of drifted apart but we do have conversations here and there when we meet. We follow each other on Instagram but he never texted me there.(we have followed each other on Instagram since forever). 
but during a gathering (in 2017-2018) with his family and mine and a couple other families, my childhood friend and I had a very fun moment with my sister included, we three of us were just hanging out (kinda like old times) so after that event weeks later he sent me a meme that was relateble with the conversation we three of us had. And I responded. And after a couple days he sent me a meme related to a conversation he had with my sister and little with me. he follows my sister too but he texted me about it which I found weird. 
But yeah, I wanted to share some memes too because he did and I didn't want to seem rude. Then we did a couple back and forth (all memes were very relatable to me and him but random) but then I forgot to send him memes and after that I just got lazy. so it's been almost 2-ish years and he's the only one sharing memes and I just respond to them. He sends me these memes every other week or after a month (usually at midnight, also he's 2ish years younger than me Idk If that matters I'm just throwing in random infos). 
I'm just saying that he's friends with my sister too and all three of us were pretty close, I assumed. and I was just curious as to why he doesn't talk/share memes with my sister but only with me since all three of us were close. Maybe I'm overthinking it but I just find it a bit weird that he sends me memes soo randomly but that relate with me and us. I wouldn't have felt weird if he was sending memes to my sister as well but yeah. 

Oh there was this incident that happened with us when we were growing. Because of puberty and stuff he was getting taller than me and he usually calls me with respect kinda like an older sister (like in Asian cultures you use unni, oppa etc kinda like that. Since he is younger than me) but my dad jokingly told him not to call me that anymore because my childhood friend was getting taller than me. I got mad saying no I'm still taller, then my dad measured us and yeah he was taller then me ;-;. Then the next time we hung out he was being all casual with me and calling me just by my nickname which I found so hurtful that Idk why, and without realizing it I started ignoring him and not listening to him when he called me that. After couple days he got the hint and started calling me as usual.
 ( just wanted to share that, Idk if that matters it's just he keeps sending me memes here and there and I can't seem to get it out of my head and I overthink too much) 

What do ya'll think am I overthinking it? Probably, but I want to hear it out loud

What would you do in my shoes?","So I've hooked up 3 times with this girl, 1st time it was a friend's celebration at a concert, and that night we had some amazing sex and took a shower the morning after. She texted me and we said we had fun briefly, and she added me on Snapchat. A few days later, I hit her up, and we made plans to hang out on Thursday the week after. She came over, I cooked her dinner, we cuddled as we watched A Nightmare Before Christmas, I said let's take a walk to settle our stomachs, and we walked outside of my place as we held hands, (she kept bumping her waist/stomach and body into me,) and we talked about our childhood, and how our parents divorced at a young age. We came back had sex, she orgasmed a lot, and we cuddled, and had morning sex.

The next time I invited her over to my place to hang out, I asked her when her availability was and she said she was free Wednesday, and Thursday, but something came up so we hung out Friday, (first time I've actually spent time with her on the weekends.) I told her come over at 10PM, and she texted that she could definitely do that! We had the craziest sex ever, and looked deep into each other's eyes, plenty of deep passionate kissing.

I'm a very selfless lover, I enjoy doing a lot of foreplay, kissing all her body, with plenty of dirty talking and pillow talking/cuddling after. She always tells me how she finds me so cute and how she was happy that I was a nice guy and not a jerk. She told me she didn't expect me to call or hit her up when we first hooked up.

Thing is whenever I set up plans with her, she always replies back like late at night after 9PM. She doesn't text or call me, and I initially have to do most of the planning. I did ask her how her day was and she replied within a few hrs, but I'd assume she has a busy schedule due to her medical job\*. She tells me she's not good at texting due to ADHD, which I guess is fair. I've met a few women like that. But even then, it makes me feel like I'm really nothing but a piece of meat.

This is the serious problem though. I never established what this was, nor did we have the talk or express boundaries. At this point, I really don't want to risk the amazing sex, but I'm also becoming attached to her because I have a good time with her.

40,qx6chu,1637289957,Do you normally sleep over after hooking up with someone for the first time?,"I (24f) have been actively using online dating for the past year or so. Ideally would like to find a relationship but I'm also happy starting out with things more casual and seeing how it goes. 

If things are going well with a guy, I normally feel comfortable enough/want to have sex after a few dates. It normally ends up being at their place and the last thing I want to do afterwards is put my clothes back on and take public transportation back to my apartment. I also love cuddling after sex and the feeling of falling asleep for the night with someone after that.

I used to assume that it was just implied that I would sleep over after and if a guy didn't want me to then he either wasn't that into me or just wanted me for sex. However, I've had a couple situations recently that have made me second guess this. Once where a guy I thought was into me asked me not to stay after we hooked up which turned me off from him. Another where I stayed over without explicitly talking about it (just fell asleep pretty quickly) and got ghosted after.

From now on I'm going to make more of an effort to talk about things like this before sex to avoid any potential misunderstandings, but I'm still wondering - do most people here normally sleep over after hooking up with someone for the first time?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qx6chu/do_you_normally_sleep_over_after_hooking_up_with/

I checked his social media and he had this beautiful blonde girl in all his photos, going back 2 years. I suspected they were dating and silently crushed on him. I didn't make any moves.

But out of the blue one day this guy (my hot roommate) asked me to get drinks. While we were getting drinks, the blonde girl Facetimed him and he hung up on her to go out with me. It felt awesome. I thought this was finally my CHANCE.

The guy cuddled with me ALL night and it was the most romantic experience of my life. He even tried to have sex but I wasn't ready, though I regret not doing so.

Unfortunately a week later the blonde girl was back with him, and I heard her next door in the room with him. I gave up for a little while.

Then a few weeks later after she had been coming over regularly, he told me his GF was in the hospital. Meaning he was home alone. He invited me into his room to watch a movie. When I laid in his bed, he asked to cuddle and although I wanted to, I declined with a firm NO this time telling him he had a girlfriend!

Ever since I declined to cuddle, he's now completely stopped talking to me and has been totally focusing on his girlfriend. She was over our house 3 times this week and I have just been hiding in my room.

Although this guy only took me out for drinks/spent a couple nights cuddling with me, I really miss him/our few cuddling sessions. I feel like an abandoned toy!

It is BEYOND painful to hear him next door having sex with this girl. She also posted a photo of them together looking happy and beautiful on social media today :(

I really miss the nights cuddling with my roommate. I am realizing that sooner or later one of us will move out and I will never see him again. Should I tell him how I feel? I know he has a girlfriend but the fact that he cuddled with me a couple nights must mean something...right?

Would things have been better if I had just had sex with him while I had the chance? How can I get him back??

51,qx78vy,1637292875,How to deal with this weird anxiety about dating n stuff,"Hello! So! A lil bit of backstory... I've really thought this through a LOT!


I 20F have never been in a relationship! 

Lately though, I've been going out with this dude 21 for a while that made it clear on our first 'date', (At first I honestly thought that day was just for us to get to know each other as we had just briefly spoken the last and first time we met) very cutely at the end when we were about to part ways, that he was REALLY into me. Quite honestly I wasn't expecting that kind of thing from the first day and it was also the first time someone had told me something like this so I was mega-flustered but I am glad he told me so I know how to deal with my feelings. 
I like him too, I told him I need some more time with him to figure things out and it has been great, we talk a lot as we walk, a lot, and I find myself thinking about him more and more.

On our last date, I took the initiative to hold his arm, then lock our fingers together :o such a girboss move I know but in reality I am so full of anxiety.

The truth is the last time a had something similar to a confession happen to me I was younger and the guy was a lot older, I didn't even know his age. At the time I felt as if I owed him something just because he liked me so I didn't stop him trying to kiss and hold me. However soon after I realised I didn't really want that and cut him off. But that experience has pretty much sadly to say scarred me and now anything involving skinship makes me anxious af.

On our last date, the same one with the hand holding, we sat really close together in something close to an embrace just talking, looking at each other and honestly I felt he really wanted to kiss me and because I got heart palpatations I gently let him go and led the conversation to a different subject and turned the mood around. But I am very anxious about how things will happen in the future. He sure is a gentleman, but I understand he will want to kiss me eventually and honestly so do I. Don't even wanna think about anything more intimate right now and I think that's ok!

I understand that the best way to deal with this is probably talking to him about it, but so early on I am not sure I am yet ready to talk to him so so so vulnerably about it. Also I doubt I can have that talk with him in public and so far that's the only places we go to fortunately lol.

Is meeting him twice a week maybe too much for my littol heart? What shall I do... I adore him‚ô° but I want to put myself first and be ok so I can be ok with him.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qx78vy/how_to_deal_with_this_weird_anxiety_about_dating/

She is on the other side of the globe, but I've never met someone so mature, beautiful, and passionate as she is. Basically, if I had to marry someone today it would be her.

So we have yet to meet in person, but already we connect on a deep emotional level. We both look forward to seeing each other and talk about what it will be like when we can finally meet.

**I'm just wondering how other men (or women?) thrive in a relationship if they get overwhelmed by their own feelings?** Is this even a thing or is it just me? I guess it happens at other times as well, but is the strongest when dating, so no amount of CBT seems to help! ü§£

We are already honest about our feelings (she's shared some past hurts &amp; things she considers weaknesses) so I plan on bringing it up with her...I already indicated to her that I get overwhelmed easily so I think she'd understand. (I just want to say it in such a way that it doesn't make it sound like I'm trying to distance myself from her).

I guess there is the lingering question about whether this is love bombing.

For context, I'm a first generation immigrant (born a proud citizen) that is pretty well established with my personal and professional field. I live in a major metropolitan city, and do have friends in the area, but that's a dead end for finding someone.

 I've tried dating apps, and its been pretty good until the 2nd-4th date. Then it's just ghosting, stalking, or all around bat shit crazy. * nothing sexual happens*

 I've been told on multiple occasions that I come off as intimidating....but I'm 5'1 106lb so it's definitely not physically intimidating(?). They were all great guys but nothing serious happens.

We would start taking pictures of the food and I would ask her to put her butt in the frame as an ironic ""eye-catcher"". We talked about female empowerment and whatnot... She had been wanting to post a picture of her nipples in a ""free the nipples kind of way"" on social media for a while, and was working herself up to doing it.  
She never posts nudes/thirst-traps on social media. We talked about making a seperate account for the pictures - just butts and food, I guess. She instead posted on her own Instagram. It's a straight shot of her behind, with the plate in front. She has been getting DMs from dudes of course and now she's sending me screenshots of thirsty guys in her DMs (for laughs). I feel weird about it. It's her body, and it was done ironically, but it is really turning me off to her.

I obviously don't want to leave her and I don't want to ask her to delete the picture either. Our values and morals allign, but this picture, even though it was ironic, is not sitting well with me.

94,qxasfj,1637306041,Dilemma of commitment inconsistencies,"Consider 3 guys, who have never been in relationship , but now, their girl wants them to commit to her :

Guy 1 : he's pretty self aware that what he wants a few years from now cannot be predicted.  So he responsibly is careful not to lead her on with promise of lifelong commitment. 

Guy 2 : he has no self awareness. He wrongly thinks what he wants today, he will continue to want it. He irresponsibly gives the girl high hopes and later backs out / breaks up. Maybe he starts getting bored in relationship,  or falls out of love  or the girl gains weight and he no longer feels attraction to her, etc.

Guy 3 : he is an even worse version of previous guy . He knows very well that he wouldn't want this relationship longer than six months. Yet gives the girl high hopes to make her stay. And then, once he has had a good time and wants to move on to some other partner, he just abruptly makes up an excuse and breaks up. Or worse, he gives the girl some inferiority complex, making her feel as if she was the one at fault.

Now,  each of them was having a nice time with their partner but guy 1 decided  to sacrifice it for sake of love for his partner  by being honest. While guy 2 hurt both himself and his loved one by not being far sighted. While guy 3 was very shrewd and selfish and thought only of his pleasure. He knew the outcome beforehand yet chose to keep his intentions hidden from his partner.

And most women don't like a confused guy like guy 1 when in reality,  he is the most honest and truly loves her to save her from getting emotionally hurt.

Most women either would want the spontaneous unworried about future guy2 or the guy3 who gives them a false sense of security and serious commitment. 

So, what should guy 1 do to protect his interests yet not do any unethical action that his conscience disallows?

Note : these thoughts are equally valid with genders reversed as well. So I don't mean to slander a particular gender.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qxasfj/dilemma_of_commitment_inconsistencies/

97,qxav0x,1637306357,Not using dating apps to meet women,"Meeting Women Other Ways  
After my last relationship ended, I've started looking to get away from app dating as it just sucks my soul. Plus it's getting expensive! Bumble is like $30/month now and I just don't care enough to pay for it.   
So how else do you find partners? Well, the short answer is everywhere. And here is what I've learned:   
\- You can meet women almost anywhere   
\- Meeting women off of dating apps is much more rewarding both mentally and emotionally as the success rate is higher   
\- Learning how to use different mediums, apps, and methods of communication increases your overall conversation abilities   
\- In my opinion, people my age demographic (late 20s) are just as fed up with dating as I am   
\- Being out and about just leads you to meeting more people  
\- If you can be clean, have generally interesting conversation, shave and not be an ass, you'll have much better success than you will app dating   
**- The competition in real life is much lower**  
**Again, THE COMPETITION IN REAL LIFE IS MUCH LOWER!!**  
What I've found is that, on average, people are bad at talking to people. For whatever reason, and I don't mean to rag on men as I am one, but men are generally bad at talking, even politely, to women in real life. So, this means that if you are able to strike up a conversation with a woman, you'll have much better odds in real life of actually getting a phone number and a date than you will spending hours swiping on dating apps.   
The thing about dating with apps is that if you have a few pictures from a few years ago that are good, you can keep using them. After all, people only see what you show them. So, for all of us who gained the covid weight, we can still use our beautiful selves from 2020 to strike up matches. The downside, is that you don't have much motivation too actually be a healthy, confident and attractive man as almost all of the interaction is online and, if you don't have much luck on the apps, you never really go out and meet these women.   
However, when you are meeting women in public, there is a lot more motivation to lose that cover weight, shave today, comb your hair and put on pants that don't smell.   
To sum, try meeting people in real life. It's probably better for your mental health, you'll have more success and it'll give you something social to do.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qxav0x/not_using_dating_apps_to_meet_women/
