Met up with a lovely girl, pretty young too. Hooked up a few times, made out. I'm pretty much sure I was her first kiss because her friends told me something along those lines.

Chatted daily, pretty intensively. Saw her (bi)weekly. It was a good time.

Fast forward a few weeks, we planned going on another ""real"" date. Here's the catch... There was no time before because she'd go on a skiing trip; males included. Lots of booze, lots of guys, as is usual. I already feared something would happen. And I assume it has. Not a big problem for me, as we are not in an official relationship but what I fear most is that she'd take it back home.

Until a few days in her trip we chatted. It has come to a pretty immediate standstill. From one day to the other. Boom. I feel the distance, the cold, the ignore. Going from 100 messages to 2 a day. It has been like this for 3-4 days and no communication whatsoever since a day or two. It's not so weird to limit communications during skiing, but the difference is huge.

She's young, and might have done things she'll regret. Most likely things that disregard everything we've build over the past weeks.

I'm a tad older. And apparently in love. Because it hurts. It feels like a constant kick in the stomach. Not sleeping well either. Heck, I don't even know precisely what's going on, but I'm well aware how ghosting works. Loss of interest all of the sudden, and hoping to slowly fade away as if nothing happened.

I \[19M\]  started dating \[19F\] two weeks ago. Everything has been great so far. We constantly chat with each other, have 3-4 hour calls everyday on FaceTime and overall really starting to bond with each other. I was really happy about it because I was in the dating scene for around 6 months now and most of the girls I have encountered were either emotionally unavailable or wanted something casual. Meanwhile, I want to dedicate myself to someone, give them all my love and passion. I would consider myself pretty emotional, kind and respectful. And the girl that I am dating right now really ticked all of the boxes I had. She is really family-oriented, kind, sweet, beautiful,funny, witty and everything you can think of. She is a really nervous and anxious person because she had pretty bad experiences with exes, they were treating her really bad and also only liked her so they can take advantage of her sexually. She got a big trauma for that and didnt date or see anyone and a few weeks ago she downloaded the dating apps so she can finally open up to someone again. I was the first guy she went on a date with. Hearing all of this things about her trauma and people not treating her well, I was really sad and started doing anything in my power to make her feel special. Giving her a lot of compliment and paying attention to small details about her stories to show that I care, give her presents, pay for the bills when we go out, try to learn her language, start reading her favourite book, listen to her favourite music artists. I feel most happy when I make others happy, so seeing her enjoy these things really made me appreciate the situation even more. I basically did everything I can to appreciate her for she truly is and that the most important thing I am looking for with her is a serious relationship. We are really started to open with each other because we spend so much time talking with each other. One problem I find is that we have only seen each other 2 times so far, so we are pretty nervous and scared while on the date and we arent on that level of openess yet. I know the solution to this is just to see each other more often but she has an exam period pretty soon, so it will be pretty hard to see each other quite frequently.

So this was basically the backstory of all of it. Yesterday we had our normal call and she shared something with me that really made me sad but I appreciate her honesty. She said that felt that I she is not on the level of attachent I am at and she feels like she really wants to be sure about her choice so she doesnt regret sharing her trauma. She thinks that she might regret taking the first guy on her dating app so she wants to continue using them for a bit and potentially see other people so she is sure. I got really sad because I am pretty monogamous person and I was really starting to get attached to her. What should I do in this situation? She still wants to keep things like they are right now but I dont know whether I should keep them like that as well, give her less attention or idk I am really confused. She says she is really overwhelmed and wants to think things through.I need your help.

So, I've known this guy randomly a couple months ago, and we went out yesterday night. 
I had no expectations, it wasn't a declared date but I find him very smart and interesting. 
He's so open, and I even knew some of his friends. 
It was cold so we start heading to his house. 
I knew what it could've meant but fuck it, I'm not forced to do that, I can leave when I want if I'm not comfortable to have it.
Also, he's so sexy when talking about history and politics. I usually don't rate people, but for an idea he was a 9/10. Not 10 because he shaves his head lol. 

Ffw, we are in his room and almost about to do that. I tell him nothing should happen. (Barely know him, first ""date"", just NO). I see the disappointment in his eyes. He then asks me if I've ever been with someone. Tell him it's complicated for me (I have a condition that makes having sex painful and actually almost impossible to have, so 50% choice, 50% disease). 
He proceeds explaining he hasn't the time and mind for a relationship and says he's not the right one. He borrows me The Green Book of Gheddafi so we could see each other again and I go home. 

WOW. Guys, just do like this!! It was not difficult, not painful for me and to be honest, that made me appreciate and like him more.

But now I really want and need someone who takes care of me and to take care of. Why can't I just find someone? It wasn't that difficult, I am ready to engage myself seriously but it always end like this.

You're going on a date with a woman. In this scenario, they're the same woman, It's more about how they show up for a first date, so it's your first impression of them.


1. The woman putting in effort into her appearance: make up, outfit, hair, nails, etc. It took a lot of time but she looks immaculate. She shows off her figure. People are in awe when she walks by. It might not be how she looks on a day to day basis. You won't know untill you really get to know her. 

or 

2. The woman showing up in a casual outfit. She looks comfortable. Odds are she dresses like this on a day to day basis. You probably can't tell if she's wearing make-up or not, it looks natural if she does. Might not be showing off her figure but she looks snuggly. 


It's about effort and casual versus date night/going out look. It's about showing up as themselves or dressing to impress. It's about first impressions. What do you prefer? What does their choice in this communicate to you?


Obviously every woman decides for themselves how they show up and maybe you don't care. Perfectly reasonable answer. Just curious what's going on in your noggin.

Short about me:  I'm at the end of the 20s, Senior Engineer, good looking and very fit.  I am looking for a relationship that can involve into something serious.  Have never done hookups/ONS, but I do not judge others for it, it just isn't for me. 

Now over to the case (trying to keep it short, yet give enough info for you to get enough insight). 
I matched on tinder with his very gorgeous girl, I recognized her uniform right away to be the same as my company. So found out she was a colleague in the diffetent town.  (we are space satélite engineers).  *Fast forward* we had lots in common, at that point I was sick (had cluster headache and recently had a strong virus attack)  so I told her I did not dare to drive a car to meet for a walk, instead she suggested visiting me for a dinner and movie. 

The date was successful, time flew and suddenly it was 1 am, and full storm outside. So I asked if she wanted to sleep over, I then gave her the option of guest room and my own bedroom and said I didn't want her to feel forced to either.  She asked to share bed with me.  (I at this point had zero intention for sex, but was hoping to maybe cuddle a bit). 
I barely was able to take of my clothes before she was on top of me, and had a tiny moment to decide.  So I just went with the flow and we ended up having insane sex.  (apparently she was a nymphomaniac, with an endless sex drive). 

The day after she left and we kept texting throughout the week,  so I spent the time to really think if I wanted to pursue this or not. I liked her a lot, so next weekend she asked if I wanted to play some boardgames and enjoy wine. The date was fantstic, as friends we are perfect, I was still just not sure if we fit as a couple. And the night came, and the same happened, this time I wasn't allowed to get undressed before she pushed me onto the bed and let her inner beast take charge.  (To the guys out there, this was both shocking and interesting experience especially when she is like a kitten which suddenly transformed to a Lioness). 

When I left that morning I still wasn't sure, cuz I really enjoyed spending time with her. Just wasn't sure if it was more on friendly terms.  I decided then to ""leave a door open"" to see if she wanted to continue or not. And rather make up my mind and tell her how I feel. But as I did so the coming week she was just reading but not responding.  So at that point I started to think maybe she just wanted to hook up. 

I gave her space incase she was busy, but  I had a feeling she just dated me for some hook up  and was fine with it,  but then I saw she blocked me from snapchat  and her tinder was changed to ""Tinder is on pause"" with a sad face. That's when it struck me, what if I did hurt her unintentionally?  

I dated her with the interest of getting to know her and the sex which I had no expextions of just happened by her initiating,   but still I have this feeling. The what if I unintentionally hurt her, and made her belive I ""used her"" for sex? 


Summary:
I am trying to find a serious relationship. Met a colleague on Tinder,  had zero plans for sex, but a successful date she initiated for sex. Same with following date. I dated to get to know her, but was unsure the feelings I had was more on friendly terms. She then stopped responding to my texts and later blocked me.

Yesterday my boyfriend was going out and his phone was dead so he logged into his twitter on my phone to tell his friend to come get him. He forgot to log out…

For context I need to add that my bf is VERY good looking and gets a lot of attention from girls (like probably at least 1 or 2 dms from a new girl every week since we’ve been together). So his dms are basically just a sea of ignored women. When we first got together this was a lot to handle, as I’d never even thought I’d be in a situation when the guy you’re with gets more thirsty dms then you (if you’re a woman you know how it is existing on social media). Through constant reassurance I eventually got over this.

However though my boyfriend is a very naturally flirty person, and sometimes I don’t even think he realises he’s flirting/people are flirting with him, and I think it’s a byproduct of him having an existence where he’s always been desired/goodlooking, so people are always trying to flirt with him, which makes flirty interactions the norm for him.

Well back to last night, when I realised he left his twitter logged on, I did something I never bothered to do before. I snooped. And I found some.. Ambiguous messages to say the least.

So there’s 3 sets of screenshots. Make sure to scroll down on them as there’s multiple images. red, blue and yellow.

[Blue](https://imgur.com/a/77sOy9o) is a girl he used to be pretty close with but stopped being friends with about a month ago

[Yellow](https://imgur.com/a/QFbvghE) is a girl who I outright told him it was me or her, because I really really didn’t like her.

[Red](https://imgur.com/a/mO14Mrn) is a girl who I didn’t even know existed in his life.

All the messages are from this year, apart from yellow, which are messages from last year.

Now are these messages cheating? Would you consider them cheating? And should I confront him about them? I need to be certain before I do because I used to be very jealous and insecure, and honestly pretty toxic, and always used to accuse him of cheating until he put us on a break until I could “sort out my issues”. So if I’m going to kick up a stink I need to know I’m right to do so, especially considering I violated his privacy which is definitely not okay.

Ultimately I took some advice and took a brave pill and went an initiated a conversation with someone who I really found attractive after I finished working out, We had a great conversation and had some smile and laughter, she also couldn't stop touching my arm, after 10 minutes or so of chit chat I asked her if she would be interested to go out on a date some time in the future, she paused and smiled, touched my arm again and said 'You are really Hot and Extremely Handsome, You really sweet and have made me laugh but I just got out of a relationship and am not looking for anything at the moment'

So I smiled back and said that it was absolutely not a problem whatsoever and wished her a Good Evening. Even though I got knocked back I was proud that I took a brave pill and did it as this is only the 2nd time I've ever asked someone out. 

The thing to do is just be proud and not take it to heart and try again next time and maybe that will be the one!

So here's a pattern I've noticed and this is what has been bothering me the most especially after reading some things on reddit

First off I do take really good care of myself even though I do suffer from major depression and anxiety I consistent take care of my physical appearance and my mental health because those two things are important when dating anyway. I work out and I make sure that I'm consistently taking care of myself and improving in life in small ways as I can!

Unfortunately my love life has always been not good people on reddit ask well are you going after guys out of your league or the best one of all lower your standards.

Now let me tell you unfortunately for me I only attract two types of men, men who are way older then me line 50s or 60s ( I have way too many stories about this.. ) or men who don't take care of themselves mentally and physically meaning they don't smell good they don't brush there teeth they talk about life negativity basically they want me to be a mom to them  and they are overweight or even skinny but they no interest in taking care of themselves and I'm not interested in men like that or they just want sex no commitment just that I'm also not interested in that either because literally that's the very last thing in my list and something I'm not even worried about.

Now let me remind you that I'm not overweight I lost my weight a long time ago and still do weight lifting and boxing today!

Now the guys I am generally attracted to  ( I'm demisexual ) are guys who I'm friends with first usually and very rare I do form a emotional bond with them while getting to know them for a months etc. They take care of themselves mentally and physically have good manners etc and overall very have the characteristics in a guy I'm looking for I'm not expecting him to be a model type at all, but a guy who takes extremely good care of himself and he consistently keeps his mental health in check ( like I already do )  so these guys I am usually attracted to and I just like guys who I know can take care of themselves overall and who are religious.

Unfortunately for me no matter how hard I try, life has shown me that I have to go for the guys who treat me like dirt ( because I have and I had a guy who I ""dated"" which it wasn't a relationship at all tell me that if I didn't date him he would kill himself these are the types of guys I attract or they are aggressive.

Now i dunno how to break this cycle and I've never been in a relationship before either or done anything with a guy I'm literally asking for the bare minimum not expecting him to be a model but some who I feel safe and secure around and someone who wants to build with me.  I've lowered my standards before and it didn't end well but I've been told my standards are realistic and not that bad I've talked to my friends about this as well. 

But anyways I got therapy and I gotta get ready I will definitely work on this with my therapist I just hope one day these men who have these good characteristics I will find one that likes me the same way I do them and my love will be recpoicated.

If you respond I'll probably see it after my session I actually prefer this subreddit vs the other one. 

Everyone is really nice here with helping with advice and other things. So far I've been using reddit to just vent or if have thoughts or anything like that I talk about it!

I am working on improving and am gonna expand my social circles and try to meet more single people  that I can be friends with first and then hopefully he does match these characteristics I do want In a guy.

I already shared before my story about dating her with the fact she has no friends.

&amp;#x200B;

Lately, I noticed she's a bit, self-centered person.

I notice that when she's talking about a topic she has an interest OR things related to HER - She can talk and talk and talk and I can ask her open-ended questions because I'm really interested in her, and cause of the fact that she's important to me - I want to know more about her and the situation/opinion she's sharing with me... I believe that I'm a good listener especially when it comes to people I like.

&amp;#x200B;

BUT... here it splits into 2 situations:

1. When I respond or give my opinion about what she said, She can cut me in the middle and respond due to the belief that she knows what I'm about to say OR because she's so into herself or I don't know...  
We spoke about it and I asked her to be more aware that when I want to respond it could be nice if she would let me finish my sentence and give me the feeling that she's really listening to me, and not only hearing what I'm saying... I don't like cutting people in the middle of their sentences. Of course, it's something that happens but if you're less of a talker and you finally trying to speak out, then cutting you almost every time can make you(or at least me) uncomfortable.
2. I feel that most of the time, she's the dominant who talks and I'm the better listener and the one who can ask more questions while she shows less of an interest in me.  
For example: I'm a student and I just finished my exams season and getting back to the regular semester schedule. When I told her that tomorrow I'm starting a new semester she didn't sound excited for me, which I can understand since she's not getting a degree so maybe she doesn't know the ""students life"" but... if you don't know what it means, can't you show an interest and ask?  
She said she thought that maybe because I'm in my 3rd(out of 4) year - a new semester isn't something special for me, but the problem is.. how does she know that? We started dating at the start of the exams seasons, and we barely spoke about how it's like being a student in a regular semester season, so how can she get to the conclusion if she didn't ask me how DO I feel about that?  
It's just an example, but occasionally I feel like she can talk for a long period of time and I'll listen and ask her relevant questions but when it's the opposite situation - it feels like she gives LESS interest in my life.  
I asked her if maybe she doesn't have an interest in me and she said that she REALLY have interest in me but she does know that she's more of a self-centered person(even the word ""egocentric"" raised up) and that maybe it's difficult for her to be less self-centered and more interested in the person who stands in front of her.

The bottom line is we both REALLY like each other.

We have a great connection, humor, intimacy, and intellectual conversations.

Our conversations can go to a really deep level and we're dating for ALMOST 2 months.

She said she'll try to pay more attention to me, and when I'm sharing something about myself and what I'm doing/going through - she'll try to show me interest and ask me things, because at the end of the day - She does like me and she does take care of being and try in many many other ways to make me feel comfortable with her.

One of the things that I really love about her personality is that she's so open to improvement and being a better person for herself and her surrounding.

We both come from an abusive narcissistic relationship with our fathers and we both are empaths, which the relationship with our fathers made both of us REALLY self-aware and open for improvement, we both came from a low place where we had almost NO **social skills**.

&amp;#x200B;

What I'm afraid of, is that I'll change the person she is, and it's not something I'm want to do.

Do you think I'm asking too much from a self-centered person, OR you believe I did my best and made the right choice by speaking up about what I feel so maybe, while she'll try to notice that, it would maybe improve our relationship???",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1163384,public,self,Dating with self centered girl,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/tcgdlj/dating_with_self_centered_girl/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,

That break up was so hard and after two years I think I'm ready to try again however I'm not having any success.

First, I'm a medical student and I started to get to know other girls in my class but I'm not finding anyone whose personality resembles mine and most of them have overinflated ego anyways so I tried cold approaches a few times in public places but it seems the chances of meeting a compatible person are extremely thin.

I see most girls care about travelling - partying - appearing cool on social media and even girls that read they usually read stuffs like poetry - literature and I honestly don't care at all about these things.

I found 1-2 girls on social media that seem nice and we have 1-2 common interests however :

1. I don't feel 1-2 common interests are enough to build attraction
2. Medical study took a dull on my personality and I don't think I can make them interested. It's not that I'm boring person I do read a lot - Play piano - and workout among some other things but I just feel only certain types of guys (the ones that sing or are narcissistic or post 24/7 on social media ) are able to have success in approaching stranger girls (no common friends or environment). and I'm not one of those guys and don't want to be one lol.

I haven’t dated in some time and really want to get back into it. I don’t know how to go about it and would like some advice. 

I am a 26-year-old Christian male and looking for a girl my age or a little younger or older. It is my goal within the next four years to get married and have kids. I really am motivated in life to have children and have a great relationship with my family. I also know the exact type of girl that I am looking for. 

I'm ideally looking for the following type: Someone who is a natural mother, someone who is kind and caring, someone who looks up to me and is kind of like my cheerleader, someone who is willing to live the gospel standards with me and raise my children in like manner, someone who wants to have a big family, and someone overall that I can learn from. 

The only problem is I don't know where to start. I guess the common and logical answer would be to look at a church. I could also give dating apps a try? Perhaps it's also an idea to give some states and cities a try over other states and cities.

Before I start approaching I have to be 10% bodyfat, have 2 million saved up in a bank account, drive a fresh shiny expensive new bmw, have a perfect haircut, perfect stubble, perfect eyebrows, glass skin, perfect all around hygiene with a nice scent. straight white teeth perfect posture, perfect body language, and most importantly a perfect harmonic speaking voice perfect and articulate , perfect personality that screams trustworthyness, 8/10 gym body with larger neck, full body completey waxed for body hair, owning a 700k house, being a great cook.

I’ll open a dating profile on all datings apps. I will be approaching young looking women.

I don't have much experience) and she said no, but wanted to stay friends. I'm working and taking one class this semester, so lately we only see each other for lunch once a week.

In favor of “it’s a date”:

* She’s driving like two hours each way to see me. Usually we meet in the middle (our university), just not this time. None of my other friends put that much effort into hanging out! Do I just have bad friends or is this different?
* We always text each other “thanks for hanging out with me!” And similar stuff after we go our separate ways. I’ve only ever heard of people doing that with dates/potential dates.

Against:

* I asked her out in early December and she said no

For full context we got into an argument days prior in which we were ignoring each other. First I  warned her that I was going to hang up if she kept speaking to me with an attitude (at least 5 warnings) then I finally hung up. ignored her after she consistently disrespected me and then she hung up on me after I tried to speak and she said I was rude by interrupting and hung up.(claims it as the same thing but I was trying to further the conversation she was just mad I hung up earlier) I ignored her until the end of the day bc she was being petty when she hung up (much lower bar for why she did it).

 We finally talk that night and she was willing to die on a stupid hill and not progress the conversation and I again gave her at least 4 warnings that if she would not go past the way that I answered the question which was “sure, yes” then I will end this phone call. I ended it. Being tired or silent arguing the past day I called her back 25 min later, she asked if I was going to apologize for hanging up in her face, I said “no” and she laughed and hung up. At this point I was furious because she is doing this just to make me mad, I called her back and she didn’t answer. At this point I decided I was officially done with the relationship no matter if we made up or not. 

In order for this too make sense I have to include some context. On September 6th I found out that she back in June had gotten on Bumble while we weren’t talking and this all happened while we didn’t talk FOR LESS THAN 24 HOURS. To make a long story short she tried to hide it and then lie about it when confronted. When she finally owns up to it bc I have proof she gives a few half assed apologies ask if there’s any she can do and I say “idk” a few times. She then essentially says “thanks for everything that you taught me, I appreciate it , how do you wanna exchange items” (she didn’t even wanna do it herself she was send someone else and we had been together for 9 months at this point. For even more context this woman had lied to me BIG and SMALL idk how many times and I was working with her to get better (I know that was stupid on my end; won’t make that mistake anymore) In addition to this I had taught this woman SO MANY THINGS ABOUT RELATIONSHIPS. She was essentially a child when it came to this stuff and I had sat through all the headaches and heartache of teaching her (she wasn’t very receptive and took a longgg time to understand stuff) while she’s learning I’m suffrage consequences. Lastly I had even gotten this woman a higher paying job where she did LESS WORK. 

At this point I felt so betrayed and so used. I sat through months of her lying and abs being disrespectful. Just so it could end with her having lied to me and using me and taking all of her new knowledge into her next relationship. And the worst part was she didn’t even TRY to fight and get the relationship back. After feeling betrayed and used I came up with a plan to get as much stuff from her as possible while I waited to get back on campus.

To make a long story short; I talked her into to staying and making it work so that I could get as much stuff from her as possible. So small gifts and a big gift, lunch dates, etc. in addition I was waiting to get back on campus so that I had more access to women. Well the Christmas gift did not arrive until essentially 5 weeks before my birthday and things were smooth enough so I decided I would stay so I can get another big gift before I left near the end of the semester. Well that’s when we had the argument and she in a major way disrespected me for the last time and I decided that I was out and done with the relationship for good. My Birthday is today and we had a hotel booked for Tuesday through Friday of next week for fun. After she ignored me that last time I decided that after that week I was going to end it no matter what, so I downloaded tinder to get my options 100% loaded. She pulled up on me and eventually went through my phone and saw the evidence. I am since glad it turned out this way bc I didn’t make any new memories with her and can spend it with my family instead and I have a hotel room booked with my brother so we’re going to have fun.

TLDR: She cheated on me after using me and lying to me for MONTHS.

We both acknowledge that we want to date for a relationship. She asked for my number and we set up a date for the next day. Date 1 goes really well and ends with a kiss and we agree to see each other again in a few days. 

The day before our second date she asks me last minute if I wanted to go out a night earlier. I said we should stick to the original plan so we did. Second date goes well again and we kiss and plan our third date. The days we don’t see each other we text throughout the day and one night even had a long call. She would usually send good morning texts before I woke up for work since she gets up much earlier than me.

Our third date was a stay in movie date and things got more heated, but she said she didn’t want to have sex until we get tested. So we just made out and cuddled a lot. She texted me saying how she’s really been enjoying our time and thinks things are going really well and thinks there’s potential for something really good. She even mentions how she’s talked to her friends and sister about me and how they’re eager to meet me. I got a little unsettled that maybe things were moving a bit fast at this point but didn’t say anything about it.

A few days after our third date, we go get ice cream and come back to my place to chill around. We talked about what we wanted to do for our fifth date and the coming weekend. We decided we’d go out to a bar and dinner this Friday night and Saturday she would come over to watch a soccer game with me. She made the reservation. From the start of the date she seemed to be very tired and even passed out on my bed while we cuddled. I noticed we didn’t talk as much and she seemed much less energetic than the past.

The next day I could tell something was off as she didn’t text the whole day even after I had sent a text to see how she was doing. Eventually she replied to the text the next morning saying things got crazy. I asked if we were still on for our date planned that night and she said yes. A few hours later I get hit with a text saying she hasn’t been feeling well and medicine hasn’t made her feel better so we cancel for the night and I said to let me know if there was anything I could do to help and that I’d let her rest.

I saw she was active on social media last night and got this unsettling feeling that I was getting faded. I haven’t heard from her today and assume we’re off for today.

He’s acted like he was interested (he would say i like u a lot and he would compliment me and say i’m cute, i have lots of guy friends and non of them act like that) so it was obvious at that point he liked me more than a friend. but then i also felt like i had to initiate dates after the first one. We were supposed to hang out today but yesterday he said “idk if i can hang out tomorrow :/“ with no reschedule or anything. When i said ok he changed the subject. 

Then yesterday he went to a friends bday party and he was texting me almost the whole time and sending me videos of him and stuff. So this morning i asked him how his night was. He sends me a series of voice messages, the last one being “i made out with a girl and yeah it was incredible” 

i replied that im glad he had a good time and that the hint was taken. and he was like what do you mean? and i said the message from his voice message where he talks about making out with a girl has been heard loud and clear.

I thought that relationships are all about emotional support, companionship, growth, passion, but also work. Now, I can't say that these things mentioned previously are that impactful.

Emotional support? Don't need it that much / Doesn't feel supported even when my SO genuinely tries to do it.
Companionship? I'm used to being a lone wolf, so it doesn't change that much; sometimes it's more fun, sometimes it's too much companionship.
Growth? I have not seen any specific personal growth from being in this relationship I'm in. On the other side, I was able to motivate my SO to become better and they did, there is change. I have not really changed, maybe the problem is me or maybe not.
Passion? Yeah, a little bit, but it is very chill. At least there is some sort of physicality.
