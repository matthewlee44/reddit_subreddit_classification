Let me tell you my story. I'm kinda surprised and disappointed right now.. I would like to understand the situation.

So.. I'm talking with a guy since 1,5 months. Everything was going great and we spent the last three week-ends together. He was constantly texting me, asking to meet me, making plans about coming to see me again or cooking again for me. He even kissed me in the middle of the street last time when I told him the week-end together was great. At the end of the day, he was holding me so tight and didn't want to let me go. 

During the 3 week-ends together, we just did some preliminaries but nothing more. I wanted to take it slow. And everything was going well for both of us. He even seemed more into me that I was.

After that, he got suddenly distant. I asked him if something was off and if he still wanted to meet me.. He told me he was just busy with work (he has to finish a paper). But he got colder and the dynamic between us changed. It's been one week that he's more distant, and 2 days that I don't got news, despite the fact that he's always online. I don't understand what happened so suddenly and I don't want to act clingy/needy. Some advices ?

He expressed that he had all of this work to do and that he was starting to get worried about it, but not only that, that he’s “worried that I like him more than he likes me” (even though prior to this it was the other way around) but he thinks it’s just gonna take him a little longer as he does have feelings for me.

He said he thinks taking things slow is the best thing for both of us right now and I completely agreed. So, I told him not to message me the next day or the days following and to just get his head down and get some work done and to message me when he feels a little clearer.

But to my surprise she said that she was talking to her ex again and she would like to remain friends with me if I were ok with it. Later that night when I got home I texted her that I was fine being friends but she told me she likes me as well and doesn't want our relationship to end because of her ex but she needs time to which I said ok. Next day she massages me and says that she misses me?! I told her that I missed her as well and that was the end of our conversation she went offline.

   One night  About a week later I told her if she could come out with me to which she said that her mom wouldn't let her, later that night she posted an Instagram story that she was out with a guy that she told me she hated so much?!

 Every time that we chatted and she talked about her ex she would say that she loves me more and she wishes that she saw me before she saw her.  So that was it after that in the span of 3 months we saw each other about 3 times which every time she told me to come out I found out that she got in a fight with her ex again.  Every time she posted Instagram stories with me then I found out she did because her ex was insecure about me.  

 Last night she asked me out and arrived 40 minutes late she even brought her friend like we hadn't seen each other in 2 months and nothing happened and kept talking about another guy that she has developed a crush (I think she does this on purpose to see my reaction once she kept talking about her ex and my friend asked her why does she talk about her so much to which she replied I want to see \[ME\]'s reaction) on meanwhile she's back with her ex.....  

Note that every time we have went out in the past 4-5 months she asked me out and sometimes when she makes plans she even flakes about 4-5 time now. she has never agreed to come out when I ask her, not even once. 

 I never liked someone so much but I can't take this anymore day and night I'm thinking about her but when I see that she doesn't even care about me or that she doesn't value me at all it destroys me. Even my mental health is getting worse and worse even close to when I was extremely unhappy with my  life I can't even sleep right.

For it to be legally and morally acceptable to date someone is highly dependent on the country you live in. For instance, a 20 year old dating a 16 year old would be regarded as creepy in a typical reddit discussion where majority are from NA, and it would (at least in many states) be illegal if there were sexual intercourse involved. On the other hand, we can take the same scenario and implement it in a swedish forum and it would be acceptable, both morally and legally. That's what I've noticed when I browse for questions. People tend to have completely different mindsets depening if you live in the NA , EU or other continents.

Now, obviously we can make a conclusion that the laws on the age of consent and the age of adulthood in different countries are flawed which is unfortunate. A scientific fact we know is that the human brain isn't done developing (frontal cortex) until the age of 25 and that's when the human brain reaches a stage of maturity, yet we still regard 18 year old as adults. Or let's mention the fact that you can't drink until you are 21 but you can buy assault rifles when you are 18 in the US.

So what law is really right in the end? That's my first question.

Secondly, I wonder why there is such a prevalent hypocrisy in regards with age gaps. Today I've browsed on reddit and people even had a problem with 17 year olds hanging out with 20 year olds, especially if the younger part is female and the older is male. But when such scenarios really occur in public, people don't seem to care about it. Let's take FaZe Clan as an example. When Jarvis who has 16-17 years old at the time joined this clan, he hanged out with people who were 5-10+ years older than him. No one even mentioned that being weird. And there are A LOT of real examples like this. But if I decided to post this on reddit ""Im 16, is it normal for me to hang out with a 25 year old"" you would have very few people actually thinking it's normal, ESPECIALLY americans.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,793641,public,self,Society and age gaps,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nk5dz8/society_and_age_gaps/,all_ads,6,,,

I was feeling a special connection with this girl. She was the only girl i could barely talk to. I can’t believe this happened. I’ve never been good with girls, and people in general, i always felt like trash ( being 18 and still never been in a relationship can hurt ).

It got a lot of positive feedback before it was removed by a mod who disagreed with the premise. Hopefully this sub is more open to debate and discussion and will not do the same

I’m writing this as a rejection of all modern online dating advice that I’ve read for the past year. I believe men and women are suffering due to a small minority of loud, miserable and anti-social people who exist on Reddit. These people tell men and women that the only appropriate place to ask someone out is on an app or at a bar/party and that every other place should be deemed as “harassment” and “creepy”. I should point out that when I refer to Reddit, Im referring to it as a whole. This sub is a lot more accepting to “alternative” ways of dating and pick-up, obviously

I will talk about this from a man’s perspective because I’m a guy

The modern advice is problematic for men in many ways.

#### Most men are not successful in online dating and should abandon it now that the pandemic is mostly over in the US

* Online dating is a multibillion dollar industry. The way they make money is by having a large, single male population that pays for premium services. Their goal is not to actually get you into long-lasting and or fulfilling relationships. Their goal is dopamine hits that get you to pay more. The stats don’t lie. Most men get very few matches. Even when they do get matches, the conversations rarely go anywhere. There is a small minority of men who do have success, but 90% do not and are just wasting time and money.
* This time could be used for other activities, work, exercise, social activities, or day and or night game
* Just on the basis of demographics, the user base for most dating apps ranges between 60–90 percent male users. Let’s assume a 1 to 1 pairing for everyone. If the user base is 75 percent male, 50 percent would be left without a “pair”. Meaning people like me, as a straight guy, literally have no one left to actually match with you (if you fall into the bottom x percent of profiles). This is theoretical and actually worse due to how people actually swipe on these apps.
* This is not to blame women. How do you possibly expect women to sift through hundreds to literally thousands of potential matches, solely by going off of 2d images and profiles that are about 30 words long? I’ve talked to a lot of women about this. All of them say it’s virtually impossible to deal with. It is set up for failure. Bumble and Hinge have made this issue less of a problem, but it’s still a problem
* Attraction in real life has infinitely more variables than 2d images and a short profile that consists of 10–40 words. Body language, ability to carry an in-person conversation, voice, smell, height, body shape, muscle mass, pheromones, viewing people in real 3d life rather than 2d images that may or may not capture everything about them, actual interests, general intelligence, social and emotional intelligence, etc.
* Many of the things I stated above can be gauged in a short 5-minute conversation with a stranger in real life

#### I like to go out at night, but not that much

* I like to go out between 4–8 times a month. I think a lot of men my age (mid 20s) are in the same boat. Basically a Friday and or Saturday night. That’s it. And a lot of times, going out maybe a guy’s poker night or a small gathering in someone’s apartment. Many of us don’t go out to bars enough to actually make a dent in meeting attractive women

#### The case for “day game”, or at least abandoning the awful apps

* I’ve seen arguments against the day game so many times on Reddit. I believe it’s horrible advice. “Don’t ask out x person here because x person is trying to work on themselves in y way or do z activity without interruptions.” If your future wife or husband interrupted a set at the gym or while you were reading at a coffee shop, you would be mad at them for interrupting you? Give me a break. You’d likely be at least flattered, and at worst, uninterested.

#### Ill cite a few examples

* Don’t ask someone out at the gym because they are there to exercise
* Don’t ask someone out at the library because they are there to study
* Don’t ask someone out at the grocery store because they are there to buy food

#### Why the above is garbage advice (don’t ask out…), especially if you are looking for a long term and or fulfilling relationships

* Lets assume for a second that you reject the anti day game sentiment and actually ask someone out in one of these environments. Lets also assume that they say yes. Lets also assume that you marry this person or enter into a really great and fulfilling relationship with this person for a year or two. Are you going to look back and give a fuck that it was deemed an “inappropriate interaction” by some stranger who’s sitting in their basement jerking off all day on Reddit?

**Why “day game” is a good way to ask out women.**

Let’s use a few examples to create the argument in favor of it

* **Why should you ask out someone at the gym**
* You are both into health and fitness.
* If the person is there all of the time, they are likely not into partying and drinking (so you wouldn’t meet them at a bar)
* If youre there all the time, it is likely that you aren’t also
* You have things to talk about immediately to break the ice
* If she says no and you’re not completely socially inept, all you have to say is “no problem, feel free to say hi whenever you see me here. Im always open to new gym friends. Have a good workout.” And walk away. Ive asked out women a few times in the gym before. The notion that you or she has to change time or locations if you get rejected is nonsense. Just act like a normally socialized human after rejection and move on
* **Why you should ask someone out at the library**
* You likely go to the same college
* You at least up the odds of you both being introverted students (ie someone youd get along with more than someone you meet online or at a party)
* If she says no and you’re not completely socially inept, all you have to say is “no problem, feel free to say hi whenever you see me here. Im always open to new friends. If you see me here and want a break from studying, Im always open to taking breaks and talking.” And walk away

#### Why the “but you’re harassing women and they are afraid of you” argument is garbage, especially for the average Reddit (and now Medium) user

* Is there a subset of men who legitimately harass women? Absolutely. Is there a good reason that women should have their guard up for these specific men? Yes. Do 95–99% of men actually harass women. No
* Most men’s biggest fear is being rejected by women. I’ve personally learned to talk to women over the years and am pretty confident now when I’m around them. Asking out a woman, especially one that I find really beautiful, is still the thing that gives me more anxiety than any other activity. My heart literally shakes my chest. You can actually see if shaking my shirt. The only time I have gotten anywhere near as nervous as I do when asking out a woman that I’m very attracted to has been at the start of large speeches (ie 50 plus in the audience) or when I used to play sports and there was a decent-sized crowd (5k plus in attendance)
* **WOMEN — MOST MEN ARE TERRIFIED TO ASK YOU OUT**. By you telling guys on Reddit not to ask out girls in x environment, you are giving them the justification to living really lonely and isolating lives. Men’s depression is real, and one of the two primary causes is a lack of satisfying intimate relationships and lack of friends. The guys on Reddit are the guys that need encouragement. They aren’t having success on apps or in their social circles if they even have any. That’s why they come here. They aren’t generally bad guys. They are guys who are generally “not socially talented”, for lack of a better phrase. Do you really think a serial sexual harasser is reading Reddit advice on how to talk to women? No, they are fucking psychopaths who feel no emotion. The guys on here need encouragement.
* If you ask a woman out as a socially adept adult, 99% of the time they will not take your actions as “harassment”. Reddit (and the internet) is not Real Life

#### Why social circle is useful but deceptive

* Another piece of advice I hear on here is “join x club or do y activity to meet “quality” women”. That statement alone is entirely disingenuous. You are using social activities as a guise to pick up women, rather than gathering the courage to ask out women, whom you find attractive when you come across in your day to day life. Secondly, the notion that “quality” women exist in only these places is utter nonsense. They exist in many regular public and social environments, you just have to look
* Should you be social? Yes. Should you do social activities just to meet women? No. Is the current advice on a lot of forums to do just that? Yes, and its wrong

**Why I’m writing this**

* I am a guy who actually has had what some would deem “success” on dating apps. For the last 2.5 years, it has been my primary mode of meeting women. However, I have not had success in the sense of truly being in love or meeting women that I am deeply physically and emotionally attracted to. I have only been in love in my college and pre-college days because that is when I met women organically. I’ve had about 10 relationships (we’ll define a relationship as anything longer than 2 weeks of meeting in person) that lasted between 2 weeks and 6 months that came from the apps. I’ve probably been on 30–50 first dates, but I’ve honestly lost count.
* I don’t want this to be taken as not having success solely from lacking physical attraction. Have I gone out with girls who look nothing like their profile? Yes. I’ve gone out with a handful of very beautiful women from apps. With that being said, the conversation didn’t flow on our first date, I felt no emotional attraction, or they were beautiful, but just not the type of beauty that fits me best. I’m a very athletic guy who lives in the gym, and I like girls who are also really physically fit. Many of these girls were beautiful, but from conversations and their bodies, I could tell they weren’t gym rats like myself. Conversations were also sometimes hard primarily because we lacked common activities, common social circles, and common interests.
* As a side note, there were 3 women that I’ve worked with within the past that I would rank less than a 7 on physical attraction. If it was socially “acceptable” at work (or if I had the mindset at the time to reject the idea that it was “inappropriate”), I would’ve asked all of them out. They were women that I’d consider potentially “marriageable” material because I got to see how they acted “in person” and not through an iPhone. I’m not saying I would have married them, but I am saying that I had a deep attraction towards them that I have yet to feel towards someone Ive met through an app
* I’m tired of dating women that I’m not deeply attracted to and I’m tired of seeing garbage advice on Reddit. I’m sure many men and women on here feel exactly the same way that I do. I’ve lurked for a long time, but I finally made an account a couple of days ago solely to write about this topic.

#### My experiment

* Starting sometime in June, I am deleting all dating apps for meeting women. My methods of meeting women will be split up into 3 categories.
* ***“Day Game”*** — we’ll define this as meeting any woman in a normal day-to-day activity that I do. This could be the gym, shopping, taking a walk, etc
* ***“Night Game”*** — we’ll define this as meeting women at any party, bar or club venue. Concerts/festivals/sporting events (if any happen) will fall under this category, even if they occur during the day
* ***“Social Circle”*** — We’ll define this as social activities like fitness classes, intramural sports, etc
* I will also be giving up masturbation. This is an idea that Im taking from Mark Manson who has written books like “The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck” and “Models: Attract Women Through Honesty.” He limits his masturbation to at most once a week. He does this because it forces him to be more social. I am doing it for the same reason — as a means to motivate myself to actually talk to people in real life. If I jerk off, it will just be an excuse not to put myself out there and meet potential future long term relationships that satisfy me
* I will set a number of women I want to ask out per month. For example, 10-day game approaches, 20-night game approaches, and 2 social circle approaches. I have not set the actual numbers yet. I will do the math first to see what is reasonable. For example, approaching 20 girls at the gym a month is unreasonable. Ill probably see a few that Im really into, and Ill focus on talking to them for that month. So for that, the goal may be an optimistic 5, with a minimum of 3. I don’t know yet
* The experiment will run until I get into a relationship that Im very satisfied with. This could last a month, or years. I have no idea

Hopefully I’ll learn things along the way and motivate other guys and girls to get the courage to ask out people they find attractive and ignore the haters that exist online",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,793780,public,self,A Rejection of Modern Dating Methods — Delete your Apps Post Pandemic,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nk72ge/a_rejection_of_modern_dating_methods_delete_your/,all_ads,6,,,

I (25F) got married at 19 &amp; divorced at 22 (I mean who didn’t see that coming). As soon as I left my ex husband, I started a casually dating &amp; met my most previous ex, let’s call him John. Apologies in advance for rambling. 

John was never anyone I expected to end up dating, but he’s a fantastic people person &amp; I absolutely loved how fun he was  so about 4 months after meeting on tinder we started dating as officially boyfriend &amp; girlfriend. Two weeks later he got a dui &amp; lost his job but that didn’t matter to me since again, still wasn’t expecting anything suuuper serious &amp; was just trying to let loose. Eventually (8 months) things got more serious, “I love you”s where said, &amp; he started getting his life together somewhat. Flash forward 2 years later &amp; I realize, I don’t just want to have *fun* anymore. I care about him, we’ve spent so much time together, but I’m realizing I healed from the hurt of my failed marriage &amp; want to try it again some day. He however is pretty comfy in his lifestyle but still says he wants to progress. Not much progressed, things festered within me &amp; when I brought it all up he cried a lot &amp; asked if we could go on a break while he sorts out some priorities instead of just breaking up then &amp; there. 

During this time I of course felt unspectacular since he wasn’t moving at the same pace as I was, and hopped on bumble to see what else was out there. Had some casual chats, flirted, exchanged Snapchat’s, and planned on going out with a guy, let’s name him Ted. Things didn’t end up happening so I deleted him off Snapchat, thinking he had been trying to ghost me.  No worries, I wasn’t expecting anything to happen &amp; didn’t want anything too. 

Back to John. Our break ended after a week &amp; a half, we decided to give it another go as long as he continued to show me he wanted to progress our relationship as well as continue to working on himself (prioritize work, no excessive drinking, take control of his life’s goals, treat me more like his girlfriend of 2 years instead of one of his bros). Well, not even a week later he was back to doing what he wanted &amp; I started feeling the resentment building up for giving him another chance. I realized how much he helped me grow as a human being since being so broken, and as much as I loved him I realized I don’t think he will be the person I reach my own personal goals with (I am very career oriented now &amp; plan on settling down before I’m 30, where as he is not). He saw the breakup coming, we reminisced the good times, cried &amp; laughed, said we still loved each other then parted ways. Healthiest breakup of my life. 

So, was that a rebound? (My best friend believes it was)

The reason I question it is the next day after the breakup, I added Ted back on Snapchat &amp; we went out a few days later. Quick I know, but again I felt very happy about how healthy the breakup went &amp; don’t mind the idea of meeting someone new since I finally know exactly what I want out of life. We actually had a fantastic time &amp; Ted surprisingly ticked a lot of boxes of what I would want from a serious partner (not rushing into anything now, but it’s refreshing knowing that). I wasn’t expecting to want to go on another date but here we are.

Anyways, the bulk of things:
I think that I realize that drinking, smoking/vaping (the devil's grass (ha!) or otherwise), and some recreational drugs sprinkled here and there has always been an enjoyable pastime for people. I think a lot of people older than me (a 20 y/o NB) always talk a lot about meeting people at bars or random smoking spots, but it seems even more prevalent in online dating nowadays to ask people to engage in recreational substance use as a way of meeting potential people. I personally have no problem with other people doing so! I think that substances in moderation is a good and fun time, and this is coming from someone with a lot of generational addiction in the family. However, I don't really do any of that, and it seems to be gaining much more popularity with the pandemic seemingly changing for the better. Yes, I'm young, and I have a lot of time to explore my interest in the aforementioned activities, but I personally just don't really care for them. It seems to be getting harder and harder to meet people who, on the surface of these dating apps, seem okay with another person who doesn't engage with it at all.

Tl;dr - I don't really have any questions like ""What do I do?"", so I guess this turned into more of a rant about substance use being super popular on dating apps. It sucks! I want to try things eventually, with someone I'm comfortable with, but I just want to date and do the dirty without perceived pressure to be okay around all that stuff.

Awkward sidenote: After a recent ""get-together"" (what would I even call it?) with someone, I've personally learned that kissing cigarette smokers is actually fine or even pretty good! I hate the smell of anything smoked (except that fresh BBQ), something I internally cringed at when they started smoking in front of me later! 😂😭 This sucks.

Happiness from Heartbreak

How Could I be Happy from Heartbreak?

The expected end came and went.

I fought to avoid it but we were two worlds apart.

My heart didn’t see what the eyes saw,

It only felt you. 

 

I tried my best,

But what you wanted was just a toy and I wanted more.

You wanted the fruits of a relationship without its toils.

I wanted it all.

 

I cried and mourned for the beauty that I hope would prevail,

For the good I saw in your eyes. 

I didn’t give a fuck about your baggage, I would have helped you carry it.

But what you did to me is what you did to others,

You left me on my knees.

 

How Could I be Happy from Heartbreak?

You changed me.

Our time together was enough.

Enough for you to show the best of me.

Enough to show me a world where it’s possible for me to be that man to someone.

 

My heart aches, my eyes burn from the streams of tears,

But my spirit is full of hope. 

I will miss you dearly.

A tragic dusk made for a beautiful dawn.

 You gave me one last gift in the end,

I am now ready for love.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,794013,public,self,Happiness from Heartbreak - A Poem by Frank Reteguiz,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nka4ki/happiness_from_heartbreak_a_poem_by_frank_reteguiz/,all_ads,6,,,

I have only approached 2 strangers in my life. But got all rejected. I like to know your experience of approaching guys in public?

One is a neighbour we used to catch the same bus home after work. After a couple of months, I talked to him first and asked if he likes to grab a coffee sometime. I approached him because I found him checking me out a few times, which encouraged me to talk to him. It turns out he was married. Unfortunately I did not check out his hand...my bad. But he was friendly, he said :""I would love to, but I am married."" I was super embarrassed, I apologised and ran away.

Few years later, I often run into this cute guy at train station after work. Also I found him looking at me a few times and look away quickly when I look back at him. My friend encouraged me to talk to him, they said he must be shy. But I am not so sure. One night, I was standing in the middle of the platform waiting for the train. He walked over to me and stood right next to me. Usually, he would walk to the end of the platform to wait for the train. But this time he stood next to me. I really thought he wanted to talk to me but he is just too shy to approach me. So finally the next day, I gave him a quick note with my number on it. He texted me and said ""Sorry, I've been seeing someone."" I am very annoyed at myself mis-interpreted all those signs. I just want to dig a hole in the ground and jump straight in. And I have been very upset over this. It happened last week.

It reminds me of some guys' posts here saying that girls checking them out but after the guys approached them, girls either say they are not interested or they have a bf. I can understand how frustrated you are...

AND i get girls hitting on me, often girls that i meet a few times at some event or similar. BUT, tinder is not working out for me, got like 10 matches when swiping right on every girl i found in my town.

So, how come i ended up a wizard? (wizard when virgin at 30 right?) Not really sure. Spent 6 months with a psychatrist talking about this, he couldn't really give me a background for the problem, he only said it sounded like anxiety. Triggered when girls hit on me and i am interested in them. I freeze up, get afraid and pretty much do anything to avoid the situation. 

I got some tools from the psychatrist to be able to handle these situations, but i need to practice by actually being exposed to situations with girls i am interested in and vice versa. But this shitty pandemic is not really the perfect time for that. So i have no idea if this really works.

So, what else can i do to increase my chances to finally experience intimacy and love? Anyone been in a similar situation that got advice? Should i dare try tinder again?

Or am i doomed to for ever seek advice from professionals to try figure out my brain and behaviour that is preventing me from having a normal sex/love life?

I had been thinking about asking her if she wanted to FaceTime for about a little under a month now. I kept putting it off because of my nerves. But today, I asked myself a couple questions. 

If not now, when? It's not like we're just magically going to get more comfortable with each other, making it easier to FaceTime by just snapchatting. 

What do I have to lose? Well she could say no which would tell me where I stand with her. Assuming she has the time and says yes, what's worst case then? Probably just some break in conversation, which is never as bad as I think it is

And then I had a friend tell me the other day ""no successful person didn't take any risks"" and well, that's true. Sometimes you just have to say fuck it.

Me and my first gf broke up before lockdown hit my country and having been pretty much in and out of lockdown since then until only recently, dating is fairly new to me. I've had some successes, some people I knew irl and asked out and some on tindr. Through it all I also got rejected...alot. When I first got rejected, I took it pretty hard, I think because I was so new to dating and it's the first time i've been actively pursuing relationships and such. My first relationship came when I wasn't looking for it so it was kinda disheartening to be putting in effort and have it not come to anything.

But after a few rejections, I had some successes. Now I'd start seeing someone for a lil bit and then it would fade out. The first few times this happened I felt kind of disheartened , because I wasn't used to it. But now I'm becoming so comfortable being rejected. When it happens I just shrug my shoulders, feel proud that I at least made the effort and got my answer in the end and then I move on. If I go on a few dates then get rejected, that can be a bit of a harder blow but (as cliche as it sounds) it's character building. You realise that theres no guarantee that things will work out with anyone but if they don't work out you'll come out the other end and be ok. I remember for a while having a massive ""losing"" streak, where I didn't get any dates for months. But I realised that's just life, things go up to come down again and so on. Sometimes the downs last longer but they don't have to be negative experiences! It's a real magnifying glass on your self esteem and any issues you might have. You gotta question why you feel that way, why are giving someone that much power to make you sad and why you shouldn't take it too personally. Sometimes people just don't like you in that way, and that's ok.

Bottomline is, you've got to have perseverance. Not perseverance in bugging one person who rejects you but just perseverance to keep trying with other people. Keep an open mind, have enough confidence in yourself that you know you'll be happy even if you get rejected or you don't get that second/third date. It's all a learning experience, and furthermore I've learnt to spot warning signs and red flags. Know when to give up or when someone you are speaking too has lost interest but is just replying to stay polite. 

So yeah, to anyone who is having a bit of a dry streak, don't stress. Keep your head up and believe that you are worthy of someone, you just haven't found the right someone yet. Everything will work out just fine, just keep at it and try not to get disheartened. Saying that, don't be afraid to take a break from dating if that's what you need. Remember that you come first, and that other people should put themselves first too so it's ok if they do that and reject you because it doesn't feel right for them. But if you can handle it, go out there, take some licks but keep ticking because you never know what's just around the corner!",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,794178,public,self,Getting rejected is still a beneficial experience,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nkcyvo/getting_rejected_is_still_a_beneficial_experience/,all_ads,6,,,

Went on a first date last Thursday, went well, got along, she texted me after that she had a great time. I was leaving town the next day and returning today, so I said we should do it again when I get back and she said yes.

We texted off and on all weekend, nothing intense but just a bit of chit chat.

Last night I sent her a text asking when she may be available to get together this week and she responded this morning saying that she may be working late all week before she leaves town next weekend and doesn't know her schedule at the moment, she went on to explain that she lost an employee at work (this had been mentioned as a possibility on our first date), and needs to reshuffle/transition people and only has a week to do it. Then asked if I fly back today, which i said yea.

Totally understandable, and probably stressful, so obviously she is busy. I texted her saying basically that really sucks that that happened, what a pain it must be, and that that's a lot to deal with.

Followed that up with ""I am really flexible in the evening this week so just let me know!""

And didn't hear anything back after that. I don't want to lose touch with her, especially just because she is having a busy week, that I totally understand.

My cat I had for 10 years just died in my arms this morning. I was a total wreck. He had cancer and wasn't doing well but he might have pulled though. I stayed up all night dripping food and water into his mouth and he passed in my arms this morning. ive been a crying moping mess all day and now Idk y but I’m mad at my bf.

We had plans to go out tonight because he’s leaning to his relatives for 2 months tom(his flight is at 12) but last night I called him and told him I didn't know about tommow night(tonight) bc he was so sick I thought I was gonna have to put him down in the morning(this morning) and if I didn’t put him down i didn’t know if I could leave my baby in my roomates care for the night. He said he really wanted me to come over and even if he was put down he said he didn’t want me to be alone and I could just be sad over at his place.

he passed away this morning in my arms and after I took him in I just laid around. I feel like total shit.

he messaged me at 4oclock. ( I thought it was because he’d slept in bc he stayed up late with me but he posted earlier. I was upset at first that he didnt txt me as soon as he got up but I’m just overreactiNg so I’m not really mad I guess.) he just says “hey.” And I text him that Oliver(my cat) passed this morning. he gave the usual Im sorry and how are you holding up and I tell him I’ve just been lazing around and my roomie got me food but I’m not feeling hungry just like a blob. He replied that he wasnt hungry either and that he was out w/ 2 friends and he didnt order anything. I just text him how I’m feeling and I’m sad and shit. i can tell he didn’t really know what to say and his replies start coming 10 min after I send him something and I know he’s out with friends so I feel bad so I just say “I’ll let you get back to your friends text later?” And he just says yea and thats it.

its now 7:30(the original time i said I’d come over) and not a word. It’s been 2 hrs Since we texted and I think he’s at his place with his friends. idk y but I just don’t want to be alone and even tho I’d just curl up into a ball over there and cry I don’t want to sleep alone in my bed for the first time in 10 years. I’m really with him bc I feel like I’m being avoided bc I’m depressed. Is it wrong if me to be mad at him right now? I know last night I said I didn’t know how I’d feel or if I’d be up to it to come over but now I feel so alone. I just want to be held. I didn’t tell him that Im lonely and I want to mope at his place tho. do I even have the right to be upset? How do I get myself to not be mad at him. i dont want to tell him he can’t hang out with fries and he has to be around me but Im so overwhelmed with emotion right now I don’t think I’m thinking straight.

But there are two things about him that really trigger me. I know that I suffer from low self-esteem and that I can be a jealous person, so I don’t want this to dictate my life and I’d rather get your opinion:

He made this comment that while flying (he’s a pilot), he will be around many beautiful airhostesses who he’d want to fuck, and that I have to trust him enough to make sure he won’t. I know that it’s normal to get attracted to others in a relationship, but I don’t think I’ve ever experienced something like that myself. When I was in a relationship, I had no desire to have sex with anyone else and I got the impression from the guys that I was dating that it was the same for them. Are all guys really like this? Am I being too unrealistic expecting him to only be attracted to me? 

Other than that he told me that he’s had a sexual relationship with some of his friends, which kind of irritates me. I know that it’s all in the past, but I just couldn’t bear the thought of hanging out with his friends, knowing this information. Besides this, since the sexual relationship in question with some friends was continuous, I’m not sure if he still would want to fuck them now. 

For me, wanting to have sex with someone else in a relationship, is almost as bad as actually sleeping with someone else. And it’s not like he’s sex deprived or something. We have A LOT of sex. It’s clearly that he just wants variety, claiming that it’s only a human thing.

What would you do in this situation? I don’t want to give him up just like that, because it’s been a really long time that someone’s made me feel that way and apart from this, I have no complaints.

I \[26m\] have been seeing someone \[28m\] regularly for about three months. Things were difficult with Covid logistics in the beginning, but we were seeing each other at least once a week and had a talk about how we weren't seeing anyone else. He's not out to many people, including his family, which is a bit of a minefield, but I want to see where things go. 

At some point I want to have a serious conversation about it - I get that everyone is on their own journey with sexuality, but I also don't want to feel dishonest about the person I'm seeing, which is essentially what'll happen if he can't be authentic with me.

At any rate, we used to text regularly - but over the last week or so I've noticed we're playing phone tag with about a day in-between. When either of us are out of town this is normal, and I still have feelings for him so I'm probably overplaying it, but I can't help thinking we're losing steam.

She was hiding all of this from him. She wanted to marry him because she didn't want to deal with her bipolar alone, if they were married it would be just as much his responsibility to manage it as it was hers. Some people agreed with her  and said that she should definitely wait to tell him she was bipolar until after they got married, that way if he was impulsive and tried to leave her then it would be a lot harder for him to do that and if he did she would at least be able to take half of his stuff and therefore not be left with nothing. Apparently the cheating didn't need to be brought up because it wasn't even really her that did it, it was someone else, so it really didn't affect their relationship. I took screenshots of the entire thing and sent them to her fiance. I told him I was sorry. He thanked me and said that I shouldn't feel bad or be sorry. I don't feel bad for doing it. I'll do it again. I don't care. I do feel bad for him though. He seemed like a nice guy. I don't understand why people are like that. Why people are so devoid of conscience. I just don't get it. 

I always advice people to trust but verify. No one like to live with regrets or wonder what the future may hold when you can get the answer's now!!! Cheating shows a lack of morality, it is a mindset that is created and shaped from early childhood. It shows opportunistic traits. It demonstrates a lack of intrinsic moral fibre. It shows that the person thought so little about their partner that they then made a calculated decision to have sex with someone else. So the reason it is once a cheater always a cheater is because you cant change the nature of a snake.
To be honest cheating starts with a message. It's why i recommend that people seek the truth before it gets too late.

I'm 28 male she's 28 Female.

It was rainy so we chilled at her place and I met her child and brother for the first time!
So I brought coffee and a 20 pack of Timbits, we sat and talked then she took me to her room and thing's got even more romantic.

We rolled up a few joints and toked together while listening to music, I got all lovey dovey because I was baked so we talked and cuddled.
Eventually I gave her a massage she layed down and I rubbed her back mounting her from behind I worked from her shoulders down to her back thighs and yes I massaged her butt.

I was actively trying to seduce her again but her little one came and wanted to cuddle up with mommy with her tablet and blanket.

 she started saying her back hurts too so I gave her little one a little back rub too while I massaged mom.
Her daughter is 2 but knew already to give us alone time but she wanted loves too so nap time came and her brother comes over so we roll up another joint and talked about school, our jobs and video games.

I hit it out of the park with her brother he actually likes me, she told me he can be finicky with people but he liked me we geeked out over Dark Souls.

So I spent 6hrs with her but it was so quick she just before I had to leave I told her that I could give her a better massage in her room now that we're alone and I suggested our 3rd date to be a sleep over, she said not yet and now those puppy dog eyes won't work.

Again I was hoping to have sex with her today but I don't feel the need to rush like I do with most girls usually I'd be concerned that she hasn't yet.
I.

I think she's teaching me how to be a proper boyfriend, I moved so fast with so many girls, I know realized I was doing it wrong I've slept with all my exes day one all of them are now well exes.

But I'm going to keep trying to seduce her with increasing levels of romance and getting creative with my seduction, I just hope it isn't too long of a wait for intimacy I like her and I'm starting to fall for her hard, I'd like to get more physical.
Tomorrow I'm bringing my impact driver over and putting together a play set for her daughter.
