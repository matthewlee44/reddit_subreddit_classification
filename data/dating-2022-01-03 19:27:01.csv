0,rvhzb3,1641260052,How to get over past trauma to make myself a more desirable partner? (18f),"Growing up, my parents weren't the type of people who loved each other. They would never kiss in public, and would often mention the possibility of getting divorced. My mom is often mean to and about my dad, exaggerating his failures, and complaining that he doesn't do more. (Why can't you build the addition to our house so we don't need to hire contractors? Redo the plumbing? Hold a job?)

My dad often threatened to leave, crying and calling my mom a bully, although he wasn't really the victim. He had a temper and would typically resort to hitting me, but sometimes my mom. 

Because of my parents relationship, I've always tried to be the opposite. I'd overlook a lot, and shower my partner with affection, which can sometimes be too much. I'd feel uncomfortable making him pay, so I'd offer to pay for myself or us both a lot of the time, bake his favorite cookies and be very attentive. On the other side, sometimes I would get a boyfriend just for the sake of being in a relationship and having someone there for me, which usually ends in me breaking up with him out of boredom.  It's hard for me to have any self worth in myself when I'm not in a relationship, which leads to the scary thoughts of me being alone forever.

In addition to this, I was also sexualized from a young age. I hit puberty at about 7, and would do anything possible to hide it, often wearing baggy clothes, and crying that I couldn't be small and skinny like the other girls. I was also one of the firsts to get into a ""relationship"" in middle school, where I started feeling a little more confident about myself. By the time I was 14, I was ""dating"" a science teacher at another school (he was 22) and while I didn't feel taken advantage of,  we were kinky and I had an  ""older"" boyfriend, which made me feel more mature than the other 14 year olds. He was also the first traditionally attractive guy to be into me. Even though I'm sure he was a pedophile, it was hard to see when he never treated me anything but good. He'd hug me extra tight when he saw the bruises from my dad, and cheer me up with my favorite foods. He told me he loved me and wrote me love songs, which was something entirely new to me. He even wanted to tell my parents he loved me, even if that meant we couldn't be alone until I was 18. 

My parents didn't take it well, and threatened to send him to jail. Heartbroken, I tried to distract myself by getting a job, and ended up doing some things I regret with a guy in his early twenties, who 100% sexualized me for my age, calling me jailbait and bragging to all our coworkers. I just wanted a one night thing, and he got angry and called me names when he realized I didn't want to continue. My other coworkers (19-21) tried to hit on me then, and still try today. 

I ended up dating a 17 y old coworker for a few months when I was 15, but looking back, he only wanted me because everyone else did, and would often brag about all the stuff we did.  He also did drugs and got us into multiaple car accidents. When I noticed he wasn't as interested, I hooked up with his friend to make him jealous, making him love me all over again. His friend forced me to kiss him once and then tried telling me to leave my coworker and be with him, and still sends me unsolicited nudes and videos a few times a year. After all that, I've been trying to create a better reputation for myself, and even though it's been years of me resisting their advances, they still try. Even the married ones. I'm not sure if it's because of how I look, or my reputation. Aside from the friend forcing me to kiss him, another coworker started grabbing my ass once, which makes me feel gross and sexually assaulted. 

I downloaded a dating site a few months before my 16th birthday, just for the validation, I told myself, and ended up getting 300+ matches. I hit it off with one guy there, who was thankfully only 4 years older. We hooked up a lot and tried dating on and off unsuccessfully. He didn't feel sparks with me, which he said was mainly because of my crazy family and me being too judgmental. We've stopped having sex, and since then just been friends, although I still think I have some feelings for him.  Even though we're friends and keep it respectful, he'll still tell me I'm really hot.

Right now I want to get back into dating, but I feel too messed up to do it. My one friend told me I'm really broken, which makes it hard, while another told me my crazy parents scare people away. I skipped my last year of highschool too, which makes me feel really different from all my community college classmates who are all 25ish, although all my best friends are in their mid twenties. I just feel really isolated and unlovable, and I don't know where to start.

For example, I was pondering having a friend come over tonight for cuddles &amp; sex because I have an emotional bond with her and trust her.

17,rvjnv9,1641264786,I‚Äôm finding that men like to have sex before getting into an exclusive relationship more and more,"I had been in LTR a relationship for almost 3 years so I am ‚Äònew‚Äô again to the dating scene and dating apps. I find that guys have been a bit more casual than they were 3 years ago. Maybe it‚Äôs me? Idk. But when I was 24-25 years old guys would take me out on real dates and try to court me in a more serious manner. Sex was practically off the table unless me and them had an understanding that we were exclusive and not seeing anyone else.

Now it feels like things happen backwards. You go out casually to a brewery or a laid back dinner and chat for a couple hours. Then by date 3/4 you‚Äôre having sex and then they either ghost you or take it serious enough to consider an actual relationship. This guy and I were basically just boning, and then he bought me Christmas gifts, and then asked me out on the fanciest date when he finally came around to asking if I was interested in a relationship with him. I thought that was extremely backwards. I also found it hard to take him seriously now.

Then it happened again. I casually started seeing this guy; we both went in with no expectations and the chemistry is crazy insane. He really wanted to have sex though (and so did I admittedly). I thought he would ghost but he actually started stepping his game up and took me on a much more serious date with a conversation at the end of the night basically asking where do I see this going and if I wanted something a bit more ‚Äòserious‚Äô. Am I a crazy person or is this backwards? It‚Äôs like you have to win a guy over in bed for him to consider actually dating you..

Am I dating the wrong guys? Guy #2 I actually ended up having another conversation about dating and becoming exclusive. He is my boyfriend now but it feels totally backwards the way we arrived here.

First trip we went to Disney world and a hotel and had crazy fun for like a week.
Second trip I got to be with her in her house and sleep in her bed for 10 days ending tomorrow.

We broke up because long distance is too tough she needed someone to live in while I didn't wanna leave my job and family back home and I can't move her out because it's too expensive. Also my parents divorce gave me commitment issues. 

I didn't realize how good having a good family was until I met her but her dating someone who lives w his parents meant someone able to help her financially so even tho she never asked me I always helped out because I'm in a safe enough spot to.

This relationship wasn't exactly the happily ever after we are both really different with little in common but I think it was really eye opening and life changing to what really could be.

We were both virgins who only dated off the internet and then we met and learned so much about everything. Cuddling is the greatest thing ever. Sharing something with someone you love is unrivaled. Nsfw stuff is nice but really its just a bonus.

We are quite serious about this relationship, but he hasn‚Äôt asked me to be his gf yet.

For New Year‚Äôs we traveled together, to a town close to were we live. (I live in Latin America)

We attended a small party on New Years, and we both got quite drunk. When I got to the hotel I immediately fell asleep.

The next morning when I woke up, he was already up and seemed kinda mad?

I asked what was wrong and he said he had gone through my phone and found my texts with my ex.  (We hadn‚Äôt had talked for months, he wanted to see me  I replied that that could be a possibility but never said yes. I honestly didn‚Äôt want to see him)

He was uncomfortable because months back I had told him about my ex, who wanted to see me and give me what he had bought on his trip, and I said that I was not interested. 

But he saw on the texts that I had asked him what it was, so I was showing I was ‚Äúinterested‚Äù. 

I honestly think it was just polite conversation. 

I‚Äôm feeling a little bit conflicted, a bit angry because he went through my phone, and a little bit guilty because I feel he is taking the conversation out of context, plus he was very drunk, he doesn‚Äôt even remember exactly what he read.

I was worried about the expectation for sex but all we did was just cuddle and kiss. Never had that experience before. It was quite nice

We were wanting to just hang out again. I'm nervous about it because I'm not sure how I'm going to feel once I start dating again and I know we are both kind of putting a distance between us and keeping our guard up.

But tonight we had a really deep conversation. I talked about my feelings, and he opened up about some things he's never talked about it. We have similar experiences and reactions to things.

But anyways, he's a drummer and tonight he asked me to be his date to one of his gigs. He has a few gigs coming up and only one is in town and the others are out of town on we are going to ride together.

36,rvkhl2,1641267213,I think this guy is still with his girlfriend .... but I need outside perspective,"I (F26) met ""Joe"" (M23) 4 years ago on tinder. He goes to college out of state and we have hooked up off and on for the past 4 years when he comes home. We usually reconnect when one of us is single ... we definitely use each other as rebound sex. 

Anyways, 3 weeks ago I wanted to hit him up but then I looked at his instagram and twitter and there were pictures with a girl so I assumed he was in a relationship and didn't hit him up.   

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to Christmas he texts me. We exchange pleasantries (I'm going through a breakup and he says he just got out of something ... mind you all the pictures are still on social media). I go over to see him and I ask more information about the break up. He says he ended it a week ago but they are still in contact. I asked for confirmation that they weren't together.  I wanted to hook up but I'm not about fucking people who are in relationships. He said it was still fresh and that's why the pictures are still up. We hook up. He goes back to school  and we keep texting. The agreement is that if he gets back with his ex we will stop talking (we've always been friends and the conversation hasn't been sexual for the most part). However, I think it is inappropriate to be friends with someone you hooked up with while in a relationship. When I have gotten into a relationship I have cut off contact. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to this week, I followed him on instagram and he didn't follow me back which is weird but I was like whatever. Him and his ex both play basketball. He shared a photo from the female basketball team with his ex and another girl and tagged them both in it... this is when I really thought something was weird. And then today I noticed that his story hadn't popped up on my feed so I searched his name and he was gone. I realized I was blocked. I asked him why and he said ""My ex has my ig so she probably recognized you and blocked you.""

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't responded because that seems like a load of bullshit to me. I've never given an SO access to my social media but if I did I'm sure that would be the first thing I would cut off their access too even if we were still talking.

The market where I live is horrible.","So yeah, I live in a pretty big house with my siblings and parents. I'm the youngest and I'm 28. This has normally never been an issue with me for dating because everyone in my area understands how expensive it is to live on your own. My family is also extremely chill when it comes to people coming over, or staying the night as our house is very big and we practically have our own sections that aren't on top of each other.  


That being said, I have wanted to move out for a LONG time. I moved out with an ex in 2015 to an apartment but then she and I moved back in with my parents to try and save for a house. Low and behold, we break up in 2019 and those savings went away during covid after losing my job and trying to pay off medical debt/car bills. Those are all taken care of but I now I can't afford a house. I really want out though. I know I have a good living situation but I want my freedom. I refuse to live with my parents when I'm 30, even though I love them. I still pay rent so it's not like I'm freeloading.   


My question is, at this point with dating am I better off trying to save for a house and potentially not moving out until I'm like 32/34? Or do I find a job that pays enough and go month to month. Do women prefer guys with apartments or houses? I know damn well they prefer I don't live with my parents.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rvkkcf/still_live_with_my_parents_almost_30_and_i_plan/

Anyways, the other night I was at a wine bar I go to a few times a week alone, like usual, and this very attractive woman comes and sits next to me. We start talking and, she doesn't stop talking and she was extremely flirty. We (mostly her) talked for around 3 hours and closed the place out. During that time, she showed me all sorts of pictures in her phone, all the stuff she makes, etc... and she noticed my hands were cold so she put them between her legs lol. She's 46, im 33. She's been married 25 years and has 2 grown adult children. Her husband and son are currently in Hawaii and I'm assuming she was lonely or something and was just getting out, idk? But she got a pizza to go and basically said she was just gonna go home and eat it by herself. The way she said it was very leading though, so I asked if she would want any company. She kind of smiled and didn't say yes or no. We walk to the parking lot, talk some more at her car, end up making out, she tells me shes not wearing a bra and puts my hand on her jug. It's 10pm at this point and, while in the bar we were deciding where we should go to next. All of a sudden she ""gets a text"" and says she has to go, and that was that. I'm guessing she either got cold feet or suddenly realized this was a bad idea. And no, she was not drunk. She had 2 glasses of wine.

When we were getting ready to leave her manager pulls her onto the dance floor and to my surprise started dancing pretty intimately. Semi grinding, her facing away and facing him for about 15min. 

I'm a pretty confident and secure guy so I just took a seat and observed. I wasn't trying to let it ruin my night, but they didnt stop until after a couple of her coworkers that I'm cool with came up to me (separately) and clearly were aware that they were dancing in a way that was inappropriate. 

She knew I was there watching and didn't think she had done anything wrong until after I expressed my feelings.

Though it's not anywhere close to being horrible. It's just not that great. I don't have many friends so I more often than not go out on my own. Which in all honesty, I don't necessarily mind. If anything, I enjoy it because I can do what I want, leave when I want, don't have any peer pressure to go talk to someone, etc... Anyways with that being said, I frequent a wine bar/restaurant down the road often enough to where the staff knows me...well. I know most of the regulars and will talk to them when I see them - all of which are men, except two. One is a woman and the other is a famous trans woman (Tyler Wrecks.)

I've met several interesting women there from just sitting at the bar but, it's always by chance. As in, they happen to sit next to me and a conversation eventually starts. Unfortunately, many of the women also happen to be married. Which I'm ok with, that just allows me to ""practice"" talking to women and continue to build confidence. Almost went home with a married woman the other night, actually lol.. 

I am wanting to actually DATE someone with hopes of a lasting relationship. Not really looking for just sex. Not going to turn it down but, it's not what I'm after either. I know confidence is something women find incredibly attractive in a man, regardless of how physically attractive he is or isn't. 

So, I guess I'm trying to figure out what some of the subtle yet, possibly flirtatious signs women give to men at a bar that they want to talk to/be approached by. I'm oblivious to signs unless they are blatant AF for the most part.

We are both digital nomads that work remotely and spoke every day throughout the pandemic with him constantly asking me to visit. I eventually flew to visit him for 6 weeks. 

I stayed at his apartment and we spent every day together. He would alter his work schedule to spend as much time with me as possible and took me on romantic thoughtful dates every day. We have sex, and he introduced me to his friends as his girlfriend, despite us never having the discussion on what we were.

At first I found this strange but then it became nice. He introduced me to everyone as his girlfriend, was always very affectionate, always holding my hand everywhere we go, etc. He even said he loved me. 

After a month I decided to talk with him. I said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm leaving in X weeks and I feel very sad about leaving you. What do you think happens next?‚Äù 

His answer? ‚ÄúNothing you came here for a vacation‚Äù 

I was a bit upset as I didn‚Äôt have expectations at first but found myself falling for him and I read into his actions as meaning something more. When I said that I didn‚Äôt expect anything but ended up developing feelings, he kept reiterating ‚Äúyeah but you knew you were coming here for just a trip‚Äù.

He said I could stay at his place with him as long as I wanted. I can stay in his country for 3 months. But I wanted him to want me there, which he assures me he does. 

But what happens in 2 months time ? I asked if he was looking for a relationship at this point in time and he said that he‚Äôd like one but he didn‚Äôt see it fitting in his life right now. 

We discussed it and I said I‚Äôd perhaps leave early and not waste more time as I‚Äôd misunderstood. He said I could stay with him another month or two and we could see where it goes. But I think he sounds half assed about it and I don‚Äôt want to chase after someone.

I‚Äôm upset and humiliated that he doesn‚Äôt want anything at all after acting like we are a lovey dovey couple all the time. Not even plans or discussion to meet again, anything. 

I‚Äôm thinking about going to the next country to work remotely, where I have friends I can spend time with, and leave with my self respect intact. 

I‚Äôm feeling humiliated that I not only travelled a long way to see him, but that I really thought he wanted to be in a relationship with me and he‚Äôs acting like it‚Äôs just a temporary thing that‚Äôs it.

59,rvmlwp,1641273924,Am I wrong for refusing to stop planning a future,I (25f) have been dating this man (28m) for 3 months. His birthday is on Christmas day. I travelled to my moms home for Christmas so I couldn‚Äôt spend the day with him.I haven‚Äôt had much disposable cash lately which he knew and he told me he wasn‚Äôt expecting anything for his birthday. That I could make it up the next year. For his birthday I stayed up till midnight to call him I called several times but he was asleep. I called at 5 which is when he usually gets up in the morning but he was asleep. I sent a text and posted over all my social media. He told me he never had a cake for his birthday before so I saved up for 2 months to surprise him and get a special cake delivered (the baker messed up the cake and it was inedible) I also sent texts throughout the day. After Christmas he became very cold and barely responded to my messages I didn‚Äôt understand why and kept asking if there‚Äôs was a problem he said everything was fine. Eventually he said he was hurt and angry at the type of posts I put up on social media and the fact that I didn‚Äôt get to speak to him on the phone on his birthday. I apologized and promised to make it up. He said he forgave me but continued to be cold and pick fights over the slightest things. I confronted and told him I wouldn‚Äôt allow him to keep treating me this way he said he thinks the problem is that we‚Äôre planning a future together (we‚Äôve discussed a 2year and 5year plan)so he expects a lot. That he wants to put the plans on hold because he has lost confidence in the relationship because of my actions on his birthday. I told him that I don‚Äôt want to be in a relationship with no future and he said he doesn‚Äôt want any plans for the future right now because I hurt him too badly and we broke up.

60,rvmmzx,1641274028,Told My Ex I Would Wait For Her,"So a little back story, I (22M) broke up with my ex gf (20F) 6 months ago. During this time me and her were both going through a very stressful period in our lives. I had never been in a relationship that lasted longer than a month. My past gfs I broke up with because I did not want to be tied down and also in my life relationships did not ever seem to last we'll just say that, and somebody always got hurt. My parents got divorced when I was a kid and I had quite a few broken hearts dating in school but eh what are you gonna do that's just common teenager shit. My childhood was not a very caring environment and I have grown up with a very guarded personality and it is hard for me to make an emotional connection. She seemed to also be going through a depressive episode and I was scared about some of the things she talked about. Not because it made her seem unattractive to me, not at all, its just I have thought those depressive feelings and got through them in high school and did not want to feel them again. 

So I decided to break it off with my ex because I was scared of our relationship and what I was feeling towards her, and basically I was scared and overwhelmed with everything in my life. 

Come to the present where it is 6 months later I ask her out for a coffee to see how she's doing. And she seems to be doing good and we get to talkin and starting hanging out and talking about experiences in the last 6 months as well as when we were together. After we are done hanging I ask her if she wants to go out to a nearby theme park where we live. She says yes!

We go out there and have another good time together. Joking, laughing, telling stories! I still keep myself pretty vague about my feeling because it is hard for me to open up. I ask her out for another date and she says yes! This time were are going to see the sites at a nearby boardwalk.

At this point, I am falling in love with this girl all over again, the truth is I always loved her I was just scared and ran because of past experiences. However my goal is to confess my feelings about us at the Boardwalk and ask her if we can start over. 

At the Boardwalk we have another great time just like the last 2 times we hung out! And I get up the nerve and confess my feelings for her and apologize for leaving her when it was evident she was in a depressive episode. She tell me its ok and says some of the blame comes to her as she needed help and she wouldn't get it when I was with her. And when we split up she finally got the help and medication she needed. I still apologize for not realizing at the time though and ask if we can start over and take it slow. 

Long story short she says she's not ready for a relationship and she needs time to heal and focus on herself. I told her that was alright, and then I told her I would wait for her for when she was ready. And we ended up coming to a deal where if either of us has someone ""special"" come in our lives there would be no hard feelings. Yet if not I would wait until she is ready for a relationship and we would try again.

I am much more sure of myself and have been working on communicating and saying what I'm feeling. I feel we both have both grown a lot in the last 6 months. And I am very serious and plan on waiting for her as she is an amazing girl that I feel is the only one in the world for me. I also suggest we still hang out as friends in the mean time though. 

The advice I need is that now after we made that deal she has been a little distant from me. We have tentative plans to go roller skating soon but she often does not text me back for 12 hours. I know that she might just need time away from me to continue to heal, but it still feels elusive. 

My question is why is she acting this way around me but when we are hanging together we are always laughing and having fun?

68,rvnl0g,1641277156,Limited Intimacy?,"I (24m) recently started dating a girl (28f). We are both back and forth between different cities so it is a bit of distance thing at times. We recently spent our longest concentrated period of time together (4 days at her apartment in the city I'm not usually in for New Years). Although the trip had many positive moments, some issues came up throughout the trip.

Specifically, she indicated she has quite a low sex drive and that all of her previous partners have complained about this. I was not too alarmed by this, I would have been happy getting sexual only once the whole trip. But then we ran into a bit of a problem. I made her a romantic dinner and put together a spa night for her for New Years Eve. We started fooling around afterward and I got her off only for her to promptly fall asleep. 

I was upfront the next morning that I was pretty upset the previous night felt all one way. She clearly felt bad and apologized verbally. We did fool around once more later on the trip in a more equal way but it was very short. I think this initial disappointment led me to try and seek out more intimacy over the rest of the trip in an effort to confirm this one way thing wouldn't be a pattern with her. She came right out toward the end of the trip and said she felt like I was suffocating her a bit with affection and reminded me of her low sex drive.

What do I do? Her and I had a lengthy discussion about this but I don't feel like any concrete solution was reached. I am okay not being intimate all the time but in order for that to work, I feel like the opportunities her and I have to be intimate can't leave me feeling things are one way or that I might need additional validation.

69,rvnsmq,1641277923,I can‚Äôt tell if an older woman is just joking around or actually flirting with me,"My best friend's girlfriend's mom is a recent divorcee as of about a year and a half ago. She is old enough to be my own mother as I graduated high school in the same class as her son. She is a super nice lady, so I never use to think much of what she said to me and still don't to a certain extent. I'm obviously close to my best friend, whom she loves, and am close with her daughter as well (his girlfriend), so I kinda just chalked her being very nice to me up to that. The first comment that made me raise my eyebrows a bit was over the past summer. Her daughter picked up my best friend from a wedding we were at, and I helped her get him into her car and calm him down due to him being too drunk. Supposedly after she was told how I helped, she said, ""He's so nice. I wish he was 20 years older."" Regardless, I didn't really read too much into it. On New Years a few days ago, I spent it hanging out with a few of my friends and their SOs at one of my friend's houses. When she learned about this from her daughter, she made a joke and said that she should come keep me company as I am the single friend of my group. The night went on, and she came to pick up her daughter around 12:30am. We all came out to say goodbye. My one friend was home for the first time in a while so she said something about how she remembered him. She then saw me, giggled, and said, ""oh I definitely remember you."" She was talking about how her date for the night only gave her a hug when she was asked by her daughter, and my under the influence self jokingly said, ""hey I'm just saying I didn't get a kiss either tonight."" She then told me to come over to her side of the car. Everyone was thinking that she was just going to give me a peck on the cheek. I came over, and she grabs my face and plants her lips right on mine and holds me there for a second or two. It definitely caught me off guard and I blushed a bit, but I, along with everyone else, thought it was hilarious. Someone said something about how she was fun and she said something along the lines of, ""I'm completely sober right now, you should see me drunk."" 

For the most part, I do feel like she's just having some harmless fun with me and I think it's funny to play along, but for the past few days, I wanted to see what an unbiased person thought of the whole thing. I don't feel uncomfortable or anything about it.

\- She hasn't found anybody else better online.

\- Alone during the holidays.

\- Feeling the pressure of turning 30 in a couple weeks, single with no kid or boyfriend. 

\- She needs some form of drama to develop an emotional connection. I gave her that when I called her on her bullshit.

Keeping a journal/ list of quirks, qualities, ideals and whatnot of everything you could want in a person, from genetics/ looks to personality to interests or whether or not they smoke or if they‚Äôre into BDSM and everything else. And then maybe going a step further and organizing it into subcategories such as non-negotiables and things you could compromise on or that are not as high priority.

It could help to streamline the sort of person you are actually looking for in life, help you iron out what you can and can‚Äôt deal with. Makes it easier to decide if you really have a lasting chance with someone.

But I also see how it could be toxic, like if you start obsessing over this list and these ideals and become so specific and unyielding that you end up shooting yourself in the foot.

80,rvo8of,1641279572,new casual dating prospect met organically,"so i've been on OLD apps for a bit, and i had recently changed my profiles/weeding out process (20F so there is one haha) to meet up with better people who don't just want sex. i tend to be a homebody but i like to do activities and shit, my main ""upgrade"" to my profile is insisting on going on actual dates, no meet ups. 

so new years i worked 12 hrs on the 31st, and had a pm shift on the 1st, amidst a 60 hour workweek. i had no plans but i'd picked up some stuff to make margs and i made bean soup (albeit lacking black-eyeds) during my break. my roommate asked if i'd go to the bar she's a reg at with her, and when we both got off early (10:45) from power closing we both dressed up and went out. i've only been to this bar like 5 times total now but my roomie is there multiple times a week. i ended up having a lot of fun and about 6 people came back with us to our place, everyone was just chilling and a few ate my soup which was cool. there was one dude my roommate knows that i was getting kind of flirty with and by the end of the night we were sitting with our legs touching ahhh. 

i asked my roommate for his number and she said he already asked for mine. i admittedly got impatient waiting but i wanted to ask him on a date. i texted him and it ended up confusing him because apparently anytime i try to flirt i come off as rude or something. but then he texted again last night asking what i was up to, by the time i checked it my roommate had invited me to the bar again so i said ""apparently going to The Bar"" and he said he had been about to leave. 

so i pull up and we're talking and we honestly have a lot in common. we had good conversation and there are other people we were hanging out with which was fun, but then he whispered the magical words ""to be honest do you want to get out of here and just smoke"" so we went back to my place. 

of course, me being at a bar and 20, i have a fake and he had been under the impression i was 23 but i came clean, which did result in him feeling lied to but i can't just go around telling everyone i'm 20 at the bar lol. we ended up having a really open conversation after that because i figured if he was apprehensive i might as well address anything else that could become an issue, which lowkey had him geeking at first but overall was a good convo and he said he'd never experienced someone being so blunt about things, which is something i value about myself in dating. i don't like to play games, i want to be clear and avoid investing in something that is incompatible, so it was cool that i successfully conveyed some baggage in a way that wasn't over sharing and overall eased both his distrust and my personal apprehensions which always exist about whether he actually does respect me or was just looking for sex.

we had a couple rounds of some bomb ass sex and he is leaving for  a backpacking trip in about a month but we're going to hang out until then. i'm on a dopamine high right now. this is actually the first positive sex experience i've had with a new person for awhile, and other than my virginity the first time i met the person organically and not from OLD. i am looking forward to more sex with a man who is also seeking a genuine connection. gonna suck when i have to find someone new but overall this man is once again causing me to raise my standards. no more meaningless hookups and no more men who make me uncomfortable with my boundaries. 

TL;DR met a dude in person on new years rather than a dating app, had bomb sex after meeting up again, i am learning about myself/dating from a positive experience rather than a negative one, feels really good.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rvo8of/new_casual_dating_prospect_met_organically/

I miss how she was and I know it's temporary, but I feel addicted to her attentions now that she's more distant.","TL;DR: I started dating a friend but she started acting differently with everyone, saying she needs some ""alone time"" because she feels overwhelmed. We still want to date but I find it really hard because I miss her old self. What can I do to concentrate on myself while I wait she turns back to normal? 

So, my best friend and I have started dating, but we aren't girlfriend and boyfriend, yet, it's a sort of an in-between situation. Anyway, things had been going good, but suddenly she started acting different. She started answering less and less to my texts and to other people's, as well, including other friends in our friend group. 

I initially thought it was for her upcoming exams but after passing them she has still been acting like that; therefore, I confronted her about it and she told me she hasn't been feeling like herself lately, and that she needs some alone time because she feels detached from herself and oberwhelmed. She told me she obviously still cares about me and that she's still there for me, but that she doesn't want to use her phone as much as before at the moment; the problem is I can't seem to accept her situation, although I obviously respect her.

We both hope it's a temporary problem, because when we see each other in person and when we call each other she feels kind of normal, although she's a bit ruder than before, but when texting she doesn't respond even though sometimes she's online.

I'm a bit overthinking the situation, because she has been acting like this with everyone, but I just miss her. Before we started dating we used to text A LOT, and just now I realise how much I miss her telling me about her day.

To add to the context, she has always had some mental health issues so I know she's not faking it, but I just keep overthinking.

He transferred to the college i got into and overall tells me that he wants to marry me and talks about our future non stop. We have a relatively good relationship and are with each other 24/7... we are each other best friends. One problem is his family. I am not jewish and i also am not from the same culture as him. I also come from a stricter culture, I'm indian but my family has been a lot more accepting. I feel as if im at a cross roads. I've never met his family and we are with each other 24/7 but if someone calls and asks what hes doing he never tells the truth. I tried talking to him about it and he told me his parents are old fashioned at that it will take time. However its hurting me. I feel like an outsider in one side of his life, and then on the other hand I feel like i know everything. Im not asking for the world but I am asking for a slight change and he's not budging.

86,rvow1v,1641282090,Are there better online dating apps than Tinder and Bumble in 2022?,"Tinder and Bumble have been a heaping pile of garbage for me. After a week, I only get a few matches and they are either morbidly obese women or transgenders. I had much better luck with getting to know attractive young women at school before covid and California gov. ruined everything for me. 

Part of the reason I think dating apps have gone so terrible for men is more men downloading the app post covid. Women simply dont have that same desire to connect as men and so they have been fine during the pandemic. Plus men are notoriously known to swipe right on every profile they see to (cast a wide net) which ultimately inundates women with matches and options causing them to become extraordinarily picky while also losing your profile in her queue.

Are there any alternatives that perhaps limit the number of likes men can send so they dont spam the feature? Or an app that squashes the competition with them by charging you money to use? Im prepared to pay because Im looking for a long run relationship and I hate competing with 4 other (young horny men only interested in a hookup) for every one girl on the app. I need an app that isnt 5:1 men to women like Tinder and Bumble. And Im willing to pay a lot of cash to get rid of these young horny men competing with me.

88,rvoyj4,1641282361,I suck at this and I kinda need a little help,"hello there. so it‚Äôs quite a long post, bear with me on this because I need insights over the matter. I came from a long term relationship that is LDR for 2 years and just back in December of 2021, I decided to actually date someone that is physically near to me. So he came from a 4 years relationship and coincidentally we‚Äôve been single for 4 months.  We talked about our past and we just click and reconnect a lot, but what bothers me the most is that he still talks to his ex for ‚Äúprofessional reasons‚Äù cause of stock exchange and he doesn‚Äôt know how to openly communicate stuff with me because he‚Äôs so chill with his ex before. I too, had the same problem with my ex with the communication thing and I decided if ever I wanted to enter another one I would openly communicate what I feel in order to understand each other more. But the guy isn‚Äôt used with the confronting thing and doesnt know what to answer to me most of the time which is honestly frustrating, but I honestly just want to understand. So here‚Äôs the thing, I keep thinking about his ex  and also the idea of him not deleting their photos but also convincing myself, I‚Äôm different, and I just knew that he told his ex, he is already seeing someone which is me. And I dont know if I trust him that much due to the fact i‚Äôve had ups and downs with people before and I might not able to handle another heartbreak for sure. But yea, these are personal problems. But honestly, for a girl who has always been the first girlfriend of every relationship I‚Äôve entered, this is honestly confusing and I don‚Äôt know what to do. So any advice, a smack in the head to tell me what I need to do can ease up whatever I‚Äôve been feeling for the past days.

90,rvpca3,1641283937,Dilemma‚Ä¶,"I recently wrote a book on self-growth based on personal experience and had it printed. I‚Äôve only made a few of them and had it dedicated to my close family and friends. 

Many of my life lessons were also thanks to my ex-fianc√©. We have been split for 2-3 months due to miscommunication, conflicts and disapproving parents (her side). As much as I wanted to save the relationship, she gave up on us. Although during the last month she herself wasn‚Äôt behaving as the woman I fell in love with I know most of her reasoning or decisions were not taken solely by her but with influences from her peers and family. 

We have been in NC for the last 2-3 months except this time one time we shared some heart-felt emails. Hers were mostly in a more reserved/angry mood but she had said she loved me and cared for our relationship with all her heart. This was likely a month ago. Although, I‚Äôm not sure how someone can give up if they say that‚Ä¶ but that‚Äôs a different story‚Ä¶

I still believe that her and I can work things out. Someday hopefully. I am just staying out of her zone and trying not to reach out to her to respect and give her the space she needs. I don‚Äôt want to bombard her life. She has a lot she needs to figure out too. However‚Ä¶

My questions are:

- Would it be wrong of me to send her the book I had worked on?

- If yes, should I at least message and ask her if it is ok or just mail it?

- If no, would it be just best to wait till she reaches out and then see if she would like to read it depending on which state we are in at that time?

I am from south Asian country where arranged marriages are pretty common. I met my current wife through this process where my parents arranged. My parents gave complete freedom to me as well if I wanted to go ahead with the match or not. The match was arranged about a year ago in December 2020 and because of Covid , we got sometime to get to know each other better. During this time my wife completely fell in love with me but I didn‚Äôt. My main problem was with the attraction. I am not at all attracted to my wife from beginning but I thought that attraction was not imp as much as love. I spent the entire year with her and I saw that she loved me to death even though I ignored her. There were certain complaints from her side that I am not giving proper attention to her but I always gave excuses. 

Anyways after almost a year, I was still where I started with no attraction and no love. My current wife at that time noticed these and even gave me the option to back out. But I was too scared because of the backlash I would receive and thought that i would later develop feelings for her. So I convinced her that I would do more and since she is in love with me she was easily convinced. Fast forward, I married her about 4 weeks ago with typical big fat wedding. I now am with her daily for the past 4 weeks and couldn‚Äôt bring myself to face her. I cannot see her face as I‚Äôm not at all attracted to her and keeps comparing her to my ex and literally find most other girls attractive and not my wife at all. I understand that love is more imp than attraction but I just cannot convince myself now with that. I am going into depression because of this and my wife is starting to notice this as well. I want my marriage to work but I just don‚Äôt know how. I finally confessed to her that I‚Äôm not attracted to her and she said she would do everything to make herself attractive to me. But I‚Äôm not sure if I can ever find her attractive. I am depressed thinking about this and feel like not only ruined my life but her life and lives of two families.
