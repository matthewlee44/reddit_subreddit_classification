We've been on roughly 8 dates, 4 of which were whole days/nights spent at my place. We get along well, text everyday, communicate well, and had agreed to be exclusive (confirmed we weren't seeing others or talking to others).

Obviously I initiated the first/second dates as we met on OLD, and then the next few dates, we organised whilst we were hanging out (mutually).

Since then, I've noticed that typically, I've been the one raising the question 'when are you available/free next'. Whilst we text everyday, and she initiates conversation too, and more recently in the last few days, we discussed that if schedules allow, we'd like to see each other more than once a week, I can't help but feel like I'm initiating too much.

I tend to overthink, and communication is a weird strength in some ways, and weakness in others. This girl obviously reciprocates and shares potential date ideas (saying she'd be keen to do x, or wants to do y), but has yet to say 'when are you free' or initiate a date.

I saw her last on Monday, and I know her schedule is packed this week (she is a shift-worker, and I do 9-5), so I've not yet brought up anything for next week yet. I really want to, but am overthinking/stressing and considering letting her bring it up?

So, this girl I would consider way out of my league started messaging me on tinder. She only had 3 pictures, no bio, and was apparently less than a mile away. At first I thought they were a bot but I decided to reply. Turns out that they weren't. However, apparently they moved to my area from super far away in the country just that day. I asked why, and they never had a good reason...just said that it was something they wanted to do. No family or friends, no job opportunities....nothing.There's literally no reason to move to this small area at all. They said that they wanted to chill here until they go to school to become a robotics engineer next year--which they didn't really seem to know much about &amp; the school isn't even located here. They also mentioned starting to work at a specific location here but didn't seem to know the owners of the place. Additionally, they mentioned that they were staying at a room here but I didnt see any rooms advertised for rent. 

So I started to think I was being catfished--possibly by someone that knew me. They said things similarly to that of another tinder match that I unmatched that day because I wasn't feeling them. I decided to play along with it just to see where this led. I asked for her snap, and it had her last name in it (her name was sorta odd as well)...so I naturally decided to do some creeping to see if I could find anything. I found a Facebook account &amp; it seemed odd--yet, it was created quite some time ago. Also a half-baked LinkedIn with blatant lies and a location from another country. Also a post on some website to do nannying like 1 week ago in the area that she said she moved from. So I decided to reverse image search them and I got no matches. I also looked at her tinder again and the profile said it was over a 1000 miles away, but then went back to 1 mile.

They sent me snaps, but it looked like they were screenshots. At this point, I just told them that I wasn't stupid and clearly they are catfishing. They claimed that they weren't &amp; joked around about the idea. Then they unfriended my snap, unmatched me/deleted their tinder. So I unfriended their snap as well. Like 2 hours later I get a friend request from their snap. At this point I'm super weirded out, but I accept because of curiosity. They say that their phone glitched out and didn't know why I was unfriended. I go to check their Facebook again, and it's completely gone. 

I said that for them to prove they arent catfishing, they are gonna have to send me a video over snap of something specific. So I told them to do 2 very specific things. They say they are taking the snap, and then send something a few minutes later...which I think is weird because it sounded like they were preparing something. Sure enough, they do the specific things...but there's just something super uncanny about it--the video is super short and doesn't seem like it was taken using snapchat. But I mean, they are clearly a real person? Is there any possible way that this can be faked? Nothing made sense. They also mention that they got rid of their tinder because everyone was calling them a catfish...but it almost feels like they targeted me. They are also very insistent on meeting up...which I don't think a catfish would do...yet, they mention that they want to go hiking with me...which is super sketchy too.

She didn't exactly say I was boring, but her reaction during the date showed it.  

Keep in mind, we had texted for 2 months prior to the meeting.

What made me come down to this is because after our first date she was filled with excitement and texted me a few hours that she was eager to see me again with heart eyes emoji (our first date was fixed for an hour, with a fun activity with regular conversation of what we were talking about texting)

On our second date, it seemed to be ok, but it was quite platonic and the conversation was more about the activity we were doing (arcades)...  keep in mind, she never really started a conversation, I was trying to come up with something, but it was honestly nothing but when was the last time you were at the arcades... fast forward we played bowling (platonic vibes) and she even tossed a sexual innuendo which I smiled and nod... shortly after we played pool and she was looking at her nails and flicking them and said she was tired so I walked her to her car, hugged and left.

I texted if she had a good time and was interested for another date and she responded yah, she's down.  However, she canceled at the last hour and rescheduled for the following week on her day off.  She texted me that she cared for me with a kissy face and ready to meet up with a devil face emoji.

We went to the 3rd date and played mini golf, platonic again... I asked her if she had any siblings (convo) and she seemed hesitant and said yeah, one.  As we continued I even asked what kind of music she likes and she said ""anything""...  so it seemed that she was annoyed from the start, we had plans to grab drinks after, but she said she was ""tired"" and wanted to go home... I asked if I can come to her place and she said ""what, nooo"" and we hugged at her car and she left.

That was the last time I saw her.

She used the escape route of not being in the right headspace for a relationship, but she had fun.

I personally wasn't feeling good mentally because I had covid prior, but to me it seems that she was wanting either a good conversation or flirting.

I come here out of...desperation, I suppose.  I have never had a relationship before, and although it's something that I have been trying very hard to achieve lately, I have completely failed in this regard.  As I am rapidly approaching my 30s, I would like to figure out what I am doing wrong and fix it, so I am not single for the rest of my life 😂  And so...here I am. 


To start with, a little bit about me.  I am a 27 year old man.  I live in a city with around a million in population.  This is what I look like:  [ME](https://www.reddit.com/user/JustSomeGuy641/comments/qwoqgc/me/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)


For most of my life I simply chose not to date, either being too busy with my career, or not ready emotionally. However, in the past year or so I have gotten my shit together and decided I was ready for a relationship.  Unfortunately, I was not prepared for the brick wall of complete disinterest that I have run into, and so now here I am, trying to find a way around it 😂 


I'll start by listing off what I see as the pros and cons of myself, AKA what I am bringing to the table. 


Pros
- I am tall (6'4)
- I am very athletic/in shape
- I am not ugly, in fact I think I look quite decent, but that's just my opinion lol
- I (mostly) have my shit together...(I own a condo, a vehicle, and have a decent job)
- I have hobbies and things that I am passionate about 
- I have a decent amount of friends (unfortunately all male lol)
- I have some interesting/unique life experiences (am ex-military, have been around the world a bit)
- I am not a psycho/crazy person 


Cons
- Not terribly smart (dropped out of high school, did get my diploma eventually though)
- Not rich (not poor either, but yeah)
- Don't have any particularly great career paths in my future 
- No fashion sense whatsoever (I don't think I dress badly, but I certainly have no idea on how to look fresh or trendy) 


Now correct me if I am wrong, but I think that I have many positives, and no overwhelming negatives here.  At least, I should be able to garner some small level of initial interest, no?  Unfortunately that has not been the case for me. 


So, as I said I've been attempting to date for just over a year and a half now.  I have managed, during this time, to get a date with 5 different women.  3 were catfishes and much larger than their profiles showed, one was not a catfish but we unfortunately just didn't find much in common, and the last one I had an amazing time with (we spent 10 hours together!), but immediately after the date she hit me with the old ""just not ready to date right now"".  So a year and a half of effort and I have nothing to show for it. 


I got all of these dates by paying for premium versions of dating apps(don't judge me too harshly lol), and liking their profiles.  I have not gotten a single date out of being liked first or matching organically.  


I have gotten maybe 50 likes in total, of which around 25% did not reply even once to me, 25% could not carry a conversation or stopped replying as soon as I asked them out, and the other 50% were all significantly overweight.  Don't get me wrong, I don't judge people for their life choices, but I personally am not attracted to that, and besides, I live a very active lifestyle, and I would like to share it with my partner.  


I did try lowering my standards and dating some of these women(specifically, the 3 catfishes), but we were simply too incompatible.  One girl got genuinely offended when she asked me how I felt about McDonald's, and I told her I hadn't eaten there in years. 😂 Sooo...yeah. 


As for meeting women in ways that don't involve dating apps, I have thus far been unsuccessful.  My job has me working with the same 7 people constantly, and we don't interact with anyone else.  My hobbies are all complete sausage fests, and I have yet to meet even one woman in all of my local hobby groups, much less a single woman in my age range who is interested in me.  


Things like dancing and yoga and what not completely disinterest me, and I feel like if I forced myself to try those, the women there would immediately sense that I am only there to hunt for a date, and that's a huge turn-off I imagine.  I see plenty of cute girls at the gym, but I quite like my gym, and would rather not get banned for harassment, so I leave them all well enough alone.  


I've always hated clubs as well, so that's not really an option.  I'd try bars, but back when I used to drink a lot and go to bars often, I spiraled into an alcohol-fueled depression...so these days I try to avoid alcohol apart from the odd social drink with friends. 


That leaves me with...pretty much nothing, I guess?  I've done everything right as far as I can tell, or at least, I'm not making any glaring mistakes.  I'd sure as hell date myself, and I'm quite happy with my life in general apart from my dating failures.  I can't think of any reason why I've been hit with such a sheer wall of disinterest.  But logically, the problem must be with me somewhere, as there are plenty of other people who are worse off than me in many ways, and who still manage to get relationships.  


So...maybe someone here can help me see what I'm blind to, help me see what I'm doing wrong, and understand why women are so completely disinterested in me.  At least I hope so lol.  Anyway, looking forward to the replies 😬",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1127488,public,self,Help me figure out what I'm doing wrong?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qwoud5/help_me_figure_out_what_im_doing_wrong/,no_ads,0,,

I matched a girl on Hinge about 2 weeks ago and we started chatting quite a lot and it was good conversations. We met about 10 days after matching - went to a museum and then a cafe and our conversation in person was fun and interesting. 

We made lots of eye contact, and at the end of the night we hugged and I got her number. 

Since then, we agreed to go out again a week later (tomorrow night). Our texting has been super dead and boring though. Pretty much just consists of asking each other what we got up to in the day. 

I haven’t replied to her text since yesterday because it’s so dead I’d be forcing a conversation.

Last weekend I finally met her. We went to a bar that also was a book shop where people sometimes recite poetry and we had a couple of beers and an amazing time.

I could see how her eyes sparkled a little, how we were enjoying ourselves and how, even though she was shy, she was trying to let herself be vulnerable.

Meeting up helped me a lot dissipate many of my worries. She was legit. I had no reason to think she was guilty of sins that only existed in my mind. That's just how my broken brain works. I'm trying to heal from abuse and she knows.

I kinda wanted to kiss her at the end of the date but the opportunity didn't arise. I drove her home and when we were saying goodbye, she gave me a hug, then I told her that I had a little something for her.

She was surprised and confused for a second. I pulled a book out of my jacket. It was Nausea by Sartre. We had spoken about it a few days before the date and she had joked about wanting to steal it from me. She absolutely adored it the gesture.

Things kept escalating over text the next few days. Last night I asked her to describe what she'd want out of a relationship/partner and she said that she's really happy talking to me, that I'm adorable, that she loves the way I explain things or tell stories to her because ""I am not pretending to look interesting and I put actual care that she understands me"" (we had discussed mansplaining days before), she said I radiate peace and that she feels safe with me.

I really like this woman. She's bright, smart, independent, she's really cute and she has a lot of values in common with me besides a great sense of humor and a lot of emotional intelligence. I admire her. I'm really happy. We're on the same page. I can't wait to see her this weekend. I don't know what we'll be doing but I know we'll be having a great time together.

This girl in my grade is probably the most objectively attractive girl and she's never had a problem getting guys to like her. I get word that she likes me. Two of our mutual friends have been trying to convince me to talk to her for weeks. I'm not really interested in dating her because I've never been in a relationship but I don't think shes what I'm looking for. But I'm also kind of unsure of myself. I have weird standards and I'm kind of neurotic.

Out of curiousity I take a brief look at her Instagram and accidentally like a very revealing swimsuit photo. I panick, unlike the photo and block her. I spend the next 30 minutes shaking, tell my mom and my brother to give me consultation on how to diffuse the situation. I'm freaking out because I need to clear the air. She was telling our mutual friend that she doesn't think anything is going to happen because we are both too shy to talk to each other. So perfect. My aloofness has rewarded me. But then I go do this 🤦. I add her on snap and the rest takes care of itself...😖

This is the text messages of our mutual friend.

""Lol that’s funny she snapped me""

""She was like (my name) liked my second Instagram post""

""I was like dam bro he fell for you""

""Ye she was like omg I got butterflies in stomach""

I graduated from college about two years ago and have already started a good career, which has me moving around a bit. I’ve been paying the rent on the apartment since before she moved in. After she moved in, she was supposed to pay for groceries and at least one utility. However, this isn’t exactly how it played out. She started off paying for groceries, never paid any utilities, and after one semester of living with me, she didn’t sign up for the next semester because she knows my job will have us moving soon. Now, she did go and get a part-time retail job, but it doesn’t pay much (she literally made more on her college benefits) and so now she doesn’t pay for groceries all the time either. 

This is starting to become an issue. Especially since she doesn’t really take care of the housework either (cooking, cleaning, etc) we don’t have kids.

He was the most attractive guy I've ever met. We seemed to have good chemistry over text. We went on a first date and it went well. We lived an hour away from each other and he said that he usually doesn't drive that far for someone and that he didn't think he'd consider dating someone so soon after his last relationship ended 4 months earlier, but that there was something about me. We also held hands and made out on the date.

We kept texting for a few weeks after that. He told me that he was falling for me and obsessed with me, and that he could see himself spending his life with me. He said that the reason that other dates I went on didn't go anywhere is probably because they weren't as smart as me, and that he might be my perfect match. I'm socially awkward and have never been in a relationship before and only been on 8 dates in my life, so I was really excited to hear this guy that I really liked say stuff like that.

But he said that it seemed like I wasn't sure if I wanted to be with him because I was a little worried about our sexual compatibility. He was very sexual from the first conversation and wanted to know if I'd be able to fill his sexual needs, and he wanted to have sex on the second date to see if the sex was good, and said that we'd be dating if it was. It also had to be in his car because his family was being forced by their aunt to move unexpectedly. When we were texting before the first date, I mentioned that I don't like to have sex on the first date. He said that we might be too different of people, and that maybe we should stop talking to each other. I said that that was probably for the best, seeing as how my family lives with my stepdad's family and he doesn't like having people's significant others spending the night there. He said that we could have sex at his house, that he had his ex sleep over and his family was okay with it, so I was expecting us to have sex there, not in his car. 

I was worried of losing him and so I sent him a bunch of texts asking him to reconsider. He said that I was acting crazy and that I made him lose all feelings for me, and that maybe he could get them back if I had sex with him. I was going to, but then I stood firm on wanting to have sex with someone once I'm in a relationship with them, or at least knew them for more than a few weeks. 

We stopped talking shortly after that, and I went back and forth between being upset that I ruined things with a very attractive guy who liked me and thinking that he was just trying to use me for sex. I found him on social media recently and I asked him if he honestly felt all those things about me and I ruined it or if he just wanted to sleep with me, and he said that he did like me at first and that I ruined it.

This guy was the perfect guy, at least in my view. Very attractive, very talented and accomplished in life, and someone who really liked me. We both really liked each other and drove each other wild. And I went and ruined it forever. I guess I'm not surprised that the universe would give me this great chance and then I'd fuck it up. I'd be more surprised if I didn't. I don't think I'll ever find a guy better than him, so I might as well date girls exclusively from now on (I'm bi so I was already attracted to girls to some extent).",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1127508,public,self,I got confirmation that I ruined things with a guy who really liked me 2 years ago,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qwrycw/i_got_confirmation_that_i_ruined_things_with_a/,no_ads,0,,

Not only that but she was killing it skating, she had a style that was like surfing on concrete and it was sick, I was mesmerized. Do I talk to her? No, lol of course not...








So fast forward to a week ago, I’m at work, upstairs in the maintenance closet in a grocery store. The upstairs area is a public seating area with a patio outside. 
I leave the closet and make eye contact with some girl who looked cute and kinda familiar putting up a drawing on the bulletin board (which has nothing on it). She  kinda walked away quick all embarrassed andwent to sit on the patio.

So I’m like scrambling for a piece of paper and a pen and post a note on her drawing that said “ur cute ;)”

I come back like 30 mins later and she wrote her number and said to call her!

So fast forward to yesterday, we finally hangout and shes the girl from the skatepark!!!!

I’ve been talking to 3 men and weighing out my options as well as just being a single woman and enjoying myself. I hadn’t  been having sex with multiple guys if that means anything. I met this one guy about 2 months ago. We instantly hit it off and I really liked him (more than the others) He’s put a lot into seeing me by driving an hour to see me multiple times a week, paying for meals, taking me to do exciting things, spent a lot of money and was so nice.… but this guy I had sex with. We had sex every single time we seen each other. Conversation always lead to talking about sexual stuff, evolving to a literal questioner sheet of what I’m willing and not willing to do. I don’t know if I gave him the wrong impression when I mentioned at a point that I had a sexual preference that he seemingly dove into researching and wanted more of. Reminder, it’s only been a month at most at this point. I had mentioned I wanted to make things “official” multiple times and I got the impression that it was too soon of me to mention that. 
At 6 weeks before he dropped me off at home, conversation of other people came up and he asked me about my willingness to stop talking to other people. I immediately deleted dating apps in front of him and expressed I would end it with the other guys. I was not serious about the others in the slightest but I’m an empath and have honestly never had to actually end talking to someone before so I chickened out and made excuses everyday about it not being the right time to make them sad with other things going on in their personal lives. So I texted with these 2 other guys VERY seldom where even they got the hint the last 2 weeks that I was fading away from interest in talking to them any further. I noticed I began to feel confused about what he wanted. A future with me or was I just a good time girl he wanted to himself? 
I still sent texts to the other guys which I’ve now gathered I strung along as “backup plans” which I know is so rude. I was very bland and short while still sending good morning &amp; night texts, talked about ones kids custody battle and the others moms cancer situation but I hadn’t seen them in person the past two weeks making poor excuses as to why I couldn’t see them &amp; waiting for “the right time” to end it. 
Well, I spent the night with the guy I wanted to be with and got a text from another saying “hey babe how’s your day been” &amp; I’ve never really been a liar until that moment when I said I did end it and that I haven’t been talking to them and after about 5 minutes of terrible lies I began expressing the truth and apologized/cried/explained/promised &amp; I wrote the other two guys and very bluntly ended future communication with them. Offered to prove myself over time that I really am an honest &amp; loyal person for the full following 24 hours I was with him for the weekend. I hurt his feelings and betrayed his trust. So from Sunday to now Wednesday he’s made passive comments about me still hiding stuff between me and my “boyfriends”. Wouldn’t inform me if he would work along side my upcoming efforts to build trust again and expressed it’s all for me to figure out. He has been semi normal other than a short panic he had when I fell asleep and didn’t answer his phone call for an hour assuming I was seeing someone else. He acted fine and let me talk a lot of trauma of mine and therapy but I also don’t think he understood DV trauma and response very much either. He had always been very reserved and hard to read.
Anyway, he let me be excited to see him tonight and as soon as I got into his vehicle he asked if I had deleted all of my “boyfriends” messages then continues by dumping me saying I’ve ruined the trust.

I am a female (white, if it matters) and have a well defined type when it comes to men. One criterion is them being white/Caucasian. I also prefer light hair over dark, no facial hair over beards, taller than me vs shorter. In other words, not all white men are attractive to me but all men attractive to me are and have been white. 

Is that an issue/turn off? I have discussed it with my female friends and they felt the same way. However, I remember seeing a post on another subreddit where a comment was accusing OP of being “racist” for desiring to date folks of a specific race. I also understand that there is a fetishizing possibility, but this is not the case here. 

I guess my question is, why would race not fall under the “preference” category together with hair/eyes color, height, weight, etc. but instead make people bothered or straight-up offended? Is “I only date white men” different than “I only date men who have curly hair”?

But we kept running into each other and every time we talked it seemed like we vibed really well. I felt like he was attracted too but still wasn’t sure. Then we shared a kiss one day and I knew for sure. My roommate told me to invite him to a Halloween party so I did and he and I hooked up after the party.

And we’ve been hooking up ever since every weekend and during the week a few times. We’ve been on dates too but I wasn’t sure if he thought of us as dating or just friends with benefits. So I had a talk with him last night and explained to him that if I’m intimate with a person I only want to be with that one person. I also told him that I expected them to only be with me. It just safer that way for both of us. 

I said if he wanted to see other people we could go our separate ways but if he wanted to continue being with me we had to be exclusive. He agreed with me and said he wasn’t interested in anyone else.

So I asked him what he thought of our relationship. Did he see us as just FWB? Was this something he saw as long term or was this just a fling? I told him I know it’s only been a month but I really like him and wanted to know where I stand.

He said of course he sees me as someone special and he wants to only date me and see where this goes. Then he said I guess this makes me your boyfriend. And I said yeah I guess it does.
