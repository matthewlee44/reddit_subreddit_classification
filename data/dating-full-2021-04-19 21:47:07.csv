I went on a date with a guy this weekend from bumble after talking for a few weeks. The date went well — we went for a walk and then got dinner. In total, we were probably together for 3 hours and spent most of it telling stories + laughing. Before I left him, we hugged and ended up kissing. I definitely felt a connection with him and I could tell he did too. After this kiss, I said “see you soon?” to which he replied, yes!

Today, I texted him that I had a great time and it was nice to finally meet him, which he replied to and agreed. However, I just noticed that he changed his pictures on his profile. What does this mean? Is he still interested in going out with me? Or did he only reply to my text out of pity?

I am 26 years old and currently living in Prague. Before moving here, I became friends with a Czech girl online. She is 23 years old and we became friends as she emailed me through a University program.

Upon arrival, she was the first to receive me and show me around the city. I brought her some gifts and she liked them.

Actually, she is very kind-hearted and caring. I have been invited by her mother for a dinner and last week she took me to visit her cottage. I meet her horse and spent the day together.

To be honest, I don't fall for a girl that easily given my previous experiences. Although, I was always drawn by her simplicity yet I never had romantic feelings for her. Also, when she told me about her boyfriend. I reserved all my emotions. However, last week she started saying about her parents divorce and how it changed her. Also, her first lover was always angry and it seemed that she is bit distant from her current lover.

If anyone can help, Am I guilty to have romantic thoughts for her? What do you think, should I let her know of my feelings? However, I don't want to loose her as a friend. I don't know why but I just want to know if she is happy and spent my time with her.

I see a lot, a lot of post talking about how men need to accept rejection, how men should do this and that,

My answer to that, what do you expect when the dating game directly pressuring men sacrificing their self esteem and emotions to ask out a girl

I know a lot of women who can't accept rejection, who make threats and stuff like this.

But guess what women don't need to ask out men, most women don't approach. Vast majority of men

I met him in September of 2014 when he got transferred to my store from a different location. He was the new assistant manager at my store and from the moment i saw him he caught my attention even tho he was not “my type” i developed a huge crush on him over time but I never acted on my feelings because I knew he had a gf at the time and they were pretty serious.
Fast forward we worked together for about 8 months and we saw each other almost everyday, we would often close the store together, listen to music, talk about deep stuff, joke, laugh, even tickle each other etc....I considered him “a friend” at that point until one day I found out all the guys from work were hanging out after work and inviting other women from other locations to hang out with them after work. I felt humiliated because they never once invited me over or included me to hang out with them. I felt betrayed and my attitude towards them specially him changed. 
During that month I had personal problems and I was an emotional rollercoaster (my dad had died, my ex had reconnected with me and ghosted me after we had sex, I was broke etc) so I left my job and didn’t even put my 2 weeks. I just never came back...
Fast forward in 2017 this guy added me on fb because we had mutual friends from work and I accepted him, the only reason he added me was because he was single, 
He started messaging me constantly and “trying to talk” but I pretty much blew him off. So he deleted me one day, which I didn’t care tbh. At this point I didn’t consider him a friend anymore. Just someone I used to work with.... 

After a month he got a new gf. They broke like after 6 months and he sent me another request and I added him again. He got back together with her and deleted me again. Fast forward 3 years later and they broke up for good and tada he sent me friend request again. What is this guys deal? Should I just block him at this point?

My best male friend who I trusted so well and believe in,that people who doesn’t even know us so well do refer to us as brothers cause we look alike though,and always hang around together.
But he really stabbed me on my chest!.. That the girl am dating after graduating and also hope to marry her,happens to know him long time that I noticed that the first day I introduced her to him before She told me. But I felt like it doesn’t matter because we are now talking about marriage and besides my friend has a girl friend too. 
So I try keeping everything real with him not knowing that his heart seems not to be pure with me. So I dated this girl for six months without knowing the color of her pant. All she keeps saying is that I should put a ring on her finger first,though we kiss,romance etc.. but always deny me sex. It do pain me at times but still stay calm because I believe I have a future with her. But not being aware that my best friend is playing my role and always also advise me to emphasize patient till we get marry then I can enjoy the whole thing. But with time things keep getting more suspicious cause I keep thinking about that everyday and now decided to keep an eye on her and reports starting coming that they mostly see my fiancée and my best friend together mostly on same particular hour every time. 
So to cut the story short is that I finally caught both together red handed in my friends room when I just went to pair him a visit. And up till now I still don’t believe what I saw because I have given her my all to the extent that I typically talk to girls since she came into my life.

I personally have never been in a long term relationship on the other hand, he had been with his ex for 10 years. He said that after they'd broke up he had took 2 years to learn more about himself and cope with everything since they had two kids together. 

While on the app we discussed many things which were mutual in terms of hobbies, books, intentions etc. (I haven't had the slightest connection since or prior to.) Furthermore, we exchanged numbers and began talking on the phone and texting. He was very consistent and seemed extremely mature and overall intelligent.

We set up what seemed to be a secure foundation where we were able to be completely open, honest, transparent and understanding. Three days in, he had mentioned he wanted to see me although he had his kids. Initially, we planned to go out on a date two days afterwards however, the more we connected over the phone I too wanted to meet him IRL. 

Now, at first I was hesitant because I know how I can be and I wanted to be straightforward as possible. I told him that I am very affectionate and when attracted to someone I can become highly sexual. I told him I didn't want it to become some hookup he inferred that ""we are beyond that because of the foundation we'd set"". I took what he said into consideration and told him I'd think about it. 

A few hours passed and he calls me and tells me that his children fell asleep and asked me about coming over because he wanted to be in my presence. I told him I still was unsure (I am very indecisive) but, I eventually made up my mind and decided to come the more we talked.

Now once I arrived it was barely any talking because we were all over each other.

While I can't say a bad thing about her or our time together, I was having some uncertainties about whether she was really the one and worth pursuing.  I suppressed these feelings for a day or two because on paper we should be totally compatible and as I said, I really enjoyed my time with her.  However, even though I couldn't put a finger on what was off or why I wasn't feeling stronger, I knew that for her sake it was best to end things now rather than continue to drag it on.

We didn't text much between dates and I initiated the contact 90% of the time so it would have been really easy for me to ghost her.  I feel really, really guilty and bad delivering any sort of negative news so the easiest thing for me would have been to just never text her and avoid that conversation altogether.  Eventually, I decided to sack up and do what was best for her and that was to be honest and direct.  I went to her place after work, sat her down, and explained exactly how I was feeling.  She was certainly sad and upset but she thanked me 3 separate times for handling things the way I did.  She thanked me for being honest, doing it face to face, and being direct.  In fact, she even texted me after our conversation to thank me for handling it the way I did.

The reason for this post is simple...don't ghost.  I get why people do it but the right thing for both parties is to be honest, direct and communicate and allows both individuals to move on and have closure.  The easy thing for me would have been to do nothing but the right thing for her was to tell her to her face and be honest.

Been hitting it up a lot with a girl I met through work. I actually went to school with her so we always knew of each other but never knew each other personally. We’ve become friends at work and talk outside of work now too.

Our vibe is really good, but the tricky thing is this: I believe now that guys and girls can be just friends. I didn’t always believe that, and some people can’t, but I do see it happen where guys and girls can be good platonic friends and it works well and I value that. 

I consider her a friend right now, but if I’m being honest she is really the type of girl I can see myself being intimate with and she’s really good to me. The thing is: I’m just chilling right now, no interest in forcing anything. I wouldn’t want to mess up the friendship by being overly flirtatious or trying to force more. I just want to see how our vibe develops more and see what happens. 

My question is about the logistics of doing things together while trying to maintain this “just chill and see how our vibe grows” thing. Sometimes we’ll buy each other food at work. We just went and got food the other night after work, but I only paid for myself and I didn’t offer to pay for her because I was kinda just viewing it like two friends going to grab food real quick after work.

She agreed to hang out with me again this week doing something outdoors.

I don’t know if or when I should be offering to pay for everything, go pick her up instead of her meeting me places, etc. I don’t know what’s appropriate or expected of me at different stages.

Basically I just feel ignorant about logistics because of how long I was off the market dealing with deep mental and personal challenges. I don’t want to mess up the friendship but I also don’t want her to be disappointed in me not taking things to a next level faster if that’s what she’s hoping for.

One of the things she said part way through was that she never imagined she'd be in a relationship with an unemployed person but I was an exception.  I was understanding to that since she had a kid and her ex (childs dad) couldn't provide much but was involved and not a bad guy.  That being relevant is understandable.  She also knew my finances pretty well so that probably helped but she learned it significantly into the relationship not say the beginning.

One of the things I want to do more in this period is date more.  I worked a lot at my job as well as my mental health in the past so I haven't dated as much as I should/could have.

I read something that 75% of women wouldn't date someone unemployed.  Now I'm kind of wondering how to approach this since it's one of the first things that usually gets brought up is taking about your job.  Financially I'm really well off.  I don't need a job and I don't really want one right now but I don't want to tell a date that because I've also had negative experiences when people learn that. I also don't want to be immediately written off because they think I'm a deadbeat or won't be able to contribute in that aspect.  I've joked with people that I'm retired but being 30 that seems to be more confusing even though I could be if I really wanted.

—Okay so I’ve been feeling like my girl needed some space. After she had canceled plans two weekends in a row, the third week I ignored her thinking that’s what she wanted. I call her after 7 days and we had a great talk just catching up then she abruptly hangs up because her aunt needed her right before I was going to ask about plans. 

So I send her a text seeing if she was available this weekend and she says she’s mad at me. So I ask why and she just says she’s mad again. I then asked if she would like to talk about it over dinner at my house this weekend and again evades that. I then sent a minute long voice memo the next day just saying that I apologize for upsetting her and I’d like to see her this weekend. She then told me she would yell at me about it next weekend in which I liked the message. —

Then randomly two days later she sends me a text saying “Hey I was thinking before we get too serious or anything that I need to just focus on myself for right now because my mental health is getting really bad. I’m truly sorry but I just think my mental health is spiraling and I just need to find myself at the moment.”

So I sent a message stating that I understood and that I am here for her if she needed anything and that I would drop off her brothers stuff and her books at some point in which I can let her know when that will be if she wants to know. 

So I guess I am asking if I should let her be for a while or should I go ahead surprise her with something in a week?

If you’re a guy and you’ve struggled, I’m sure you’ve been gaslit on here before

“It’s your personality”
“It’s your tinder bio”
“You’re probably not showering or have bad hygiene”

I’m sure for a small percentage of guys, those things are applicable but we obviously know for most, those are bullshit but we have to tap dance around the situation on Reddit because while certain genders are up front about their superficiality, others are self conscious about it and will lie before giving the opposite gender the truth

We have eyes. We have ears. We see what type of guys get the casual flings with little effort, what type of guys have to pay for 10 expensive dates to get any physical contact and what type of guys get absolutely nothing.  We see and hear about what women let certain type of guys get away with in their relationships. We see what type of guys (physically) most young women gravitate towards. It’s all good. Nobody is vilifying anybody here but there’s different sets of rules for different people. We all know it but certain types of people have the numbers on this platform and use them to brigade threads like this and mislead others. Ignore them, they’re full of shit and many of us already know it 

Chances are, if you’re struggling, it is a PHYSICAL appearance issue. All the other bullshit reasons people give are easily overcame by those who are physically attractive enough. There’s no beating around the bush. If you’re not naturally blessed facially/height wise, there is zero room for error in other departments  

1. Skin
2. Teeth
3. Fashion
4. Physique

After nearly becoming a hermit, my mother and father married and I had some semblance of normal introduced into my life.

I own all that is mine, have a 2018 Camry, a factory job, furniture, and pay (reduced price) rent, as well as help out with upkeep and appliance purchases. I'm very socially awkward and can't have trouble talking to, let alone dating women. I have made several attempts to ask women out and get rejected constantly or just ghosted after a date.

We've been in different states during Covid so haven't got to spend time together in person. I felt like we would have been ""officially"" in a relationship months ago, except we wanted to spend more in-person time together before doing that. 

We've had tentative plans for her to come visit me for several months now. She already pushed those plans back a month, but then we finally settled on dates. 

Then today she texts me (my thoughts in brackets):

&gt;I'm looking at my schedule to see if our trip will work. I'm wondering what you've got in mind for the trip. Will I be staying with you, or should I get a hotel? Are we just going to get dinner together and then split up, or do you want to spend a lot of time together?

Maybe it doesn't seem like much, but this is pretty ridiculous. We set these dates 2 weeks ago, and *now* she's looking at her schedule and wondering if it will work? Plus she doesn't have a job right now and for the last 6 months has barely left her apartment; exactly how hard can it be to fit something into her schedule? Also, the questions about where she'll be staying and how much time we'll be spending together are just insane. We've been talking about her coming to see me for months, she's going to fly to another state to see me... and she thinks her getting a hotel, just grabbing dinner and then saying goodbye is what I had in mind? 

Seems pretty clear she's not into the trip and is being cagey about it rather than just coming out and saying it like an adult. Which is really, really disappointing...

TLDR at the bottom. 

Having gone through chatting with some girls and trying to find someone, I just feel exhausted and sad. More on that below, but I had different situations. I talked to girls who I wanted to take things further with. Some just ignored me. One girl was interested in me but I wasn't interested in her at all. All of this failed, and now I just don't want to attempt anything for an indefinite period. I will delete all my dating profiles and stop trying to find someone for now. Maybe eventually I will do that again or everything will be better off after the pandemic ends and we go back to normal when it is easier to meet people, but I don't feel like even trying that now. And it is just sad because my age is when it is exactly the right time to explore romantic relationships. 

To give you some context about myself, I am a 18 year old male, and I live in the U.S. as an immigrant from an Eastern European country. I didn't really have any interest in dating and romantic relationships and never tried to find someone until April-May of the last year. I guess it just started out of the boredom I had when the pandemic hit, but later on I started thinking more deeply about the question of dating and relationships. Then, I realized that there really is something missing in my life, and that is love. Don't get me wrong - I have some amazing friends (although they are back in my home country and I don't have many friends in the U.S., but that's not a big issue for me) as well as my mom who has helped me tremendously with advice and other assistance. I certainly don't mean that there are no people in my life who love and support me. Romantic love, on the other hand, is something that I have never had experience with previously, never being in a serious relationship or dating anyone. What I wanted (and still want, I guess) is to feel what it is like when you love someone and someone loves you back in this way. I don't know if I believe in the existence of soulmates, but I feel that a very special bond between people who love each other exists - and I just want to experience that. Additionally, I have been looking not only for love, but a long-term romantic relationship rather than anything in the short term. Honestly, I am afraid that I will lose these sparks and thoughts on love I have as the time goes by, and I hope that I will find someone sooner rather than later before my fire goes out. 

But enough with what I have been looking for (love and a long-term relationship) and sorrowful thoughts. Here is what actually happened with me. As I mentioned above, I started trying to have conversations with girls a year ago. Here, it is important to say that I mostly used a dating chat bot on social media that people in my home country and its neighbors use. There were some people from the U.S. (you can set any city there and swipe on people), although it was mostly just populated with trolls who didn't really live in the U.S. Later, I also tried using Bumble and Tinder, and I had zero luck with it, finding that the majority of girls there look solely either for casual sex and hookups or followers on Insta. I found myself swiping left almost constantly, which is not what guys usually do, but I genuinely felt that I could never feel love in the way I described above with the vast majority of women on these apps, deleting them soon. I had way more luck with the chat bot I described above, and below I will write about situations I had with girls of my or similar ethnicity I found there (or other sometimes using something else). I counted, and I can say that I had some kind of a chance with 7-8 girls, but in the end, I can say that I couldn't love any of them. Oh, and I had no meetings that you consider real dates. So here is the experience I had.

\- Overall, I had some interesting conversations about different topics with some girls, but they really went nowhere after I or them stopped chatting due to losing interest. 

\- Some girls ignored me outright when I messaged them after connecting on the bot, and I didn't send dumb messages like just ""hi"" or ""baby what's up"". Why would you even do that if you registered in a dating chat app?

\- I went out with one girl two times last summer. We never really mentioned that these were dates. I had some cringe moments with her (check out my very first post for more) but she was eventually interested and then lost this interest, I guess. Fast forward to March now - I went to the city she lived in and asked her on a date. Actually, so far this was the first and only time when I explicitly said that to a girl. She refused, telling me she has a boyfriend. I was able to confirm this, so she didn't say that to come up with a reason for refusing. However, I knew she didn't have a boyfriend back when we met in summer previously. 

\- One girl was genuinely interested in me, and I could tell from the clues in chatting. She sent me a heart emoji on the first day we met and then sent some more suggestive stickers and images. The problem is that, to put it mildly, she wasn't really my type. I don't want to date or love a 16 year old girl who drinks and smokes. This is not the only issue I had with her, but it is the biggest one. I don't feel bad for ghosting her, no thanks. 

\- Another girl lived close to me, and after we had a good chat, I thought I could just ask her for a walk and see where it goes. Until I found her profile on another social media that people in my country use (we chatted in a different app). She had a status (you can use these and they are standardized) with heart emoji and text that said ""I love at a distance"". I then found a profile of a guy from her home country to whom she sent a gift with a joke that said ""I wish I were your bed because it's under you every day"". How funny. I didn't want to get into any awkward situations, and, needless to say, I didn't suggest her to go for a walk and our communication stopped. 

\- This girl asked me about politics and she told me that she was moderate in her beliefs but then told me that she supported the Republican side on the issue of coronavirus. I proceeded to find out more, and she said that she doesn't believe in restrictions, is against the vaccines, and thinks that some conspiracy theories about its origins might be true. Well, I tried to dissuade her but failed and stopped communication. Some of you might say this is controversial and solely the matter of opinion, and I will not argue otherwise. I will just say that my thinking on the issue was completely different and it was a deal breaker, so please respect my opinion as well. 

I had more stories, but I will not post them all here since you get the point. I wasn't able to find someone and now want to give up on it for idk how long due to my experience trying. All of this is just a little depressing, and I start to doubt whether I will be able to date anyone later. But maybe everything is still ahead for me, I just don't know. I am aware that my failure so far is not the end of the world and that many people are in far worse situations than me. Finally, sorry for being so long-winded, and thanks for reading my rant. 

TLDR: After trying to find someone and looking for love/serious romantic relationship, I feel exhausted  and discouraged due to no positive experience dating. Sometimes I missed my shots, sometimes I wasn't interested, sometimes things just went wrong. Now, I don't know what to do next and want to just give up searching, even though I feel the fire and my age is considered golden for finding love.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,725662,public,self,I want to stop trying to find someone for an indefinite period of time as a 18M,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/muhpfy/i_want_to_stop_trying_to_find_someone_for_an/,all_ads,6,,,

We instantly had no issue talking about whatever and eventually that first night hooked up. It was one of the most passionate nights I’ve ever had but I chalked it up to be a one night stand and didn’t think much of it. I actually left the next day without saying anything because 1 I had to go to work and 2 I didn’t want to get caught up with the feelings I was having after just meeting him the night before.
Fast forward a week or two we’ve continued to spend time together hooked up a few times and it has only been getting better and better. I can feel my self falling for him but like all men in my life lately they don’t want anything serious and want to just have fun. 

I confided in him telling him that I was feeling this connection and wanted reassurance that I wasn’t crazy about what I was feeling. He agreed and told me that he felt something as well but isn’t ready for something long term or even a commitment. He told me that he is afraid that he is going to cheat and doesn’t want to hurt me. 

How do I take that? I finally found someone who I had an instant connection with, passionate sex, a lot in common with and he makes me forget about all the things that stress me out in that moment. We danced in the living together just having a good time, he’ll sing his favorite song to me.
But on the opposite of the scale he makes me feel like I’m not good enough not to cheat on. 
He makes me feel insignificant not a priority. 
It’s hard to even contemplate waiting around for him to realize the type of person I am because I know my worth, I want to fight to show him who I am but I’ve spent so much energy on trying in the past that going forward why waste time to prove myself when I don’t have to. 

Having this vent session has not only made me feel better but solidified to myself and I hope to whoever took the time to read this that I’d rather be the one who got away then sit at his feet begging him to love me looking stupid. 

I hope that if he ever comes across this, he reads this and see that I was hurting and wanted him more than anything. I was willing to love and accept him for all of his flaws and wanted to praise him for them.

""If she's not making an effort...."", and I've never found that my experiences relate to these at all. Women my age here where I live seem to be very reserved, don't really engage in conversation all that much, let alone flirt.

I also hear the tropes about ""work on yourself and women will come"" but in my experience this doesn't align at all as I've found the better I get, the more standoffish women my age here are to me. For example, I used to have women my age be friendlier to me and even approach me every so often at times but now I'm in shape and dress better, have a leaner face, women have become a lot more standoffish.

I've talked to women here about this and they say that it's normal for them to be friendlier towards less attractive guys and that they'll be more standoffish towards more attractive guys.

This doesn't align with the common reddit threads I see about signs of interest etc and it got me thinking that maybe these common dating tropes/advice/etc are mainly specific to America and was wondering if there were any other Redditors not from America who felt similarly about this.

28(F) here. My boyfriend (28M) of a little more than a year broke up with me 2 weeks ago because he thinks we are non-compatible and think I am ""immature"" compared to him. I was very hurt.  I loved him despite his flaws and anger issues. After 2 days of the breakup, we reconnected and start sleeping with each other. We have been intimate for more than 2 weeks and while I am with him, he would tell me he loves me and want to work it out in the future. He would treat me as if we are still together. He would invite me to sleep over and still does nice gestures like buying me food and taking me out. 

However; on the days he doesn't see me. He would rarely text me and would take hours to reply back and I'm always the one who has to follow through with the plans. He ignores my calls when I need to ask him an important question. He doesn't let me know his schedule until the last minute and I felt he would only hang out with me if he has no plans with his friends. He would ignore my text messages but I know he's on his phone because he would post IG stories. He is the one who advises my best friend (back when we together and my BFF was seeking advice from us) if a guy barely texts you, it means he doesn't care much about you. And I conclude from that remark he doesn't care about me right now. 

He would text me at night randomly that he loves me and misses me. Yet he tells me that I am just his friend. Funny thing is that he is currently still sleeping with me but he was the one who told me he never had casual sex before. And I know he doesn't. I asked him why he is still sleeping with me and he said he is not making me as a placeholder but he is considering working it out in the future. Then he would call me his soulmate. He also got very angry and jealous that I am going to the gym with my friend (female) and she invited her friend who is a trainer (male). He got jealous my friend's trainer friend is going to be there despite I do not have any history with that guy and I don't even know him. My ex also got mad at me for improving myself by going to the gym and starting a side hustle right after we broke up. He thought it was disrespectful that I begin taking his advice after the breakup.

Mostly just interested in having a friend to hang out with these last few weeks. Any advice on how to proceed or anything?

28(F) here. My boyfriend (28M) of a little more than a year broke up with me 2 weeks ago because he thinks we are non-compatible and think I am ""immature"" compared to him. I was very hurt.  I loved him despite his flaws and anger issues. After 2 days of the breakup, we reconnected and start sleeping with each other. We have been intimate for more than 2 weeks and while I am with him, he would tell me he loves me and want to work it out in the future. He would treat me as if we are still together. He would invite me to sleep over and still does nice gestures like buying me food and taking me out.

However; on the days he doesn't see me. He would rarely text me and would take hours to reply back and I'm always the one who has to follow through with the plans. He ignores my calls when I need to ask him an important question. He doesn't let me know his schedule until the last minute and I felt he would only hang out with me if he has no plans with his friends. He would ignore my text messages but I know he's on his phone because he would post IG stories. He is the one who advises my best friend (back when we together and my BFF was seeking advice from us) if a guy barely texts you, it means he doesn't care much about you. And I conclude from that remark he doesn't care about me right now.

He would text me at night randomly that he loves me and misses me. Yet he tells me that I am just his friend. Funny thing is that he is currently still sleeping with me but he was the one who told me he never had casual sex before. And I know he doesn't. I asked him why he is still sleeping with me and he said he is not making me as a placeholder but he is considering working it out in the future. Then he would call me his soulmate. He also got very angry and jealous that I am going to the gym with my friend (female) and she invited her friend who is a trainer (male). He got jealous my friend's trainer friend is going to be there despite I do not have any history with that guy and I don't even know him. My ex also got mad at me for improving myself by going to the gym and starting a side hustle right after we broke up. He thought it was disrespectful that I begin taking his advice after the breakup. Even though I used the breakup to reflect and took immediate actions to fix my mistakes.  So many mixed signals and I honestly don't know what to feel anymore because I am very hurt.

So guys, any idea what is going on? And brutal honesty is welcomed.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,726015,public,self,I Need Advice from Men!! Is my ex-bf stringing me along?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mul43q/i_need_advice_from_men_is_my_exbf_stringing_me/,all_ads,6,,,
