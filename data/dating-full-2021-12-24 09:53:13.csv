She mentioned a present she wanted and I was hesitant to get it as I wasn’t sure if it was too soon but I figured I wanted to and she deserved them, they weren’t mega expensive but a fair amount. I went round to give them to her yesterday. She was happy with them but when I left, I still felt uncomfortable and unsure in myself. She text back saying she was happy with them and so grateful. She didn’t get me anything, which is fine as I didn’t give the present to receive one and I’m not that bothered.

I opened up the dialogue of if it was too much, too soon &amp; she said the act wasn’t too much but paired with the trip away and it being Christmas makes a difference. She then said she told her friend and she said anything Christmas related gives off cozy and coupley vibes so the notion is quite intense, and she felt like that was a perfect description. She then added that it isn’t a dig at me and I haven’t turned her off.

I said that’s fine, we can cool it off over Christmas and she said it’s a busy time seeing family and she has to rearrange old plans with friends that were cancelled last week but we still have a date booked in for January.

Ultimately, I’m not really sure what to think of it, last I saw of her she was quite affectionate and touchy but now I feel like I’ve read everything wrong and I’m not sure how to even go about it all anymore. 

Do I stop texting her? Do I just pretend it didn’t happen? I would like her to be upfront if she doesn’t have the same feelings and don’t want her to avoid doing it just because of a gift and her feeling obligated to continue talking to me (which I explained to her).

I’ve been on 3 dates with this girl I’ve meet off Hinge. We had sex for the first time on Tuesday. I am really into her.

On Wednesday she texted me that she really likes me wanted to be honest about that she has also been going on dates with other guys as well, which I appreciate her telling (I had some vibes that she was but wasn’t my place to ask about). Personally I am more of the kind of person who “exclusively causally dates” (if that makes sense). I brought up to her that I personally have not been seeing other girls and have barely checked any of my dating apps since after our first date. I also asked her if she had been sexually active with anyone else recently just so I can make sure I’m safe with regards to condom usage/protecting myself.

I asked her about what she thought about us moving forward and when she would know if she wanted to be exclusive with me or something else; she told me that she would be cool with being “exclusively casually date” each other so we could both get to know each other better before becoming official.  She told me that she thinks I'm great but definitely wants to go on a few more dates as she has had bad experiences in the past.

It ended bad with infidelity, she cheated on me with at least 35 guys that I know of. I hit a deep depression and became extremely introverted. Afterwards i wouldn't even entertain the idea of anyone interested in dating me. Years go by, eventually I created a social media account to keep up with sports highlights. I was a SM virgin, I didn't partake in any social media before this in my life so I was unaware of the potential risk.

 Somehow I met this girl online, it started as just friendly conversation out of curiosity but eventually grew into something more. We began chatting all day and every day. After a year She eventually started speaking of starting a life together, I was sold on the dream. She was the sweetest girl I've ever met and went above and beyond to make me happy. I did the same for her. She Introduced me to her family and close friends. There was great distance between us(different countries), but that wasn't an issue because I was financially in a good position to visit whenever I wanted. The issue was the pandemic lockdown happened when we became a thing and lasted the entire duration of our interactions. 
Months go by,

I noticed her getting distant towards the end, I felt her slipping away but couldn't do anything to stop the bleeding. She broke things off with me and told me that she lost hope that things will work out, stating that it's been a couple years and we haven't met yet. She also admitted the doubts hit her after her ex bf from years ago randomly reached out. He was also long distance from her but he lives in her hometown. She decided to pursue his advances. Less than 2 weeks after she broke it off, the travel ban was lifted. I was devastated, meeting her irl had became my dream. She chose to visit him instead, completely crushed my heart and spirit. (Crying profusely rn just thinking about it resurfaces the pain I felt)

I had developed a deep emotional attachment to her which makes the pain noticeably worse than a physical one for me personally. All I'm left with now is broken thoughts and dreams of what could've been while she's back with her ex. I feel extremely foolish for thinking someone's love for me was as pure as mine and thinking that a girl across the world could love me when the one I was with physically for 15 years didn't. I wish I'd known about this subreddit sooner, I'd have realized that I was essentially fooling myself (playing the adult version of house - Random redditor). 

I gave her all of me and she abandoned me, won't allow me to meet her and now won't even return a friendly nonromantic message. 

*Not suicidal but have no will to live, I've given up on ever finding happiness in this world. I have no one in this world, not even loving parents.

He also lives in the city where I will move in 9 months but right now we are 500km apart. We planned to meet up in February. He suddenly just stopped texting me and I thought well here it is sexting and ghosting again. I asked him and he actually replied and told me that he has to deal with depression right now and doesn’t really do anything and that he is suffering from it since his childhood. He stopped texting me again and when I was really drunk I told him that I am not mad when he can’t text me and that when he feels better he can reach out if he wants to.  That was 3 weeks ago. I feel so stupid I know I should just move on and say thank u next or something like that. But I can’t. I think about him constantly. I’m used to having guys run after me and 90% of the time when I meet guys on dating apps i don’t feel any sort of connection. But not with him. I have never in my whole life been that interested In a man before it’s literally crazy (I get gehostet too don’t get me wrong, I normally just don’t care). I know maybe it’s just a sex thing and he doesn’t care about me. It probably is. 

I don’t know what I should do. Should I really move on and try to forget him? Or should I text him again(that would be the third message from me in a row because he didn’t answer) and ask if he’s ok or something like that?

After he came back, he didn't get in contact, didn't ask me out and I didn't ask him out again either because I had already asked once and didn't want to be pushy. Weeks went by and I didn't hear from him. In the end, I messaged him to strike up a conversation, asked him how his trip was. I was hoping this would remind him of me and provide him an opportunity to ask me out. He wrote back and he said the trip was nice and asked me how I am, but he took 3 days to read my reply and after he finally did read it, he left it on read.

I ran into him a few weeks later somewhere and we had some pleasant chitchat, but it led nowhere.

At this point, I think I really have to cut my losses and move on, as he is clearly not interested. I'm just trying to understand why someone would say that we should do something once he is back if he clearly doesn't mean it. Did he say it to be ""polite""? Why did he even respond to my message if he was not interested?

Before we dated, I was a serial monogamist who liked to tell myself I was a dating butterfly, but compared to now, in hindsight I was just a single caterpillar looking for my next LTR cocoon. Like most of my relationships, my ex and I moved very fast with emotions. I felt like he was “the one” for the whole relationship, so dating afterwards was a little tough to understand again. At first, dating became this chore of solving human-shaped Rubix cubes as quickly as possible and throwing them away if I didn’t feel like they could “live up” to how i felt for my ex. What was the point? Along the way I started noticing how happy I was in the during. I was taking care of myself, trying to look good for first dates, constantly going out and having new experiences, and learning so much about different perspectives and music and media. Instead of cutting off people I didn’t see long term potential with, I stopped looking for long term partners, and just enjoyed the ride. I started cutting off people who played games, or gave red flags, and keeping people who just weren’t my “idea” of perfect, but I liked their company. 

I’ve always been an enthusiastic conversationalist, and dating really has shown me how much I enjoy that tightrope walk of trying to win someone over when you’re getting to know them. I’ve started being upfront with people that I’m not looking for a relationship, I enjoy dating around, and I want to stay being single as long as possible. Some people either don’t vibe with this or think I’m bluffing to not seem clingy, but aside from them, This has led me into some wonderfully fulfilling less-than-relationships. I’m not tied to one person, but I get enough intimacy that I don’t feel used, or like I’m using them. I don’t worry about people texting me back, I’m not hurt if someone isn’t as into me as I’d hoped. I have self confidence radiating, which becomes a self fulfilling prophecy of attraction and validation. Dating happily is easy if you love yourself first, and I notice what I love about myself when I’m presenting my best me to someone else.

I wasn’t quite ready for it and then caught him lying about something major but decided to forgive him. About a month later we decide to become official. 

I had told him that my best friend (M 25) is coming from out of state and will be staying one night at my place. My partner assumed he’d also be staying with me. I haven’t seen my BFF in a couple years so I told him I just wanted it to be us. He seemed fine with it.

The day I went to pick up BFF and I’m 1.5 hours from home he blows up my phone saying he doesn’t trust my BFF and that he’s upset and suspicious that I want to be alone with him. I explained that I’ve known my BFF for 8 years and him 2 months so he does not get to make that decision. 

A week after that I get a message from a woman on instagram telling me he cheated on me that night. They went out for drinks and he stayed at her house when I thought he was at his mothers house. 

We broke up but continued to see each other until November we made things official again. 


I do not want to keep blaming our arguments on his cheating because if I made the decision to forgive him, I should try to move forward from this. I know he’s trying his best now but I still have my doubts that he’s loyal and the issues I have with him always make me think back at his disloyalty. It’s causing me to be insecure and suspicious which is disconnecting me from him. I am still angry that he started a fight about not trusting me nor my BFF and then did exactly what he feared I would do. I am angry that he has lied about major things on multiple occasions but wants me to treat him as if it didn’t happen.

If you date online you should come up with a system that spares  your mental health whilst also allows you to pursue potential partners. 

I see a lot of people on this sub that seem to sacrifice their mental health, time and energy in the pursuit of love. 

I ask you to stop. Believe me you hold all the cards, you’re just not using them properly. 

Over my time OLD I have come up with a system that eliminates ghosts and unserious people. Here is the way. 

First off, just like who you want to like or talk to who you are interested in. Don’t go for the cast your net wide approach. 

Next have 1 conversation and get off the dating app. Ask for an Instagram or a number or whatever you want. I ask for insta because I think you can get a better look at what that person is actually like but this is personal preference.

All you need to do is when your first conversation comes to a natural end then ask for a social. If they are somewhat interested they will give it to you if they are not then they won’t. 

Next stage is talking off the app. Just have a convo simple. See what vibe they give. If you like it and if YOU want to then ask to go in a date at the next possible time. If they don’t want to date you this is where they ghost, become flakey or whatever. So far you have wasted about 2 days. Which is probably about 3-4 conversations? 

I’ve been using apps for about 2 years now. You meet people on there that want to date, don’t want to date or are unsure. There is no way to know which one of these you are talking to so force their hand. Make them commit to a date. Don’t mean that in a forceful way of course I just mean give them that option because if they want to and the offer is there then they will.

If you are interested in someone romantically, it’s crucial that this type of dynamic is established early on. Otherwise, your dynamic will veer towards platonic friendship. 

Consistent eye contact is perhaps the biggest factor in establishing an emotional bond in the early stages of dating. Studies have shown how constant eye contact during personal interactions can promote feelings between participants. If both of you are looking elsewhere in a loud environment, there isn’t a chance to look at each other directly, talk, ask interesting questions, bond.

We've already delved deep into subjects like long-term goals, what we do and don't like in a relationship, sex, lots of things. We reguarly have long phone calls and it's very comfortable; I've been pretty excited so far and fell for him a bit prior to the first date.

On the whole we seem really compatible, but there's one detail that makes me feel terrible for not liking. We matched on tinder and his photos were a bit 'bigger' than average. There was a bit of chunkyness, but his cute face still came through. My bodytype preference is average-to-skinny; I decided to give this a go as this is leaps and bounds better than my past dozen dating prospects in every other aspect.

We had our first date and it was great... But I felt he was larger than the photos of him I saw before. I was enjoying myself though and we went back to his, and he initiated fooling around but we didn't have any kind of sex (my preference). Great date overall, but my physical attraction for him has very much waned. Prior to this date he brought up his weight semi-frequently, joking that he's big. I didn't really know how to react. He sent me photos from a few years ago at a 'normal' weight and... **oh my god,** he was *EXACTLY* my type. Absolutely adorable face, incredible proportions, sexy arms, I was getting turned on just thinking about hugging him in that state. 

He at one point said he's happy with his weight right now, and might lose some in the future. I feel so conflicted. It would be horrible of me to say I was more attracted to his previous photos, and it would be awful for me to go into a relationship with him with the intent to try and change him. At the same time, the idea of breaking things off when everything else is close-to-ideal feels awful, and I would have zero idea how to articulate why I'd be breaking up with him truthfully, other than giving some bullshit excuse like 'there's no chemistry' which would give him zero closure when the real reason is incredibly simple.

When I got there, they were already drinking. After a while of getting to know each other, I offered to buy a round, which my date told me not to worry about it and that she got it. We eventually left, to go to another bar which is on the north side, but it totally sucked. I offered to buy her a beer there and she told me it was ok and that she couldn't drink anymore. So we agreed to get something to eat, and everyone agreed on IHOP, well the son told me to follow him, which I did and I noticed that we were heading back to downtown. When we got close, she told me that we were probably going to Denny's. 

The thing is that I hate Denny's. I think their corporate tasting pancakes are garbage lol. I was really hungry and tired and I just wanted to get home. So I told her that I had a great time and I would like to do it again sometime, but I was probably going to head home. She said ok, and gave me a kiss and got out and walked to her sons car. Then I noticed that while talking to him, she kept looking back at me, and I was thinking uh oh..that's not a great sign. I waited a min or two and then slowly pulled out and went home. 

When I got home, I realized that maybe she didn't have anymore money since she had spent so much money at the bar. I would have been ok to pay for her, but we didn't even talk about it. The next day, I got up and she had blocked me on fb and text. So should I have approached this differently? My sister said that I shouldn't have said that I didn't like Denny's and I should have sucked it up and just drank a glass of water, but I was hungry and tired and I just honestly feel like I shouldn't have to do that.

I posted about this situation on dating advice sub to vent, specially after I told the guy and he called me 2x and texted 4x mocking/challenging my decision to cancel. I told the guy I just wasn’t interested and didn’t want to waste his time. I was honest. I felt uncomfortable/frustrated/upset that he didn’t take my answer and instead called and texted to challenge it/mock it. 

A few men on the sub basically thought my reason for cancelling was wrong and I “ghosted” the guy. Even thought I informed him, gave reasons, was polite about it, and had no define date time the day of. Thag didn’t really bug me. What bugged me was the attitude some of the responses showed, where they wanted a female to be on a date despite not wanting to be there or being OK with a female being on a date despite her feeling uncomfortable.

The reasoning some of the responses had was crazy. Some went as far as to say my ego was hurt about cancelling. Others that my prior post (where I discuss 2 ghosting situations) were a reflection of being a crappy person for cancelling on the guy. I don’t take any of this personally, but it’s disheartening to see this. It’s disheartening to read how a guy would be perfectly ok being on a date with someone that doesn’t want to be there/is uncomfortable. Obviously it says a lot more about them but wow.

Feeling really hurt and confused. 

A little about myself: I don’t want to sound cocky but I feel like I’m a legitimate catch. I’m tall, funny, fun, active, a good listener, I have a good job in engineering, I’m financially responsible, in good shape, and enough women have told me I’m handsome that by now I finally believe it. 

Honestly I think this is the first time I’ve been rejected dating as an adult except for two girls who as I was breaking it off said they felt the same and that’s just a chemistry thing. This was also the first girl I’ve been excited about like this. Usually I’m not excited about someone until we’ve been hanging out for a lot longer, but with her I was mid third date and it just hit me what an insane catch she is. I feel like I’ve been waiting for someone to come around who I just felt really lucky to be hanging out with. She was that. The top of the dating pool for me. 

Ok so the dates. They all went well. On the first date we had great conversation and chemistry. I walked her to her car after and kissed her. She literally said “wow” and then went to get in her car and came back for more saying “wow” again. Our second date we met at the rock climbing gym. It’s not the best setting for a date but it was fun and we were able to do some like physical flirting. I had to run but we said we would meet again. In between the dates we were texting alot and when I asked when I could see her again she said “you tell me” which made me feel like she was really into me and I was holding things up. We made plans to have dinner in her neighborhood which she later changed to cooking dinner at her place which I took as a great sign. Ok the third date she seemed excited to have me over and show me her place. We worked well together in the kitchen and had good conversation. While we cooked i took the opportunity to get a little physical. Massaging her neck, touching her back, etc. She ate it up. We talked for a long while after dinner and at some point I start to realize “this girl is amazing” smart, interesting, funny, good job, physically my ideal, same hobbies, confident, competent, driven, resourceful. Just everything. Im super into her but I also feel like I’m a match. Not insecure at all. Eventually I made a move and we started making out on the couch. Clothes start coming off and things continue to heat up from there. The physical chemistry is as good as it gets. Eventually we’re in the bedroom and we fool around until late at night. We don’t have sex because the ahem timing is bad but we do everything else. There’s no mistaking that she was very much enjoying herself. She was very generous with me as well. Eventually it gets to be really late and I say I should leave and she pulls me back in. The third time I say I should leave she tells me I should stay. The whole time I’m there we’re cuddling, kissing, touching. Just really indulgent physical contact. She eats it up. In the morning it’s more of the same but I say I should go eventually and she again pushes me to stay even though she has meetings. Eventually I actually leave. I drive away grinning like an idiot thinking I’ve found someone amazing who’s super into me as well. 

We don’t make plans for a next date just yet because of holidays travel plans. Pretty quickly I feel a shift in the texting. She’s not texting back as fast and we’re not really flirting. I try to make some sexy flirts that she basically ignores. I’m getting confused but I think she’s just busy with work and visiting family. Maybe she feels like she needs to text more early when you’re still in that online dating phase but not so much when you’ve established there’s a connection? I worry I’m just texting too much because I’m excited and coming off desperate. I decide to just leave her be and see what happens. She texts me late one night and I don’t reply. 13 hours later she texts me something like “hey I hope you’re having a great day!”  And this makes me think ok she does want to chat. I make a date with her for the day after I get back. She enthusiastically agrees to let me cook her dinner. I say I can’t wait to return the favor of her cooking and as well as some others (just trying to be sexy playful flirty) but she doesn’t reply. 

The next day she basically says even though we have “undeniable chemistry” it doesn’t feel right. I say ok no worries but what was it. Her feedback was that she felt defensive around me and I probably didn’t even notice but it doesn’t feel like how she normally is. Replaying everything in my head I can’t imagine when I would have made her feel that way. The best I can come up with is that my playful little flirty jokes that I make with everyone may have been the issue. Maybe she’s used to people just praising her. I think most women like this kind of playful teasing because it keeps them on their toes. That or she just thought I was ok but used me for physical stuff and then made that up because she couldn’t be honest. 

I’m super bummed but after a day of feeling really down on myself I feel pretty normal and I don’t have hard feelings per se. I feel a little used but I did something similar with a girl a couple of weeks back so who am I to judge. It just feels so weird that things felt so SO good on the third date (to me) and then she made it seem like she kinda could tell that it wasn’t going to work. Im normally so confident with women but it’s really shaken me up. I’m worried I’m going to be super suspicious or insecure with future women. And I still keep thinking about her, mainly because she just really is as good as I could possibly find and she slipped away. I’ve waited so long for someone like this and in the end I wasn’t worthy of the caliber of woman. It sucks.

I (31F) had a bad first relationship like a decade ago, and since then every time I try to seriously talk about dating, I start crying. 

Now, in my head, I know the one guy was just one guy, and as I've gotten older I've only gotten stronger with respect to basically every aspect of my life. I'm good with people, and I'm financially stable and close with my family and friends. It's like I have some kind of knee jerk physical reaction to the idea of dating, though. 

In spite of this, I HAVE gone on dates, but most of the time I have to pretend to not actually be dating the person, and it goes great all the way till the guy wants to do anything that couldn't be construed in my mind as strictly platonic. Then it's tears, even though I know intellectually that everything is fine and dandy, and I get increasingly anxious until I break things off, which is always much to my physical relief/mental chagrin. 

Settling down with someone seems like it could be great.

Until now, we have met up 5 times, the last time being on the 23rd where she invited me to her birthday party at her house with her uni friends where we cuddled, held hands and kissed (not make out).

However, she had an ACL surgery on the 15th Dec, and basically she's been recovering since, on crutches/can't go anywhere far, and resting at home. Since surgery, our texting has been minimal, basically once per 2 days. She barely instigates text (whereas before surgery she often did), so I instigate every time just asking how shes holding up and her responses have been short so I always quickly end it to give her space to recover (Although, she said sorry for not texting me that much when we were cuddling on her bday).

After the party I messaged her that night, saying thanks for inviting me and she replied ""thanks for coming and for the birthday card xoxo"". I then asked ""you planning on resting at home for the coming weeks?"" she said ""yea I think its smart for me to rest"".

QUESTION: Should I wait until she recovers (mid-jan?) to then ask for a date then? Until then should I keep texting/calling at a minimal? (which is already the case now)

OR

say something like ""when are you free to meet up sometime soon?"" in the coming days. But since she's on crutches, we can't go far, so maybe her house? but She lives with her dad, and she told me shes never brought a guy back to her house, and it's probably too soon to interact with her dad at this stage.

SO

we probably can't meet up until she recovers, and I probably shouldn't text her or call her more to interact with her (every YouTube dating video warns about phone is for setting dates not getting to know someone/ overtexting = needy behaviour/will turn her off).

So what should I do now? Literally back off/minimal texting until mid jan to ask her to meet up? Surely if I stop initiative contact she will think im playing games?

When she gets there I come down to let her in since she doesn’t have a key card. I immediately noticed that she looked like she had put on a bit of weight like 40-50 pounds. She had on layers so I kinda gave her the benefit of doubt as we were walking back to my apartment. But once we got back and she started taking off her jacket and shirt. I pointed out that she didn’t really resemble the woman in the pictures. She looked slightly offended and said she had put on some weight from college and then some more from the pandemic but truth be told I was pretty turned off and annoyed that she deceived me in a way. She wasn’t ugly face wise but for a short hookup I just wasn’t turned on by her body in her current state. So basically I said sorry no I’ll walk you back to the lobby. It was radio silence the whole time and I know it was an embarrassing situation so I tried to be as respectful as possible but I could tell she wasn’t happy.

It became too much, I left, and for a while I enjoy casual dating/sex.

Eventually I met this girl via Tinder. She was beautiful, to the point people would be taken aback, but in an unusual way. She was intense, passionate, affectionate, opinionated and smart but also somehow mysterious.

The first months together were like a Lana Del Rey video. She made me feel like the hero that had whisked her off her feet, and to me she was this beautiful and precious but brooding heroine with some kind of inner pain.

Eventually she told me that she had had extensive mental health problems throughout her life and was still seeing a psychiatrist. At the time I thought nothing of it as she was so functional and seemed so happy and well adjusted.

Over time I noticed that many of the hobbies she claimed to enjoy or interests we seemed to share, she actually had to knowledge of or interest in. Her compliments became subtly backhanded. She started to become paranoid about me cheating on her. I noticed her staring at me blankly when she thought I wasn't look, for long periods of time. Most of all I developed this intense feeling that wasn't feeling connected to her or tuned into her wavelength or something, I felt like the person I was seeing was a projection.

I struggled really badly with these feelings and it showed. I started to neglect her and withdraw from her instead of talking to her about it. I blamed myself for having commitment issues. Eventually I broke up with her. We got back together a few weeks later but she wasn't really interested in talking about why, she just told me not to do it again, that conversation led to the final breakup.

Since then I have been unable to form a romantic attachment to anyone. I can see they are great potential partners but I can't let go and just commit to them. I am chasing the feeling I had with my ex when we first got together. Everything else feels muted. All I can manage is brief flings or casual sex and then I drift away from people.

I have tried:

* Therapy
* Meeting new people
* New hobbies
* Taking breaks from dating
* Talking about this with friends and family
* Meditation
* Psychedelics
* I even moved country for 3-4 months just to try and turn the page on this chapter

It's not that I want to be with her, it seems clear to me that she had a personality disorder and that things would never have worked, but my time with her haunts me. It was like a dream of the relationship I had always wanted, only I became suddenly lucid, realised it wasn't real and suddenly woke up. I go back and forth in thought loops about whether it was all in my head or she really was as unusual as I remember.

We are no contact but I am sure she doesn't think about me at all, but here I am over a year and a half later and I must have discarded 10+ girls who wanted to continue seeing me because I just feel nothing for anyone since then.

Now for the reason for the post and granted I may be wrong, it seems as though she may already with be with someone else. I’ve come to this conclusion from posts in the last day or so and comments such as ‘wow, I don’t know how I got so lucky x’ again I acknowledge I may be wrong, on a lot of things in this post.

I’m not going to lie, I did get a little boost thinking about things progressing but now I’m just thinking I’ll leave her alone again and just forget about it.

I always state clearly that i would love to get in a relationship but im pretty carefull about going into one. My thoughts being that im pretty carefull about it since i get emotionally attached fast. 
Last weekend i had a date with a girl i matched with that monday. She was late since she got news that her uncle died pretty much out of nowhere which is how the date started. We went to a small bar for a few hours, had great conversations, laughed and decided to go to her place. We smoked a joint, had some drinks, ate sushi and after some hugging we kissed. It felt amazing, i thought that there was something real a connection i did not felt so far this fast before. 
It quickly escalated into sex. i felt like i was not performing well, since i get nervous really fast and i think i mastrubated too much beforehand. Therefore my weener got not as hard as usual. (Its also been a 5 years since i had my last gf and only one time sex in between) after a 30 min it kind of stopped. I felt the lust from her until penetration after that the touching and such became less. I dont know how to feel about this. Nobody came but we cuddled really nice after and she fell asleep on my chest while i was watching the Witcher season 2. 
After a while we said goodbye while kissing and off i went. I texted her: i want too see you again and she was thinking the same

We had great conversations before but she has a 40 hour work week and is pretty busy. I tried to keep the conversation alive by texting her about my day but she hardly writes back. 
I recieved a voice messege with her explaining why she usually doesnt reply (we havent really talked since 3 days). I feel like im loosing her and honestly if this continues im getting pretty done with the situation. Its bringing me too much insecurity. I want too wait since she is dealing with somebody that died but since its christmas vacation i want to see her soon since we both have time.

We both agreed to meet at x place at x time. Infact, we both made it very clearly and agreed upon the date and time. I showed up a few minutes late because I couldn't find parking, and messaged her saying that I had just arrived. I took a second to look around to find her. I didn't recognize her as anybody there. I saw a bunch of old townies, old faces that had probably been going to that same location for years. In fact the bar tender greeted an older gentlemen sitting next to me by his first name. I decided to sit down and order a beer. The bar she had recommended didn't have a drink menu. Off the top of my head I thought of a popular beer that I might somewhat enjoy, as the bar almost certainly didn't carry anything I liked if it did not have a drink menu. I ordered a heiniken, with regret. 

Fast forward 15 minutes, she still hasn't messaged me back. This is where I was giving her the benefit of the doubt. 15 minutes is not alot of time. But I was still sitting there twirling my thumbs. I had gotten worried that maybe something unexpected had happened to her? After 30 minutes I asked for the tab so I could leave. 30 Minutes with no contact is where I drew the line. This place didn't accept credit card so I ended up using the ATM to withdraw money and paid the extra fee. I walked down the street to order a few slices of pizza before I decided to head home and study. Before I left the bar I messaged her, ""Didn't hear from you so I decided to leave and go home and study."" To which she still has not replied. 

Looking back in hindsight I probably should have expected this. I think the reason is because she had decided to move the location closer to her house, when I offered a location to meet. Normally, this wouldn't be a red flag to me, but when she recommended that it be closer to her house, she didn't know any bars in the area. I had to research them, call them, ask what time they closed, and make the plans. Which struck me as odd, considering the bars were literally in her town, and I had to do all the heavy lifting. It was quite inconvenient for me, as I had to drive 20 minutes there. Overall, it wasn't a fun night and I have learned that I should schedule dates closer to me, and probably confirm whether my date will show up or not in case something like this happens again. She certainly will not be getting another chance from me.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1140321,public,self,Stood Up Last Night,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rnuv9r/stood_up_last_night/,no_ads,0.0,

Alright buckle in this is a long one - 

So I (22f) began talking to this guy (23) a little over a month ago, our conversations were great and we texted everyday. I gave him my number the first day after we began talking it was such a good conversation. Well finally after 2 weeks he asked me out for 2 weeks in advance. We went to dinner had a really great time and he said we should do it again soon and he’d text me tomorrow well, he never did so I texted him. And our conversations continued going well so I asked him on a short notice second date, he said he was kinda busy but he’d make it work basically, the date started off rocky because the place we were going had too long of a line and then the place we headed instead closed by the time we go there so he invited me back to his place and basically we cuddle and had great conversations for several hours, I expected him to make a move but he never did or maybe I missed a signal, I’ll never know, but then he said I’ll text you tomorrow at the end of the date again, and he never did so I texted him and we had a short conversation because it was late and went to bed. But now I’m confused because he responded happily to my texts. And he has yet to text me today. Maybe he’s busy and forgets? Maybe he just doesn’t know what to say to turn me down? Or maybe it’s just the holidays? I’m just a bit stuck on how to proceed. Any advice?
