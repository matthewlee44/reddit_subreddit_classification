Lived probably the most boring lifestyle you can imagine for the first 20 or so years of my life, also had a not good dressing style my friends helped me with, now I’m trying for the first time in my life to talk to girls and it hasn’t gone great. Gotten a few numbers but they all either never text back, lead me on, or, in one case, invite their friend on our (my first) date. 

Just tired of seeing it come so easily for other guys, when I see an attractive girl talking to/flirting with someone else I don’t even get mad anymore, I’m just sad that I’ve let my life come to this point, paid for a fucking nose job I work out and do all this shit to try and make myself more appealing to women but i can’t even get a glance from one. 

What do I do because I told myself I would make something happen by end of summer and now that’s looking doubtful before I know it I’ll be 23, the same lonely loser and it will only get weirder the older I get.

However, over the last few years my social life has faded away while I tried to build my life up professionally with school and (at times multiple) jobs. Also, the couple friends that I had during school or from previous jobs have moved away or gotten busy with their own lives just like I have.


Long story short I don’t really have “a life” lol. I wake up, go to work, go straight to the gym, go home, eat, maybe game for an hour and sleep to do it all again tomorrow. On the weekends I run a few errands, but that’s basically it lol. 


Do you guys have any tips? Any hobbies I can pick up or maybe habits I can change? I’m pretty introverted so I don’t need to make 100 friends...just some ways to make a few connections! I’m not super unhappy or anything but I lurk here enough to know my lack of a social life would come across as unattractive, and I think it would be healthy for me to meet more people anyway.

12,nvkvu6,1623205098,I (36f) went to Hawaii with a man I met on Tinder after only 5 dates,"So I met a recently separated 42 year old doctor on tinder in March.  We would see each other about once a week and he had a planned trip to Hawaii with his mom.  36 hours prior to take-off, his mom got shingles and had to cancel so he invited me instead.  He paid $3500 for my first class ticket and we stayed at a luxury resort for 8 days.  I am still reeling from my good luck here.  Not only was the trip to Hawaii awesome, we got along great the entire time, we are now exclusive.  


Besides the trip to Hawaii, things are going pretty slow.  We see each other once a week (our kid schedules conflict) and text every day or two.  Everything is very sweet and great in person.


One odd thing I’ve been analyzing is, there was a chapel at the resort and he said “let’s go exchange some vows!” And I shrugged him off and didn’t do it.  I was interested bc I am super attracted to him but I didn’t know how to reply.  The day we are leaving, walking past the chapel, he says it again and we stop and he says he promises to be honest with me and nice to me and not to see other people, along with some other sweet stuff.  I return the sweet comments.  Pretty soon after he said, “that’s as close as I’ll get to getting married again” and I didn’t really reply that much but he said something again later and I said I thought I would get married again one day and he agreed he may just be jaded right now due to divorce.

13,nvkyuv,1623205373,(24F) I don’t know what to title this but it’s kind of long and I feel stupid. Got heartbroken after having sex then being dumped.,"TL;DR- I’m a first time dater and got invested in one guy in a short period of time, slept with him, he left and I’m sad about it but also feel incredibly stupid because I think I may have come off as desperate.

To preface my situation, up until this point I had never “dated” in the sense that I never tried meeting strangers and pursuing a relationship. I’ve only ever had boyfriends that I knew well prior to becoming a couple, so this has been a learning experience that I’m already not proud of.

I went on a few dates and talked to a lot of guys, but I developed strong feelings for one person (29M). He was sweet, affectionate, attractive, and I found him interesting super since I had never dated someone like him. I wanted to get to know him and thought that we were both looking for something serious…we met on Hinge and I guess I assumed that everyone would be looking for something serious unless they said otherwise. 

We went on several dates and I totally fell for him. Way too fast- which I recognized early on. I’m a very emotional and sensitive person, so it doesn’t take very long for me to become at least somewhat attached to people. I also definitely have some abandonment daddy-issues which isn’t his fault, but made everything worse when obviously it didn’t work out.

I was just so excited. I, very stupidly, would dream about what our future COULD be like if we ended up on dating. We share a lot of interests and since my love language is quality time, I was super excited about all of it. Which I knew was dangerous but it’s really hard to not think too far ahead when you really like someone.

In hindsight, I was probably looking at things with rose-colored glasses though. Every date he asked if I wanted to have sex and I agreed too soon (after a week and a half) but I trusted him. That night, I asked him why he deleted his hinge profile (I noticed a few days before) and if it was because he really liked me. He said that he was still feeling things out but thought I was really fun and didn’t see the point in seeing multiple people. We both agreed it was WAY too soon for a label, but I thought this was at least a baby step and a mutual decision to at least be exclusive. I then told the other guys I was talking to that I just wanted to focus on one person at a time. I was convinced that in a few of months maybe we would become an official couple.

After having sex, I barely heard from him. I even noticed right afterwards that he was somewhat cold, but after asking if everything was okay, he assured me it was all goodS He was noticeably distant but I’m not the clingy type so I wasn’t overly concerned; I just thought he was busy or needed space. He even gave me a sweater to wear home and said “Don’t worry, we’ll hang out again. If I give you this it means you have to come back.” After 3 days, he texted me and told me that when I stayed over he turned over to cuddle and he half-asleep thought I was his ex, and that it sent him through a spiral. He said it wasn’t anything I did but that he wasn’t ready for a relationship. I was a bit surprised because when we briefly talked about exes, he insisted (I didn’t ask) that he didn’t have any “hang-ups.” 

We texted a little more and I told him that I hope he feels better, and that I really like him so I’ll still be around if he wants to try again. I also thanked him for his honesty and not ghosting me, which is way easier.

I did, however, have a moment of weakness and texted him a few days later saying that I didn’t want to bother him, but that I really liked him and would be willing to at least try to keep spending time together if he was comfortable with it- I explained that my past relationships were really painful for me and that I’m still working through things, but that maybe we could heal together? I also emphasized that I realize it was weird for me to even send that text, but that I wanted to take the risk. I acknowledged that I got my heart wrapped up too fast which isn’t at all his fault either. This feels like an example of actual stupidity and desperation.

After a couple of days, I noticed he was still looking at my Snapchat stories, but then unfriended me :( that’s when I think I snapped out of it and realized that I’m an IDIOT and he probably didn’t want anything serious to begin with. Or maybe he did and he actually did realize he’s not ready? Maybe I managed to scare him away after sending that last text. I’m not sure but either way, lesson learned.

If you read all of that, thank you. I’ve been really struggling with this the past week and am worried that I somehow ruined everything.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nvkyuv/24f_i_dont_know_what_to_title_this_but_its_kind/

39,nvoh70,1623217803,How does onlyfans typically fit in to people's lives for those who are in relationships now a days? (bit of a confused rant included)," 

Call me old school, but I think it's pretty wild that GFs have only fans accounts, and are posting nude pics, taking special requests, and sexting guys - or doing only some of that.

Making money is obviously hard and a necessity to keep breathing on an ongoing basis, so I completely understand that part of it.

From what I read about this, either the onlyfan content provider's partner is ok with it or not, that's one part of it. Then there are some who hide that they make content on onlyfans. Furthermore there are others that are not ok with showing their partner what happens on their onlyfans.

Then I've read some posts where girls are upset that their boyfriend has an onlyfans account and is subscribed to someone (not sure if you can sometimes see some content for free, or if you always have to pay for anything you look at).

In the above scenario, is it the case that the guy is paying money to someone else / looking at specific people porn that is the issue?

And to follow up on that, is it the case that it's more ok when the girl has an onlyfans account because she's not purchasing anyone else's photos/vids, and she making money from doing this as a job? Even though she can also be taking requests and sexting guys or however special requests work?

And yes anyone can do whatever they want, it's their life, their body, their choice. Which kind of has me questioning why I even care about it at all. I think I don't that much, but I do want to understand it a bit more from an emotional aspect of how other people see things - maybe fill in the blanks for what I'm missing in my head.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nvoh70/how_does_onlyfans_typically_fit_in_to_peoples/
40,nvomye,1623218418,Realizing emotions is NOT enough,"“I can’t like you because you won’t like me back,” were my exact words. The night was a blur but those those words ring in my ear. 
That’s what I told my friend because I realized that I was slowly catching feelings (I didn’t have a crush or like him, idk what it was but it was definitely something). But I knew that he wouldn’t like me because he is international and is only interested in people from his home country. 
It’s stupid for me to even have any thoughts or feelings, but you know we always want what we can’t have and I thought... I  thought maybe we could. But I knew we couldn’t b/c he’s super logical and wants a secure/safe future with few problems.
But I had to lowkey let him know how i felt by saying “I can’t like you because you won’t like me back.” Idk if he interpreted the way I wanted him to and idk how people would perceive it, please tell me how you would interpret that if someone told you that.
When I said that I wanted him to subtly know that I had feelings for him but am suppressing them because we would never work out. That I would pursue him, but won’t b/c he won’t. That I would try to make us work despite the struggle if he liked me.
He responded with “ but you understand why, right ?” Meaning he doesn’t like me. 

This experience just made me realize liking someone in a relationship is not enough.

46,nvpfuw,1623221667,She approaches me irl to say how I’m doing but never initiates anything on text,"I met this girl through work and I instantly felt an attraction. I’m a relatively good looking guy and get a lot of attention from girls in general, but she stood out instantly being more intelligent and quietly confident and shy.

The thing is her first impressions of me are that I’m very confident and social, I’ve just been trying my best to come across well around her. In actuality I’m also a bit shy and have very little relationship experience.

I have two main worries, because we are colleagues and she is new, it’s hard to grasp whether she is just trying to be nice and fit in because she wants to do well at work. If that’s so I *really* don’t want to make her feel uncomfortable.

The other, is she even interested to begin with? It’s funny I’m usually really good at reading people but with her it’s really hard. I will catch her staring at me from across the room throughout the day, she will come up to me out of the blue and ask how I’m doing. But then when I pass her and smile she won’t make eye contact.

Then over text I complimented her, not in a sexualised way but a genuine one in a jokey way so that it could easily be shrugged off if it wasn’t appreciated by her and she replies “aha.. um 🤔”. Then after work we were having drinks and I asked if she was going, instead of answering she asked if I was going enthusiastically. I said I’ll go if you go and laughed, she just looked away sort of panicked. So instead I had to told everyone I didn’t feel well and dipped as I felt I was making her uncomfortable and didn’t want to ruin her first social with the team.

I’ve decided to just give her space and not contact her at all for a week or two. I dunno what to do, I really like her, I just don’t want to come across too forward, which is what as guys we’re told to do, be confident and take the initiative but every girl is different and maybe she is struggling from previous relationships or doesn’t want one.

48,nvpn8f,1623222498,Do you *have to* use online dating?,"I (23M) think my dislike of OLD goes beyond the norm. I have a bit of a weird background, where I was raised in a family that was kind of conservative and religious, and then discovered that my actual values lean pretty progressive. This means that one of the few areas that has some actual overlap is around dating, and I think it's left me kind of out of touch with how people actually do dating: Treat women with respect, don't be a creep, etc. While I may have some weird hangups about it, those are genuinely important values to me.

They seem fundamentally incompatible with OLD. Like OLD is inherently objectifying, it inherently trivializes human relationships, but yet it somehow seems more socially acceptable than any of the other options. (I don't think I'm even particularly unlucky with OLD, I think I get a fair amount of matches. I just hate how it makes me view others.)

-It's bad to ask people out if they're working. This is absolutely, 100% true. Hell, I've been asked out at work back when I worked retail, and it was one of the most intensely awkward things of my life. Plus, there's an inherent power dynamic at play here.

-It's bad to ask out coworkers. Again, true. There's maybe a little more leeway on this, but even if it isn't against your workplace's rules, it's a bad look. There's so many potential power dynamics, opportunities to make people feel deeply uncomfortable without realizing it, and in general the same stuff as in the last point.

-The whole concept of 'missed connections' seems creepy as hell to me. Like if you see someone cute in Wal-Mart or a bar (although tbf, I don't really drink) or whatever, the idea that you'd go and be like 'Hi I know nothing about you, but you look cute can I have your number?' just seems weird.

-I'm at an age where while I'm going back to school 
to finish up my degree in the fall, most people my age aren't. Like it just feels like a really uncomfortable, fraught situation.

-Sure, there's all sorts of social connections outside of that... But are there? I mean maybe this whole post boils down to ""it's hard to meet people in 2021"", and fair enough I suppose, but having just moved to a new state mid-pandemic where I don't really have any connections, it's crazy how people's advice for meeting new people is 'Download a dating app'.

Is this just a problem in my head?

So the last two women I talked to on dating apps who showed even the slightest ounce of interest in me were scam bots or men pretending to be women. I hate to be learning the lesson that if a woman were to actually show interest in me, then I need to question their entire existence. But I feel gaslit and slightly traumatized.

The worst part is this: my last irl girlfriend had borderline personality disorder. She said what she needed to say to get what she wanted out of me. Like a goddamn emotional scam bot. I don't know and can't know if anything she ever said or was was real, like ""I love you"".

I am a real person with real emotions, trying to deeply connect with another real person feeling the same way. I don't know who is or isn't real. Are you real? Am I real??

I am not an unattractive guy. I am full of love, mindfulness, wisdom, genuine care, compassion, humor, emotional intelligence. I don't know if these things matter. I don't know what does.

I know that the only way I can feasably meet women is on dating apps. I also know that dating apps, like fucking Tinder, are built on the goal that nobody actually gets what they deeply want or need out of the app. If they did, Tinder wouldn't be able to make money off our desperation to pay to see who likes us or otherwise thinks we're hot.

I am not mad at women or any one woman, I am mad at this viscious dynamic we are being duped into. We are being trained. Our need for love and attention is being exploited for money, and in the process we are being conditioned to swipe endlessly and connect with no one. Our faith that we can actually connect with anyone diminishes, and therefore we continue to put less actual effort in because we've failed so many times. *This cycle is training us to devalue each other, to guard our emotional energy, and thereby make it even harder to connect with another*. In our hopelessness, we give up on our deeper needs and linger in the shallow buzz of seeing someone like us, matching but never talking, just looking at pretty people, and the illusion that we are making some kind of choice when we swipe left or right. 

Scam bots are able to take advantage of this system so easily because apps like Tinder and OKC are *literally* set up for this  same reason: to exploit your need for love and validation for money. The context is set with the hopeless void of uninterested and disillusioned women that Tinder creates, and then when a spam bot actually matches with you, let alone *messages* you, you feel eager and vulnerable enough to fall for a scam. This is exactly the same tactic Tinder is using with their ""pay to see who likes you"" scam, but in a less obviously malicious way.

It shouldn't be like this, and doesn't have to be. Dating apps are the only way a lot of us can meet other people, and they progressively take away features and our ability to meet others while training us to feel hopeless and ambivalent to one another. We let this happen because we have no other options. 

Stop coming up with witty bios or one liners to cut through the noise and fight for someone's attention. Stop listing your interests and personality traits as if that mattered in this game that is set up for you to fail. Go meta. Talk about how pissed off you are at Tinder or OKC for manipulating your need for love and altering your perception or even respect for the opposite (or same) sex. Wake the fuck up, start a riot.

We hit it off after I liked a post of his about a similar interest and he started messaging me to chat about it. Over the weeks, we really built a connection over our interests, one of those being our love for music and how similar our tastes are. We were non stop messaging throughout the day, everyday from first thing in the morning until late at night. Eventually, just under 2 weeks after chatting we shared how attracted we were to one another, and from there the sexting started. Let me tell you, I've never had a man make me feel so hot, turned on and desired before in my life!! I was shocked at the things I was saying and doing as a result of talking to him, but I loved it! We eventually started having dirty, late night video calls.

Now for some background, he separated from his wife about a year ago but they still live together for now due to covid and the fact they have a young daughter. ( This is known by those on his social media, it's not one of those scenarios where he's kidding and still with his wife). We tried to have 2 seperate date nights together, but we had to cancel both times (once each so equal fault) due to circumstances out with our control. We were really frustrated as we were desperate to spend time together.

I wasn't expecting to meet up with him as he was busy,  but he messaged me basically saying his ex had left for a bit and he wanted to take the opportunity to spend the afternoon with me. So, I diverted the taxi I was heading to the record store in to his house, where we met each other in person for the first time. We immediately had sex, where admittedly he got excited and came within a minute or so, but it was great to get rid of those frustrations that were building up. Afterwards, we left and headed to the store, where we spend some time picking out records together and then headed for a drink in the sun for an hour or two. It was a great afternoon!

I never heard from him the rest of the day (although he was exhausted). I then heard from him on Monday and he said he really enjoyed his time with me, it was great, despite how short it was and exchanged a handful of messages. Then, he messaged first thing in the morning yesterday, but again, a handful of messages and I never heard from him again that day after 3 in the afternoon. Not heard from him today. 


 I know it's been about 3 days now but his messages are now really few and far between and not at all like what it was previously and it's concerning me. He's still watching all my Facebook stories? Is it normal for guys to withdraw like this? If so, how long does it take for guys to come back after withdrawing? I'm so long out of the dating game I don't know if this is normal or if he's disgusted with me after meeting up in person lol. It's such a 180 from our previous interactions that it's really frustrating and concerning me!

Sorry for writing the equivalent of War and Peace there! Any help or advice on this is greatly appreciated. Thank you so much guys!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nvrau2/older_guy_42m_that_ive_26f_been_connecting_with/
63,nvrelm,1623229994,The Thing About Breakups,"The thing about breakups is that you've been so used of living in a world where both of you coexists. And so, there would be a lot of times, a lot of sudden moments where a thing, a place, or a simple hobby you used to do together would bring back the happy memories of the past. But with it comes the pain of the day you last held each other's hands; that day when you reached the end you never thought you would and finally had to let go of the hand you held for so long.

Perhaps, that's what makes it hard—to move on and continue living in a world you lived together. It hits you even harder once you realize you're living on that very same world but this time, alone.

But as the saying goes, if you truly loved someone, it will stay as it is. You continue to cheer for them, to be happy for them. Because true love isn't ephemeral. It isn't fleeting. It is constant. You just learn to love them from a distance; you just learn to live a life without them.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nvrelm/the_thing_about_breakups/

I'm at the point now where I've just had it with online dating, it's just not my strong suit. Doesn't matter which dating app I try. I'm not the most attractive physically but I just don't feel like I can show off my other personality traits well enough to let someone take a chance on me.

I've been trying to lose weight unsuccessfully so far but I'm trying to rebuild some good habits. In the mean time, how should I go about meeting women IRL? I know it's weird because covid isn't really over but I just feel like I'd have more control in a social situation than on a dating site.

I've heard yoga or dance classes are decent ways to meet women, but those activities don't really interest me and idk if it's really appropriate to use those venues as a dating pool.

65,nvrids,1623230443,"Dear Dating Coaches, stop giving false information about how ""Men can get Women with money, cars and status"". It's completely false. Let me elaborate that for you.","First of all it's really stupid to assume that a Man can get lot of Women with money. It's NOT possible, neither wholly true. Dating Coaches don't go deeper to the situation but talk a lot about ""how it's just money that makes Women go crazy"".

If a Man's listening to this, and his intentions are to get a Woman with his cars and money after listening to a Dating Coach, then he's actually been fooled.

The true animal nature and Emotionally speaking, a Man's Money has nothing got to interest a Woman. With Money surely you can buy a lot of expensive stuffs, cars, houses, jewelry, properties, phones etc etc. 

Money can ONLY, give you a Financial Security in a relationship, like when you have a marriage or a child later on, (it's just to sustain and maintain the relationship/ marriage for a long term).

I hate it how, Men comment on YT videos saying ""Women ONLY love money, or get impressed by Supercars etc etc"".

Or how ""If you're a Celebrity and you're famous, Women would flock around you"". They fucking don't know how many negative Women would exploit these things in a negative way.

A lot of Bad Women date a Rich Dude or a Celebrity to get clout and fame and then when she's got the attention and fame, she's just willing to walk away and make a life Outta it.
 
""Just because you're a Famous Personality or a Celebrity, that doesn't mean it's proportional for a Man to get a lots of Women"".

In reality, your Partner should be proud of you naturally, for a Good Person you are, for how kind and dedicated you are. But if y'all guys think that earning money and making money and getting filthy rich or being a billionaire would get you lots of Women, then you're absolutely wrong.

You're gonna get Tons of GOLDDIGGERS, who are just going to date you for your money, a Golddigger ""just wants a Financially Stable Man, so that she can just live her life peacefully without ANY problems economically"".

Technically there's NO True Love when you're into marrying/ dating a Golddigger. Dating coaches betatize you into making you think that, Money is all what Women care. But they fucking don't know the priorities of Money according to Women.

For a True Woman, your Lover would have: 

1. Looks+ Personality
2. Loyalty+ Loving and Caring Nature.
3. Burning desire to stay with you(this comes with how you've been together).
4. Money, House, Bank, Cars etc etc.

You can see that the 4th priority is money for a True Woman.

For a Golddigger:
1. Money+ Status+ Financial Stability etc etc.

You can see, she always cares about the guys' money, property etc etc.

It's so sad to see how some Men, almost don't date in their 20's because they've sacrificed their lives for a better career in the end, get married to some Golddigger without even knowing her true intentions. A Golddigger NEVER can Love a Rich Man truly, she justs pretends to love him, instead uses him for her financial needs, stability and to buy expensive clothing, jewelery etc etc.

It's usually these 38+ years fat dudes with heavy and deep pockets approaching a Hot Chick in her 20's to wife her,  they're Directly ""Buying her beauty with their money"". 

These Beta Males are the problems on why other younger Men become fools and follow the same trend. It's really sad how it's happening in every country and Men are really willing to date a Golddigger.


Solution For This:

1. Fucking unfollow those idiotic dating coaches who tell you this fucking bullshit. More you listen to them the more you'll become a Beta Male willing to swipe your card for a Golddigger.

2. You don't have to be a Singer, Actor, Model, Celebrity, VIP to get a lot of Women. Women in their Youth fall in love with dudes who weren't like this, they necessarily didn't have fame. 

Yet they were good men and honest with Women and they were fairly Attractive and Decent Looking and had Good Personalities and Women were interested in them.

3. Looks matter a Lot, the main bullshit that Dating Coaches say is that ""A Dude who's like a 4/10, Fat, Obese, Bad Hair can get a Hot 9/10 Busty, Slim, Sexy Woman if he's Rich and Has a Big House. 

But, in reality if a 4/10 dude is getting a 9/10 Woman, there's almost 80-90% of chances if she marries him, it's definitely for his Money, NOT for who he is.

4. Any Woman can be a Golddigger, it's NOT confined to pretty women, but usually the frequency of Pretty Women being a Golddigger is a lot because Beta Males, Weak Men ONLY approach Pretty Women when they become Insanely Rich.

5. You SHOULDN'T be attracting a Woman using your money or your big cars, surely a photo of your supercar might look good, but moreover it's how you are is what matters(Looks + Personality) to Women.

6. Don't get married to a Woman(when you're Rich) just after a few months of dating, wait for almost 2-3 years with a Live In Relationship. To get to know her properly and then decide.

7. Start Dating Women who actually have a Job, earns money, has an education and makes fairly enough Money and can actually "" live a life without your money "". 

8. STOP spending a lot of money on Women, thinking that, an expensive gift or an expensive trip or a jewelry can turn her on or make her fall for you then it's really wrong because "" Women don't care about your efforts, they ONLY care about how you made them feel"".

A Woman who really loves you and likes you, would be happy enough to eat at a Decent Restaurant with a Good Meal, you necessarily needn't spend 1000's of Dollars on her for a Single Date, if she doesn't/ didn't like the date, she surely won't be obliged to go out with you for another date.

An Expensive expenditure on Women ≠ To Make her fall for you emotionally/ romantically. 

9. A Prenup is a must, doesn't matter you're NOT going to lose half of your money on an unsuccessful Marriage, and moreover Men aren't born to be a Woman's bill payer. 

This generation has fucked it up so badly, such that dating/ marriage has become highly expensive for a Man.


Conclusion: I hope I haven't been harsh to people over here, but I just can't hold myself to see Men getting turned into Beta Males by all these false sayings from these Dating Coaches and other people.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nvrids/dear_dating_coaches_stop_giving_false_information/

70,nvsw8u,1623235883,"Hypothetically, why should I risk losing connections with people I care about if I can risk it on people I don't?","So I've been thinking. 

A lot of the time, I may try to get to know someone better, ruin my chances, notice my mistakes, write them down and make sure not to repeat them. Examples:

1. Don't text if they don't respond, they have a life - I learned by texting and not realizing people have a lot more to do than text a random match. Also by now having a much busier life, etc. Lost a few matches this way.

2. Move on as quickly as possible, you never know what negative feeling is about to catch up to you.

3. Realize women are at higher risk than men in this specific scenario.

4. Don't approach from behind, etc...

This made me realize I have a problem. This ""method"" makes sure that I'm better of experimenting on people I don't care about that much to prepare myself for people I actually care for, which would make me a psychopath/sociopath(whichever fits), but utility wise, this is the best possible method if I wish to reduce the risk of not making a connection with someone I actually want to.

What is the ethical choice here? Who do I choose to risk with my terrible social skills? I can't be intersted in everyone, why should I hurt my chances by making mistakes on the people that matter to me?

I never did the above, however, I DID lose people by making mistakes and learning from them, but people never assume you learned, so they're lost forever. So why should I risk it?

What's the point of learning from your mistakes if the lesson I learned can't even be proved on the person that I'll never meet again? What if the lesson is not entirely correct?

Just imagine me sitting in a room full of blueprints about hypothetical social scenarios, me making a few new notes after experiments, failing, tearing a few blueprints off and then putting on new ones, that's pretty much how I feel about life, and one day it might all burn by a single lit match forcing me up onto the rooftop of a burning building.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nvsw8u/hypothetically_why_should_i_risk_losing/

72,nvt1qj,1623236451,I have a feeling this might be the end for us…,"I’ve been seeing the most wonderful man I’ve ever met for a few months now. He’s committed to self improvement, smart, kind, compassionate, communicative, all of the things I’ve wanted in a partner. 

He made it clear at the beginning that he wouldn’t have a lot of time for me, he’s in the middle of the most intense portion of his career and he can’t focus on anything else. He feels incredibly guilty about it, but his passion for his career is one of the things that makes him so attractive. 

Last night I dropped a gift off at his house. It was a food supplement that I really wanted him to try. I knew he didn’t have time to see me, and that he’d feel guilted into seeing me if he knew I was there, so I dropped it on his porch with a note and left. 

He texted me saying that I was too kind and he doesn’t deserve me. I told him that was not true but I hated meeting him at such a stressful time and not knowing the best ways to care for him, but that I was going to bed right now (so he didn’t feel like he had to continue the conversation). 

I woke up this morning to some confusing texts. He says the gift got him thinking and he wants to grab coffee. He says he’s not used to receiving such kindness and it’s really messing with his head. That he likes me as a person. And then he sent like five thank yous. But also said that it made him want to scream. 

He hasn’t gotten back to me this morning. I feel like I did something bad. I feel like coffee is a break up date.

73,nvtbmz,1623237433,How do I tell a potential partner to not be desperate?,"tldr: met someone interesting online, hit off really well but he started to show signs that seem like he is just desperate and lonely

I met this guy through a dating app and we hit off really well with our common interests. I was on the app for fun, if I actually met someone interesting and my type then I'll just go with the flow. At first, I was interested in him as I thought that physically, he was kinda cute. In terms of personality, he seemed quite funny and nice to talk to as well. So far, we have only interacted for a month.

However, I realised that he was being a little...desperate. He would tell me about how he and his ex broke up (as we were talking about our ideal type) and he would also tell me about his family (heck, even the terrible plight his family used to be in) and his family background. He started to use pick-up lines on me rather often, complimenting me whenever I change my profile picture. At first, I was flattered but now, I felt abit uncomfortable as he seemed to overshare but he said he wanted to as I seemed ""cool"" to him. He would start to text me everyday, always initiating the conversation which I appreciate but as someone who rarely receives so many texts that often (I have very few friends), it kinda became too overwhelming for me. Now that Im swamped with work and lack of motivation, I cant seem to bring myself to reply on time. 

Furthermore, he would often text me names like ""babe"" or ""cutes"" and tbh, I felt uncomfortable. Firstly, we hadnt met irl, and he already said he liked my personality and all that. Secondly, it gives me sketchy vibes like as if he is just being desperate and lonely instead of actually liking me for me since we have only interacted for a month. To support my second point, he once told me it's fine to text alot to him as he rarely receives text and that his phone is kinda dry. He would always text me what he's doing everyday, share posts with me (which I appreciate) but I really don't know how to deal with this as someone who has not received such attention before. 

I would like to add on that based on my past exp, I had a guy who told me all about his past rather early as well, how he got bullied and shit and he ended up ghosting me after we met (turns out he was just tryna play the pity card). I had also met a few guys who always complimented me alot and try to be smooth with their pick-up lines but they give up after a few times of trying, which makes me not impressed with pick-up lines as I felt they were being insincere. So basically, this guy here is a mix of both types of guys I've met before and thus, with my trust issues, I really doubt that he likes me and that he's just being desperate and lonely. He downloaded games for me, sometimes copy phrases that I say, change his profile picture when I change mine, says he wants to do things for me and just seems too much to me like as if he's coming on too strongly. 

 He's starting to seem less interesting to me as these happen and we only have two more weeks before we meet. I've told him I cant reply him that often these days and he said that's fine. When I apologised for replying him late after a day of break from phone, he told me ""oh I thought I was getting ghosted haha and that Im not interesting anymore"", when I was just joking around, he said ""oh no am I bad to talk to"" and just makes it awkward for me to reply. And if I dont text him for a day, he would text me asking ""how's your day"" and ""wyd"" and share with me what he's doing and this is just awkward for me as I've not received such texts before. 

Anyways, I've brooded over this issue for the past few days, not knowing how to bring it up to him. I like guys who are assertive, have their own way of thinking and he just seems to follow anything I say or do. I appreciate the efforts he put in but sometimes, his texts seem too much. We have called before to game together and it seemed okay I guess, but there was this one time I was really tired and tried to leave and he said ""I'm funny, right?"" and at that moment, I was like jesus christ man just let me sleep already.

I guess I'm just awkward with this type of interaction as I've not actually been in a relationship before and heck, is this what couples do? when they first meet through dating apps? Or is he just being desperate and lonely? Do I tell him how I feel and if so, how?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nvtbmz/how_do_i_tell_a_potential_partner_to_not_be/

I just don’t get why....he said we were good. I said it once, moved on and have begun dating other people.

Also, when the conversation is appropriate, I will happily share little tidbits and details about my dating life. 

Point is, why would he have done that? I’m doing all of the right things aren’t I?

87,nvwbdw,1623246352,Trying to meet a guy that lives almost 30 hours (Driving) away from me. Thoughts?,"Okay soooo, long story short. I met a guy online. We’ve texted, sent audio messages, FaceTimed. The whole shebang. Its only been a week or two (we’ve talked every day) and for some reason things have just progressed really quickly. We confide in each other when we’re going through something but we also have A LOT of fun and laughs together. I find myself thinking about him a lot, I’ve imagined us meeting in person and hugging each other, just little cute gestures and stuff. But I’m not super infatuated, I just feel super comfy when we talk. So no butterflies. To be honest, I could live without him. 🤣 But I don’t want to, because he’s literally the best, and who else am I supposed to talk to if it isn’t him??? I swear, he’s so rare, it’s like finding a needle in a haystack. Idk, my feelings are confusing me. 🤣

I guess I’m just wondering….is it weird that he’s willing to pay for my flight to his state? Is it weird that I want to take him up on the offer and get over there as soon as I can? I just want to meet him in person because I feel like it’ll help me decide if I just like him platonically or as more than a friend. You know? But if I were him I wouldn’t waste my money on a person who has no idea how they feel, you know? If I end up just wanting to be friends, then that means he lost around $500 bucks paying for my flight there and back and also got rejected as a romantic interest. Yikes! 😬 Then again, I really want things to work out. So I hope I don’t feel that way when we meet 🤞

Haha if he sees this he’ll definitely know it’s me, but I don’t think any of this information is new to him so I think we’re fine 🤣 I just need outside opinions that aren’t from anyone I know. Lol what do you think??? Am I insane???👁👄👁

88,nvwcke,1623246445,"Modern dating, casual and texting","I don't really apprehend to any texting or dating etiquette. But lately, I've been called dominant, weirdo, quiet or either chilled, open, friendly. In a casual context, if you ask a guy guy out, agreed to meet but haven't set date or time and they haven't reached out either or replied to your message, do you reach out to confirm or let it be? It seems I'm socially awkward and don't know how to properly socialize especially with guys. Some guys would leave me on read but I trusted the connection in person so I kept reaching out to schedule a meeting (never do small talk over text but would definitely double text and don't mind to initiate all conversations). Some people tell me I'm way too direct and my masculine energy turns off guys (for example, I was thinking for a date to invite a guy over to make cocktails and enjoy sunset more like a roof or garden party) or invite a guy to a gathering with friends (less common because they find it weird). I'm sociable yet find it hard to keep guys interested. I'm old school in terms of hobbies and interests, research, sociology, art, theatre but also partying hard and drinking heavily. I don't mind being alone but having a partner makes it more fun and I feel ready for it but won't comprise either, meaning i won't have a relationship unless I like the person 100%). I started reading some dating sites and watching videos, apparently I'm doing it all wrong: I try to initiate, lead, organize, conquer and don't lean back so guy comes to me. Those who approach me and actively pursue me are usually not my type and 90% of the time I won't be interested. Is it that hard to meet people these days? Sometimes I feel being high intelligent becomes a burden. I'd say or do something weird, then over analyze it in my head, draw conclusions and move on and the person would think something completely different but because my vibe is already cold and distant, they kind of withdraw. I'm really clueless about modern dating just hope that somewhere along the road I'll get lucky and come across someone who understands me and things go smoothly cause I've been exhausted putting myself out there and get no results.

89,nvwguy,1623246778,What are some signs that you are a 'placeholder' partner?,"Me and my boyfriend have been dating for nearly 6 months (30M 30F) and I've been realizing that while he is a very attentive and affectionate boyfriend in most ways, he hasn't openly expressed that he cares for me let alone loves me. He says things like ""you're my little -----"" or when i come out of the shower he pats my butt cheekily and says ""that's mine"". He does little things like bring over coffee and the other day cleaned up my backpacking gear without me asking. We cook a ton of meals together and he picked up running with me and is very supportive of helping me meet my fitness goals, even if it means he has to slow down his pace or be patient and wait for me. We have planted some herbs and veg to grow together on his patio and he recently paid to include my licence plate on his national park pass for me. He has called me his girlfriend on rare occasion, and we have established that we are in a relationship at this point, but I can tell that he's still adjusting to that label and it makes me feel worried that I'm a girl he likes enough to date, but not enough to love. He had a rather rocky relationship with his ex (2 yrs) that was defined by a lot of bipolar behaviour and he was only single for 4 months before meeting me. I expressed my seriousness about finding a partner, and he did too... and we are both on the same page about marriage and kids. He asked to exclusively date after a couple weeks, and I've met his parents, siblings and some of his friends. He spends a lot of time with ""the boys"" and I enjoy that he has those friendships, his ex hated his friends.

His personality is a little more introverted while being an overthinker, while I lean towards more extroverted behaviours and also being an overthinker. So whenever we build up the courage to address our personal needs with each other, it tends to come out flustered and awkward. He tends to express himself in few words, I tend to verbal vomit, but we are patient with each other. We rarely fight and are comfortable being goofy around each other.

Yet the fact he hasn't said he loves me at this point makes me worried he's still wounded from the past and that I might get my heart broken again. I don't know how to address this so that he doesn't feel pressured, or if i'm jumping the gun and expecting too much.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nvwguy/what_are_some_signs_that_you_are_a_placeholder/
90,nvwmqh,1623247220,Internalized racism,"I am mixed Asian living in a primarily white city, and mostly prefer Caucasian people or people of Western culture. 

One day I had an insightful conversation with a fellow Asian. We were talking about how our experiences in school have been and dealing with racism (lightly or heavily). This also has translated into our romantic preferences, mostly Caucasians or people of Western culture/mindset. 

This led to noticing why I had clear preference for ethnicities and cultures other than my own, perhaps out fear of being judged by others and my own parents.

I found out through a picture of them and she was wearing a ring (it was on her middle finger but it was probably because it was too big or whatever). 

I never had a chance with this guy. We went on a few dates a very long time ago and I struggled to get over him, and witness his “picture perfect” relationship that has been going on for 1.5 years. I tried to move on through my previous ex boyfriend (21M). But it wasn’t working out because I was just not in love with him (he also started to reveal his true colours). 

Like I said I never had a chance and there’s nothing I can do. But I am afraid this will affect my wellbeing. I struggle with depression and anxiety and this guy seems to be my main trigger for me. I broke up with my ex-boyfriend only a month ago. It’s too fresh for me to date other people.

Nice gowns, nice shots, nice landscapes, happy families, all the shenanigans. 

I didn’t like it, I know it is a personal choice, but I personally didn’t like it. Our relationship ended for completely different reasons, but this thing stayed with me quite a while. 

Right now I would not even begin to entertain a conversation with somebody that still holds those days so dear to be so comfortable to share them with their most intimate of friends and family.  

I have never been married, my exes exist only in the memory of my mind, I have that approach. Being cool with your ex is fine, but still sharing pictures of your failed marriage just for likes kinda comes off as a little bit creepy to me.

## Obstacles to finding love

Are you single and looking for  love? Are you finding it hard to meet the right person? When you’re  having trouble finding a love connection, it’s all too easy to become  discouraged or buy into the destructive myths out there about dating and  relationships.

Life as a single person offers many rewards, such  as being free to pursue your own hobbies and interests, learning how to  enjoy your own company, and appreciating the quiet moments of solitude.  However, if you’re ready to share your life with someone and want to  build a lasting, worthwhile relationship, life as a single person can  also seem frustrating.

For many of us, our emotional baggage can  make finding the right romantic partner a difficult journey. Perhaps you  grew up in a household where there was no role model of a solid,  healthy relationship and you doubt that such a thing even exists. Or  maybe your dating history consists only of brief flings and you don’t  know how to make a relationship last. You could be attracted to the  wrong type of person or keep making the same bad choices over and over,  due to an unresolved issue from your past. Or maybe you’re not putting  yourself in the best environments to meet the right person, or that when  you do, you don’t feel confident enough.

Whatever the case may  be, you can overcome your obstacles. Even if you’ve been burned  repeatedly or have a poor track record when it comes to dating, these  tips can help put you on the path to finding a healthy, loving  relationship that lasts.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nvxdel/dating_tips_for_finding_the_right_person/
