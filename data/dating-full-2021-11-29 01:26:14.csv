This is my first time posting on this subreddit, so apologies if something is off. Well, might as well get right into it.

I'm (M 18) in first year Uni, and there's this girl (F 18) who I'll remain unnamed also here as well. About a little over a month ago me and my ex of 6 months ended things, and at first I was pretty roughed up by it, but I was the one who ended things because the distance was putting strain on us both. It was my first physical genuine relationship, since I've only had 2 exes and my first one was long distance (never even met) and didn't even last 3 months. Around that time was also when I met the girl I mentioned earlier, who got introduced to our friend group. Things go on, and eventually things start developing between us. I was scared for a while that these were just rebound feelings, so I never acted on those emotions because I didn't want to do that to her. We hungout a lot 1 on 1, we've even slept over at each others places (usually by accident) a few times (purely just sleeping, no sex or anything frisky). Another thing I should mention is she is a very physical person, and cuddles with everyone in the group. Nothing sexual or anything, just what she does. Things were good. Some drama went down where this other guy in our group (M 18) had a crush on her. Told her and everything. She didn't know what to say, so she said nothing. But she still hangs out with him because she considers him a very close friend. I should also mention that she has never had her first kiss and is a virgin, and her only exes were very toxic relationships that she basically didn't want to happen.

At some point she went back home for a bit to visit family. The day she came back she invited me over (no one else) asking if I could help bring some stuff from her car to her room. I more than happily said yes. I do that, and we end up hanging out in her room. I'll cut out the filler and get straight to the meat. One thing led to another, and we made out. A lot. Then it moved on, Really, really fast. My hand at some point went up her shirt, she even took off her bra on her own accord. She didn't show me anything, but there was a lot of touching. While making out she grinded against me and we ended up basically fucking but with clothes on. Lots of dirty talk. Eventually things settled down. We said how it turns out we were both lying to each other (we frequently say that we hate each other as a joke), and how this night was unexpected but we were both happy it happened. It was getting late, and I had class the next day, so I had to leave.

Then things changed. It felt like nothing happened for a few days. When we met each other in person while in the group, it was kind of awkward. We planned to talk about it, but that didn't happen for about 5 days later. I started getting anxiety over the whole thing. I have social anxiety, but this kind was different and new and it scared me for a while because I didn't know how to cope besides just distancing myself from everyone. We eventually talked about it, and she said that she was just worried that I would be using her as a rebound without knowing it, as she knows I wouldn't do that to her intentionally. I agreed, and didn't know what to do. We both agreed that things moved a little fast that night. We talked for a bit about it but didn't really get anywhere because there was no real solid way to determine whether or not these feelings are rebound or genuine. I left eventually because it was getting late and she passed out by accident while laying down, phone still in hand. I shot her a text that basically said, long story short, ""I don't think I should be part of the decision making, I don't know where I'm at either. So take you're time, there's no rush, but I'll leave the decision up to you. Do what you're most comfortable with"". She says she will. Time passes.

It's been a week now. I tend to not go to the group hangouts due to getting anxiety whenever I see certain things. She takes longer to reply now and isn't as fruitful with her messages. She still hangs out with the guy with a crush on her, and every time I see that it spikes my anxiety and, as much as I hate to say it, makes me jealous. Sometimes I'll walk in on the group hangout and she's there with him, leaning her head on his shoulder, or other things she does, like cuddling, that is just her being her. But I can't help but feel so anxious about it. The night where we did all that stuff honestly just feels like a fever dream at this point. And I don't know what to do. Every day goes by so fast and ends in the same way: me leaving the hangouts early making some dumb excuse, and either going right back to my room or I go on a late night walk to ease my nerves. I only go to the hangout anymore because she is there, and it's basically the only time we see each other anymore. The other day I got drunk for the first time, didn't mean to, was just hanging with friends and one thing lead to another. The guy with a crush was there. She heard about my condition and came to help. Her and the guy brought me back to my room. He left me some meds, she left me a plushie, which I thought was sweet. They left together, but I was too shit faced to care. Next day, later in the night I go to bring the plushie back. We talk at the door for a while, and she invites me in. Guess who's just chillin on her bed? The guy. The cycle repeats.

Sorry for the long story. Don't really have anyone else to vent to. Can't vent to my friends in the group, they don't know about it and I don't want to start drama if they end up telling the guy. No one else knows about it to my knowledge. Just feels like I fumbled something that could have been great. I genuinely don't think these are rebound feelings. I should have been more responsible, I'm the one who has some sort of relationship experience, and yet I let things get out of hand really fast. Just don't know what to do at this point...

Our first date went so well that we ended up extending it beyond the initial two-hour booking and stayed out nearly all night. Since then, we've seen each other every weekend at least once, and started having sex on the third date and began sleeping over at each others' places for the next three weekends after that.

This past Saturday we went out for dinner and drinks and came back to mine and had sex again. I got a message from her the next morning that said something along the lines of ""I've been doing a lot of reflecting, and it's nothing you did but my feelings aren't where I think they should be, and I think I see us more as just friends, but we get along so well and have so much in common that I don't want to lose you from my life, but it's totally up to you."" I was a bit stunned as I thought everything was going well but I sent her a message that said I was really happy I got to meet her, and thanked her for the fun times over the past month, and that she was a great person and I'd like to be friends.

Thinking more about it, though, I'm not sure if that was the right move. She is a great person and we have a lot of fun together, but if we hang out again, will the sexual tension not be awkward? Do I even want to be just friends? I'm still not sure where my feelings lie - I was beginning to develop feelings for her so I'm not sure how to put those back in the box now that they're out there.

Has anyone been in a similar situation before? Do these things ever truly work out?

This isn't a friendzoned type deal. 

Basically, I met this woman on hinge. Ironically I downloaded the app and she showed up within distance. She was visiting family on Halloween. So I just happened to be at the right distance at the right time to even match with her. I didn't think she was going to reply. Saw her profile and thought instantly her inbox is full or why bother. But I did.

She replied and we spent 8 hours chatting. She replied actual paragraphs and books. We exchanged numbers, emails and social media. And we met up the next day. ( I picked her up from her families place ). We went and got coffee and went to the bookstore and spent like 3 hours in each. It was like we knew each other and just connected. But.... She actually lives out of state. She's moving here in the spring. ( Which isn't that long or a big deal. ). An she left home the next day.

She got home. And we kept in touch. She wrote me a huge email after the date. ( Too much to text ). Just saying how much she really enjoyed meeting. Told me how she could never seem to connect with anyone. And how it seems she's always on a different frequency. But it was the exact opposite with me and that's a first. We agree on everything, down to our goals, wants and needs. And that I match her perfectly. And that continued for like 10 more paragraphs. And we kept in touch. She introduced and told her friends about me. And I did the same. 

She had my attention, so I deleted my apps. Originally I planned on just keeping in touch and picking things up when she got here. Honestly I feel the same way and I noticed the connection almost right away. I don't focus on multiple interest. Don't friend my exes or date around. And I was always honest with her. And things were going good.

She started expressing more and more emotions to me. And I matched them. Neither of us wanted to rush things. So we didn't cross any boundaries. Also planned out a few days we could meetup each month til she got here. ( I got all the flying miles.)

*She's a quiet to herself person. Buried in hobbies.
Hard to reach even by her friends. Awful texter. The type that runs from social contact after working with people all day. Grew up a dork like myself.

But a few weeks into things she tells me the distance isn't working. Or it doesn't feel natural. She went kinda distant for a few days to short out her feelings. And just said the distance and trying to communicate feels like a burden. She just drifts away at times. She assures me she isn't throwing me away and wants me in her life. Our connection is one of a kind and that I'm the most amazing person she's ever met. But the long distance isn't working and wants me in her corner. But as a friend first and to see if it goes anywhere.

And that's my problem. How do I go about being a friend after that? I know she isn't playing games. But am I supposed to date? I said I would wait for her, but I can't wait for a what if. And I don't want to look like I'm a liar.

I'm not the type of guy to be in contact/dating multiple people. I don't have a bunch of potential GF friends around. Initially this was what I wanted to happen. But she pushed feelings and I matched them because I did have them too and wasn't going to reject her when I flipping adore her.

Now I gotta censor myself, act not interested. And do that whole act til what she gets here?

We talked a bit and I made it clear I'm not shooting myself in the foot and even saying I'm her friend. I agree to take it slower for a future date. And in her words a friend can develop into something more. But we will just leave it untitled and just be ourselves.

We met on a dating app. Talked about children, marriage, life goals and what we wanted in life.
I was plenty clear on what I wanted. We both have feelings, neither are invalid. Im honest, open and stand by my word. I'm supportive, positive and uplifting. I'm not pushy and I'm very patient. So I can make a choice and stand by it.

And now it feels like I'm having to back pedal on it. And if she was anyone else. Well I would walk away. But I saw who she was and I know it's a once in a lifetime connection. I have the sense to know a good thing when I see it and to cherish it day one, not after I lose it.

What are people's thoughts on asking someone out that you meet at like a dance class/social or martial arts class? It seems there are two camps on this topic: obviously, social activities seem to be a logical place to meet potential dates, especially outside of college years or the bar scene. 

But there's definitely an unspoken ""don't shit where you eat"" attitude some people carry about this type of thing. Like, ""wow i can't believe you were hitting on that girl, don't you know people come here to just dance platonically!"" Or ""don't date a martial arts training partner, it'll make the gym atmosphere uncomfortable if you break up."" I guess this is especially nerve-wracking since often you'll shoot your shot and get turned down or find out a girl has a partner already, so it's not like a bar where you just move on to the next one. I don't want a reputation as someone who uses hobbies just to meet women, but I also don't know what else to do because I have terrible luck with dating apps and women in my area tend to be less approachable at bars compared to when I go out of town (just a more uptight culture or maybe my demographic is less appealing here lol).

Even IRL I don’t easily miss people, but from the moment I met her I missed her every time she wasn’t there. The feeling was mutual. I still don’t really know how this happened. It’s like we already knew each other. I never understood how people could fall in love online. Guess I need to change my opinion on that…

Anyway, I made some mistakes which made things difficult. We’ve been back and forth a few times about keeping in touch. At one point she told me to to fuck off and to never contact her ever again… When she came to understand that I was gonna stop pursuing her, she told me she was glad, but that I gave up quickly regarding how I supposedly felt about her. When we talked about it, I couldn’t really tell if she was in fact relieved or sad.

I think we both acted like we were cool. But the truth is, I’m not. She’s still that one person on my mind. I just didn’t want to put her in a situation she doesn’t want to be in. I didn’t want to put her on that emotional rollercoaster again. I did that before and that wasn’t fair to her. But my feelings for her haven’t changed, and the more I think about it, the more i know they’re  not going to either. So, while she thought I was giving up on her, she couldn’t be more wrong, but I couldn’t tell her. She wasn’t gonna believe me anyway… I thought it was best if we both had some time to think.

But seriously, how can I forget about her…

I wake up and go to sleep thinking about her. 
Everything reminds me of her. From the cheese section at the supermarket to someone randomly mentioning “Hay”. 
For some reason I keep seeing John Hamm, ever since we talked about him. 
Everyone around me drinks tea all of a sudden. 
I miss our conversations. I miss how easy they were.
I miss her rants.
I miss how passionate she talks about the stuff she cares about.
I can’t stop listening to her music.
I miss how she’s always right (even when she isn’t).
I miss how brutal she can be.
I miss how she gives me goosebumps playing the piano.
I miss her facial expressions when she’s focussed.
I miss how she challenges me.
I miss all the fun we had together.
For some reason I happen to watch the clock everyday when it displays her birthday (what’s that about…).
I miss how elegant she is.
I miss staying up till 4am for her.
I miss her hands.
I keep watching her favourite show.
I miss how I could tell her things I can’t tell anyone else.
I miss her soft spot for animals.
I miss seeing her, hearing her voice.
I miss making her laugh.
I miss her fringe.
I miss how she’s the only person who can make me mad.
I miss her love for raccoons.
I miss how she pronounces “croissant”.
I miss how she used to look at me, how we looked at each other. 
I miss how she put her tongue on her lip when she smiled.
I hate how we never had that long passionate kiss, or even a hug.
I hate how I never got to hold her hand, or keep her warm when she’s freezing at 18°C.
I hate how I don’t know how she really feels about me.

I miss everything about her.
I miss her.
I miss you.

The more I think about it, the more I know I simply don’t want to forget about her. I feel like not meeting up with her is something I’ll regret for the rest of my life.

The girl was cool for the first 45 mins but after one drink she wanted to go. I may have said something she doesn't like in terms of my interest (she asked am I a dog person and I said no) but she was still friendly. I think that was the question and turned her off or maybe I just don't look as sexy in person but we still chatted for more than half an hour until that question came up randomly from her. 

So I walked her to her car because it's ghetto in that area, and she gave me a hard hug but she deleted me right away when I got home. What's the point of hugging me soo hard when you are going to delete me?

I don't think she's my cup of tea anyway but it kinda affected my confidence. Since pandemic, I rarely went to date due to fear of covid. Before covid, I was getting dates every week and now I barely go on dates because I am being more selective with the fear of covid.

Do all girls really do that? I never really had girls that would delete me immediately. They typically would still be interested and chat with you and eventually just dies down with limited texting.

The person I've been talking to is a couple years younger than me, lives in the same city and just started Med School, and I think is pretty cute. Honesty is real important to me, and I don't want a relationship to be built off lies. How should I approach my circumstances? Because I want her to be aware of who I am, and my relationship novicehood; and that I have no expectations that someone should deal with a rookie unless they want to.

however with all that said, i realize that approach hasn’t really worked for me, as i am still depressingly single. so going to try out this new method even tho i am slightly scared they will run once they get to know all my baggage. 

how long do you wait before getting into deep stuff with new people you are dating? i  have mental health issues (bipolar, so it’s not a “fix myself and come back when i’m better” situation) that would most definitely need to be discussed before entering a relationship with someone.

Hi, I live in a rather conservative country, it’s becoming more progressive but still. 

In the city, people have been exposed to western values (because of the internet and all) so guys there should be more open minded.

What I’m looking for is: 1. I don’t plan on ever, EVER giving birth, I’ll get my tubes tied at the exact moment that I can and I’ll adopt.

2. Idc about virginity. I don’t consider the whole virginity thing sacred, just bs to put woman down.

3. If I really like the guy, I want us to move in together (b4 marriage) to se how things go.

4. I want a serious relationship. If we date, it’s for real. No playing the field, no open relationship, nothing. Long term or nothing. 

When should I bring these things up?

Not sure what flair to use for this one because it’s a toss up between venting and seeking advice.
So basically this has happened multiple times in my dating life over the years and just so happened recently as well. Let me set up the scene:
You meet someone, you have an instant connection/chemistry and know this will be something special if everything aligns up. The dates are fantastic, the texting and communication is perfect, the humor is never out of both your wheelhouse, you agree on most basic compatibility points. I mean everything is great until you get to the physical intimacy part and then even though you can tell there is great sexual chemistry, I’ve always found myself to be more nervous around a woman like that and tend to underperform and/or tend to be more intimate in my ways (which is nothing wrong but I’m usually on the dominant side and turning into this persona feels very alien, which in turn feeds into my psyche that something is wrong in the relationship itself, which in turn makes me question the whole thing.

On the other hand, if I meet someone and I know this is going to be a short fling because of some incompatibility, the sex just happens to be mind fucking blowing on both sides. I’m performing at my peak which in turn also leads to the woman enjoying the hell out of it. Has this happened to anyone else? What’s the logic here? What am I missing and how can I fix this?

I met a girl online and we really hit it off. Similar interests and other interests we shared with each other that we were both intrigued by.

However, I am too afraid to ask her out, since I have never asked out a woman in my life, and I don't know if she has a current boyfriend.

Some history: I originally got to know this person more earlier in the semester, when I interviewed her for a project in another class that I have. Specifically, it was about a near-death car accident that she was in a couple years back. After learning more about what she went through and how well she recovered, I became very empathetic towards her, and I immediately saw her as a charming and resilient woman. I thought about her every day for a long time, and now I finally want to gain the courage to ask her out.

However, there are many problems at the moment. For one, I have high-functioning Autism, which makes me a very shy and awkward person. I have trouble reading how people are feeling through visual cues, so I am uncomfortable asking her in-person. Instead, I want to send an email (to an account that she gave me), which I have already done. That email was about how much empathy I had for her, and I also offered my support in case she ever needed a shoulder to lean on. I know that it is better for me to ask her out in-person, but I absolutely need to send an email asking her out because of my social awkwardness (I already have a heartfelt message drafted out).

Also, I don't know if she already has a boyfriend now, and I don't really know how to find out. I don't have anybody that I can ask to ask her for me, and I don't want to ask her directly as she will likely believe that I am desperate.

This all leads me to my final point: I have many questions regarding what I should do about this situation. If I ask her out through email, how should I go about doing it? Should I tell her all my feelings about her along with a date proposal, or should I only ask about the date without any deeper feelings? Should I explicitly ask for a date, or just a simple meetup to begin with? How can I know whether or not she has a boyfriend? Should I ask her out even though I don't know about her current relationship status? Finally, should I even ask her out at all?

Thank you all in advance. I know that this was a long read, but I've never felt this in love before, and I would really like some advice as to where to take things from here.

We had a long conversation and she told me that she’d scared of commitment, and idk I didn’t really say anything bc I guess I’m just sort of used to just going with the flow. She also said that she doesn’t want to feel pressured and like I guess in the past she stayed in a relationship just bc she didn’t want to hurt the other person.

I told her that usually this sort of conversation doesn’t come up until like 1-2 months in, in my experience but that it was good we were talking about it. And basically I said that we could see where things go and just take it like naturally, and see what happens to which she agreed to. 

After that we made out for like probably an hour or so and just talked about what turned us on, and she told me a lot of her kinks and what turns her on. Idk it’s kind of confusing but she basically said that she doesn’t think she’s going to sleep with anybody else but at the same time to not expect anything, and I guess there’s like some mixed signals.

Regular dating would yield the exact same result.

I'm 32M, just for context.

Now that the pandemic has normalized and people are going back to their regular lives, I thought I could give OLD a new chance. **The reason I'm choosing OLD instead of any other method is because I literally have no choice.** I seldom know any people in my area, and have zero friends here. I tried getting into social activities right before the pandemic, but to no avail.

I decided to open Bumble after a time of not using it. I matched with a couple of girls in no time. One of them lives pretty close; the other one, I don't see myself going to her place soon. They're fine and all, but... **I just don't feel the spark**. I can continue the conversation, but at this point I'm doing it because I enjoy having someone to talk with. It gets pretty lonely when you don't have company outside your family and the friends you made in a different, far away city.

And here is where the more generic issue comes. For every 10 girls I get shown in Bumble, I'm lucky to swipe right on 1 of them. Same goes with Tinder and about any dating app. The rest? **I'm literally not interested on them**. I want someone to share my quirky hobbies, someone I can be, I don't know, excited to be around of. But most profiles are just girls who travel the world and like dancing and karaoke and beaches and damn, I literally have negative interest on all of those! If you're dating me don't expect me to jump into the ""let's travel everywhere"" bandwagon, and let's not get started about how much I hate beaches and dancing.

Don't get me wrong. I can hold a conversation just fine, and I suppose I can do so without becoming a creep. But most girls don't really interest me (I dgaf about how hot they look if we cannot share similar interests) and it's been a long time since I felt that spark of actually wanting and needing to be with someone. Let alone the fact I don't have a single friend here.

And do you know what sucks even more? In the past I used to be extremely excited of being with... well, anyone who showed me a little bit of love. Nowadays I'm so emotionally worn out I lost that excitement and I have a difficult time becoming vulnerable with anybody.

Background info: 

Regular communication without leaving each other on read. Equal effort in terms of interest. We had 3 dates so far. 1st coffee, 2nd music concert, 3rd proper dinner date. Each date was spaced 1-2weeks in between due to holidays, exams, other commitments. I had a healthy childhood, healthy friendships but never got to follow through romantic relationships because my fam and I were moving a lot, and I was advised to focus on studies. So I don’t have any relationship traumas people talk about on different outlets of advice. I feel calm and secure in this stage of dating. We had our first kiss on the second date. I do not do hookups because my parents waited till marriage to have sex for just moral reasons(atheists). I have a high sex drive but I also practice delayed gratification and can probably see myself abstaining from sex till marriage for moral reasons. Plus oxytocin and dopamine rush from sex can get in the way of thinking clearly about compatibility.

There were periods where we took each other seriously but now it’s more of a friends with benefits situation. 

We always maintained a policy that we would be honest with each other. This past week, I told him that I want to start dating other people, he didn’t seem hurt or against it. We’ve talked about us being exclusive in the past and it never worked out. 

I was supposed to meet up with him this past Friday, but the morning of our meet up he canceled and said he no longer wanted to do anything physical. I asked him why the change in his tune and he told me he thinks I can do better than him and I deserve someone who wants to commit to me. We used to get into arguments (from my side) about me not seeing him enough and he told me we should stop doing this so we stop getting into fights.. Long story short, some fighting words were thrown around and I decided to be an asshole and ask him to hook me up with his friend (something he used to get upset about when I made jokes about it…). We got into an argument and he blocked me on iMessage. 

I tried to reach out to him on other social media platforms and he just reads my messages and doesn’t reply. I’m more hurt about the loss of the friendship than anything, but I get him not wanting to do anything physical anymore. Just reading back on what I wrote, I know I messed up and I know I’m in the wrong about overreacting during the argument. It’s not an excuse but I was just hurt.

Guys, I really liked this guy. I was so happy to have found someone nice after my last extremely abusive relationship. 

Then I dont know what happened, all of a sudden, he said to me that he is worried if/when we break up, I am gonna be really hurt and I shouldn't love him too deeply. What does that even mean?

He started withdrawing from me. started canceling our plans. Answering my texts after 12/18 hours, not picking up my calls, stopped calling me, whereas he'd always reply within a certain time window and called everyday.

I texted him, asked if he was no longer interested and he replied that he loved me but was a little afraid (didn't explain afraid of what nor did I ask)

I swear, my anxiety is killing me. I didn't say anything or texted anything to him after that. And I have a feeling he wont contact me either.

So my ex and I work for the same company we dated for like 5 months 2 years ago and after the break up (which was brutal) we pretty much ignored each other for two years only interacting if absolutely necessary.

But recently we started talking again and now it's evolved to what looks like a friendship, we hang out outside of work often we share secrets and have alot of deep conversations.

Now to be clear I am not interested in dating her again that relationship was toxic as hell and healing from that was long and hard but as 'friends' I'm really enjoying her company but at the same time I feel like it's weird. We are both single so I think that makes it easier for us to hang out guilt free because I don't think if we were seeing anyone they would be happy that their partner is hanging out with an ex.
