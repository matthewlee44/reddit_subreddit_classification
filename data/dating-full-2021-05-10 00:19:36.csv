It sucks, not gonna lie. That being said, the most common advice given is to focus and improve on yourself. That is simultaneously great advice and horseshit. Horseshit because it's too vague to be of any help, but also great for a little bit more of a nuanced reason. I think it's meant as a way to remind yourself of what you can control. Hear me out. **You cannot and will not ever control who is attracted to you.** That being said, there *are* things in your control. ""Working on yourself"" is always such a vague piece of advice, but being in better shape will be more attractive to more people. Having a hobby/passion is something that you can control that will make you more attractive. Dressing better is something that you can control, too. You cannot ever fully control the outcome, but you can control the input. That's just part of the risk, so to speak. Nothing is ever guaranteed.

And before you say ""but I've worked on myself and there's nothing left to improve"". Bullshit. There's always something new to learn. You can save up and travel. You can try a different hobby. Everything you do doesn't have to be related to dating, either. Even then, maybe improvement comes in the form of learning to be ok alone and with your thoughts, or having a better outlook on life. Neither are easy skills to learn. The lack of matches can get to your head and sometimes you just need to step away for a bit and come back at it with a clear mind. Don't be afraid to ask for help or talk to a therapist, too.

To start, i was involved with someone for just over a year and we met through work. In the beginning, i was 100% percent interested in her and wanted to see where things could go. But after some time, i realized i wasn’t ready to be in a serious relationship and i made her aware of that many times. We continued to see each other and remained intimate. For the record, i didn’t have any other women i was interested in nor was anyone else in the picture which i reassured her of that. At the beginning of the year, she stopped reaching out which i didn’t blame her for. I didn’t want to waste her time or prohibit her from getting what she truly wanted. I cared a lot for this person, but i didn’t feel like i could give everything i had to her without being secure within myself. I have my master’s, a good job, financially stable but i had my own shit to work through which i also made her aware of. I think the reason why i couldn’t full commit is because eventually she wanted marriage and kids and i knew there would be some pressure to give her that. A few months go by and we stopped speaking as i said. I reached out not too long ago to see if i did something wrong for her to stop speaking to me. Long story short, she is seeing someone else. Since i found this out it hasn’t sat well with me and it’s been killing me inside. Maybe i cared more for her than i thought or maybe i realized i let something good go.

I’m willing to be more open going forward but I’m afraid I shut this guy down and idk how to lighten it up. Apologize for reading into his intention? Or just move on and say something cute. He left me on read...

I really envy women who grew up comfortable in their skin, allowed to date, not surveilled 24/7 by their parents or threatened. I think that shit shaped me into adulthood and I’m apprehensive at times.

I know that him leaving will probably make me feel bad for a good time, and i know this may sound dumb but there's a part of me that think that the best thing to do is to end up things now,i just feel like i'll get attached even more for nothing at the end and i'll just waste my feelings for nothing,but there's that other part that really enjoy spending time with him, i really love him and im really grateful that he gave me faith in love again, i mean, i'll probably feel bad about him leaving anyway so why not just try to enjoy the moment ?

I know that part of me never having a girlfriend is due to the fact that I’ve been shy my whole life. From ages 18-25 I never bothered looking for love because I was very shy. I started to try at age 26. In June 2019 I met a woman, she was the same age as me. When we first met, she pretty much told me amazing things such as “you’re the one for me” “I like you” “you’re a cutie” just sweet things like that. We only went on 4 dates that lasted 2 weeks. She ended things with me because she said she wasn’t ready for a relationship, I was heart broken. Fast forward to November 2019, I met another woman who was around 21 years old I believe. She was an actress &amp; she was very attractive. I quickly knew that I could never be in a relationship with her, so I only tried to pursue a friendship with her, but I wasn’t even good enough to be her friend! We hung out like 5 times and she just stopped talking to me out of nowhere. Fast forward to February 2020, I met a different woman, we only met up once that day, she didn’t show any interest in me &amp; she stopped talking to me for whole year. Fast forward to March 2021, I found her on Facebook &amp; I sent her a friend request. She accepted and messaged me a couple of days later asking how I’ve been. We met up a week later after messaging, we met up at the same place we met up a year before. She showed a lot of interest in me this time, she seemed to regret that she stopped talking to me for a whole year. She told me things like “You’re an amazing man” “I don’t plan on letting you go this time” “I hope to be the one for you” but after 3 weeks of going on dates, she ended things with me because she sent me some texts which I never got, she thought I was ignoring her and she lost interest in me quickly. She thought I was looking for an excuse to stop talking to her, but that wasn’t the case. I ended up calling her a few days later because I missed her. We would talk on the phone often after that and help each other with our anxiety issues. But she hasn’t texted me back since last night and she hasn’t returned my calls from this morning. I wanna get over her, but I can’t. I feel like the only way to get over her is by meeting someone else. I just don’t understand why I can’t last more than 3 weeks dating. I need advice. What do I do? I’m tired of crying and I’m tired of being alone. I bought a house this past December, I’m very independent, I have good paying job. I’m just tired of coming home to a house without a wife.

I recently went on a few dates with a woman and we had both been very interested in each other for the few weeks that we were in contact.  However, after the second date this past Sunday, communication between us kind of slowed, and I had the sense from when we kissed during the second date that she wasn't as into it as I was.  This turned out to be correct, as she ended up sending me a text in response to my asking for a third date several days later that said she liked everything about me except that she just didn't feel chemistry with me.  I really liked this woman, for various reasons, and one thing that really disappointed me about this was that, prior to our first date, we had done phone calls and a video chat and, when I mentioned the possibility of us finding out we didn't have chemistry, she texted me later that evening saying that, although she knew I felt that way, she felt very confident we wouldn't have that issue.  She also said on another occasion that I was special to her, and I really think at that point I was.  As she said in her breakup message to me, this kind of thing just happens sometimes, which is totally true, but...this really shook me because I thought I could relax a little bit.  The first date went really well and she had great things to say afterwards, and we did kiss on the first date.  She broke things off a couple days ago and since then I've gotten to feeling a little better, but...yeah, this shook me.  From what she said, she liked everything else about me, but in the most basic sense (sexual chemistry), when we were in person with each other I just didn't do it for her.

How do I get over feeling inadequate and like I'll never find someone as good as her again?  I tried everything I could this time to make sure that if I got rejected, it'd be quick, and yet this took me by surprise.  I guess I thought that she'd be sure whether we had basic sexual chemistry by the second date, but I was wrong.  I've been rejected and done the rejecting many times before this, but this time has hurt notably more.

I'm a fairly peculiar person that would be a deal breaker for the majority of people.

For instance:

I don't want kids and I wanna stay childfree.

I'm extremely career oriented. I'll likely have to move a lot and travel for work.

I'm an atheist. While I'm no anti-theist, just lacking religion can be a big deal-breaker for some.

I don't have a friend group. Mainly because I moved a lot, but also because I just don't need a whole lot of people in my life beyond my sibling and acquaintances at work. It's enough socialization for me.

I live with mental illness. I mean, I've got Depression, OCD, and ADHD. While I've been fairly lucky in my life  not to deal with much shaming about it besides from family, it's still something that people just don't want to deal with.

those are just some of the points. It makes me kinda apprehensive to date since it's a long shot to find someone that share my values about the future and ambition.

It's these parts of me that just make dating difficult... Although they're rather moot in the grand scheme of things since I've gotta meet someone before they come into play...

I just worry about wasting someone's time when if they knew X about me they never would have agreed to date. I'm not someone that is a risk taker.

I like hedging my bets so I don't ever have to worry about people lying that they're  into me or lying that they also don't want kids just to try to convince me.

I guess, when it all comes down to it I just don't wanna be hurt by people again because that shit stays with me for years because of intrusive thought cycles.

I just don't really know what to do since I wanna try dating, but I just feel like there's a barrier since so many people that I may find interesting and/or attractive will want nothing to do with me if they find that we don't have the same goals or foci in life.

I guess it just boils down to a fear of rejection that I haven't been able to shake for years.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,765089,public,self,I feel like I'm a walking deal breaker...,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n8x72z/i_feel_like_im_a_walking_deal_breaker/,all_ads,6,,,

I’ve (F21) been on many good dates but the recent one was, eh.

We were in a coffee shop with this guy, maybe 30 min into, and he starts talking about his past: how he had a drug related illegal business, did many kinds of illegal stuff with some of the well known criminals in my country. 

I was like WTF. When I heard that, things clicked and I didn’t doubt he was still doing that stuff. I’m glad he told me that early, but _why on Earth would somebody tell that on a 1st date to a stranger?_ And he was telling it as if the things he did were normal!

When I was young I was an outcast in school and at home and in my community to a certain extent. At school I never really connected with anyone due to having speech issues and at home I didn’t really connect with my family since they were strict Muslims. (I became atheist at a young age) 

Due to lack of self awareness and other issues i had socializing with guys even, i was never really aware of how unattractive I was to the opposite sex until I turned 18.

One of the only things that I wanted out of life was a relationship with mutual attraction. I don’t fault girls for liking taller guys, because they can’t control their attraction anymore than I can control my height. 

I just turned 24 and I live alone now and make close to six figures but that hasn’t helped me any. Living alone has made me think about the future and tbh id rather be dead than continue the status quo.

Dating someone from my own culture is very hard when you’re an atheist and even more if you’re short. Ive tried to date less attractive women who were overweight, but I could never really get over the complete lack of attraction. There was no spark. Ive tried to see if getting fit would help and getting ripped hasn’t helped me. I was able to get nearly a 4.0 gpa in engineering, but trying to get a date has been infinitely harder.

At this point I’m at a crossroads. I realize that ending my life would obliterate the minute possibility of finding what I want in life. I don’t take suicide lightly. However I also realize that past performance is the best predictor of future results and that there is a very high possibility that i die alone and miserable.

So im giving myself an ultimatum. In 3 years, if I haven’t found someone or garnered any interest, I’m going to end my life. I figure if i cant attract someone at my best, then there is no point in going on. Especially cause I don’t want to live a miserable life alone or with someone I’m not into. I’m not even upset about it, and I’m a bit relieved because I feel this is truly the only solution to my issue. I’ll do my best. Permanent problems require permanent solutions. 

That being said, what can I do in these three years to maximize my opportunities. My speech has been corrected years ago, and I’m already pretty charismatic now and can strike up conversations easily with men and women. I’m actually pretty confident and have been told so myself, so im not entirely sure what im missing. How else do i attract.

We were young and nothing worried us. We joked around, had the ""if we are both single at 30, we'll give it a go"" talk, but in my mind, it wouldn't have taken that long. 30 is old when you are 8 or 9.

Along the way, we lost touch, both moved, and we didn't hear from each other in over a decade. Through the wonders of social media, we reconnected with each other early in our 20s. It has been great to slowly catch up over the years, even though we lived thousands of km's away, every time we were in the same city or town, we have caught up, and had a great time at it.

We are now living a few hours away from each other, and catching up more than ever. We talk multiple times a week, on social media, and things are clicking more and more. It feels like when we were kids again. This week, the if we get to 30 agreement came up again, and it got to the point where we have both not had any luck dating, and don't see ourselves having luck before we turn 30. We joked about the agreement, and what will happen if it gets to that point.

We talk about politics, the environment, sport. We ask how our days are, and share our struggles and triumphs. We talk about our plans, how impossible it is to buy real estate, our futures. Our plans, whilst very different, seem to line up well in a context of being able to co-exist.

Now, the more I think of it, the more the though of her has shaped the idea of who I want to be with. I want someone passionate about causes, hardworking about their pursuits, someone who will push me to be a better person, but at the same time not being the same as me. All of these things are what I see within her.

Now it's getting to the point where I don't want to wait until 30, it's getting here fast, but not fast enough. The next time we catch up, I'm trying to work out how things can move forward.

My previous experience of online dating seemed shit. The site I used is so popular and I had over 5k men show interest/ hold conversations with me/ ask me out. 
Obviously based on my picture and personality it's probably what attracted them and made them stay. Out of all these men only 1 was my type.. 

For me it's my unconditional + appearance + personality . I personally can't find you physically attractive if you don't meet my unconditional or have a personality I enjoy. Actually I probably won't get to know you if you don't meet my unconditional.

I think people forget that it's alright to have unconditional whether that be religion, age, height, culture, anything and everything. It's alright to have that as you filter. Not everyone is the same! 

My biggest problem is seeing essays upon essay on their profiles. And getting essay upon essays on their messages.
If  I know everything about you how do you expect to move forward and have a conversation. 

Secondly. It's fine to share but it seems people just want to have random meaningless and forceful conversations.. 
If you want to be friends then fine I can have qwerKY conversations.

For example the really well written paragraphs, I just don't think us forcefully speaking the queens speech is going to do anything for either of us if that's not how we naturally talk. Though, I don't want someone who speaks like a 13 year old chav. 

If you want someone as eloquent as well written as you then fair play I see why you write in essays.

That's fair, but it wasn't always like this. I used to be a bitter person and get really angry and sad whenever I got rejected or turned down, sometimes lashing out at the girl or getting really depressed for quite some time

But recently, I DMd a girl I was interested in, shot my shot. She thanked me for the funny messages and the ego boost, but told me she was gonna have to say no for now, but maybe some other time we could go on a date (which I'm 99% sure is just a nice way of saying no). I joked around a little bit, told her ""Task failed successfully"", she laughed, and I said ""Well, if you ever do wanna go on that date, you know how to contact me"" and that was that

And you know what? I felt good. Now I know, now she knows I'm interested, and I'm free to pursue other options and not wonder about this one girl. I honestly didn't feel sad at all after the rejection, and even if she didn't want to date me, she left our interaction just a little bit happier and not thinking I'm an asshole

Would I rather she had said yes? Obviously. But, whatever, she wasn't mean to me, was actually quite nice, so it is what it is.

Someone who I feel very strongly about, someone who I've come to look up to in a great many ways, rejected me a few months back and every since I've been feeling an overwhelming sense of complete and utter decimation since, and it's only worsened more and more the more time passes. I feel worthless, I feel angry, and I feel unbearable sadness. It's getting to a point where I just can't help but feel a complete and utter sense of disgust and hate for the entire world and everything about it. I know the feelings aren't right, and I know that it's not healthy to feel this way, but the feelings are still there, lingering like a festering rot on my fucking soul and I don't know what to do about it or how to help it.   


I've always struggled a bit with depression and anxiety, but I've always tried my best to stay positive and give my best possible self to the world when dealing with other people and have always tried to live as my best self around others. I've always maintained the outlook that everyone is trying their best and deserve to be given the best effort I can make, even when I'm not doing the best internally and even when other people are difficult to deal with. Lately though, no matter how hard I try, I just feel hateful and resentful of everything and everyone. I hate myself because I can't stop thinking and wondering what about me wasn't good enough for her to like me back and tearing myself down over every little thing, hating everything about myself and about who I am as a human being. I hate people in general because I feel like everyone I see is judging and resenting me over all the things I hate myself for. I hate the world and the way life and society is. I'm angry about it all, I'm sad about it.   


I've never felt such an intense and unceasing level of insecurity, worthlessness, and alienation before in my entire life. Being being bullied, socially outcast, and always having a difficult time with other people socially while growing up and into my early adult years, while it always hurt a bit, I always tried to stay positive about life, learn to accept myself and others as is and know that eventually I'll find myself at a place in life where I'm happy and loved by people who like me for who I am, and for the past couple of years I actually started to feel like I was beginning to get there, beginning to get to a place where I started to feel more comfortable with myself, feel less rejected by others around me. Then this happened, and now I can't look at myself of think about any aspect of my life or myself as a person without feeling a sense of disgust and repulsion, of hate and rejection of everything I am and could ever be. I'll just be minding my own business, doing something I would typically enjoy or whatever, and all I can think is ""That (that being just about anything, from a hobby I enjoy, to the way I move when I walk, to the way my body looks, you name it) is why she fucking hates and why nobody could ever, *ever* love you, you worthless piece of shit!"" And then I feel like everyone around me feels and thinks the same way and I feel like I they hate me as much as I do over every little imagined, perceived slight, and I resent them as much as I resent myself for it.   


Anyways, I'm sorry for the long, venting post that probably doesn't do anybody any good. I just don't know what to do. I feel like there's nobody who I can talk to about it. I feel like nobody in my life around me actually likes or wants me around, not really, even if they say otherwise I feel in the back of my mind like it's a lie, like any superficial level of acceptance anyone has ever displayed towards me is nothing more than a lie for their own convenience. I feel like I can't trust anyone or anything and that the only thing I can feel 100% confident in is that life is awful and always will be. I don't know what to do about it. I don't know how to not feel this anymore. I don't want to feel this, I don't want my life to be this, but I just can't see anything else right now, and I don't feel like I will ever see anything else ever again. I feel like I'm ruined and used up, and like there's nothing left inside that could ever be good again. I feel expired and broken now.   


I guess the reason I'm positing is, I want to know, when you've been hurt, when you've opened yourself up to someone after feeling shut out for so long and working so hard to build yourself up to the point that you could open yourself to feeling romantically towards someone and trying to involve them in your life only to be discarded like a used piece of trash, how do you possibly start over?

I accepted these reasons even if I didn't agree, and thought that was it, but when I got back into town next week, he invited me over to hang out, and it was clear he still wanted to fool around. Nothing happened, but after one more time of this I told him we couldn't be friends like this, and I was done.

I spent the next few months getting over him, improving my life, and one day he texted randomly, inviting me over to hang out. I was curious and bored, so I went. We fooled around, and I decided I was all for it, as by then I no longer had feelings, and figured a purely physical thing would be mutually beneficial. Well, the following week I texted him to see if he was free for another hookup, and he texted me back ""I think we should refrain from having anymore se\_ual encounters"". I was confused and hurt, but it made it clear there was absolutely nothing for us to have contact over in the future.

We stopped talking again for 6 months, then this year when he heard one of my family members passed away, he reached out to ask how I was doing. Since then we have had 0 se\_ual contact, but we have hung out a handful of times. He has been kind enough to fix my car on two occasions, meet me for coffee to help with schoolwork, and the other day he came by to help me with some painting. He never takes money for any of this or shows any se\_ual interest, but every time we spend 4+ hours talking after the fact talking about all kinds of things: his dreams, my career goals, our mutual hobbies, his kids and how they're becoming adults, etc. The other day before he left, he said something about how much he loved being able to talk like we did. It made me think back to all the talks we have had in the past. Last year I had gone over to his house to drop off a jacket he lent me. I had been in a hurry and never even got out of my car, but he ran outside when I drove up and spent half an hour leaning in my car window talking to me like a teenager. It was pretty funny.

I am wondering whether we are both at a point where we can just be friends. Is this possible after our history? When we were seeing each other he never once raised his voice, spoke unkindly to me, or was bad to me, however I felt so hurt and disrespected by what he did when he called me after months of healing, only to fool around once, and then cut it off the following week. I am much more cautious and guarded with him now, but I still enjoy talking to him so much. I have a good network of friends and family I can talk to, but the conversations him and I have are just incredible. I know there is nothing there romantically and that is off the table as far as I am concerned, but is being friends a bad idea?

Tl;dr: I casually dated an older colleague, then some weirdness happened, but now it seems like we are forming a natural friendship centered around great conversations.
