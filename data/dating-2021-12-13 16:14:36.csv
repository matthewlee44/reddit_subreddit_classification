0,rfrtlo,1639433973,How to get to know this girl I got introduced to by my friend?,"So there's this girl I know for around 1 and a half years but I've only hung out with her like 4-5 times. She's a friend of my friend, a good one, but I don't want to tell him that I like his friend. We hung out once in 2020, and then have hung out 3-4 times in the past 3-4 months. These past months we've gotten to know each other better but still not a lot, since I'm a shy(?) person or should I say I don't really open up that much and also I can't strike interesting conversations with anyone, let alone girls. This has often led to us just hanging out as a group but never really getting that one to one connect. And I'm tired of waiting. Do you guys have any idea what I should do in case we meet again? Or should I send her some social media request? But even if she accepts (which she will) there won't be much to talk on Instagram? And I don't want to be the pursuer. I want to keep it as natural as possible. I can tell my friend to bring her to hangout again but it'll be just another hangout. How do I turn this ""just another hangout"" to a night that forges my impression in her mind?

2,rfs7uk,1639435014,He googled my dead ex…,"..and texted me asking questions about him. 

I’ve decided this is a block-able offense, but wanted to hear others’ thoughts. 

Basically a guy I met on an app, had one video call and texted for 2 weeks, then a date over the weekend. Some things I wasn’t fond of during the texting stage: Asking to play a game where we send each other either NSFW non-nude pics or PG pics, (whatever those mean), responding to some fairly innocent statements with sexual innuendos (ex: ""I’m working sadly, so still chained to my desk."" His response: ""Kinky""), randomly video calling me with no heads-up on 2 occasions, and when I asked why, response: ""Because I can 😌"" Asking for my IG - I tell him I’m not comfortable with that since he’s still pretty much a stranger and he says ""A stranger who owns his own LLC"" - maybe as a misguided attempt to impress me? Then doubling down a few days later with ""give me your IG bro"" because he ""needs visuals until I come out and play"" then sending me his. Wrote him off then &amp; there as someone who doesn’t respect boundaries and told him as much, but he claimed it was a joke and a lot of the other cocky comments were also jokes - apparently he has his own specific brand of humor. So against my better judgement we talked it over the phone (he definitely reads much better in conversation than via text) and went on a date. 

Was an OK date, no sparks or butterflies on my part, but average. During said date, he admitted that he’d googled me (apparently caller ID showed my full name when I called) and looked at my work online - even though when he’d asked to see my work, I expressly told him I’d rather show him in person, so I can gauge his reaction if he hated it har-har. I took him doing that as boundary-crossing, albeit a light one, but something to keep an eye on. Then the topic of exes came up and I gave him the condensed version of mine - year long relationship, ended with him cheating, then he passed away 6 months later. And it was a tragic accident so it made small town news. He asked me his first name and I told him. Talked a bit about his ex, and moved on to other topics. I text him when I get home and he says that he had a good time with me. 

NOW the next day, he texts to see how my day’s going. I’m about to respond when I immediately get another text asking about said ex - one he could only have known by googling: ""also that guy had a kid in 2016, [Ex’s name]?"" I was actually lost for words. I asked him: ""Are you seriously googling?"" And he responds ""only the accident"" then another text: ""that showed with it""

I was - and am - still lost for words. I was going to type out a response as to how strange, creepy, and inappropriate it is to not only do that but to actually ask me *follow up questions* based on what you’ve googled. Then decided it wasn’t even worth the effort and simply blocked him. He didn’t seem like the worst human in the world on the date, so I started feeling unsure if I should’ve at least explained why I’d no longer be messaging him (he’s definitely the type to ""argue his case"" and go on the defensive, and I wanted to avoid all that).

4,rfscy4,1639435391,told date i liked her and she said thanks?,"I (25M) have been seeing someone (25F) I met off of Bumble for around 2 months now (since late September). We have been on 8 dates and had sex on the first date. My feelings for her have been developing steadily and most of the times, I feel as though she likes me back (most of the dates have been initiated by her).

This past weekend I wanted to get a sense of the direction we were heading: I told her that I really liked her, to which she half smiled and said, ""thanks.' Since we've been talking for 2 months and have been having regular sex, intuitively one would think that she would know by now whether she likes me or not.....I didn't confess love or ask her to be my girlfriend, I merely stated that I really liked her. By saying ""thanks' to this, I can only take away that she doesn't like me back or is only here for the attention and sex.

I know that the clear answer is to communicate and ask her what she meant by thanks but before I make myself vulnerable again, I'd like to get some insight in case anyone has ever been in a situation like this. Is this relationship a lost cause? What would make her say ""thanks"" to something like this?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rfscy4/told_date_i_liked_her_and_she_said_thanks/

12,rfssn4,1639436580,Ended a 4-month talking stage after being too emotionally involved.,"I simply just hate the 'talking phase', the dreadful phase in your dating life in which you don't know if you are officially dating or not. He ended things exactly a week ago. Now I can think a bit clearer and am out of my crying phase. It might sound ridiculous, but this is the first time in my 23 years of living that I have actually tried dating seriously. I really thought this time it would work out. I know it's dumb to put all your eggs in one basket, but I trusted him for some reason. I told him things I normally never talk about, and at the end I felt betrayed?

When I first met him, I said I didn't want anything serious, because I simply don't date or try to get involved with people as much as I can. He, however, said that he really wants to take me out and start a relationship, so silly me opened up with the idea that it would work. One thing I can say is that I truly tried from my side. I had pure intentions and wanted to grow with him. I thought I had problems before and have to work on myself, and I still stand by that. I admitted it and actively tried to change my dating style. I wanted to tell him how my day went, made time even if I was busy as heck, tell him things I'm interested about, or send him songs I find great. 

He himself opened up, and I guess from his side he also tried at first, but towards the end I could feel that he wasn't putting much energy into seeing me or make  time the way that I do.  I tried to blame it with our busy schedules. I don't know why, but even if he sometimes negged me or do something questionable, I just put off that feeling, because it felt so comfortable around him. Never have I met anyone in which I felt this comfortable. I always felt conflicted and unsure towards the end. I guess I did feel that he was pulling back but didn't want to accept it. I knew something was going on when I made time for him that weekend, but he instead needed to clean his closet.

See, I thought only people with similar upbringings as me are the ones that could understand me. We had so many things in common that I immediately felt comfortable and at home with him. Nobody has ever held me the way he did or held my hand that way. I trusted him with my insecurities that I never tell anyone, and hoped that he would understand where I was coming from. I don't know if he did or not, but at the end he became the first man that put me in so much pain. I didn't know it was possible to feel this sort of pain. It sounds so dramatic, but that is exactly how I felt a week ago. All I did was cry, but nowadays, I just think about him and wonder what we could have done differently to make it work.

I'm also aware that I can't force people to stay in my life and make them work on themselves if they don't want to. It's like you can't help people who don't want to be helped. I know myself that I can be selfless, and I think deep down I'm a bit glad he ended it, because I may have ended up hating him in the long run. I can't be with a person who don't have the emotional capacity to love themselves. Not only that, but I now realize that people can only give what they themselves have, and at the end of the day I don't think he even liked himself.

His reasoning for ending things is that there wasn't a click and that his depression is apparently back. He went to therapy early this year and told me when we met that he's cured. In my head, I knew that was a lie. I have so many people in my life that suffer from depression, and I also know it just doesn't just go away. Apparently he has been feeling shit for the last few weeks (during the time he was pulling away) and not once has he ever told me about it. He said he didn't want to drag me down with him or ask me to wait for him, and that's why he wanted to end it now. What I don't get is that right after he named his reasons, he ended up saying that he actually wanted to ask me to be his girlfriend in our trip in a few weeks or what he wanted to give me this Christmas. Towards the end, after we hugged and cried, he told me he'll tell me once he's fine. The silly part of me is actually holding onto this even though I know I shouldn't. 

I feel like he has a lot of unresolved problems within himself and needs to come to terms with them before he even tries to date. As for me, I'd like to see this as a learning experience. Looking back, it wasn't all that bad, even if it still makes me sad thinking about the things that we could have been. I now found out hat deep inside I actually yearn for a relationship and that I'm surrounded by good people who support and love me. I don't know how I will feel towards this experience in a few months or years, but I'm glad I did not end up settling for less. 

I don't know how long it would take for me to go out there and try dating again, but next time I'll try better, because I know I have to.

24,rftqdq,1639439188,Is this a red flag?,"I (25F) met someone (32M) on a dating app. We had two very nice dates before he invited me to his flat for 'dinner'. The dinner quickly turned into sex, which was consensual, and mutually enjoyed. The sex felt intimate. After it there was lots of pillow-talk where we both opened up. He'd already told me he had meetings in the morning before he had to fly to another country for a week of job interviews. After a couple of hours in bed the mood changed quite quickly. I'm not sure if he just became aware of the time (2am) and everything he had to do before his trip, or if I said or did something he didn't like. He asked if I wanted to stay and, sensing his mood, I said I didn't have to, that if he was stressed and needed to pack I could go home. He replied that, yes, he thought it'd be best if I went home. I was very tired, and had not expected him to say yes (even though I suggested it). It was 2am, raining, and, on my bike, it would take me 40mins to get across the city to my house. I was visibly upset and didn't say much as I dressed and left. He'd tried to hug me was also pretty silent. I got home to a couple of messages from him about me getting home safe, about how he was sorry I couldn't stay but hoped I would stay the whole night sometime soon, that I had been right, he needed space before his week, and that he'd had a great time. I was very upset. I tried to weigh things up and to see it from his point of view, but I couldn't help feeling used - that after making myself vulnerable to him, I'd been turfed out and rejected.

25,rftsmc,1639439371,"I got a girl's number, texted her, haven't heard back yet (1 day), wondering if I should call in a couple days if I don't hear back? (please read context)","As usual, most situations are different from other people's situations. I've included some detail (you don't have to read, but **I'd recommend doing so if you're sending a reply**) to **help better understand the context** here.

A friend of mine I hangout with a lot and his gf introduced me to one of their friends. We've hung out about twice (all of us together, that is), and commonly my buddy and his gf who introduced me to her would leave us by ourselves, so we'd entertain eachother and talk about a lot of different stuff. All together we've spent about 3-4 days together (roughly), because she stays over the friend's house when visiting the area, and my buddy generally lets me crash there too since we're pretty blazed/buzzed/etc. So I do get to spend a decent bit of time with her (but give her her space too, because she's also there to visit her friend, his gf).

While having a good conversation, I was able to get her phone number, and she got mine. I also ended up getting one of her social media profiles she uses often.

The next day, yesterday that is, we went out on a nature walk and had a lot of fun together as well, usually left by ourselves most of the time since my buddy and his gf would disappear.

Throughout our conversations, she did mention she recently had a breakup and isn't looking for anything serious; which is great, because nor am I (I'm open to ""something serious"" aka a relationship as bf/gf, but I'm also open to fun as friends; it wouldn't be my first time, and if she wants to have fun with other guys too, lol, that don't bother me, wouldn't be my first time; I'd still enjoy what I get! plus, you never know what it can evolve into in the future, since we know eachother through good friends and all + we all do plan to be hanging out more).

So, I guess now I should get to the point. After parting ways, after we'd been chilling for a couple days, I went home, got some sleep, and was busy the next day with various things. I didn't want to text her right away, because well, I already know how all of that goes. At the same time, obviously don't want to never hit her up either. She already mentioned she's bad at replying to texts, as am I most of the time. So we do know that about eachother.

I waited until just lastnight (it had been a day since I'd peaced out) and sent a txt her way, just saying it was really fun chilling and we should definitely do it again sometime, then I told her something that related to what we'd talked about. She told me her laptop's broken and she'd like to get back into making music, but doesn't have the program(s) she needs to do it like she'd used to do. While we talked about that, I found out which programs she needs and let her know I can get them for her. We talked further about next time we chill, me bringing my laptop over if I can get what she needs, and then we can basically work on some stuff together (she'd be showing me some stuff she said, because I'm kind of new to programming instruments, but as a musician myself, I've done it before in programs like Reaper and such; so it'd definitely be cool to chill w/ her and work on some music tracks, help her record vocals and such, I have really good recording mics, audio interface, and etc because I record often).

That was all my text said, just pointing out that it was a really fun weekend (that was probably obvious, but oh well, I felt like saying it), that we should do it more, and then I brought up (in my 2nd sentence) the program I'm working on getting (the main one she needs to do what she's trying to do). I'm simplifying it, so I don't have to quote the text here, but I did add some slight humor to it and such ""I'm working on getting \_\_\_ since I know you'd like to have some fun with it ;D""

I've learned my lesson, awhile back, when it comes to 'texting too much', so, I'm not concerned about that. I haven't sent another text, lol, and I'm not going to at the very moment. Obviously it's best to see if she replies for the time being. Now, something else important that I should bring up, is she did mention her phone bill wasn't paid and she was waiting on someone in her family to pay it for her. That said, it's entirely possible her phone isn't even receiving my text for her to see at the moment. Probably would've been better to msg her on social media initially, but oh well.

Maybe I'm a bit lucky here, because regardless of any of this, I'll be seeing her again (unless she just absolutely never wants to be around me; but I definitely didn't get that vibe in any way, and if that were the case, my friend's gf wouldn't hesitate to tell me that so that I understand). Actually, while hanging out over the weekend, we all found a show we'd like to go to, and I'm the only one out of all three of us with a vehicle. So, I offered to drive and if necessary pick her up (she lives a couple hours away, but I like going on a little drive now and again, especially if it's to see a great looking chick like her). That show's going to be later this week, and as long as she isn't busy, she should be coming along with us.

28,rfu97i,1639440952,Looking for advice on some gray area of dating,"Looking for some advice since I feel like an idiot.  I don't want to go into a ton of detail on the off chance either of these people browse this subreddit.


I matched with this person, we'll call X, a little over a month ago on an app.  She has some family stuff going on that didn't allow her to meet in person until a couple weeks ago, but we texted every day for two weeks leading up to us hanging out.  We met on a Friday, had great chemistry, and hung out Saturday and then Monday, and ended up hooking up on Monday.  On Wednesday I get a long text from her saying that she really likes me but that she's not currently in a place to be in a healthy relationship, and I totally get that considering all the stuff she has going on (also, this was not a cop out, I do believe her, she's dealing with heavy family stuff right now).  I was super bummed but there was an understanding that once things cool off a bit on her end that we could try dating again in the future, but she told me to live my life in the meantime.  Anyways, we still text every day, exchange memes on IG, etc..  


Now, I was also casually talking to someone else I matched with on an app for about a month, we'll call her Z, but hadn't met up due to scheduling issues.  Earlier last week we had planned to meet this past Saturday, and it was a date I would have definitely canceled if X and I ended up making plans for that weekend, but X isn't emotionally available and told me to live my life... so I went out with Z on Saturday.  We both got hammered and ended up sleeping together.


On Sunday, X texts me essentially saying that while she didn't think it would be a great idea to rush into something super serious right now with her situation, she'd still be down to hang out.  If I hadn't hooked up with Z the night before, I would've instantly agreed, but I ended up telling her it's something I'd have to think about and she was understanding.


I am way, way more into X than I am Z, and I'd really like to see X again.  However, I'm torn on if I should tell her that I went out with/slept with Z.  I know X and I weren't/aren't dating, but I do think X would be hurt if she found out.


Apologies for the wall of text, hope that all made sense.

30,rfua87,1639441042,Family/friends always judge me(29M) for people I'm seeing because of attractiveness,"I was a late bloomer and didn't have a relationship till the end of college. I was just always a very awkward person and it took me a while to get social.

In grad school I started to maintain my look a bit more and exercised a lot, so people started to compliment me. As I got older it just spiraled, and most people I know do refer to me as very handsome/attractive. My friends even make fun of me because I'm so oblivious to advances from women.

However, recently I've been in the dating scene and I feel like family/friends won't accept anything but the absolute best and will mock me for being with people ""below"" me. If they aren't a doctor and a model I get judged for being with them. They say you can do better, and she really isn't that good looking, or you can have anyone you want, or I hope she a good career. In turn I feel bad for the girl, and then I start to question myself. It's gotten to the point where I have a very hard time maintaining interest in people I start seeing (handful of people in the past few years) because of the negativity. It's honestly kind of warped my opinions and I'm having hard time breaking out of it and committing to a longer relationship.

I know it sounds crazy, but it's gotten to the point where I feel like people aren't actually interested in ""me"", they are just interested in my looks and could care less about who I am. So that just amplifies the issues.

I know, boohoo for me and all the attention, but it really has been eating away at me. I shouldn't be worried about others opinions, yes, but it's just been nonstop for years.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rfua87/familyfriends_always_judge_me29m_for_people_im/

Life isn't pretty. I know many of you out there have had some struggles with medical issues affecting their dating life. Mental illness, addiction, homelessness, physical conditions, disabilities, etc. I'm determined to overcome it though, regardless if other people accept it or not.

We've talked about mental health before. I mentioned I had severe depression at one point and still take medications. 

My mental health was a complete shit-show. I was having severe mental illness symptoms for years. Lots of therapy, medications, hospitalizations, every psychiatric treatment possible. That hell came to an end last summer after receiving shock therapy. I've been living a relatively normal and independent life since then. I consider my symptoms to be in full remission and I haven't had a significant episode in 1.5 years.

My assumption is that this comes across as a lot of baggage. However, I don't feel it is affecting my life anymore. Building a long-term relationship with someone is part of me moving on from it.

Is this the best way to phrase this?

The answer is to simply date but what gets me is that finding the right girl will take a while. Who knows how long it will take too. Not sure if I should keep waiting because even if I do try to date, I might ruin it by wanting sex frequently.

To be accurate, it feels like it's always winter and never Christmas. My fiancé cheated several years ago and ran away with some rich guy. Before she left, she called me fat, ugly and shamed me for being poor... I was in college, and it was hard to go through, especially when it's the day you graduate and the day before your first job interview. I ran away from my city as a I couldn't handle to see my medically ill parents feel sad over my breakup. After all, as a kid we grew up homeless. I worked since I was six, selling food in the streets that my family made to survive and buy them medications. Being dirt poor has always been part of my childhood. The fat part came later in life during the end of high school when I graduated (with honors and fluency in 3 languages albeit), I took it upon myself to put my brother through college and take the family out of poverty. Worked 2 full-time jobs with one being a night shift and one additional full time internship on the weekends. I ate, ate and ate. The only way to run on 3 hours of sleep were energy drinks and fast food. I got big from that. Anyways, I ran to Russia as in college I learned it as a fourth language along with other degrees. At the heat of the moment, I started experiencing abnormal pain. Doctors feared it could be cancer as there was a mass needing biopsy. Never told anyone, and I'm glad I did. It came out negative but the fear and anxiety was still there. In Russia, I felt happy. Made many friends, was living comfortably. But then came my ex, sent me a random email saying she was in Russia also and needed a place to stay that night. Of course, I got excited. I thought she wanted to get back together and flew all the way to Russia to see me. NOPE! she came to see the city, her boyfriend couldn't make it and decided to stay with me at my house. My inner peace was ruined from that psychopath. Later the pandemic hit, and I flew back home. I decided to make a big change.. Moved east, worked out a lot. Build a good physical presence, worked hard to get a job where I worked with world leaders on a daily, and made a nice friend group.  Despite it all, I still feel sad, alone, and under-appreciated. Felt something again recently for a new girl but she immediately called me ""bro"" ""dude"" and ""pal"" after I gave her a Christmas gift. Not to mention, I dressed up to deliver it to her, but essentially made me ship it via mail although we live in the same city. Im never creepy, or anything with potential girlfriends. I guess Im just ugly. I think I have a kind heart, and work hard to be a good guy - at least that is what every girl says before completely rejecting me. But if anything life has taught me..

I (f,24) am out of 4 year old relationships. This has been a very serious ones, we were engaged and publicly very official. 

So first years of relationships with my ex, he was in the university for some program and had a group of classmate with whom he’d hang out, around 15 people. He wasn’t close with everyone but there were sometimes big gatherings where everyone would come and spend some time together. 

There was a guy (let’s call him B) with whom my ex was an acquaintance but never friends. We all (my fiancé brought me to the events, as many people would bring there significant other) hang out maybe 4 times. Including once when we went to this (B’s) house for a big barbecue party. Me and him were never flirty, max of what we could do was some friendly small talk, I did kind of like him but I’d never cross the line as I was in relationship. Even for my fiancé it was never more than that, they never hang out one to one.  

He was on my fb page and would like any of  pics I post but many good acquaintances are this way. Then, when we broke up I got on dating apps. Once I saw that this guy was on bumble and that he gave me a like. Then I also was on tinder, saw him and gave him a like too. It was a month ago when we matched. A month after he He messaged me :”Am I wrong or we have met some time before?”. 

I honestly didn’t expect him to message and I decided to go with a joke too. I said: “not sure, but I’m getting a feeling we might have met before” , he’s like : “ abc  bar in xyz location possibly?” I’m like “most likely”. And final was that he’s like “ wanna meet for a drink over the weekend and talk about it?” And we set the meeting. So basically everyone understands everything but it’s all been a joke manner :D 

I’m thinking whether it’s okay to go out with or is it too much including the fact they never were friends and I like him and could give it a chance to talk and see how it goes? I feel that it is. But I mean, I’m also shocked by the guys move as he was also just friendly with me always but would he invite me knowing all prior history if he was like really interested?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rfwyet/a_date_with_an_acquaintance_of_an_ex/

Over the summer, he opened up to me that he struggles with anxiety and it wasn’t a big dramatic thing; he simply admitted it to me. 

I recently found out that I was the only one he told and I don’t understand why. He has so many other people in his corner. Why would he as a guy have just told me? And only me? Im not special or important

56,rfx8w7,1639450128,Are there any social events dominated by single women looking for relationships?,"It's well understood that dating apps, bars, and clubs are dominated by men. So, what are the women doing? Are there places and events dominated by single women (who are looking for male partners) in an equivalent fashion? Or is there simply no equivalent because even single women who want to find partners are overwhelmingly more likely to remain in spaces and participate in events that aren't accessible to men? (or at least, tend to congregate in events where they would resent being approached-- I see plenty of single women at church, for example, but I'd obviously never approach women there.)

For example, on posts where men ask women for dating advice, women tend to suggest dance classes. And to be fair, dance classes *are* dominated by women. But my impression is that women at dance classes are women who want to learn how to dance, not women who are consciously making themselves available on the dating market. Compare that to a singles bar or upscale nightclub, for example, where women expect (even if they don't necessarily welcome) advances.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rfx8w7/are_there_any_social_events_dominated_by_single/

64,rfxk92,1639451087,Are most people in relationships just settling or am I doing something horribly wrong?,"I’ve posted in this sub before, but this past weekend it occurred to me that millions and millions of people are in relationships all over the world. Meanwhile a rather handsome guy like myself with an endearing personality is struggling to make one single connection of mutual interest. 

For context I’m early thirties mixed black male who has a full-time job, my own place, nice car, I workout 3-5x a week, cook, go hiking, rock climbing, join local meetup groups and consider myself very out going, easy to get along with, witty and approachable. Despite feeling so confident and in a good spot in life I cannot for the life of me find one mutually interested woman to date. I’ll go out on dates every once in a while and they just never go anywhere. Either I like her and she doesn’t like me or she likes me and I don’t like her, it’s never mutual. 

This made me beg the question to myself which is whether or not people who are in relationships are just settling and making it work with the wrong person. 

I don’t consider myself picky at all. All I’m looking for in someone is obviously mutual physical attraction, a woman who’s emotionally mature with a good sense of humor…that’s it. I don’t spend all my time scoping out for red flags and finding some imaginary perfect woman, I just want someone who enjoys a good mix of athletic activities and sitting inside binding movies and playing board games…you’d think I was asking for a million dollars finding one person. 

Here I am at 30 years old and I’m the only person I know who’s single in my personal life. I try to make new single friends, but surprisingly it’s actually pretty hard. Im not desperate for a relationship with the wrong person, but I feel like at this point in my life I should of been able to find at least one woman I’m compatible with to date; but I haven’t despite the fact I’ve been bettering myself physically, mentally and emotionally for the last 5 years I’ve been active in the dating scene. 

Here I am having never been in a relationship before but here I am never have been in one in my entire life and idk why. Hell I don’t even rely solely on dating apps, I’ve even just asked a woman out from the gym and got rejected, asked a woman out I met at a comedy show and she wasn’t single etc etc. I’m never the luck one 🥲",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rfxk92/are_most_people_in_relationships_just_settling_or/

Stacy makes all these reasons why she'd never eat there essentially saying why they'll never go to one together. Jack accepts this. But then they break up, and Jack sees Stacy at a seafood restaurant on Instagram with her new boyfriend.

The real life example that resparked this question for me is seeing that Jeezy got his current wife pregnant, but apparently in the last long term marriage she was in she told her husband she didn't want kids and never would. This woman and Jeezy haven't even been together long.

A closer example is in high school. I had a friend who's girlfriend would make a lot of claims about all the things she's not allowed to do due to her parents. Eventually they broke up, she got a new boyfriend, and now she's doing the exact same shit she said she couldn't do.

What causes this? It never seems like a change of heart or a shifted perspective. Every time I see this it's like Person A makes a lot of claims that Person B learns to accept, -claims that are seemingly only a matter of ""i can't/would never""- then when Person A gets in a new relationship they go against all of the claims they made in relatively no time at all.

Either way, fast forward some time and I have her back in my life again after a lengthy relationship on her end.

Not only do I not have a chance with her, I’m more like a backup for her. 

Someone to complain about her day to and give her attention.

She already admitted that I could be gone today and she wouldn’t mind. 

Now I don’t fault her for this response to my behavior cause I was seriously a Bad Guy to her in the past but did I fuck this up so bad that it can’t be repaired going forward?

Most of the people at work are elder than me, and I only have 1 good friend who lives in a different state. I have also not been in a relationship for 4 years now.  Yes, I know I am young and will have many friends/opportunities in the future, even if I move to a new job, etc.

However - I met someone (let's call her Abby 21F) at college, and we have been going out on about 8 ""friendly"" casual outings/dates (movies, dinners, etc.) past 3 months. I made sure she is not going out with anyone or has a boyfriend. So I now have a crush on her and really want to ask her on a ""real"" date, but fear losing her as a friend since she is now my only 2nd good friend who shares similar goals, likes, and dislikes.

We haven't texted in 2 weeks due to final exams week, but have asked her to let's go for dinner after exams, before Christmas. My friend from the different state has advised me to not look desperate and wait for her to initiate the next dinner planning since I have already raised her the question. According to him, if she remembers and reaches out first, it would show whether I am a priority or just another friend. If she doesn't reach out, then just move on and forget about her :-(

If she does reach out and we go on the dinner, I am thinking of two situations:

1. I can be direct and straight-up confess my emotions, knowing that I might still be in friendzone. If the answer is yes, good. If no, that's the end. I say: ""Thank you for your honesty, and I respect your decision. We made some really good memories, and as much as I still want to be friends with you, I think it would be unhealthy to see each other since nobody wants to be an option nor be in a 1-sided love. You have a bright future ahead, it's just sad that I wouldn't be a part of it. Anyways you have my contact, if you ever change your mind, reach out"".
2. I can give her a hypothetical story, pretending to get her opinion/advice on a ""friends""/my relationship situation - who met someone and is now in love with this girl he is going out. He thinks he might still be in the friend zone, and if the girl says no, he fears losing her as a friend. The reason I came up with this idea is because obviously if she's smart, she will get the hints that its our story. Regardless, her response to this hypothetical story would give me an idea of whether I should break out the main question or continue as a friend. If the latter, it would surely hurt, but selfishly, I would at least still get to go out with her to the events and places I like. At least until I find someone else romantically.

79,rfyghs,1639453906,Self-Respect in dating -especially through Dating Apps,"Hi r/dating community, thanks for taking the time to read my post.  It’s a bit lengthy, but I’ll do my best to be descriptive yet brief:

I. Connection on Hinge:

- A month ago I connected with a woman on Hinge.  We’re both in our late 20’s and it turns out we had a lot of interests in common.  She ended up offering me her phone number and we began texting.

II. First date / meet up :

- A week later, we went on a date at her favorite wine bar.  I bought a wine of her choosing, and she brought burritos.  We chatted and had a great time - felt easy, no pressure.  Now, we agreed to meet up again in another two weeks. She had to get a surgery due to a torn ACL - this is where it got complicated.

III. Patience :

- Given how such a procedure is unprecedented, I empathized with her and recognized that this could be challenging (ad I learned, it is for her).  I did my best to listen to her concerns, and show support where I could.  We continued to text for the 2 weeks since our first meeting, and everything seemed great.

IV. Date 1.5 :

- Since I knew how she’s been feeling, I decided to get her a bouquet of her favorite flowers, a bottle of wine for her to enjoy after she’s completed her meds, and I brought food from her favorite food truck.  We hung out at her house (she’s recovering from the procedure), and I listened as she expressed her anxieties and concerns. That aside, the food was good and we had a great time playing board games.  Though, her meds made her sleepy and she decided to take a nap- she politely asked me to leave and thanked me for everything 


V. The fall :

- A handful of hours go by and I received a text message from her.  She apologized for being so abrupt and tired, but then told me this: 

“I know this is not what you want to hear, but I don't feel the chemistry between us and would rather be upfront with you, seeing as you're a kind and thoughtful person. Thank you again for the flowers and for coming out today, I hope you have some joyful holidays. “

Of course, being a reasonable person, I understand.  Though, seeing as :

A) We only spent a few hours together

B) We both are getting to know each other (4 hours isn’t nearly enough time for any sort of relationship be it a friendship etc.)

C) The message seemed decisive -

So I opted to call her.

I wanted to learn more - why suddenly decide to drop me? Did I do something or not do something? Is it the timing?  Does she think I’m overly interested in her?

VI. The Call - Being appropriately composed yet confrontational :

- I gave her a phone call - You could tell she didn’t expect it by the tone of her voice.  While remaining composed, and by probing with open ended questions, I found out that :

A) she assumed I was extremely into her, yet felt no chemistry

B) Her surgery and recovery are affecting her emotionally and physically more than I thought

C) She prefers to spend time with people she already trusts, and though she believes I have good intentions, she can’t muster the will yo get to know someone else


So I made my peace - I set the expectation and told her that while yes I’m interested in her romantically to an extent, I have absolutely no idea if we could ever have chemistry romantically, let alone as friends.  Truth is, as I’ve come to learn in my 28 years of life so far, any sort of relationship takes time.  Though I like her, I also do not feel the sort of chemistry she spoke of - but I could, that potential remains to be seen.

I empathized with her situation again, and kept an open mind- I proposed that, if she would like, we could continue texting and hangout after the holidays / when she’s recovered.  No expectations.

She said she’s sure she’s not into me romantically again, but did agree to chat more and hangout when she’s able so long as I was okay with it.  To which I am a-okay with.

What I take away from this experience is that it’s important to stay open-minded and to seek information with a cool mind and composure.  
This isn’t my first rodeo, and tbh, it’s crucial to have these conversations in person of able (phone sufficed here). 

I believe had I not, I would’ve let someone blatantly disrespect me with a decisive text.  As a person, I deserve an actual explanation.  Ghosting and blowing off people is wrong - the less we do of it, and the more we hold each other accountable, the better it can be.

We met up tonight for around 4 hours and had a very pleasant time drinking and chatting. I knew, of course, she was going to be here for a finite period. No big deal.

Before we left, she said she has a lot of free time for the foreseeable future. I’ll text her tomorrow, etc., but I’ve never been on a date with someone who’s in town for a short amount of time.

I don’t want to make any assumptions either. I feel very stupid asking this, but what should I expect if I see her again?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rfygze/i_had_a_great_date_with_a_girl_whos_visiting_for/

84,rfyqb0,1639454754,Got rejected again,"I’m a relatively attractive, 26yo woman. At least, I think I am and I manage to accrue matches on dating apps. But I haven’t been in a serious relationship, well, ever. I’m also still a virgin. 

Honestly starting to think something is wrong with me. I hate anyone I meet on an app (save for two people in 8 years) but nobody I like irl likes me back. The people who like me, I don’t like back. I just feel defective, watching all my peers get into relationships and get married, because lord knows that’ll probably never be me.

Got rejected yet again today. Trying not to take it personally, but at this point I don’t know how not to take it personally. I’m kind, working hard to improve myself, I cook really well, and I’m pretty constantly in a good mood irl. I’m pretty low maintenance I think and fairly easy to get along with, but every man or woman I’ve ever seriously liked has turned me down. 

Heartbreak sucks. Why do I keep putting myself out there when I know this is how it always goes?

I’m probably just ugly and nobody’s been bold enough to tell me so. Oof.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rfyqb0/got_rejected_again/

88,rfyy10,1639455443,What's considered appropriate physical contact when on first/early dates?,"So I (25M) have grown out of being an extremely awkward teenager and finally feel comfortable venturing out into the world of dating (if it matters I'm a straight male)

Only issue is that due to aforementioned awkwardness my experience in getting intimate with women is, *ahem*, limited (virgin, and only one sexual encounter 12 months ago. Only kissed one person. Not having had sex doesn't bother me, and I don't have any anxiety about it and would have it if the opportunity arose).

Question is, I don't know what physical contact us appropriate for dates - like what would be received as creepy, compared to indicating my interest. Given my lack of experience I tend to be way too careful as I don't want to make people feel uncomfortable

Any help/advice is appreciated!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rfyy10/whats_considered_appropriate_physical_contact/

Any advice?,"I went on a first date a few days a go and the man showed up with heavy foundation and his voice was very squirmish. I think he will be great to have as a friend but I wouldn't go out of my way to see him again. I don't like his eating etiquette especially during covid and he dates multiple of people.

My family doctor gave me a go a head to date as I have no active stds or any sexually transmitted diseases. 

I hate the feeling of meeting someone again. It's so tiring. To show up for the date. To make sure you look good. I used to love this but I think it's so expensive and tiring. Cause especially if you don't like the dude, you have to pay for yourself. 

And then you have to worry about drug use, exgfs, or stds.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rfyzpn/been_single_for_a_few_years_and_i_am_starting_to/

94,rfzf34,1639456969,Worried about getting rejected and making my job harder,"I(18f) am worried about asking out a guy(24m) I work with. I’ll call him N to be on the safe side. There’s a very obvious age gap. I’ve talked to friends and a close coworker about and no one really thinks it matters, but I’m worried cause when I was 17 I dated someone someone who was 19, and the 2 year gap alone created a weird dynamic in the relationship(granted, it was mainly cause that’s what he wanted to happen). 

I’ve work at an assisted living home since mid October. I mainly got the job because my mom works in the business office. They put me to work in the kitchen as a server/dietary aid. The first 2 weeks I worked there N was out sick. I heard the head cook, my boss, talk about about how much he values him. And the residents and my coworkers say plenty of racist remarks towards him. When I met him I didn’t really pay him much attention. He was helpful, hardworking, and we got out of work early when he was cooking so I liked working with him. 

One day everything just kinda clicked. He made some joke about a broken coffee pot but I barely remember it cause I caught myself just admiring him. I barely even knew what he looked like cause I’d never seen him without a mask on, but those eyes. 

We struggle with understanding each other sometimes. He has a very thick accent and most of my coworkers either brush him off or just pretend to understand him. Just nod until he stops talking. It makes me so mad. I feel horrible every time I ask him to repeat something, but it’s only cause I want to know for sure. He gets annoyed occasionally, which can be hurtful. But I understand. It must be annoying to not be understood. 

Enough of the fluff, I am at a bit of a tough point cause I want to ask him out but am unsure if I should, or how to do it. He is my supervisor. He’s older. He’s never expressed an interest in anyone to my other coworker’s understanding. I’m not sure if he even wants to date at all, so why me when I’m so young? Should I shoot my shot just to stop thinking about?

If I do ask him out, how do I go about it in a way that’s not only clear about my intentions, but it’s not so forward that working with N would be awkward? 

(TLDR: I want to ask out an older supervisor, but I don’t wanna make going to work a nightmare for myself.)",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rfzf34/worried_about_getting_rejected_and_making_my_job/
95,rfzg7e,1639457073,Move on or wait a bit?,"I [21F] met this guy [27M] on bumble 2 weeks ago. We’ve met up a couple of times and I’ve slept over at his place and he’s slept over at mine. I told him straight up that I’m looking for a serious relationship and he responded by saying his end goal is a serious relationship but he just got out of one that lasted six years. For the most part the relationship we have now is casual which I’m fine with bc I really enjoy his company and we haven’t discussed exclusivity. 3 nights ago he decided to stop by my place because he was in the area with some friends and he didn’t spend the night because he had work the next day. That night I asked him if he was still swiping on bumble, he said no. He then decided to tell me his mom is racist but his dad isn’t (dad is mixed) and I thanked him for telling me. I hadn’t heard from him all yesterday and then yesterday night I asked if he was coming to see me, no response. But I saw on Instagram that he was out and about, which is no biggie because he told me he usually goes long boarding on Sunday. Today I texted him “hey” and I get no response which is strange because even though I’m usually the one to text first,he usually responds immediately. So I’m not sure if i should wait another day or two or if I should just move on.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rfzg7e/move_on_or_wait_a_bit/

My question is... why? In general, what factors would make you approach a guy vs. let him come to you, like I normally had to do for years?

Is it about having welcoming body language? Is it something you'd only do after having a few drinks at the bar? Is this just a new set of rules for approaching? Or does it just come down to looks?

I'm doing this research so I (and other guys here) can learn what we should do to improve. Thanks in advance!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rfzm4d/for_women_what_would_make_you_approach_a_guy_vs/
