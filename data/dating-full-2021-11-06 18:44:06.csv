Would these be red flags to you?

\*On first date, said the night before they went to a swingers sex party as a plus one with someone they used to date, said he didn't partake. He said he was only there as it was couple's only, and she needed someone to bring.

\*Also bragged about getting 3 porn star phone numbers from a adult movie convention.

\*Asked twice if I was into women (I am not). The fact he brought it up again made me feel he didn't accept my own sexuality. His past partners, many were lesbians. He also had a threesome with his baby mama 2 years ago, who also was/is still a lesbian.

I really liked his personality, but I wanted to ask third party what they would of felt with the information given. I felt like he was being honest, but also, it felt heavy for a 1st date.

He's 38, and I just feel now his mind was so warped from porn. I am also looking for a relationship, and thought he was, too. Also, we were talking for a month before this, and none of this was mention, outside the fact his baby mama was/is a lesbian.

She got out of a relationship about 6 months ago and I have been divorced for about a year now and it feels like our dynamic has been changing recently – as in we are growing closer and closer. That being said, I’m not sure if I’m reading too much into it or if she has interest – at some point I will ask her but because of the age difference and having been out of the dating game for more than a decade I’m curious as to what others would think. For the record, the coworkers we are closest too seem to think she’s interested in me.

•	She’s become more physical with me. In the past, she used to touch my elbow to tease me about how cold her hands were. She likes playing with my arm hair or stroke my arm and sometimes when we’re talking, she’ll rest her legs on top of mine. Now when she gives me hugs, they’re no longer the friendly side hug, she comes up to me and presses herself against me, leaning her head on my shoulder or chest. She’ll randomly grab my hand and have me follow her to help with something. If I tell her my back hurts, she’ll give me a back rub or massage. When I’m sitting down and we’re talking, she leans up against me if she’s standing up. She starts a few hours earlier than I do, if I don’t hug her when I come to work, she says something like “excuse me, aren’t you forgetting something?” When her shift is over (a few hours before mine), she asks me to walk her to her car. If I’m not working that day, she walks alone and doesn’t have anyone else walk her up. 

•	When we’re assigned to different areas of our department, she’ll come and spend time with me in my area. She flirts with me and some of it is mildly sexual – she comes from a pretty traditional culture (Arab) and she’s told me she usually doesn’t flirt like that. She also doesn’t express emotions. For example, she went away recently and asked if I was going to miss her. When I said I was going to I also told her that she can tell me she misses me. She responded with “I don’t really express those feelings.” While she was away, we were talking and I said I might call off on the day of her return to work and she said “you better not, I miss you.” When I asked her about not expressing herself, she sent back a winky face.

•	Other guys at work try to flirt with her, she doesn’t really respond or just laughs it off. We talk about everything and text each other throughout the day. We always text each other “good night” and “good morning” even if we’ve had a day where we haven’t really texted. We call each other honey and sweetheart. She gets jealous when other girls at work try to flirt with me and will show me memes that say something along the lines of “when another girl flirts with your man that’s not your man” and has some random picture of an upset animal or something like that.

•	A few weeks ago, we were talking about going to lunch together and she was making super elaborate plans about where we’d go and what we’d eat, etc…and she ended it by saying “and we can call it a date.” Unfortunately, I had to cancel due to one of my parents being diagnosed with cancer. We’ve both been busy and haven’t had a chance to reschedule but will have some time next week. 

•	When we do certain tasks at work that we’re required to do every night, we do them together and I call them “work dates.” She always gets a quick little smile on her face when I do so. If I’m not around she’ll come find me and say “time for our date.” 

•	She sends me pictures of herself all the time. If she’s out of town, she’ll send me a picture of herself at the beach or having a glass of wine, or whatever. She was out of town for Halloween and sent me a picture of herself in her costume. She’ll send me videos of herself with her family – I’ve only met her brother and sister-in-law. I’ll send her pictures of places I want to go and she’ll say something like “take me there.” Or if I send her a picture and say that I’m going there alone, she’ll always – I mean every single time – say “no, we’re going together.”

There are a lot more things she does that shows she’s interested in me. We’ve hung out a few times, and I’d like to ask her out but I’m not sure how to go about making it clear that my intention is for it to be a date and not hang out as friends.

I’m not looking for comments regarding dating coworkers: our employer doesn’t care and neither of us reports to the other. If we were to date and things went south, it’s easy enough for me to transfer to another location that’s about 10 minutes closer to where I live. 

I’m also not looking for comments regarding the age difference. I’ve made jokes about our age difference, and she’s made it clear that she doesn’t care that I’m older than her. 

**tl;dr**: pretty sure co-worker/close friend is interested in me. We’ve hung out in the past, but want to make clear that next time we hang out I want it to be a date. How to go about doing so without being an awkward fuck.

Been dating a girl (22f) and we’ve been on 4 dates. They’ve all gone really well and we’ve both never had relationships or gone past 2 dates. Our previous date was us laying near the water stargazing and we ended up cuddling together and her telling me how comfortable and safe I make her feel, and on the way home we talked about what we wanted to do for the 5th date and then we had a longer than usual goodbye hug.

Here is where I am lost ;__;
On Monday she asked to rain check our date (that was gonna happen this Sunday) until next week due to having a family event that she forgot about and having to get uni work prepared for when she starts on Monday. She was also out of state all this week with her girlfriends on a vacation and got back Friday night. We used to text all the time for the first 2 weeks and she used to initiate most of them and send me good mornings etc. We date once a week due to our busy schedules and live nearly 50 mins apart. Between the 3rd and 4th date the texting was still there, but no where near as much. Now ever since she went on holiday and told me about the rain check that I mentioned above, she hasn’t said like anything to me :/ 

I don’t think she’d ghost me as on our 3rd date she asked me about my past dates and I told her about how a girl lead me on for weeks cause they couldn’t tell me that they didn’t wanna go out anymore and she thought that was really wrong and told me that the guys she’s been out with in the past that didn’t work out she told that she wasn’t interested. 

I’m so confused and lost on what to do. We still haven’t picked a day for our date this coming week and I was thinking about calling her tomorrow night (Monday night) and seeing what happens out of that. I’ve never rung her before either.

I’ve just grown completely dissillusioned with dating and have increasingly started to believe that love is not going to happen for me.

I’m 27, gainfully employed funny outgoing and kind. I’m very average looking (bald at 27 lol) and not somewhat that would turn any heads. I’ve been in one relationship in my life during 2020 and it lasted 7 months before she dumped me.

Ever since it’s become pure drudgery in the dating market. It’s all one off dates that go absolutely nowhere. Usually ends after one date and a ghosting.

I just got my stupid hopes up one last time today and met with someone who was really cool. I felt we were really hitting it off until i broached the idea of a second date. I got a long winded answer saying basically she doesn’t want to waste my time and she doesn’t know what she’s looking for…. 

I naturally turn a critical lense to myself. Is there something wrong with me? Am I not attractive enough? Weird in person? I rack my brain to figure out what my problem is. 

I’ve officially lost the fun of dating and it’s become drudgery. I’m about ready to delete my apps and give it all up. 

Problem with that is… without apps I’ve never successfully secured a date. It’s become even harder since I’m not in school. Deleting hinge and the rest means I’m deleting dating from my life.

Should I do it? Delete it all? The crappy dates are starting to wear on my self worth.

Sometimes we have something really meaningful we want to say to our partners, for example telling them about a life-changing experience, but when we put our thoughts and feelings into everyday words, it doesn’t sound all that special, a lot of that meaningfulness is left behind.

Ultimately, I want to explore how people can sometimes talk without losing any of that meaning, and what exactly hinders their communication most of the time.

The results of all of my research are going to be used in the making of an animated short film.

On snapchat, if you don't know, when you add someone, it says how you added them. For example, I had to search her username, so she'll know that I've done that.

I ( 22M ) wanna ask her out to dinner or coffee or something but I’ve found myself to be a bit timid around women I find attractive lately.

I do not want this to sound egotistical at all but I have been told before that I’m a handsome guy. I work retail and occasionally have girls give me their numbers. My coworkers joke about sending the “pretty boy” to the sales floor to stock. I don’t typically have a problem getting dates.

However, I’m still crazy timid before approaching women I find attractive. What makes it especially bad this time is that we go to a small college and the class we have together is very small (like 8 students). I’m worried about being rejected and having to awkwardly finish out the semester with her there. I also am a huge over thinker. I over analyze everything. We’ve texted twice but the conversations didn’t last more than maybe 5 minutes, and I’ve second guessed everything I said to her even though it was all about our class and none of it was flirtatious. 

I’m good at relationships but subpar with dating if that makes sense. I want to play it safe so I don’t come off as overbearing but not too safe so it seems like I don’t care. I suppose I just need advice on initiating a conversation with her to eventually ease my way into asking her to coffee or dinner?

Anyway, I didn’t want to pry or anything and so I just told her I was sorry to hear and said to call if she needed someone to talk to.

Fast forward to yesterday afternoon, she texted me about hanging out in our friend group last night. She told me that the rest of the girls knew about her break up (I’m the only guy in this group fwiw) so I at least knew everyone knew about it when we got together. She called me about two hours before we were all expected to hang out and told me that she would talk more about it when she saw me in person and were together. 

Anyway, I went over to one of the girls houses prior to us all hanging out and this particular girl (Katie) is one that I’m interested in courting and so her and I were together. The others ended up canceling due to other commitments that came up last minute so it ended up just being me and Katie so it was kind of like an unofficial date. I called the girl who had the break up and told them everyone else canceled but that me and Katie were still planning to go out and so I invited her to come with us. She initially said that even though Katie and I are not actually a couple, she would feel awkward being around us because she’d feel like a third wheel. I told her I understood but still encouraged her to come with us so she could clear her head a bit. 

Long story short, she decided to come along, so Katie and I went over to her place to pick her up. Shortly after, I asked ‘so tell me what happened’… I assumed it was safe to ask since the other girls already knew and she had told me we’d talk once we got together. Anyway, she became uncomfortable after that and later told me she was taken back that I’d ask about her breakup in front of Katie and said the whole night was uncomfortable for her and that she felt awkward. I heavily apologized and said I didn’t mean to make her feel uncomfortable, as I thought it was safe to ask considering Katie knew and she also told me we’d talk once her and I were together in person. 

Do you think Katie would’ve thought I was a jerk for asking about our friends breakup? And was I in the wrong to ask about it? Bear in mind we’re all close friends, so I didn’t think it was the wrong time to ask. I told Katie afterward that I felt bad bringing that up but thought it was safe and she didn’t seem like it was a big deal and kind of brushed it off.

TLDR; I brought up a break up with one of our mutual friends and it made the whole night out feel awkward.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1124217,public,self,Did I 25M screw up badly?

I’d say we’ve been good friends for two years but I understand that he is now single - we’ve also been talking a lot more lately. 

We had a drink last week and I cannot seem to A/ get him out of my head and also B/ wonder whether he felt the chemistry too. 

There was a lot of looking into each other’s eyes, talking about more intimate stuff (family, plans for future…) - a step up from what we usually do and talk about. We’ve also texted EVERY SINGLE DAY since. We did not even have anything interesting to tell each other, we just would not let the conversation die. And talking so much is definitely unusual in our relationship (or any of my friendships in general, save for maybe one very best girlfriend). 

I know why I kept the conversation going (he’s on my radar since last week) and I’m thinking that he would not keep chatting « just be cause » either as it is not something we usually do ? We’ve spent two years being great friends and sometimes not talking for weeks. 

If it had been a drinks with any other guy I would consider it a complete first date success. But because we’re friends and friends do see each other for drinks, I wonder whether it’s all in my head. 

Should I just be bold and ask him out again (and just go for it if we have another drink soon) ?

We met each other at the hospital 4 years ago. I had attempted suicide. She doesnt know why I was there yet. I think it is time to tell her.  


I developed a crush on her after about 3 weeks at the hospital. I stayed there with her for 9 months. I couldnt kiss her though because I was really unlucky with getting infected by an antibiotic resistant bacteria which put me in quarantine for 4 months.  


I lost contact with her completely since she left the hospital before me. But I had her number. So when I got out of the hospital, I called her. She told me she honestly never expected to see me again after the hospital but we caught up where we left it at.  


Chatted about everything for hours on end and we probably went on somewhere around 20 dates before we eventually kissed,  


Then we were together in a long distance relationship for a year or so. It never quite worked out. I visited her but she had mental issues like PTSD and anxiety for large crowds, social anxiety etc. It didnt appear so but it made her quite immobile so all my plans on going on vacations and what not never worked out.  


So even though she is a fantastic person. Much more than she realizes herself, I cant be with her anymore. We never broke up. It just gradually transitioned from a relationship and back to a friendship again.  


We are still in a grey area but it seems like we both have realized that I have come further in my recovery than her. She says that she envies my ability to just go out and meet new friends, study, work out and that I am actually going places.  


I am telling her that I believe she can do a lot more than she thinks and that I believe in her. And she is supporting my visions for the future but she dont think she can join me.

We made great conversation and had so much in common! Conversation was effortless, and for me that is HUGE because I tend to be a very shy/reserved person who can take more than a few dates to open up. But on this date, I totally felt like I could just be myself. I feel like we were both very comfortable around eachother: we flirted, shared laughs, and had loads of fun.

On the date, he mentioned more than once (with no suggestion from me) how much he wanted to see me again. I agreed, and so we made tentative plans (I unfortunately had an obligation the following weekend), but it seemed like a sure thing.

However, days have passed...and it's been dead air from him, despite a fleeting text exchange. He had told me on our date he would like to text and talk on the phone. I let it rest (we had a very long date), but after a day or so texted him and asked if he wanted to chat. He said he was busy, and I haven't heard from him since.

This has obviously made me think, what could have gone wrong? And I honestly can't think of a lot, except there wasn't really a ""spark."" While we got along and enjoyed eachother, I honestly did find him a bit boring at times. I'm not sure why this is, because he is an exciting person who has lived a pretty colorful life, as have I....but he was just a little...boring? I wonder if he felt the same about me? There were a couple core issues I am really passionate about (when I say issues, think interests/hobbies) that he showed complete disinterest/almost aversion to - so that kind of bummed me out and made him a bit ""boring"" to me I guess.

Which leads me to ask these questions: *Is* there such thing as a spark? Were we missing a chemistry spark? Is that why he hasn't asked me out again?

I'll admit - I'm not terribly upset that he hasn't asked me out again, the date was fun for what it was. What I am more concerned about is that I have been on a string of dates now that have followed a similar pattern. Things seem to go well, but the guy never follows up for a second date. This date went way better than any date I've been on recently, though, so I find it particularly strange.

What does everyone think? All feedback is welcome.

I have this “cycle” that I have finally decided that I need to break, hence me just recently beginning therapy.

I usually meet someone, we get to know each other 1-3 weeks, then maybe we go on dates or get closer. We then reach a “high point” of them saying how they see a future with me, promising me stuff, being affectionate, calling me pet names and giving me attention.

Then, 3-6 months in, they start to withdraw either from not being over their ex or over what their ex did to them or claiming that they are not ready to settle down/want to “focus on themselves” or see other people.

I’m really tired of getting burned like this and continuing to fall for the same people and repeating cycles. Are there any books, advice, or any materials to help people like me who have this issue? I always end up feeling bad about myself and like I’m not good enough when things ultimately fail.

For me, I avoid pregnancy and practice safe sex by asking my partners to wear condoms. I've never been pregnant ever, even after I got off the pill, so clearly it does the damn job. 

I told him what my preferred method is, and when he said how we expect to practice safe sex, I said via condom use. Alternatively, one can get a vasectomy which can always be reversed. Not too different to a woman having a coil implanted, right? 

He got pretty upset at this. He crossed his arms and legs, the smile disappeared. He said this is something he feels very seriously about, as well as some of his male friends. Apparently condoms are temporary measures, used for casual sex. When it comes to a woman you want to date seriously, in order to feel super intimate and close with her, apparently unprotected sex is a big part of that (following sexual health tests).

When I find attractive women online(after covid struck and I've been focused on my uni studies so i haven't had no luck on having dates with women, and my biggest power is my personality so I don't think i can reveal this at once when i meet women).

Whenever I showed up about me online, the women messaged me back were curious and wanted to know about me. And whenever I say I'm a man, they suddenly ghost me.
Some had troubles with her ex, and had kids. Well as i'm finding my future wife, this makes me uncomfortable. So i'm out.

I've been even desperate and saw women's pictures on bisexual/lesbian subreddit.

Plus, whenever they wanted to see me after telling about me, i show them my pictures. And they ghost me. And they even say you are not attractive and you are asian.(...Wow)
Yeah. I am an ESL. I learned English like in 3 years to read, write, and speak. I deal with English in an academia ALL THE TIME.

I do workout a lot. I am tall. 5'11"". I go to university clubs to meet people. Yes. I always strives to find my possible partner. I dress well a lot. I do use skin care routine cosmetics. I buy nice perfume.
I do have online apps more than 5. Tinder, okcupid, bumble, badoo, etc.
I can't go to the bar cuz of covid issues. It is not over yet.
And I don't drink.

I've been busy and so stressed due to the workload required from the university. The uni i am attending to is always in top 10 in the world, supressing its students to study all the time(this is not the point that i am complaining about rn.)

Finally, this made me conclude am i just suicide? Nobody wants me.

Oh. I'm correcting my previous statement.

'Some' girls wanted me. And i don't want them and they don't attract me.
This is the real problem. There are woman who likes me but i don't like them. And there are attractive women, but it seem they don't like me.

All from online dating. Its the first time in a long time that I've jumped back into dating. Almost all dates I felt nothing. Even if I had feelings before I keep getting rejected. This girl is different and its really throwing me off. 

So quick story. It was so difficult meeting up it took us a month of chatting before we finally had a first date. She was soo nice. It was the best date I had been on. But I've built up a hesitancy to believe someone is interested in me. I was thrown off by how interested she seemed. It took me off guard and kind of made me freeze. She played with her hair, touched my shoulder,  gave eye contact. 2nd date scheduled friday. 

So friday.. Almost a week away. I'm suddenly overthinking things I think. Like we texted some today and Im kind of not sure what to say anymore. She actually called me up for like 5min today to basically say sorry for forgetting to text me something earlier that she said she would. She wanted me to know that she wasnt ghosting me. 

I think I set good first impression because I was literally on a vacation to a national park which made for easy conversation and I sent her pictures. Now our conversations are back to reality so things will get more interested to see if we are actually compatible. I have this annoying fear that once people actually get to know me they wont like me. 

I think Im falling for a trap I've been in before. When I catch feelings my brain runs wild. I go from depressed to happy throughout the day. My mind quickly will focus on this one person even if I have other girls in my dms. 

I want to see if she would like to call instead of text sometime. If that okay after a first date or should I keep things casual over text?  


Im just worried im going to self-sabotage.

3. Says she doesn't like sex but will please her man  
4. doesn't seem very lovey-dovey in the slightest  
5. If asked about 5M bucks if someone handed it to her, would say take it and says no. No strings attached.   
6. Doesn't understand or like most humor or jokes  
7. When talked to, she comes off as if she doesn't understand or wonders why you asked that  
8. When we chat it feels like she doesn't understand my train of thought  


so I asked her what she sees in me, I truly want to know, I don't get it. She won't tell me or she doesn't have an answer to why she likes me so much.

What is dating?

  


My mindset seems to focus on dating as something entirely other than yourself. Insofar as we are seeking for something we want. Ultimately, what is the goal of dating - are we all vying for best options for procreation?

  


Modern dating seems to be very superficial and shallow and it is based on likes and dislikes. This is the premise of all online dating that has ever existed.

After getting some solid pics and paying for premium (lame I know), Ive been getting lots of matches and dates. I live in a big city and probably go on an average of like 2 dates a week. I like it to some extent because the girls are usually awesome and I enjoy their company. As far as I can tell, our dates go super well. They laugh at my jokes, we talk for hours, and we end up making out like 99% of the time. Despite this, whenever I text them after our date I’m either ghosted or hit with a “I had a nice time, but I don’t see this going anywhere.” As things get colder, I def would like something a bit more stable but I don’t know what I’m doing wrong on these dates? I have pretty good social awareness so I feel like I’d know if i was doing something overtly turning them off. At first I thought I was being too needy, so I stopped complimenting my dates. The I thought that they maybe weren’t attracted to me, but lots have told me how cute they think I am. Then I felt that I was maybe being too sexual too fast, so I stopped making out with them during the dates. Despite all my adjustments, I still face this issue.
