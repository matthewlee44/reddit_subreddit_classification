Thank you to everyone who contributed, I think that was a very honest and compassionate discussion. I did a bunch more independent research and talked to a doctor as well. I was asked for an update so here it is. 

I am going to pursue a relationship with her. Here’s why.

First, she was honest. She was terrified, but told me on the second date. She had been married for over 20 years, and then slept with one man.  She felt devastated and worthless. She had also grown up in a conservative religious tradition and that compounded everything for her, but she had the courage and integrity to look me in the eye and tell me. That kind of makes her a badass and a catch. My ex cheated, so honesty is important. Also, since so many asked, I have had a full test  after finding out about the affair, and included herpes. I do not have it. 

Second, from what I’ve read the risks are not much greater if you are with a diagnosed person who is on medication and is sensitive to their body and understands outbreaks than if you are with a random undiagnosed person who might have it and not know. Doctor confirmed this.  I am not a guy who sleeps with someone early into a relationship. Months, not days or weeks. So I broke a potential future out into three segments. Bear with me, I’m a bit of an analytical geek. First, a couple of months of not having sex. Ok, no problem! Second, having sex in a committed LTR. There is like a 1% chance *per year* of me getting it if we are safe. So then say it would be at least 2 years before committing to a marriage with someone. So there is a 2% chance of me catching a not that bad thing, all while in a long term committed relationship. Third, marriage. If marriage came, I would still take precautions, but because the disease isn’t that bad and it’s really about the stigma and possible impact on other potential relationships, I really wouldn’t care as much at that point. If having 1% chance per year of contracting something that gives me a small chance (most don't have symptoms) of occasionally having a minor rash is the only cost of finding the right person, I’m in. 

Third, It really does seem like the disease isn’t that bad. I had the ‘scare you into abstinence’ sex ed as a kid, and then was married 17 years so never thought about it. As I said, I’m not one to jump into sex early, so I really didn’t need to reassess my thinking about STDs until she told me about this. Most people are asymptomatic, and even the symptoms are controllable and not that bad. For most with symptoms it’s a rash and uncomfortable for a few days. Big deal. It sounds like it was made into a big deal by a media scare in the 70’s and 80’s. I can’t help but think there were people who were gleeful about scaring people (and shaming women in particular) into not having sex who were pushing this. This woman was raised in a conservative culture where women’s sexuality was repressed at best, viewed as whorish at worst. That shit is *so* damaging to women. Be pretty and feminine! But don’t be a whore! Never think sex thoughts! Make sure you please your husband! Pass.  

Anyways, even after saying all of that I am still actually a little nervous. It is hard to change something that you’ve been afraid of your whole life. But, aren’t there things in any relationship to be nervous about? Gotta just push through it and do what I think is right.

Since I was 25, I've been with 2 men- one was my husband (together 15 years), one was my boyfriend (together 3 years).

These men were different in many ways, but I feel that in the end, it was like I was with the same guy.  I rarely received compliments, I did not feel beautiful to either of them, and felt almost like they were jealous of me instead of appreciating that I was fit and healthy (they both gained weight and had some physical injuries but I still found each of them beautiful).  The intimacy diminshed over time with no effort nor interest on their parts to do anything. I carry a lot of shame for wanting to be physically and emotionally expressive with my partner as a result.  


Husband- He was affectionate and loving but rarely wanted sex, it was always very distant, he got so defensive when I asked if we could explore anything whatsoever other than 'status quo'. Never wanted to be intimate in the light.  He would look at me as  thought I repulsed him frequently, it was awful- but we never spoke about it b/c I didn't know how to process this, other than asking him if he was still attracted to me, and he would say yes (but no action).

Boyfriend- the sex was great, and at first it was more intimate: kissing, looking in the eyes, etc. He was like a dream come true for about a year. But as we got closer and more familiar in real life, the sex became less intimate. He could not do emotional intimacy very well, got defensive at any intimate talk, deflected it, almost like an awkward teenager who didn't know what to do.  


I realize that a top need I from partnership is exceptional physical and emotional intimacy. By exceptional I mean, that I want someone who can look me in the eyes and smile, who will kiss my forehead, who will hold me for no reason at all, who will at time wrap his arms around me from behind and kiss my necks/shoulder, etc. Someone who feels free to express his love to me.  


I want someone who has a sex drive that matches (or close) to mine, and who can be playful and actually LOOK AT ME when we have sex and not make me feel like I'm a stranger when I even try to confront that issue.

I want someone who lights up when they see me, at least some of the time. I get that this won't happen every day or in the midst of stress, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Where I'm at now is that I have serious doubts I'll ever get this. I feel like both men showed me one side at the beginning that ended up not being the case as time went on. How can I trust myself when I feel like things are going to be good when I'm 2 for 2? I was friends with both of them first (I move slow).  We had explicit talks about intimacy multiple times, and I was told  things that made me feel we were in alignment.  When my boyfriend starting seeming less loving to me after being more loving than I'd felt from any man before, it felt like sand slipping through my finders. How could all that have been an act. He used to look at me with this amazing, piercing gaze, hold my head in his hands and kiss me passionately. He was the first to bring up the ""L"" word, only to tell me later in in the relationship that he never said it to anyone  at this phase of his life unless he was going to get married (not true, I'd heard stories from him when we were friends about how he's pour his loving soul out to his ex).

I have a limiting belief that even if it looks like something amazing, it's just going to get taken from me, and/or that what I want is just not out there.

&amp;#x200B;

Am I being unrealistic and romanticizing middle-aged love? I know that not everybody needs or wants expressions of intimacy like this, but I guess I do, and I want to feel safe and supported in having my needs honored (and I want someone whose needs are congruent with mine).",True,False,False,datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,46147,public,self,Just venting and thinking 'out loud' - will I really get what I want in a relationship?

Long time lurker, first time poster in this sub. About a week ago I started chatting with a man who lives in my city, but who works out of town in oil and gas for two to three months shifts. Our conversations haven’t been terribly in-depth, mostly hi how is your day sort of thing, but yesterday he asked if I would wait to meet him when he returns at the end of June. My reply was yes, if I’m still single by then. He then replied, I’m looking for a relationship, are you just looking for a one night stand? It sounds like we’re looking for different things. 

My question to the group is this: is it a reasonable expectation for a man to expect a woman  he has just started talking and whose name he doesn’t even know - to “wait” or remain single or be celibate until he can meet her in two months? 

I know if I was working out of two for two months, and was chatting with someone sporadically whose name I didn’t know and whom I hadn’t met in person, I wouldn’t expect him to be single when I finally got home.

Here are some that stuck in my brain:

2. You won’t find someone if you’re addicted to the attention you get from dating apps

3. Time swiping &gt; Time on dates? = FOREVER ALONE

10. Treat yourself like crap? You’ll attract those who like to treat people like crap.

11. Dating is a learning experience. Rejection and failure are all in your head. Get over yourself! It’s not a rejection; it’s redirection!

13. If you don’t remember what they said on the date, you won’t know if they’re right for you. Pay attention and listen.

19. Don’t look like crap on the first date. First impressions count. Take a damn shower and trim those nose hairs.

22. Are you finger happy when it comes to swiping on dating apps? Enjoy the single life with your fingers.

23. Are you extra picky and judgemental? Go look in the mirror. You aren’t who you deserve.

24. Stop dating people you know aren’t right for you because you think you can change them. People aren’t your pet projects.

25. Think you can convince [them to like you](https://sumonsleeve.com/2019/03/how-to-think-straight-when-youre-dating-and-you-feel-like-youre-going-crazy.html)? You can’t. They don’t like you.

Is it ever a good idea?

We dated and really clicked but ultimately things did not work out for us at the time. There were major factors in our lives causing us to be incompatible, but now those factors have changed.

I recently reached out and he has been enthusiastically there for me and encourages me to continue to reach out to him. It seems he is really trying to let me set the pace of communication, though. While we ultimately agreed to end things, he was more so the one who did not want things between us to end. 

I’m realizing my feelings are still there for him and now that those factors have changed, I’d like to explore a potential relationship with him again, but I am unsure how to bring up the idea. At this point, we have only had text conversations since getting back in contact.

It’s been about 6 months since we broke up and we dated for around 10 months, if it matters.",True,False,False,datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,46208,public,self,Dating someone I have dated in the past?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/mz99an/dating_someone_i_have_dated_in_the_past/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

First thing first, you need to optimize your profile. Most women post pictures with the same facial expressions and do nothing special. You need a picture of you where you clearly see your face. You need to smile with your eyes in that picture and not just with your lips. It will make you look 100x more attractive. I have never met a woman that was happy and not attractive. Men are attracted to joy, not just physical beauty. I remember hanging out with a friend that I find more attractive than me. I received great news when I was with her and had the biggest smile on my face. When I started to smile two men who were together stopped what they were doing and looked at me as if I was the most precious thing. My friend looked at me and said “they’ve just fallen in love with you”. When a dude looks at you like this, it’s random. But when it’s two men at the same time, it means you are doing something right. From now on, stop worrying about being pretty enough. Worry about having enough joy in your life. When you are truly happy, you shine from within. 

You need another picture of you being playful. Post a picture of you in your halloween costume. Post another picture of you working out and one where we see your body shape. It doesn’t matter what it looks like, we are all someone else’s baddie. It’s true that looking like an Instagram model helps attract more men, but being attractive is not what makes men fall in love. We all have hot friends that have an amazing personality that get ghosted by men. Why? They don’t act like the prize and don’t do what I teach here. Doing what I teach here is what makes men fall in love. You don’t need all men to like you. You can only date one guy at a time. You will notice that just by practicing this, more men will want to date you. Femininity is truly powerful.

In your description, avoid sentences like “no hookups please”. It makes you sound very negative. I totally understand why you are sick of men who just want to sleep with you. Remember that you have all kinds of fish in the ocean. If a guy just wants to hookup, block him and move on to the next one.

Stay playful in your bio and say something like “my ideal date would be a leg day session followed by pizza”.

When you get a match, let him initiate contact with you. Men are very visual, if they find you attractive, they will message you. If he doesn’t initiate contact with you, all it means is that you were a “why not”. It’s not all black and white. Even for you. Some men are a “why not” others are “OMG! I want his kids”. Your first task when you meet any man is to figure out how interested he is in you. 0% interest means “she can die”, 100% interest means “I am madly in love”. You want a man whose interest in you is already at 80% when they look at you. Below that, you will have to work for his love, he will expect 50/50 in effort, money, and energy or worse, expect you to give him everything while he gives you bread crumbs.

When he messages you, say something playful like “Help me choose my nail polish color”. Men who are just looking for a hookup don’t like playful things like this. They want to go straight to the sex talk. This tip will help you weed them out.

After talking with them for a while, say “I am sick of texting, give me a quick call. I want to know if your voice is sexier than mine ;)”. Let him ask you for your number.

Once he messages you on WhatsApp, block him on the dating app. He should not see if you’re still on there talking to other men.

So I'm looking for some insight and perspective. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Why?**

&amp;#x200B;

Because I read the phrase, I start to imagine that she'll probably be too stubborn and refuse help.  Being so self-sufficient that she'll make me think that she isn't going to value me or the contributions I bring into a relationship. 

&amp;#x200B;

Don't get it twisted! I'm far from insecure. I value and appreciate a strong woman as much as any secure guy can. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, after spending almost 20 years with a ""hyper- independent"" woman and spending the better part of 3 years in therapy trying to undo the damage her ""independence"" caused where nothing I did was ever right or good enough and my contributions to the relationship didn't matter and she had to ""fix"" everything I'm a little gun shy.  Try living in a world where nothing about who you are or what you do is valued, that was my nightmare. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm looking for some insight and perspective.

**Why?**

Because I read the phrase, I start to imagine that she'll probably be too stubborn and refuse help. Being so self-sufficient that she'll make me think that she isn't going to value me or the contributions I bring into a relationship.

Don't get it twisted! I'm far from insecure. I value and appreciate a strong woman as much as any secure guy can.

However, after spending almost 20 years with a ""hyper- independent"" woman and spending the better part of 3 years in therapy trying to undo the damage her ""independence"" caused where nothing I did was ever right or good enough and my contributions to the relationship didn't matter and she had to ""fix"" everything I'm a little gun shy. Try living in a world where nothing about who you are or what you do is valued, that was my nightmare.

So I imagine there are a lot of strong women out there, I know more than a few of them myself, and most of you probably think that after reading this that I'm scared of strong women.

Met someone who sounded chill, but I ignored a couple of, frankly, orange flags. He was overly familiar and complimentary before meeting, and would veer into preemptive rejection territory (you’re so successful/pretty/blah, blah, blah, you would never want me). I’m not a particularly socially skilled person, so I would just say preemptive rejection makes me unable to tell if you’re interested, because I have no interest in some weird cycle of having to talk someone off the ledge all the time.

So...met, hung out for a couple of days, and it was pretty good, although he pushed a couple of boundaries that made me uncomfortable. Monday I got a text to have a heavy conversation. He claimed to be a Jeckyll and Hyde, and actually depressed and negative. Also said he’s not my man, and went more negative, to the point of insinuating he was suicidal. It didn’t sound genuine. I’ve struggled with depression, I’m sensitive to mental health struggles, it sounded like throwing the kitchen sink at a failed manipulation tactic. I immediately knew how this was going to go, because I’ve heard a variation of this on this forum, and DOT, a million times.

&gt;Person 1: comes on really strong. Makes big promises trying to get someone on board
&gt;Person 1: I just don’t have the capacity to love and give you what you need because I’m so broken inside, I always hurt everything I touch 
&gt;Person 2: I can help heal you, so you can love again
&gt;Person 1: I guess that would be ok
—-six months and a lot of bullshit later——
&gt;Person 2: Why do you always hurt me and bang other people? 
&gt;Person 1: I told you I was broken and hurt everything I touch. It’s your fault, I warned you!

So yeah, I wished him the best of luck and blocked him. Proud of myself for blocking immediately, but wish I’d blocked him after the orange flags. A variation of playing on my sympathies has happened to me before, and I’ve spent longer feeling obligated to be a nice person, or worried they were going to hurt themselves.

I’ve been dating an amazing woman I met online for the last 8 months which has been difficult during lockdown. She has children and I have a daughter which she was keen to meet and it’s sometimes difficult to meet each other due to work and child care so there is a week when she has her kids where we don’t see each other. 

I’ve been divorced for 2 years and this was my first serious relationship since dating a few women. I realised a few weekends ago that I have been hesitant in arranging her to meet my daughter because I was self protecting myself due to nerves about taking the next step. Scars from my divorce I guess. She thought I had doubts about her and was concerned about the future of the relationship. Anyway I thought about my feelings for her and not being with her anymore and realised that I really do love her. So I told her last week. 

I wasn’t expecting her to say it back but she was pleased and we had a nice evening together and she still needed to think about how she felt so I gave her the space she needed. I got a text from her 2 days ago saying she missed me and we were planning to meet on Sunday to talk more.

I received a text from her today saying that she thinks we shouldn’t meet and she’s sorry and doesn’t want to hurt me and I mean a lot to her but it’s over. I’m devastated. She said she text me because she didn’t want me to wait until Sunday.

I matched with a gal on Bumble, we texted a bit, decided to meet up for a walk in the woods, it went well. She's really busy with school, work, and kids. But she kept making time for us and basically asking me out. I have a more flexible schedule so it worked out. 

I was a little indifferent with my feelings towards her, but I felt there was something there I couldn't put my finger on. So fast forward \~7 weeks, we've seen each other about 10x. We've hiked, ice skated, biked, grabbed drinks, snuggled by a fire, had dinner out, she invited me to her place and made me dinner, I invited her to my place and made her dinner. We've had conversations about boundaries and expectations. I've been watching for green, orange, and red flags, so far so good. The more time I spend with her the more I like her. She made it clear fairly early that she is romantically interested in me, we both agreed that we want to take it slow, have clear communication, and don't want to lead anyone on or hurt each other. We've been open and honest with our dating history since our marriages were over. 

Things have progressed to the physical level and it was awesome for both of us! We're making plans to spend a couple of nights at my cabin on the ocean 2 hours away this week. We're both really looking forward to it. 

I picked up the bad habit of using tobacco during my divorce. She doesn't know I smoke...but I've decided this is the exact catalyst I needed to push me over to the side of ""it's time to quit"". I feel it would probably be a deal breaker for her. She's very active and healthy. I'm active too, but could be more healthy. I have the tools, the motivation and the drive to stop this nasty habit that no longer serves me. There's nothing good about it, so I'm done and moving on to a happier, healthier, better me!

I am (40M) my future ex GF is (35F) we met on CMB app and we started dating on October 2019. When the Pandemic began, we decided to move together on March and try to see what happens. We had Couple fights, adjusting to live together, normal issues, nothing big. Also we went into survival mode With the lockdown and the quarantine.For a few months we were in honeymoon state, didn’t last long, everything started to fall a part on June last year. Bc unmasked a perv which it was following her for a while (apparently her “friend” for about 7 years). I found out her password and decided to access to her phone, to find out info about it and she lie on my face about her perv/friend. This individual was asking for naked pics, used underwear, videos and also webcam sex (including after couple months in our dating) for her, doing all this stuff was “normal”, but not for me. So when I found out I was shocked, I told her to stop this sick relationship and focus on us. She decided to start a WAR on trust, very angry at me bc I broke into her privacy (which I would never have found it out otherwise). She said, she felt violated, bc I searched her text. Also my therapist couldn’t believe it, she decided to protect him instead of our relationship.
Personally I am very transparent in relationships, they will have my phone password, access to my laptop, etc. I don’t have nothing to hide from my past or my current present, so I am very trusted man.

Since that day, everything went down the hill, sex, talking, weird moments, so it went vanilla really quick. Lockdown didn’t help with her mental health, she takes prescription meds like a drug cocktail, for anxiety, depression, you name it is in there.
On my end, I did special dinners, games, walks, hikes, do fun stuff during quarantine to keep our relationship interesting and afloat. None of that was enough or make her happy, she already has decided I am not the one and it felt she was tolerating me for all this time, bc she didn’t want it to feel alone during the Pandemic. She started to listening to these third parties (Mostly her big bulk of male friends for advisers)  they gave her advices how to get rid of me or saying things against me or help her how to end it. She mentioned to one of them; that she was stuck in a “Shitty relationship” with this Pandemic.

I might have some jealousy issues (which I am working on). But with her history of a very promiscuous past, never married, few stable relationships which only last 1 year max + the combo with the perv/sick “friend”, it wasn’t helping with my trust issues. 
Now we are both vaccinated, things are getting back to normal. After she cut on sex almost completely, she decided to start seeing friends. She came to tell me she needs some time to be alone (or going back on the dating world and do sausage fest IDK).

So I’ve been torn about an experience I had talking to someone (45F) I met online from beginning of December to end of February.  She claimed to be from Colombia (the country).   So many of the scam flags eventually  went up, and I basically ended it by telling them I thought they weren’t real, but I feel regret because I think they may have been a legitimate person.  I’m curious what people here think was the case, so I can maybe better accurately identify in the future.  

Things that make me think scam:

- professed love quickly
- used a fake location on their profile (Miami, FL - I am in upstate NY)
- found my profile and messaged me first
- highly attractive (not like out of my league supermodel, but definitely a gorgeous woman)
- refused to video chat
- eventually asked me for money for her business (clothes making)
- when I refused to send money she immediately got offended that I didn’t trust her and tried to make me feel guilty about it

Things that make me think she was real:

- she sent me tons of pictures, including pictures of family
- she revealed many personal details, including names of family members
- she had Instagram and TikTok accounts that looked legitimate
- we talked every day.  She used a translator for texts.  She would send voice texts, but couldn’t speak English well at all, so they would be basic phrases, but they would be in line with the conversation.
- She gave me an address to send her a Christmas gift (running shoes, it was my idea to send something).  The address was in the city she claimed to live in, and when they arrived she sent a pic of her feet wearing them.

I was convinced for most of the time that she was legit, although I quickly realized that she was broke, and that any meeting was going to come completely at my cost.   But when she asked for money ($100)  I got pretty weirded out.  It’s a basic rule that you don’t send money to people you meet online that you haven’t met in person.  But her reaction was what pretty much made me lose interest.  I’m pretty much over it, but what bugs me most is I can’t decide whether this really was a scammer or not.  A lot of the typical scammer signs are there, but I just get this weird feeling she was legit, even though the odds of some gorgeous Colombian woman hitting up a gringo from NY on a dating app seems pretty slim.

Frankly, before covid, I didn’t find I needed to. I don’t have a problem striking up conversations with people I find attractive and I have done well without apps and sites. But a couple weeks ago I decided it was time to generate some more dates and I had four dates in the last two weeks. One of them went exceptionally well. We talked for over three hours and had a phenomenal goodnight kiss. We both found a lot of common ground, had great chemistry, and I decided after the date to put other conversations on the app on hold. 

Perhaps I overshared when we were setting up the next date and I told her I put my dating app on hold, perhaps her discovering my housemate was a friend of hers and she’s very concerned about her reputation in the community, but for whatever reason, she’s giving me the slow fade. 

I used to try to fix things at this point. I used to want to make it clear I was acting out of respect when putting other dates on hold and not moving too fast and I used to try to make her try to understand that discretion was as important to me as it was to her. Hell, I still think about those things, but I’m not acting on it anymore. Fuck it. I have a half dozen other conversations going and I just set up an alternative date for the weekend. If I don’t hear from her again by tonight, I’ll book the rest of my weekend.

But unfortunately I am emphatic and give people the benefit of the doubt so its burnt me in dating &amp; relationships.

I decided to end my failed 9yr marriage in the summer of 2018. Took some time to myself and last year the yearning for a true connection and chemistry with one man began to brew in me. I jumped into dating sites. I was hesitant but open to try. Times have changed and COVID made it impossible to meet new people in person. I decided to try CMB, then Hinge, Match and so on... The League, MM, JDate, JSwipe, Chispa, Eharmony, Bumble, DateMyAge, and Elite. Till I finally gave up last week. I never had more than 2 apps at a time but I kept thinking that I should try a different one with no success.

I always got hundreds or more of potential matches. I matched back with a fair amount but though their profiles claimed they were looking for love or a connection. They quickly wanted to take the chat out of the apps and meet up. Very little to no effort in chatting or talking before a meet up. Immediately rude once I declined after 2-3 messages. With the same “hru, wyd, hot, send pics, come over” messages. It’s like they are just into hookups or wanted nudes. I’m not one of those so no one got any. But it turned me off. I still tried to come back with some humor, a question to start a convo. Just wasted my time. 

I’m very clear that I’m not looking for hookups. There was a handful that communicated so I went out on dates but were insistent that I go to their place afterwards. Nope. Pass. Some had real outdated pics. Another let down. But I was still polite and stayed for the date.

Physical attraction is equally important to me as mental attraction with an empathetic, understanding, adventurous, ambitious, and youthful spirit. I know it’s not to much to ask for. Their definitely are single individuals out here in Los Angeles that are like this. Funny, accomplished, or working on becoming accomplished. But where?

How much more clear do I have to be that I’m not online for hookups but rather seeking a connection with tons of chemistry?? Or is online just not the way?

Hello all. I am 48M and am in the final stages of separating. My wife and I are finalizing our separation agreement, have worked out the joint parenting arrangement for of our 3 boys, and I am in process of purchasing a new home nearby. I will be closing on the house in mid-July and move in by the end of July / early August.  

The process leading to my divorce has been collegial and deliberate over 7 years, including various stints in couple’s therapy and plenty of personal therapy and introspection. Not to get too woo-woo, but, during that time, I have had the opportunity to do a lot of work on myself. I have a sense of gratitude for where I am, an understanding of my wounds, an appreciation and acceptance of the positive and challenging traits in my ex, and a sense of clarity of what I hope to build going forward. I am still working through my process, but feel ready to start to move on.  

My plan is to start dating again once I transition to my new house. My long-term goal is to find a new partner. However, I am not ready to dive into something super serious and monogamous at the moment. I know myself well enough to know that, while I do want to have sex, I am not looking for anonymous hook ups. It strikes me that the middle ground is the sort of casual dating / FWB. I’m attracted to smart women and specifically am now seeking warmth and fun. I’m a strong extrovert and look forward to meeting new, interesting people, even if it does not always result in sexy time. I’m also totally fine if a FWB transitions back to simply an F with no B as their situation evolves.  

That said, it has been a long time since I was single and it is new, very different world. I would appreciate it if people would give me advice or point me to resources to help me learn what I will need to do.

Specifically, what dating app should I use? It is geography dependent? What is an appropriate way to express what I am looking for without coming across as a sleazy old man? Are there appropriate OLD code words that I need to learn? How long does it take to meet someone?

My top priority is my kids; my availability for dating will be constrained by my time with them. Can I assume that is a given for people in our age range, or do I need to be explicit about that priority? I have my kids and don’t want more. I assume I need to be clear about that. Do the apps have appropriate categories to signal that?

From some of the posts that I’ve seen about OLD, it looks like much of that process involves ridiculous pick-up lines and a ludicrous amount of time texting on apps. Is that accurate or will there be people that respond to proper punctuation and normal discussions? What is the appropriate amount of in app texting before moving things to text / phone / in person? Are there things that I can do to make the women that I am meeting feel safe, given that they are meeting someone random from the internet?

I was severely neglected as a child and raised by a narcissitic parent and then spent a good chunk of my adult life living with that parent who emotionally and verbally abused me. I had to keep staying at home due to mental health reasons, which, you guessed it, were caused by my childhood. 

I escaped. And until I got away, I did not understand how badly I was abused. I did not know that I had a right to take carenof myself, look nice, have a few nice things...It took me several months on my own not to he scared of people as I always thought they would yell at me like my parent would. I was jumpy. 

A few years later, I am better. I started dating at 38. It is late in life to do this I know. So this is embarrassing when dating because I do not have relationship history.

I still have not fully recovered. 

 I am finding that I have a hard time knowing if a guy is treating me right. I still have the tendency to think it is ok to let them walk over me and that I somehow owe them a free pass to do so.

The last guy I dated said he needed take a long break and be alone and then he ghosted me. Before that, he was hard to connect with him. He was moody. He would half listen to me and not take interestnin things i liked so I eventually would not discuss anything I likes. I tried to get back with him, why? No sense of self worth. No idea of what it is even.  

That guy also had a bad attitude toward women. I do not think he liked them other for sex and it showed. I always felt he thought I was spoiled and entitled. He thought that about his ex wife too and about his female relatives. When in fact I have worked my ass off for everything I have with no help from anyone. 

He would only be affectionate if he wanted sex. He would push for sex at times but then would not want to have it when ever I wanted it. We would only go places when he wanted to go and never on my time. He was over too much and eating to much of my food at my place. He was a dirty house guest. He would promise me one thing but then do something different and when confronted, it was my problem.

So stuff like this is not ok. 

I still do not have a full sense of self worth and I put up with this stuff far too long in relationships. 

I am getting better. But I still need help. Is there anyone out there who can relate?",True,False,False,datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,46424,public,self,No Self Worth,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/n0pt7r/no_self_worth/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We met on a dating app.  Early on, she said she was looking for a friend who might lead to a long-term relationship.  She said at the time that she has depression &amp; anxiety and was bad at relationships.  I wondered how bad it was, because as we hung out, we really enjoyed each other's company and conversations.  Things were going slow, but I was developing feelings for her.  In time, we told each other we really like each other (and even were falling for each other). She seemed to be giving some signals too (kissed my cheek goodbye a few times, cuddled up a bit while watching TV a few times, held my hand once while out shopping).  We hung out almost once a week (a bit less) and were texting almost every day.

After a few months, just before she went home, I asked her if I could kiss her.  She said she wasn't ready for that - she said she enjoys my friendship but wasn't ready to take it further.  She also became more distant, texting me much less and not always replying to my texts.  She wouldn't text good morning or good night anymore (or reply to my good morning/night texts) like she used to.  We met for dinner and she talked about what she said, saying she has a lot of emotional trauma and has trouble with love, and although she has feelings for me and I'm the nicest guy she has met, she said she can't reciprocate and doesn't want to lead me on and feels it's best to be friends.  I don't argue.  She said she'd still want to hang out.

At that meeting, she had mentioned hanging out the upcoming weekend (which was this past weekend).  She said she wanted to play it by ear.  Saturday came and she said she had been sleeping much of the day (as she has issues with sleeping).  I asked if she was hungry, and she said she had ordered some food but I'd be welcome to come over and join her.  So I went over, we ate and hung out and watched some TV.  It was similar to how we had been hanging out before, and she was nice.  I asked a bit about what she had said, and that I remember her saying she was looking for a friend that might lead to something.  She said yes but not this soon.  I started to ask if she'd be open to anything in the future - she said ""what do you mean?"" and I said ""oh I dunno"" and dropped it.  We watched some more TV for a bit.  I asked if she'd want to hang out the next day (Sunday), and she said she'd text me.  She texted Sunday mid-day and said she had a bad headache (she gets those) and had to rest.  I said I hope she feels better.

That was the last I've heard from her now.  I texted to check in Sunday evening, and again to check in yesterday (Tuesday) evening but have still not heard anything from her.

It seemed we both liked each other and were developing a connection.  She said she'd still want to be a friend, but now I feel like she is ghosting me.  I feel like I've lost a friend, and it hurts.

Early on, she said she was looking for a friend who might lead to a long-term relationship, and that she has depression &amp; anxiety and has had problems with relationships (though now when I think back, I thought her dating profile sounded like she was looking for a relationship).  Over the 3 months, we really enjoyed each other's company.  Things were going slow; I felt like I was getting some mixed signals, but I fell for her anyway.  Several weeks ago I asked if I could kiss her, and she said she isn't ready for a relationship, and she started to back off and get more distant, not texting as much.  She said she realized she needs to work on herself (she has some bad emotional trauma) and although she really likes me (she said she was developing feelings), she can't reciprocate.  She has trouble dealing with love.  She said she doesn't want to lead me on and doesn't want to hurt me and thought it would be best to just be friends.  She said she'd still hang out though.  She explained that due to her past emotional trauma, she tends to build a wall and when good guys like me come along, it can be hard to let them in.

This past Saturday, I went over to her place to hang out.  At one point I asked her a little more about what she had said.  I said I remember her saying she was looking for a friend who might lead to something, and she said not this fast.  I started to ask if she might be open to something in the future, and she said ""what do you mean?""  I said I dunno, and I left it at that.  We continued hanging out and watching TV.  I had asked about hanging out the next day (Sunday), and she said she'd text me.  She did text me Sunday and said it was ""a no go"" as she had one of her headaches and needed to rest.  I texted back it's okay.

One thing to note is that we had been texting almost every day.  However, now I haven't heard back from her since Sunday (it has been about 4 days now).  I had texted Sunday evening to check in, and also texted Tuesday evening to check in, and she hasn't responded.

I've been feeling heartbroken and down about this - actually at least for several weeks now, since she said she can only offer friendship.  I've been feeling unmotivated and haven't felt like doing the things I'd usually enjoy doing.  I feel like I may have made her uncomfortable now to the point where she doesn't want to talk to me.  I feel like she has ghosted me, and it hurts.

Basically I feel like I'm grieving unrequited love, and now possibly losing a friend and having been ghosted.  After the mixed signals, feeling like we had a connection, and then her saying she can't reciprocate and now this, I feel like this is the hardest rejection I've felt.  How can I get out of this funk?

Also, I still have a book that she loaned me a little while ago.  I'd like to return it, but if she isn't talking to me, I'm wondering how best to go about that.  I thought about sending it back to her via mail, though she lives in an apartment and has said carriers sometimes deliver to the wrong apartment (it's a confusing apartment complex).  I thought about delivering it to her apartment myself (she's about a 15 minute drive away from me) and just leaving it at her door - I thought about writing a note with it too, saying I'm really sorry if I made her uncomfortable.

I'm in an extremely busy transition chapter of life right now with a corporation merger so slow and steady is the only option.  Plenty of orange flags - in a good way, considering we don't know much about one another yet. 

(PS - I'm the one whose children wanted a puppy.

Puppy is wonderful, and all routines are well established. Puppy is actually the one who got the attention at the outdoor attraction, which led to an exchanging of phone numbers.)

I’ll start with I (43/F) have a super anxious attachment style (I’m aware and working on it) have been seeing a guy (48/M) for about 2.5 months, it’s pretty casual but he knows I have feelings. We’ve been talking in some way every day (text, call or FaceTime) and usually see each other about 3 times a month (maybe a lunch and I’ve been sleeping at his place every other Saturday). He’s never been married, no kids and not much in terms of LTRs. We met on Bumble but knew who each other were IRL when we matched. 

Last week we had lunch Thursday and I spent the night Saturday. We went out to eat at a causal place (I had my lunch 2nd shot that morning so we were just going to do take out but I felt pretty good). Rented a movie On Demand, cuddled, talked and had a good time. We’ve had sex before and we did again this week (although it wasn’t great. I think he was having a hard time staying hard - I get it we’re getting older, no judgement - but he didn’t acknowledge it and I didn’t say anything because I didn’t want to embarrass him). 

After that we cuddled some more and put something on Netflix to fall asleep too. He didn’t sleep good and I know he didn’t. When we got up in the morning we just hung out for a little bit and talked. He said something about my BFF (he’s met her on video chat before) and so said something to the effect of she wants us all to go to dinner together (meaning her and her fiancé and me and him). His first reaction was “we’ll get there” and he quickly changed it to “we will”. When I left he walked me to my car, gave me a nice kiss, told me he had a blast and to text when I got home. 

I’m wondering if maybe I freaked him out? He hasn’t initiated a text with me at all since then (and he was probably initiating 60% of the time before that). He does still respond immediately so it’s not like he’s blowing me off. I’m wondering if I freaked him out? If he’s just not into me at all anymore? I do want to address it with him, but I’m wondering other peoples thoughts too. (For the record I’m a single Mom of 2 high schoolers and have been divorced for about 5 years. I’m in no way shape or form looking to blow up either of our lives. I’d eventually like to get to a place where our lives can include each other at bbqs and stuff like that, potentially him meeting my kids, but I’m not looking to cohabitate or marry him - at least not until my kids are grown)",True,False,False,datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,46539,public,self,Anxious Attachment or Slow Fade,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/n19y9m/anxious_attachment_or_slow_fade/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
