0,pc1saj,1629991653,Dating in San Antonio and Austin TX,"I am relocating from Ohio to Texas this fall, I need a change of scenery and a new chapter in my life from the Midwest to the southwest. 

Single M 27 6ft tall  young professional with a degree, remote corporate job getting my own place for the first time in my life without kids or pets. 

I have done tinder bumble hinge etc in my local city for awhile with no avail or it’s constant bs flaking using me for attention and ego boosts but never wanted to meet for a first date. 

Does Texas have more wholesome and down to earth women who won’t play games and cause me headaches and frustration when trying to date? I just want to meet someone to eventually get a serious relationship but Ohio has been a big disappointment and a lot of damaged women with kids talking about package deals and gotta be 6ft tall and all sorts of criteria when they they’re a 4-5 at best. 

Hoping San Antonio and Austin will treat me better in the dating scene and I can meet people who won’t flake or cause the mental gymnastics I currently go through in Ohio.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pc1saj/dating_in_san_antonio_and_austin_tx/

2,pc1z9k,1629992243,situationship fail,"I (21F) started seeing a guy (20M) a few months ago. We were going out on dates and talking consistently for a month. Then he left for bootcamp for 3 months and we had no communication that whole time. Before he left he said he’d make it official plus other promises once he gets back home. Basically asked me to wait for him which I did (dumb move on my part I really thought he was serious about me). He has his phone back now and we’ve been talking since he came back and he’s been facetiming me sometimes 2/3 times a day. 

But these past 2 weeks I can feel it’s off. He won’t talk to me for sometimes 1 or 2 days now but will always be posting on social media. I talked to him about it and said I don’t need him to talk to me every second of every day but it’s nice to receive at least 1 text. He said he understood but nothings changed. And now one of our mutuals shared a post of his where he was talking about another girl yesterday. He tried calling me the same day he posted that. 

I guess I’m just lost because although we weren’t exclusive I didn’t know he was still looking to date more people. I thought it was a mutual interest. But now i feel strung along and like I was a placeholder for someone else he wanted. I’m torn if i should even confront him about it or just ignore him and move on. I know he will call me today so I’m trying to figure out what to do before then. What should I do? 

tl/dr: i was talking to this guy for 3 months before he left for boot camp. he promised that he’d make it official when he came back, but now that he is, he’s being inconsistent w his communication, and has been tweeting about another girl that i know isn’t me. what should i do?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pc1z9k/situationship_fail/

And I’m not trying to bash that sub in this post either, that was just a random example I saw.
I totally get why it’s not desirable but I would never make fun of a woman or anyone for her physical appearance, especially stuff she can’t change.

I had gotten a girls number at a donut shop asked her out twice in two weeks and both time she says she is busy. 

So i stop. Fast forward a year later i ask her out in person again and she tells me she has a bf. 

So i ignore her and continue on about my business.  I try to get another girl at the donut shop, im a good looking guy with good energy so i get looks . She starts to notice me just being myself and enjoying myself. She begins to give me signals for about a week.

But im confused. She has already rejected me, i don't know if she just wants attention or is interested.  I know girls switch up so fast.

I pay her no mind because in the past i have fallen for these dumb mind games. 

Anyway after a week of giving me signals she quits. 

Now i also have the issue of maybe not pushing enough or quitting to soon.  

Did i miss my chance to seal the deal when she was showing interest for that week or did i just dodge an attention seeker?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pc2r7s/mixed_signals_from_donut_shop_girl/

Text I wrote: 

Now that I’ve calmed down there is just something I want to say and I don’t need you to respond or anything or do I hold anything against you but this is just to clear the air about what made me so upset. I wasn’t angry with the fact that you rejected me… yes that shit kinda hurt because it was so unexpected BUT what really got me angry was the fact that you told me you weren’t ready for a relationship AFTER we’ve gone on so many dates and you kept telling me things? It just sorta felt like you were leading me on when you knew this was gonna happen and I’ve done nothing but treat you with respect and idk the way you did that kinda fucked with me in the wrong way. 

I’m not saying you owed me anything or It was an obligation cause my main point was more on the fact that you sorta just lead me on which meant you had no regards towards me as a friend. Had you have told me you just wanted to be friends from the very beginning then I wouldn’t have gotten my hopes up or started catching feelings for you again. I’m not trying to cause drama or start something because I know you’ve been really sad lately and I don’t want to add onto it but what you did really messed with my sleep and my daily routine cause I haven’t been hurt like that in a long time and I thought expressing what I’ve been feeling to you now would sorta help with closure. Anyways besides everything that happened towards the end I really did enjoy the time we spent but I hope everything goes well for you from here on out ✌️


Anyways she never responded but it sorta felt good to finally let it all out.

9,pc318c,1629995327,I think the only reason people are attracted to me is because I might be easy.,"21 year old female here, since entering the dating world I’ve had some varied success. Typically on dating apps I would get lots of matches and meet tons of new people. Not at all trying to brag but I would get compliments from these people and I would be told constantly that I was beautiful and pretty and hot, stuff like that. I’ve always struggled with my confidence, I have my highs and lows just like anyone else but it’s hits harder for me than it probably would most people. It’s a problem I know and I’m doing my best to work on it. I’ve since deleted all my dating apps and I find that no one ever tries to talk to me or even approach me. I don’t get hit on, no one ever asks for my number or even looks at me. I’ve always had this thought that maybe in not actually attractive but just easy. Mabel these guys were just telling me what they thought I wanted to hear in hopes of getting what they want. It’s sucks to feel this way but when I look in the mirror I can’t fathom why anyone would ever be attracted to me.

i brought it up to him again the next day and told him it really hurt me and i needed to know the context of it. he said she had followed him and he followed her back and that the last time they ever spoke, it wasn’t good so she apologized and they had a normal conversation and that was all. he also said their relationship was very short, they didn’t get to know each other all that well. i asked if he wanted her back in his life and he said no and i understand that it may have been just a simple conversation but i can’t help but wonder would he have never told me? what did they talk about? when did they last talk before that? etc. 

that was yesterday and thinking about it today i still feel bothered by it because if i hadn’t known her name, he wouldn’t have told me that? &amp; if you don’t want someone back in your life, why still allow them in, in any way?

12,pc3b1c,1629996138,Red Flags in Men ( or any gender ),"
**This list can apply to all genders** 

My post about red flags in women yesterday, (requested by another user), got a lot of attention, and I was asked multiple times to make a list for men.  Again, *this list can apply to all genders, but sometimes people comprehend things better when written from the sexual orientation they understand*.  Every situation is different, and not every red flag necessarily means a relationship is doomed.  Some things are fixable, but this is just a general list of common things to watch out for.  I had a **LOT** of feedback on my last list, so I stopped updating it and will have all additions on this one.  Some of the suggestions were more based on preferences rather than red flags, so I left those out.

**If he isn't responding/engaging in conversation** - He's most likely not interested, and if he is, is it really *worth* it?  If he wanted to talk to you that badly, he would.  Nobody will wait days to answer someone they are genuinely interested in.  Sometimes life happens, but they should communicate that with you.

**If he's obsessed with you** - This might seem great at first, but can turn south quick. Codependency is not healthy, and can create a foundation for control, manipulation, and abuse later on.  It's better to have a life outside of your relationship, rather than let your life revolve around it. 

**Always expects you to pay/bad with money** - This one made more sense on the women's list from a traditional standpoint, but definitely still applies to men as well.  Sometimes people are in a rough spot in life, but is it *your* responsibility to pick up his side of the bill every time? No.  Watch what they order, do they order something reasonable, or go right for the steak if it's on your dime?  How do you build a future if your partner lacks financial skills?  How do you feel about being the breadwinner in this situation?  Is he using you *for* your money?  Just stay diligent and be careful.

**My exes are psycho** - This is one to take with a grain of salt, because sometimes people legitimately just have bad luck dating and reading people. But in a lot of situations there's one common denominator and a reason their relationships ended badly. So stay on your toes. 

**He slaps/hits you if he's upset** - This one is a big one especially for women, who are more often victims of domestic violence.  Physical violence is NEVER okay in a relationship, man or woman. If your date/SO hurts you in some way, run. If they do it once, it's likely it will happen again, and could be *much* worse. Not to be confused with play fighting or BDSM in the bedroom, which if consented to by both parties, is okay.  This also applies to safety when driving, etc.  Does he make you feel safe in the vehicle? 

**He makes her mental health your problem** - A lot of people legitimately have mental health issues, but it is not okay to make them someone else's responsibility. You shouldn't have to tiptoe around them all of the time. If they can't handle their emotions on a day to day basis, they have no business being in a relationship. If they ever ever ever say ""if you leave me, I'll kill myself"", run like the wind. Contact police, family, whoever you need to, to get them the help they need. But that's the end of your responsibility. That is nothing but an abuse/control tactic and is never okay. 

**Showers you with gifts and affection, but uses it against you** - This one is tricky. Have you ever heard of ""love-bombing""? Basically, someone will shower you with affection, love, or gifts, but use it against you later. They make claims like you're soulmates and shouldn't be apart. They want to gain your trust for their own agenda.  They'll guilt you for not doing what they want, after ""all the gifts and affection"" they gave you. You didn't ask for it, you don't owe them anything. It's manipulation. 

**Makes fun of you for humor** - He'll joke about your flaws or make rude comments, but say ""babe it was just a joke"". There's always some truth behind every one, and a lot of people will use humor as an excuse to make fun of you/complain about you. If it hurts your feelings, it was probably meant to even though he said it wasn't. Don't encourage those mind games. If it's a one off situation it might be an honest mistake, but if it's reoccurring, run. Again, just like the play fighting, sometimes that is just the nature of some relationships.  If you both make it clear you are okay with that type of humor, that is okay.

**He's always picking a fight** - As much as people like to say ""relationships are work"", they shouldn't be like this. Relationships really should be a source of stress relief. If everything you do is a problem to him, you need to find someone where it isn't. You shouldn't have to fight for a relationship, it should come naturally. 

**He doesn't say what he means** - This one still applies to men. That just means he has poor communication skills and expects you to just read his mind. Nobody is a mind reader, and relationships don't work without communication. I *promise* you that there are men out there who are worth it, *will* tell you exactly what they want. How are you supposed to know unless he tells you? That's not fair to you.  Communication is the key to a good relationship.

**He plays the poor me act"" - Some people are truly down on their luck. But for some they use it as a tool to manipulate you. They just need some help back on their feet, but never seem to actually get back on their feet. They're usually just using you as a meal ticket. Somehow they end up in your home, unemployed, and eating your food, if this happens, run.

**He only talks about his ex** - Sometimes this is unavoidable if they've spent years of their life with an ex. However, this is often a sign they are not over them or might be comparing you to them. You shouldn't have to compete for your partner. On the other hand, I do want to add that sometimes your partner may have been the victim of abuse.  They might have some unresolved trauma from past relationships, and that can be hard to get over if they aren't having any outside help.

**He isn't consistent** - Some days he's super interested, and other days he's not. He might be working, might have other commitments, but watch for patterns. If he's hot and cold all of the time, you might not be the only one on his radar.  What kind of job/other commitments does he have? If he does have other commitments, are you okay with working around those?  He should be communicating with you when he's going to go cold for a while.

**He has cheated, or indicates he has cheated in the past** - If your partner has cheated, there is a very good chance they may do it again.  A lot of cheaters just become sneakier once caught, and will tell you whatever you want to hear to not lose you.  You can never fully erase that memory from the relationship.  If he cheated in the past, what were the circumstances?  Use your best judgement, people do grow and change, but some never will.  If he cheated on someone *with* you, use caution.

**He doesn't hold himself accountable for his actions** - For example, (using an experience I had), he borrows your car and locks the keys in it.  You don't have a spare.  He suddenly makes it *your* fault that this happened because there is no spare, and it's now *your* responsibility to fix the problem.  That is not okay.  Make sure they understand when something is their fault, and take responsibility for their actions.

**He tells you he is a ""nice guy""** - Usually nice people don't have to tell you they are nice, they just show you.  Someone telling you they are a good person, usually are trying to *convince* you that you are.  Be cautious.

**He doesn't respect/respond to boundaries** - Boundaries are *soooo* important in a relationship.  If you set clear boundaries and he violates them, reevaluate that relationship.  Your partner needs to respect what you are and are not comfortable with, and there should be no ""compromise"" on that.  If he truly cares and respects you, there should be no issue.  Once boundaries are crossed, that opens up the stage for abuse later on.

**He lies about little things** - It can start with a little lie here and there, but can quickly snowball into bigger and bigger lies.  Lying is not okay, relationships need to be built off of trust and communication if they are going to last.

You might be thinking, well how do I find a man that doesn't have any of these red flags? If it were easy, everyone would be in great relationships. But it's not.  Sometimes you need to sift through *hundreds* of men before you find him. (Different populations use different types of dating sites). It is not worth dating someone who doesn't give you the love and affection you deserve. Again, this list does not include *all* red flags, but just some major ones I see come up a lot. 

I can't link anything here, but look up different types of emotional abuse tactics. 
Read them, get familiar with them, and save yourself some hurt in the future. 

Remember, you never are obligated to stay in a relationship. Their life is NOT your responsibility. Take care of yourself first. And communicate, communicate, communicate. 

Also, did you find things that *you* do?  Do *you* have red flags?  That's okay!  It's good to recognize faults of our own that we may have.  It's important that we see these and know what to work on in the future.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pc3b1c/red_flags_in_men_or_any_gender/
13,pc3btd,1629996201,Is it ok to date multiple people at the same time?,"I am 21f. Till March this year I was in a long term long distance relationship. We broke up due to distance and are still cordial. I have decided to start dating seriously again. I think I would like to have someone to have fun with. I love the platonic part of relationships a lot. It's really important to me. Also I have realised that dating apps although have a lot of options for girls but the majority of them want to hookup or do casual stuff. Also my previous experience with the friend who misled me to get casual stuff has left be a little paranoid cause I have realised how people can pretend to like you till u lower your gaurd and then they show their true intentions in a second. Also I absolutely don't want to do long distance stuff cause it's too much effort and I am not a texting person.

So I started finding guys in my area using dating apps and I did find some. I have met a few of them too and put of these 3 have showed an interest in dating. One was an old acquaintance and other 2 are complete strangers. I have met each of them once for an hour or so. And it was a good conversation with everyone but nothing over the top. They were all decent but no one particularly interesting in a way that makes me stop in my tracks. I am texting with all of them rn and plan to meet them again soon. Whenever we can. 

I had inclination towards one guy more than others cause he was the same age as me and was also pursuing a similar field but it has happened twice that he said he would meet me but he got stuck in work. ( I don't think he was lying about it but I did not like that he didnt inform me prior and clearly say a no. He kept saying he would make it on time but when he finally got free it was way beyond my free time.). Another guy has a significant age difference ( 5yrs and is busy with his job at a different stage of life). Third one is a year younger and I know him from a few years back and he is sweet but he is pursuing an entirely different career. Overall they all are same for me and I don't plan to indulge in any physical stuff with any of them till I feel comfortable. Also I have made it clear to them that I am no hurry to get into a relationship. I was hangout with people. Have fun and see how it goes. 

But I have never dated multiple people before. My moral compass is feeling a bit weird for getting involved with all of them. Although I don't have a reason to pick out any of them yet. So is it ok if I go out with all of them a few more times without telling them that I am not exclusively dating them? I did clear the relationship bit but I did not discuss if they were seeing other people or no. And also I will not get involved physically with anyone till I feel I really wanna be in a relationship with them.

14,pc3dix,1629996345,No contact or not?,"

I met her through work in february through work and what started off as just a bit of fun with talking on the phone slowly evolved into a really strong connection, we meet for the first time 30 march and after the second date we spoke out to eachother that we like eachother. I always have a hard time opening up but she did not mind and was willing to wait, two weeks later i slept at her place and we slept together. Until that point everything was great between us until a week later she said she does not know if it just friendly between us or romantic. I told her it would be hard for me as i do have those romantic feelings, She just had some doubts about it, some moments she did had attraction towards me and sometimes she did not.

As time progressed we remained friends, still talking on the phone everyday, telling eachother everything going on in our lives and she frequently said things like she is really happy that she has me in her life and that she needs me. But as time progressed it also was harder for me at times. Especially if she was hanging out alone with her guy "" friends"".

I was feeling jealous and really questioning my own self worth/ respect at times. I know i just should have go NC the moment she friendzoned me, but yeah stupid me.

But i was becoming more distant from her to just protect myself and 3 weeks ago she send me a messages that she really misses me and did not thought our bond would ""break"" this quickly. I told her i miss her aswell but from the moment she told me she just wants to be friends a lot had changed because i really thought we were building something more then just friends. she did not respons on my reaction.

For the last 3 weeks our conversations are really dry and it feels forced. I got a snapchat from her last week from her that she was taking a drive with her ex, which she always complained about to me and talked alot about when we were ""dating"" in hindsight it maybe meant she was not over him still. But since she send that snap i did not contacted her and it has been 3 days now.

I need some advice on what to do next, should i stay no contact or should i contact her? i have to be honest and tell you all i am having a hard time, also because she is undergoing surgery coming thursday and i want to be for her, but on the other hand it is hard to be in her life as just a friend",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pc3dix/no_contact_or_not/

I caught myself thinking ""Oh, maybe she's just being really friendly"" in the moment. Anyway, we're meeting up later next week so I didn't totally blow it, but I basically cock blocked myself this time ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

I keep reading that you should ""just ask"" (for a kiss, if they want to come back to your place, etc.) and the worst case is they'll say no. I'm fine being rejected, I just can't help but think it'll be creepy and turn the other person away pretty quickly. She basically told me she's an adult and can stop me if she isn't comfortable with something I do, so no need to even ask.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I'm just wondering how people here deal with this? Do you feel similarly, or do how do you approach ""making moves""? I'm not seeing anyone else right now, but I plan on getting out more often after I move in a few weeks.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pc3ork/advice_getting_out_of_your_head_and_just_making/

We hangout and things went well she laughed and had fun, we watched a movie, went for dinner and just chillied and I tried to get close to her she denied me. But she wanted hangout again.

So I thought I messed up, she texted me the next day ""il be honest let's be friends I don't rush things and I don't want to lead you on I like going with you though"" even though I never officially asked her out.

She wants to go out for a 3rd time and she was the one who asked not me, we went bowling 2nd and she paid for it, and things went well too she loved it. I'm just conflicted she seems to always open up to me also she has never had a bf that could be a factor.

Overall what do I do her take my time even tho she sorta rejected me?

29,pc52oy,1630001363,It's much harder to see someone for who they are when you're in love with them,"I would like to share my experience before getting to the title. After I (20M) have been rejected by this girl (20), I was so sad for months and I wondered what's wrong with me. I really thought we were a great match, because she is an affectionate person like me and we have similar interests. 

This month I finally moved on and I began loving myself above anything else. I chose to remain friends with her because I still enjoy her company and we care about each other. But three weeks ago, when we were sitting in the park, two girls passed us and she bluntly said ”Man, I don't understand how a lot of these girls dress so lightly, it's like they're asking to be raped, and if it were to happen, it would be their fault, too”.

I just froze. After a while, I told her how twisted it is to say that, especially as a woman, but I didn't make a big deal out of it (I try to avoid any arguing in general), so I decided to drop it. I don't understand, she never said something like that before, and she herself was almost dressed like them. It completely shocked me. 

Because of infatuation, I ignored other things which I didn't like about her when I was in love, like weird and disrespectful comments about some people, zodiac &amp; horoscope stuff and corny poetic quotes which she still constantly posts, but this...? I don't think I can ignore this and I will see if I can bring it up to her, maybe she is willing to become better than that.

If there's a lesson to be learned after this, I think it's to always respect your principles, try to look attentively at people from time to time, to see if there is anything that crosses the line for you. If you are in love, take a moment to realize that they are just a person. They have flaws and opinions that might be a dealbreaker for you, so don't let strong feelings blind your reasoning.

And also... do not put yourself down over someone. Please. If you can love someone, you can love yourself, too.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pc52oy/its_much_harder_to_see_someone_for_who_they_are/

I suggested that we meet two weeks from this last Saturday since I would be busy this coming weekend and she said yes.

Now, I'm wondering if I should message her a few days prior, or maybe even sooner than that, if at all. The reason why I am unsure is that she takes a long time to reply to messages and even unmatched me on hinge. When I say ""a long time to reply"", I mean days on the app and hours, if at all, through text message. 

I'm just chalking it up to her being uninterested at this point, but maybe she's just busy.

35,pc5xbn,1630003994,I need help. I ruined everything.,"‘I know I fucked it up and I’m an asshole but please show some restraint. I’m a human being, I have flaws and I know I need help. But I can’t do it alone. I’m drowning.’

Me (26) and my girlfriend (22) have been dating for 6months and I’ve never been happier in my entire life. I thought we were going to spend the rest of our lives together. But I fucked it all up with a couple of beers and 60 seconds.

Backstory I am a problem. I know I am. To start this girl is one of my childhood friends. Was I a dick? Yes. But I had an enormous amount of respect and interest in this girl ever since I met her a year prior to us actually “hooking up”. This of course was a huge ordeal and dramatic for about the first month and a half as what was going on came out. My friend was pissed but things ended out fine. He just didn’t want me to hurt her and our friendship. Which I did. 

We dated for 6 months and it was amazing. Everything was good we just got back from a trip actually. We always drank with friends or even eachother and had such amazing times. I seriously thought I’d marry this girl. 

Skip to July 1st my parents were having a rough time (relationship wise) my moms calling my on the phone crying and I shouldn’t of went out drinking. But I do I go to my gfs brothers and fiancé’s home with her other brother (my friend) and gf and their friends. I get too drunk have a discussion with my friend about everything which pissed him off, she’s upset with me and it ended out absolutely horribly. Family was not happy. We broke up. 

I begged her to get back with me and said I’d never do it again. And she came back. Skip to last Friday. I’m invited toner her extended family at a bar and we drink. Everything was going amazing. So good. Most of the people leave like her parents and some others. We’re getting our bills and I got one for $165 dollars with 13 20oz beers on it. Which is simply impossible and I did not drink that. It wasn’t till the following day I find out that the sever had been putting my friend/her brothers beers on my tab when I asked for another round for us. 

Enter her cousin (g) who is sitting across the table. My gf is hammered and not noticing. I’m noticeably upset an the server is talking to me like I’m hammered. We are packed and I moved my gfs chair just so I could stand. The sever is refusing to listen to me and gets the manager. It’s an ordeal. They are finally like are you going to pay it or not. Some time has passed and my gf comes up and demands I pay it. Which I do. We leave and we go home but my gf dumps me before we go to sleep.

Fast forward the next day she goes to a family event I was supposed to attend. At the event her parents have told most of the family we are fighting and her cousin who I previously mentioned says that I forcefully moved my gfs chair and got up yelling at the server. 1 I did not move her chair like that I would never do anything like that to a girl. Even my gf admits that could not of taken place. In my mind I got up to move to the side so I could talk without making a big deal. Her cousin says that I was yelling and she was so mad she had it walk outside where I found out she had told my gf and then she came back to tell me to pay the bill. Fast forward a week we are still broken up. I’ve begged for her back and told her I need to make a change. I have a history of being self destructive when I drink to excess and struggle with some mental health issues. Sometimes I drink and I just lose social cues. I am a bigger guy and my gf also says that I can just get intense and I scared the sever. If you know me this is just not who I am and hate that I came across as this. I ruined it with her family her parents don’t think they can let it go nor her cousin and I’m sure her brothers and gfs/fiancé. 

I told her I can repair these opinions. I booked into therapy starting in two weeks and am taking a break on drinking. We’ve met up and hooked up again it is clear she does not want to breakup. We were amazing im telling you other than these two times no issues ever. But she can’t get past her families opinions and things that if I did this twice in two weeks who knows if it will continue or just get worse. She said she wants to be together but can’t because she never wants me around her family again. 

I’m broken hearted. I’ve lost the best thing in my life. There’s nothing I can say or do to change her mind. I’ve suffered from depression and anxiety and ive been struggling with suicidal thoughts. Im in a masters program doing something I don’t want to do and now unemployed. Im literally thinking about going to school and becoming a millwright or taking a year and going back to university to enter as a nurse. But I’ll be 30 when im done. I’ve lost everything I love, I feel like a failure. 

I just want her to know that I can fix it. I know id do anything for this girl. 

What do I do? I can’t stop screaming and crying..

37,pc5ze3,1630004170,SA (?) (23F) (23M) Before Talking with FWB (23M),"Four months ago, I (23F) got out of a bad relationship. I knew I wasn't ready for another relationship, so I decided to find someone to hookup with. I started talking with Ash (23M). I told him my boundaries, what I liked, and didn't like. He did the same. I told him we would absolutely have to use a condom. Before meeting I asked him to send pictures of his condoms for proof. The first few times, he used a condom no problem. Then at one point he got on top of me without one on. I asked him to wear one. He rolled his eyes, and put one on. 

In the middle of the night, we wanted to fuck again. He got on top of me again, without a condom on, this time, I didn't know what to say. He knew I wanted to fuck with a condom on, I had told him multiple times. He didn't respect that. He was sweaty, the sex was horrible, and he wouldn't let go of me the entire night. I blocked him the next day. 

The next day or two after, I started talking to Chris (23M). We had talked for a day. I had told him my last hookup sucked, and that it was a day ago. We both agreed to getting tested before meeting. (He was getting tested in general, not just for me.) We seemed to be into the same things. He agreed to wear a condom and that it was no problem. Then I thought about my previous hookup. I didn't want the same thing to happen again. So, I unmatched with him on Tinder/unfriended him on snap. The next day, I got a text message. 

I had forgotten I had given Chris my number. I should have just blocked him, but to my surprise, he actually ordered a 10 panel STD test. He asked me if I was potentially still interested. I was still really hesitant. He asked me if I wanted to hang out. After my experience with Ash, I just didn't feel like having sex. I hadn't told my friends about what happened, because I was ashamed. I was embarressed. I was afraid they would judge me. So, I had no idea how to explain this to a stranger. I told him maybe, and we set up a day to meet.

I didn't show up. The day after, Chris texted me saying he had just went to the clinic to get tested. He asked if I was still interested. I didn't know what to say. I didn't think he would go this far. I didn't know why he still wanted to talk to me. I kind of wished he would just leave me alone. But part of me trusted him a little more because he went through the trouble of getting tested. 

The best I could muster up was, ""Something not so great happened to me before I started talking to you. I'm nervous it will happen again."" He told me he wanted to take me out to dinner to show me he wasn't just some ""horny guy"". He wasn't ""like the guys in the past."" He said he thought I was cool. I trusted him. But I shouldn't have. He never asked me any questions to get to know me. He didn't know me. He just wanted me to trust him.  

I agreed. I told him I wanted to take him out to dinner instead for being so cold at the beginning. I wanted to make it up to him. I then asked him if he wanted to hang out that night. Just smoke, chill, play video games. He said yes. We hung out, he was really nice. He didn't make me feel pressured. We ended up making out and I gave him a blowjob. Nothing else. 

I had gotten tested. I had recently opened up to my friend Sarah about what happened with Ash. She told me I had been assaulted. I still don't know how to feel about it. Chris and I made plans to get dinner. I asked him if he was completely okay with it since we were just fwb. I didn't want to cross any boundaries, or make him uncomfortable. He said he was okay with it. We started to sext, and he asked if we could fuck. I said ""Like I said, something not so great happened, I wouldn't feel comfortable with that until I get my results back."" He finally asked me what happened. 

I opened up to this complete stranger, I don't know why. I wanted to tell him the truth. I told him I would understand if he didn't want to talk anymore. His reply was ""Yeah, I can use a condom."" I said thank you. At that point, I guess I didn't feel human anymore. The next day, I asked if Chris was still interested in me taking him out to dinner. He blew me off in the end. I'm sad.

Every date would get longer and more interesting. On the third date, we were watching this final at her place and I made a move (tried to kiss her) while I was at her place. She rejected it and was like 'wow', I then said that I don't do friendzone and she went for a hug and was all confused about it. She told me that she was feeling weird about how it would develop at work and she wouldn't be able to show her real emotions.

We work in different departments so we essentially see each other maybe for 5 minutes at work everyday. Me being stupid, I kept hanging with her (for an entire month) and we kept having so much fun, she would always come back to my place to chill and all. Last week at a party we were talking and then went back to my place to finish a serious conversation. I essentially told her that I can't keep going this way and that it wouldn't be sustainable in the long run. I also told her that meant that we can't ""hang out"" anymore and that I wanted to properly ""date her"". She then asked me if I had feelings for her and I said ""what do you think?"". Obviously I did develop feelings after so much hanging out.

She started crying and went into full freeze crash. Gave me ""puppy eyes"" and kept reiterating if I really didn't want to hang out with her anymore. It kept going like this for maybe 2 hours on my bed where she didn't know what to do (to date or not I guess). At one point I started feeling bad and I hugged her and she just kept crying in my arms.

She then texted me the next day about her ""thinking of me"" and how ""sorry"" she was and that she understands that I needed space but that it was so hard for her and also about putting me in this situation after the first rejection and telling me how ""special"" I am to her. I haven't texted her and kept it real cool at work for a couple of days and I'm not planning to.

I made it obvious from my behaviour that I wasn't interested, after we finished the drinks off we walk back to the station and I don't know whether it was anger or whatever but something came over me and I told her clearly ""You do not look like your pictures."" She was like 'Ooh the truth comes out then!' and asked me to elaborate. I didn't want to be like 'well...you're fat.' so I said I'm sorry I can't do this and left promptly.

However, it's more my personality to be exclusive with somebody, and I think that's what my heart wants... so I got on some apps and made lots of connections, but I'm finding myself to be way too picky with who I talk to. I've met several girls I know my past self would've loved; they're beautiful, kind, and fun to be around, but I just don't want them and I'm unsure why. They expressed interest in me and I turned them down without giving them much of a chance, saying I'm not interested in something exclusive before I led them on. I have rational reasons to be picky with girlfriends: inevitable transitions like going away to grad school in a few years, having a lack of time while in architecture school, and at this point I'm only interested in a relationship if they could potentially be someone I spend my life with. But I think a part of me thinks that's bullshit. I feel like I'm becoming shallow and distant against my will, like there's a battle between the irrational bit of me and the rational that I've never dealt with before. I'm 21 and male.

I guess what I'm hoping for is advice on how to navigate dating with so many questions about the future. Where will I be for grad school in a few years, and is it worth putting in time for something that might end solely because I move across the country? If I don't date now in college will I risk not finding anyone after? Can I give enough time and energy into somebody while I'm swamped with projects? Should I give more girls chances? There's so much happening, and I don't know whether to follow my heart and find someone or to focus on my future like my head is telling me to.

Historically, he’s not a great texter and he’s very inconsistent. He will sometimes go 24 hours without responding, or he’ll be super responsive. In person, he was personable and funny, very different from his dry texting personality (not unusual). Full disclosure: I suggested the second date last week and he responded immediately, saying that this past weekend wasn’t great, but he asked if we could do it this week and suggested a specific day. 

My immediate thought was that he was brushing me off, but I’d imagine that if that were the case, he would have just canceled without suggesting that we meet up later in the day. I’m kind of conflicted about how I’m feeling. I obviously went to see him again, otherwise I wouldn’t have suggested a second date.

48,pc8j40,1630011754,Clingy by instinct and trying to fix it-- I give off red flags and don't feel that I'm worthy of the patience it takes to stay.,"I'm 21f and this past week, my 19m partner did something that triggered my abandonment issues and anxious attachment style. He didn't even do anything wrong at all; he just wasn't able to hang out and didn't give a reason why. I didn't ask him to give a reason and I don't particularly need him to give a reason. I know he still likes me; all the reasons I've spotted that he doesn't are just ""proof"" that I relate to past relationships that ended, and not necessarily good indicators of a secure and healthy relationship-- which I feel this has the potential to be.

I don't feel that I've been outwardly clingy, but I made the mistake of looking up those articles-- you know, the ones that are all ""how to spot a clingy girlfriend"" and ""big red flags that she's clingy."" I noticed that I ticked off a lot of them, but the energy is always matched: yes, we text every day and I usually initiate, but we typically go about two hours between texts. Yes, I'm too accommodating trying to learn about his interests, but I'm also intentionally focusing on the things that make me happy and my own hobbies. Yes, I do want to move too fast on making things official, but I'm also holding myself back and being considerate of the pacing that we've both set together.

I can't help but think, though, that perhaps I've already come off as the clingy girl. I've asked him to hang out twice in a week, but both times he was busy. After we slept together for the first time on Friday, I held his hand while we were waiting to be seated for breakfast. I've visited him at work (although I did actually have a valid reason to be there other than him). I keep thinking to myself, ""Okay, he's spotted the red flags about me. Now he's going to leave.""

I don't know if these actually are red flags or not, but I keep holding myself back. Every time I do something with him that I perceive as clingy, I apologize because I think he's annoyed by it, and the apologies I know are eventually going to annoy him. It's such a frustrating, anxiety-inducing balance beam. I do something that I want to do, and then I realize it's too much, and then I apologize, and then the apology is too much, and so on. But these are all perceived; he's never once indicated that I'm too much or too needy. It's all in my head.

I want to communicate this with him; I trust him enough to communicate this with him. I want to tell him that I'm honestly a mess inside and ask of him to be patient enough with me to stick around. But I'm worried that communicating my fears of being too much will simply drive him away, because what if he's actually okay with me as I am and it's not the red flags he's scared away by, but the overthinking?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pc8j40/clingy_by_instinct_and_trying_to_fix_it_i_give/
49,pc8jcl,1630011775,Seeing male [28M] and I [27F] think it might be over. Thoughts?,"I've been talking to this male for 8 months. We talk on the phone at all hours of the day, like seriously 6 hours a day. I was going to visit him and see him in person for the third time on my way back to moving in with family and starting essentially a new life 12 hours away from where I currently live.

Lately, we've been talking about sex more than usual. I told him I would love to sleep with him in October when he comes to visit me in Chicago. Then, I mentioned visiting with him in Tennessee since I said I could stop for a night on my to all my life changes. This would happen over labor day weekend.

I realized that after talking with him I was maybe moving too fast. I had only ever seen him twice in person before and we hadn't even made out (only a peck on the lips) and here I was talking about losing my virginity to him. We weren't in a relationship. He wanted to get us a room with a hot tub to hang out nude in.

I mentioned that maybe we should just stick to kissing, cuddling, making out, and if anything else happened, then let it fall as it may. He completely shut down and started getting quiet. I told him that I wasn't saying no, just not yet because of all the other anxieties/stress happening in my life.

I asked what was wrong and he told me that I was playing with his emotions. I told him that I was sorry and that it was most likely my anxiety.

I have two anxiety disorders. I'm moving across the country, getting rid of everything I own. My car is broken down. I have little money. I have OCD in the middle of a pandemic. I'm starting a new ""big girl"" job soon. I'm moving in with my family. I am also packing all in the next week.

I told him that I wasn't sure I could commit to adding a new sexual relationship to the list of anxieties quite yet because I'm still a virgin and we aren't in a relationship all while moving my life across country, starting a new career, moving in with family, getting rid of everything I own, and dealing with anxiety disorders.

He freaked out, shut down, and started crying. He said he wasn't sure he wanted to come see me in Chicago in October because he was afraid it wasn't going to happen. I told him that it would happen just not in September because I'm stressed the fuck out, so we agreed that I wouldn't come in September, but now he's not even wanting to meet me in October since I won't agree to having sex with him right away because I want to make sure I'm comfortable physically with him before committing to agreeing to sex.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pc8jcl/seeing_male_28m_and_i_27f_think_it_might_be_over/

56,pc995d,1630014019,What does it mean when a girl reaches out after needing space?,"A girl told me she needed space and I thought she wasn't ever gonna text me again. Normally when a girl says ""I need space"" that translates to I'm not interested. 

We didn't date exclusively but went on a few dates and talked from March to now. In July at like the 4 month mark, I was confused and didn't know what we were. We hadn't talked about expectations or intentions ever. That's partially my fault, she didn't ever talk about that either.

We agreed we didn't want anything serious at the time but we both agreed we wanted to continue going on dates to feel it out. 

We met on hinge. Apparently I'm one of the only people she's actually felt comfortable enough meeting on a dating app, but she goes out a lot with friends. She's a little younger than me. I'm 23 and 20. 


For a few weeks she had been backing away and I noticed it and voiced my feelings about it. She told me she needed space and I honored that. 

2 days ago, she texted me out of the blue. We hadn't talked at all in 3 weeks, full no contact. 

There is a show she talked me into watching and she texted me about it. She texted me telling me the new season was out. Caught me completely off guard. I responded and she texted me back the next morning. She texted me late at night. 

I then asked her if she's started it yet and she never replied. I texted her back 7 hours later because i was working at my new job and phone time is limited. She never replied when I asked if she had started it or not. 

Do I wanna reconnect? Yeah maybe. I want to do what we had been, feeling it out for potential and whatnot. I like her. 

I don't know what this deal was about. She had been with friends an hour before she texted me because I saw her snap stories. Should I reach out to her in a couple days?

57,pc9a09,1630014094,Going from dating to relationship?,"So, once again talking about myself (25M) and a girl I've been going out with (23F) for almost two months by now. 

At this point I stopped counting our dates. We have been talking daily for the whole time, enjoying our time together, planning stuff for the future. I told her I really like her and I don't mind waiting for her to feel ready for sex, and she told me she likes me too. Kissing and touching (first base) while making out happened, but nothing else. 

Throughout this period she's been referring to me as her friend. I poked a bit of fun at her for this, she told me that of course I'm not really just a friend, but indeed (and we agree on this) we are not a couple. She told me she's just going with the flow right now, which I guess is pretty up for interpretation. 

I've been ok with being just two people dating/hanging out so far, but I'd like to suggest being more. Like, actually being a couple. The reasoning is that i really like her, I have been liking her more and more with time, and I think I could see myself being with her in a long term relationship.

I see two issues with this. 
1. Lack of physical intimacy; this is her first experience of this kind, so right now we are going slow from that point of view. Better to wait for this to evolve?
2. Future perspectives: we just finished college, so we might be moving. I'd be willing to adapt (as in, if I find a good job where she does, why not? I don't really have a dream job that I'd be abandoning), but I haven't told her as I'm scared it may freak her out. 

Should I shoot my shot in the next week, or take it easy and postpone?

Also obligatory: I'm from Europe, we don't really have an exclusivity talk separate from a relationship talk. From what's worth, i told her that I'm not dating other people nor I want to, and she told me that she is not going out with others either (though she was not too clear on not wanting to).",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pc9a09/going_from_dating_to_relationship/

Althought we are still learning about eachother and enjoying it, we can still hold eachother accountable and communicate very directly and openly. 

Currently, we live 1.5 hours from eachother (this is OK due to where we live in the US). This coming weekend, I suggested we spend Friday evening/Saturday morning together before school starts for him on Monday. He's a bit stressed and mentioned that Friday night he wanted to take advantage of having an empty house to play video games with his brother and relax before school starts Monday.

I was a tad hurt at first but after talking it through, I was okay with the situation and would rather my partner be happy than stressed. I felt like I took the high-road on this one and didn't get all pouty over it. We settled on a Saturday day hangout, but it will be short lived due to previous set plans.


All is well, but I know this will happen again and I don't want to change my partner by any means but I know I want a healthy balance for both of us. Mind you, I do not play video games and don't plan on ever being interested in them...

So I just wanted to post here that online dating can be really tricky, especially if you are into BDSM, have any trauma surrounding abuse or anything like that that can make you more vulnerable to abusive people. Please be careful. I had the worst experience with someone from a dating app (Tinder). This person basically uses BDSM as a loophole to be abusive. This person completely broke me down mentally (also be careful of people who have been through military boot camp or work for any intelligence sector of the military or anything like that because some use their knowledge of psychology for evil instead of good, even in their personal lives). Then, to add insult to injury, he has also chosen to propagate a smear campaign against me, full of complete lies and misinformation about me in order to discredit me and anything I may say about him. These are the types who are one type of person in public and with most people around them but completely different people when it comes to their victims. I had a very scary experience with this person and it's been extremely hard to come back from it, especially since these people will not only manipulate and gaslight you and make it seem like you are a willing participant but they will do the same with your friends and family to turn them against you if you say anything about them. This man was literally threatening to sue me for slander and libel like some delusional egomaniac just for seeking support from friends and private Facebook groups.

So I’ve suffered with anxiety and social phobia for a long time, well basically it all started while I was working with the public (to its extreme) 20 years ago, then while trying to fit in with life I got attacked while out by a bunch of guys in some random trophy attack, so my mental health took a huge hit. 

On top of that friends weren’t really friends and girls used me a lot, so I started locking myself inside 2003 until I had a breakdown. 

I managed to get some therapy and I came out of my shell a bit, worked from home selling video games etc did ok for the best part and it gave me a little life.

As things do everything changes throw the years, I gave up with a social life and kept things basic, never even expected to meet anyone etc.

18 years pass (very quickly) and all of a sudden this beautiful girl comes into my life, we just hit things off like you wouldn’t believe, spent every spare minute together, even when she was working she had breaks every 30 minutes and we spent them together. 

We were in love, well I was anyway, 1 year and 5 months, it was nothing I’ve ever had before, then I was watching my dads health change rapidly and it was horrible to watch, doctors were ignoring him and I was stuck, within a month he died of a brain tumour on May 12th.

My life fell apart, I had to take care of so much as you can imagine and my head was in so many places, the girl was always on my mind and I often cried thinking about how am I going to make her happy too… so I took a silent break for a month, I come back to her and explain that I didn’t want my emotions to effect us and I apologised. Sadly in that time I found out she was acting different and she never told me she loved me anymore, so I ask whats going on and she said I needed to “chill out” etc then the next thing she says she’s moving…..",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pc9zq3/the_big_dead_end/

67,pca3v2,1630016746,How often do your feelings of romance come and go for a person?,"When it comes to forming new relationships, I am really struggling and have been for a while. 
I am a 31(f) and have spent from 17-27 in a long term relationship. My relationship wasn’t toxic and I didn’t come out of it damaged. I just felt that the person and I outgrew one another and we split on amicable terms. 

At first, I was super excited to be single. And I still love it. That is kind of the problem. Now, I am finding that I have difficulty finding anything that lasts. (Even though I crave an intimate bond more now). Since my breakup, I’ve dated two people whom I thought I could potentially love, but with each I felt my love come in more horrific and unstable “waves”. I can’t seem to find any emotionally stability and I’m starting to really resent it. 

Now, I know that love has its ups and downs but I don’t remember having such downswing momentum’s before. 

The waves go something like: I feel for them, I miss them if I haven’t talked to them in a while, once I see them my feeling of love really peaks and I fly high for a day or two, then on the decline we go. After excitement of me seeing them passes I’m left feeling nothing, even a slight dislike for the person. I don’t particularly care to talk to them. For a while too. I may even feel irritable with them(although I’m great at not taking it out on them). This lasts, unfortunately, longer than the feelings of flying high. I genuinely don’t want to see that person too often or else I end up feeling numb, bored and suffocated. I do eventually recharge emotionally and miss them again, but I really need lots of space to do that. I feel like it wouldn’t be fair to the person if we were in an actual relationship. 

I have considered that maybe it’s the people Ive dated. Maybe I feel like they feel similarly about me so it’s this energy that I’m reflecting back. Maybe I’m trying to hold back my feelings for them thus it ends up overcorrecting itself into hatred. Both of the people I really liked were complicated relationships with odds not in our favor. I’m curious if I’m doing that on purpose. At times I feel like I crave that misery of those odds-against-us relationships. Has anyone else experienced this swing of emotion which has hindered their ability to truly connect with someone because their feelings about the person fluctuate so much? Or maybe it’s totally normal and I’m just not really ready for the commitment (again) through these times when I’m ‘bleh’ about the the person.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pca3v2/how_often_do_your_feelings_of_romance_come_and_go/

I know this already SEEMS creepy (and probably is), but for the last few days, I've been telling myself that if I follow her and say something along the lines of ""hey, I apologize in advance and will totally leave you alone if this comes off as creepy, but I saw you on tinder and thought you were exceptional, we have x and y in common, and couldn't talk myself out of not following"" (paraphrased), that I would have a chance at a date/not creeping her out. 
This is something I've never done before and think im an attractive enough guy. 
Do I shoot my shot? Or is this move irredeemably creepy?

72,pca8rk,1630017192,No dating experience or relationship experience,So I’m 20 years old I still live at home I have a intellectual disability I have had tinder on and off for the last few years I did meet this one girl a few weeks ago and I thought things were going really well. So we had a date planned the minute I told her the movie times she completely lied to me and said she didn’t know if she wanted to go. So I suggested coffee instead! And then she said she probably was going to go camping next week. Next thing I knew she blocked me on Snapchat and if anyone’s asking if I did anything weird or say something out of the norm I did not she completely played me. I did see her profile back on tinder and bumble saying she was looking for something serious and I Kinda laughed saying to myself wow now you’re looking for something serious! Anyway I have matched with two girls ever since but I’m worried with my lack of dating or relationship experience is going to fuck it up I still haven’t had my first kiss as well and I’m really insecure about that,dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pca8rk/no_dating_experience_or_relationship_experience/
73,pcacf4,1630017528,It’s your personality (+ self respect).,"I feel like a huge chunk of these posts are men complaining about how women “only care about looks”. They say they want to hear “the real truth” so I’m gonna say it right here and now; It’s your personality and your own self respect.

If you are here complaining about how people are superficial and nobody likes you cause you’re unattractive what you are really trying to do is project the blame onto something you can’t control; ex. your looks. By blaming something out of your hands you’re deflecting the fact that you have a lot you can work on that you can actually change, but you just choose not to do it.

You need to take a step back and instead of analyzing and nitpicking everyone around you, analyze yourself, shifting the blame to things you can’t control isn’t going to get you anywhere.

Sometimes even if we have good personality, we do things to sabotage ourselves which makes dating impossible or a bad experience, but once again that’s something you do have control over. Use that power to improve not just the dating scene, but your life.

It is you, but that doesn’t mean you’re a bad person, it means you have room to grow as ALL of us do. Work on respecting yourself enough to not be put in positions where someone claims your looks are bad, work on being the person someone wants to be around. It’s not easy, but blaming things that you can’t control isn’t going to change anything and it isn’t healthy. You deserve someone who will truly find your attractive and if the people you are meeting don’t think so then that’s all you need to walk away and continue to look for the people who do. And that is the cold hard truth.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pcacf4/its_your_personality_self_respect/

Women feared they'd be beaten, raped, or killed.   


Granted this study was at least 10 years ago, but I don't think things have changed substantially.

88,pcbhil,1630021444,Girlfriend (25F) casually mentioned she tried anal sex before she met me and now I (25M)) feel like shit.,"Me and my girlfriend (both 25) have been dating for about 15 months and things have been great. We communicate well, always have fun, have the same goals and our sex life is pretty good too. She moved in with me last month.

Our sex life is pretty good. On average we have sex two times a week. We can talk openly about sex and we both said multiple times that everything is open to talk about, including things we want to try. We do have a consensus about our sexual past, we both have our past and that’s fine, but we don’t see the need to share the details with each other.

Yesterday we had some pillow talk and i referred back to a drinking game card which had me ask her whether she’d prefer a threesome or anal. I skipped over the question after asking it back then but I mentioned it again in the context of ‘those are not things I’m into’. She then said that she did try anal in the past. I then reminded her of our understanding not the share details and we left it at that.

I didn’t make a point out of it but I’ve been feeling like shit since. I really don’t have an interest in trying anal but knowing that someone else did it with her makes me so jealous that I don’t even want to touch her anymore. It’s completely illogical but I have images in my head that I can’t erase even if I want to.

What should I do? I don’t want to come across as insecure by talking about this again but I hate that I know this.

I'm still that shy person, however if someone shows interest in wanting to have a conversation even if just for a few minutes or something I'd always be up for that....

We talk off and on and sometimes if not for 15 minutes, I've been incredibly hesitant to give her my number, however I made not one attempt but I made 2.

The second time I handed her my number alongside my name attached to it. And I never received a text. So I figured she may have looked my name up and saw something that she didn't like.

A couple days passed with no text and not seeing her for a couple of days, we get to today and I go in and I was minding my own business and she came up to me and said good morning/afternoon.

I then joked with him since he hugged my elder coworker after she playfully scolded him for not missing her too. I basically joked that he didn’t miss me because he didn’t hug me like he hugged her, and he said. “Noooo, I missed you so much. You’re special to me BBHYUNG.” After this, while I was waiting for my ride, he was fake crying about me leaving since we don’t see each other much and I told him that it’s because he only works nights, so he said that he’ll try to pick up early shifts and before I left, we hugged goodbye.
