I weight the same but look bigger, lost some muscle mass. But even skinnier back in 2019, I still never got attention from guys. Did I look better back then or do I look the same or better now?

The very first days we wouldn’t talk too much but then we talked nearly every day. If we didn’t talk for a couple of days she would say she missed me. Our conversations were very interesting. She said to me she had never met a girl like me, so intellectually and physically attractive. 

At some point I felt something was off, and she tells me she feels there is something she is not giving to me, like I need more. Which wasn’t the case. I asked her what was going on and she confessed very traumatic stuff about her childhood. Asks me what is that I want and I tell her that I don’t know yet because we haven’t met but that it‘s very easy to fall for her. She says she had on her Tinder that she wanted casual. (Even though she also complained about people only wanting sex in the casual framework). She also tells me that she only ends up in relationships because men pursue her so much, not because she initially wants or falls for anyone. That she only fell in love once and it was uncomfortable. Her last ex cheated on her, so she has a lot of trust issues, together with past trauma with men. She also told me she had never been in a relationship with a woman but wanted to try, yet was scared of what people may think, specially her dad, as her mother is a lesbian and her dad hates her for it. We agree we will give each other time and space, and meet up when I’m back to the country, as I was on a long holiday During covid with family. 

Truth is that we would continue engaging on social media and writing each other from time to time. If I put a selfie or something on social media she would write me in awe with my beauty, as per her messages. Also loved my poems, etc. 

At some point, I was very confused and not too clear, as all this conversations happened via WhatsApp. I had a panick attack and wrote her asking if I could call her. She was out with a friend but called me. Then went home and we talked again. She tells me she just wants to be friends yet she also tells me that she has imagined me naked many times and also that she would definitely bang me. 

I am not sure about you guys but I wouldn’t say that about a friend. I was in so much pain and so emotionally confused for so many different reasons (family, identity crisis, work, trauma as well, etc) that I asked her to block me and I deleted her from all social media accounts. She said she was very sad and that she didn’t want to continue talking that night. She didn’t block me, I asked her, and then she did up to this day. I’m still blocked. 

I reached out to her in several ocassions, one of them when I was truly sad, where I opened up to her, and she never replied.

Hi, how are you? I don't know how to get straight to the point or make sure my question is understandable. I love myself but I do battle with internal feelings just like anyone else. My most insecurity is my brain in other words my mind. I have invisible disabilites and many times I do want to cry. It is not easy because I feel like it is hard to be understood or to understand others. I'm a female who is in her 20's. I have a psychologist and psychoatrist so I'm also in medications. I was born with my brain partially damage. I was not going to survive when my mom was pregnant but I did live and later I was interned at the hospital for many months because I was dying.

 

So, I was born prematurely and I was born with my brain partially damage especially in my frontal lobe part of the brain. I have outbursts, anxiety, and I do not see consequences. I do feel feelings but I do not understand many things. It is hard for me to read body language or facial expressions. People have to explain to me the same things in simpler ways because I do not understand they way people explain things or communicate. I also drink medication for memory and for other stuff. Besides this I also focus on my hobbies and I exercise and I am very busy with work. To me dating is a topic that makes me have fear.

 

I do wish I could date but I am afraid of relationships. My parents had a very traumatic relationship and divorce. And then there were custody problems. My dad won the custody but later my sisters found the truth and who he actually is so they left him. I left my dad when I graduated from high school then I moved in with my sister. Now I live with my mom and her family. My mom has helped me very much. I do not have a good relationship with my dad but there is no right or wrong on raising a son or daughter. There isn't a bible of how to raise kids so for that reason I do not blame him.

 

Now I live with my mom and I have to believe that relationships are possible because my mom has a good relationship with my stepdad. I cannot think of the past because I need to let go of the past. But I am very afraid of falling in love and dating someone. I do not want to have children even though my mom wants me too. I do want to have kids in the future but I will not let that happen. I saw the way my parents struggle to raise me because of my invisible disabilities. And I do not want to have kids then I will hurt them. It is not easy and that is a fear I have. I don't want others to struggle because of me.

 

I have emotional rollercoasters. People have said that I am not malicious and that I do not have common sense. And my mind is that of a younger person. But my family tell me that I am still beautiful in the inside. How can I get over the fear of dating? And advice?

-she has been tied up during sex
-she has done (pills) only 2 times supposedly
-she has a kid (girl 7yrs)
-her ex boyfriend is an alcoholic and does drugs but still communicates with him
-she still lives with her parents

-she bought a brand new vehicle but was working places like hotels. I'm sure most of her check goes towards her payment and insurance.

-we are going on a 4hr trip to visit meow wolf and she wants a really nice hotel. (it has to have an indoor pool and jacuzzi)
- she said she spent about $115 on makeup one time

1) I want to find a way to fight overtexting or being anxious when she doesn't reply right away
2) I would love to see if she would sometimes text as much as I do. I know she's having a tough time right now, but reciprocation is important when things are normal.

If you think you are one of those people who ""doesn't do what other people on dating apps do"", then kudos to you. You are in the ""good minority"".  I've had good success (3 dates a week with these rules and 2 relationships - that didn't end sourly) and failures (3 dates in 6 months by being too honest). This post is based on my experiences on dating apps and 50+ dates between 2017 and 2020 Dec and talking to hundreds of people on dating apps / calls.  Just because you don't approve, doesn't mean things aren't hard for average guys out there... And they can't always be honest.   


Note : This advice will ensure that you miss out on the 10-20 percent of women on OLD and applies to OLD only based on my (and my friends') experiences. 

***""Be Yourself"" is bad advice for average dudes. Do not be yourself.***  
Dating is a minefield. When people have options, they will reject you even for the smallest of reasons. He is too available. He is too agreeable. He tries too hard.. He doesn't put any effort at all. He took me to an expensive place.. He took me to an average place... He said this.. He said that... He didn't initiate touch.. He initiated touch that made me uncomfortable.. He is not a good kisser.. He has a small - apartment.. If you are too honest and be yourself, AKA lacking game, you are bound to fail.  OLD is a game without rules, sure, you can play it with honesty if you are in the top 10-20 percent of guys. If you are just average or above average dude, without game, you'll struggle to get 1 good date a month.  Below points / answers are the things that has gotten me multiple dates in the past. If you don't like pretending like you are important, then feel free to ignore this post. 

&amp;#x200B;

***1. How has your experience been on this app?***  
A:  You should always say it's going well. Put it casually like - \*It's going good\*. Do not elaborate. Do not talk about how hard it is for average guys to get dates. Do not talk about getting ghosted. She is there because she thinks you are in the top 20 percent. Any hint that shows that you aren't in it is game over.  Nobody cares about your struggle, they all want the ""awesome guys"" out there. Very few want to settle for the average dude.

&amp;#x200B;

***2. How many matches do you usually have?***  
A: \*A few\*.  Do not elaborate. Never complain. 

&amp;#x200B;

***3.  How many dates you've been to this year (or past couple of months)? :***  
A:  A few.  Do not elaborate. If she asks for a number, make it 2 to 3 dates a month.  If asked about why you aren't in a relationship,  just say ""I didn't find someone interesting"". Never mention that you don't go on many dates..   


***4. Never tell them that you are a virgin. They will think that you are a sad loser and in the bottom 10 percent. Game over.***

&amp;#x200B;

***5. Last time you had sex?***  
A: A couple of weeks ago.. Nothing more than a month. You haven't had sex in 3 years?. That's fine. You need them to believe that you have easy access to sex to get sex. 

&amp;#x200B;

***6. What are you looking for?***  
A: \*Something long-term. Always, something long-term\*. Average guys don't get picked for FWBs or casual dating. Online dating makes hot guys accessible to everyone.. Imagine having the option to get a free Ferrari or a free Corolla. What would most people prefer?. Average guys are like corollas, nobody picks them over a Ferrari / Bentley.. A lot of people won't approve of this.  But I would rather say this lie and go on a few dates that could lead to something (long term or short term) than be honest and not get a hug or a date for a year. It's not a fair game. An average guy can't play it fairly if he wants to get anything out of it.. 

&amp;#x200B;

***7. Questions about your ex, family, job?***  
A: You don't dislike any of them. They are all ""OK"". Your ex tried to set your house on fire?. That's okay - She was lovely. Nobody likes a whiner. Don't complain about anything. You can disagree with her. In fact, you should disagree with her sometimes.

&amp;#x200B;

8. If you can find productive things to do, that's awesome. ***Else, act like you are bus***y. One thing that turns women off is an average looking guy who is always available.  Do not respond to texts too frequently. When someone has options, replying too frequently comes off as ""being clingy and too available"".

&amp;#x200B;

9. Don't agree with her always. If you feel like you are agreeing too much, force a disagreement on a minor issue. I've been rejected a few times because I've been too agreeable and that's apparently a turn off too.  If she likes nachos, you can say - \*Nachos are okay, but not great\* if you both liked the last few things you spoke about.

Are we not human. I took this girl out. On the date at the movies I slowed her down.

I wanted to make sure she wanted this for her and not that she felt the need.  I tried to talk to her about her moving fast after the movie. She said she wasnt doing that then. Then later she texts me and said she was.Then I had an emotional breakdown. Traumatic family life caught up with me (after keeping it locked away for so long) to me I felt safe with her and I let it out. I told her this is the worst part of my life and I'm sorry she saw that. I said I didn't want her to fix me I just wanted her with me.Then she blocks me we talk again. Asks for my snap chat says she not looking for anything then blocks me. Then she flirts and gets close to me all day. She looks scared like she wants to trust me but won't from her past. She says shes to crazy for me but I want that. I don't get it I'm push so hard cause our chemistry is so good we get along so well. I met her at work everyone in the building sees it but her. How do I get her to her to understand I am not that f**king A**hole who cheater on her. I catch her looking at me watching me but when I look at her in the eyes she looks away. Like she wants me but she won't give herself a chance.
I would give her as many chances as it takes but she either won't give us one or herself one. She won't say anything even though I know she wants too. I don't get it this girl I have never felt like this before so quick. Like its my soul mate or something. Everything is calm with her and on fire in the best possible way I get a focused picture of what I have to do in my life. This has been going on for a few months of back and forth. I don't know anymore. She's going to school a few hours away in a 2 weeks I could drive or catch a plane no issue. If she wasn't looking for anything she wouldn't have said yes. I made it very clear I wanted her for her and it want an hook up or using her. Its so confusing I don't know what to do anymore. I tired to stop caring and I can't the only confort I can get right now I writing letters about her and some for her.
Everyone my age has told me to forget her and f**k anything with a pluse. Everyone older is telling me to move on. But no one was there with us. She got me that night I got her. Then everything went to shit. So quick and we tied to pick up the peices but she won't give it another go.

Looking for some advice re: a guy I’m dating. Much appreciated!

So, for context: I (28F) met a man (30M) on a dating app in late April when I back in my hometown, visiting my parents. I was set to fly back to my city in May, spend the month packing, and move back to my hometown for the summer on June 1. I had tentative plans to move to Europe at the end of August and I shared this with him. 

Over text we hit it off and began speaking primarily over the phone within two days. He’d call every night and we’d chat for hours. We didn’t have time to see each other before I left, so we spent the whole month of May getting to know each other via phone calls and FaceTime. It was during this time that we established that we weren’t going to be talking to or seeing other people. He initiated this. 

When I returned in June, I received a message from him a few days before we were supposed to meet. It was long but here’s the most important bit: 

“Knowing that most likely that you are going to be going away in the next few months and knowing that i have a lot on my plate and trying to figure and puzzle things in with my career and all i dont want to put myself in a situation where im left in the unknown and at the end im kicking myself mentally about it. I need to protect myself emotionally and mentally in the long run. In terms of a relationship I don't think i would be totally ready for it, it really does not have to do anything with you, its just my own problems that i want to figure out. I still want to hang out over the summer because you really are someone that i have connected with but at the same time i need to strive and complete myself before putting myself in that type of situation”

I told him I was okay with just meeting and seeing how things go. I mean, I hadn’t even met him yet. It felt like a slight rejection, but whatever, I didn’t know if I wanted him to be my boyfriend anyway. 

That week, we met for the first time and it was… electric. Having already made an emotional connection, I felt so close to him already. The banter was off the charts. He is so attractive too, and has so many qualities that I am looking for in a man. Not only is the spark and attraction there, but he is ambitious, smart, funny, gainfully employed, from a good family, and owns his own car and a $600,000 rental home. He also makes me feel beautiful and wanted. 

Since our first meeting, we see each other consistently once per week. He will block out an entire Friday or Saturday for me and we’ll have an amazing 8-hour date—usually drinks, an activity (beach, walk, etc.), a nice dinner, followed by a really hot make-out session in his car. He pays 95% of the time. The dates are incredible and we connect so well. We haven’t slept together yet, but there has been some occasional oral sex here and there.

While I love spending time with him in person (it seriously gets better and better), I feel so distant from him during the week. We’re both at our parents’ houses temporarily and I live about 1hr 20 mins outside of the city and away from him. We’ll be getting our own apartments in Sept/Oct, about a 10 min drive from each other, so this will change.

He’s also self-employed with an unpredictable weekday work schedule, which makes meeting up during the week even more difficult to plan out. But he’s been calling me much less (maybe once every other day) and doesn’t text me out of the blue as often. 

I can deal with these feelings of insecurity because I know our distance is coming to an end very soon and we should be able to meet up more often and more spontaneously. 

What I’m mainly concerned about is that I’m beginning to fall in love with him and I don’t know if he has more clarity on what he’s looking for. Remember his text message to me about how he’s “not ready for a relationship”? That was OK in the beginning when I didn’t know him IRL, but now it’s been two months of in-person dating and I don’t know if his thinking has changed. I’m also not moving to Europe because my request to work from there was denied, and I told him this in mid-June. I’m not going anywhere. 

It’s also confusing because we are dating each other exclusively—we’re not seeing or texting anyone else and we’ve both deleted the dating apps. So what’s the difference between this and the label of a “relationship”?

He’s also mentioned he’s felt “lost and indecisive” over the past year—mainly to do with his career and wanting to make a change, but I wonder if it has something to do with his ex, too… He broke up with his girlfriend of 3 years in May 2020 as she wanted to get married and have children like yesterday, but he wasn’t ready for that yet—not until his career is completely sorted. He ended things because it wasn’t fair to her to wait and since then he’s been channeling more energy into his own thing. 

All together this boils down to me just not feeling settled in what we have. We’re supposed to have an overnight date this weekend—which I initiated—and while I would love to be intimate with him, I want him to have an open heart about me. I want him to see me as someone who he could have a committed relationship with. 

So…how exactly should I proceed? My goal is an LTR with this man. I know that pushing him will make him run, so I’m planning on just letting him continue to lead the relationship. Our last date was the best yet. He was so touchy-feely with me and he talked about plans for future dates. I know he wants to continue seeing me at this current capacity and level. But I want more. How do I make this happen? 

On the flip side, though, am I just wasting my time with him? I go back-and-forth between wanting to tell him how I feel (and risk scaring him away) vs. waiting it out a more few months until I’ve moved closer to him (assuming we’re still “together” by then). 

TLDR: I’m in a more serious situationship and I want more. Not sure if he does. What do I do?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,923539,public,self,How to proceed with the man I’m dating?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ot1skm/how_to_proceed_with_the_man_im_dating/,all_ads,6,,

I have been with her for a little under a year now and we love each other quite deeply (so breaking up is completely out of the question), but it's only been in the last 6-7 months that she has mentioned hearing voices and has made it slip that she 'talks' to them; Originally, she told me she only started hearing them last year and only when she was playing an instrument (we both practice in a conservatory) did she really hear them intensely ""singing"" along with the music; Now however, she tells me that they've been there since around the time she was 16 or so and that she doesn't want to get treated for it, since it doesn't inhibit her.

My question is: What should I do? She really is hostiile to the idea of medication and admittingly I have heard her talk to the voices in the bathroom before and they don't seem hostile. It just seems like she's talking to a friend or something. How can I be most supportive? summary/question

So last weekend I was out in line for a pretty popular nightclub/bar. I was with some friends of mine, but they got tired of waiting and decided to go back to the hotel. I decided to stay in the line and go in by myself. In front of me in the line were two girls who noticed that I was ditched and asked me what happened. They couldn’t believe I was ditched and invited me to come inside the bar with them. During which I got to know them a little bit. Once we finally got inside, they both asked for my Snapchat. All was good and they even bought me my drinks. They even “cheers’d me” for being “new friends”. They said they were going to get pizza after and they’d love for me to join them so I did. I decided to buy them their pizza. At this point I was pretty drunk and they said thank you for the pizza and I just kind of left to go back to the hotel without saying bye. I did text one of them afterwards saying it was nice meeting them and they said nice meeting me too and to enjoy the rest of my time in the city. I haven’t texted any of them since, as I’m scared they were just being nice. I do like one of them and want to get to know them better. I am essentially just hoping they’ll text me first.

Then tonight I asked her body count. She said 1, but that she gave a guy blowjob this year when we fought around May. Then she asked mine, I said 2 hookers around May ending too😅. I told her I waited for her. That I tried my best. But the law of life is like an elite force. All those years I kept that virginity for her, but she declined to meet up.

That being said we developed feelings for each other since october last month (we've been texting regularly for the last 3 years, exchanging music, playing video games and etc, great friends) and we've been sweet to each other since. Video chatting every day. Basically everything is going smoothly. We are extremely attracted to each other, and show that to each other. Our communication is great. 

Only thing is that, we are not officially bf/gf yet. He wants to spend time with me in person in order to finally make that decision. I respect that, even if it makes me anxious.

We have talked about it, he also doesn't really see our relationship not working out, but I can't help but stress about it to myself. The fact that even when he thinks everything is going great, he still needs that, it's stressing me out. And like I've said, I respect it, I don't fight him on it. But I am trying to cheer myself up and not expect the worst.

There was a bit of a situation and I got fed up of being used so I kicked him out of my house and told him to sort his head out, but I also said that there were no issues and if he needed someone to talk to I was there but he didn’t want to, whatever. Then a situation arose where we had to communicate and then he responded to that situation by ghosting me, so I then responded by ghosting back and deleting him. I had put up with enough.

Anyway, I get on with it lived my life how I was before no issues, then a month later I find out by a few people he had twisted words and basically had been spreading awful rumours about me, now I was pissed at this because we live in the same area and it’s a small village so everyone practically knows each other. But I took the high road and thought whatever I don’t need to explain myself, the only reason he was doing it was cause he clearly felt guilty about what he did and wanted to make sure I came off as the bad one first…but that’s where he went wrong in the first place because I didn’t tell anyone I just moved on like an adult should. 

He got a new gf pretty much straight away so I was somewhat relieved thinking he’d stop talking about me. It’s been 8 months now and he’s still going on, I was told lastnight by my brother (as they used to be good mates, emphasis on the used) that when they attended a funeral last week for a mutual friend, he had brought it up again, not only that but his girlfriend shamelessly went right up to my brother and said “I heard (said rumour) about your sister”.

My brother responded by saying no it isn’t true, she wouldn’t do that now mind your own business. Now it’s very clear to me that his gf must be somewhat curious to go up to a guy she doesn’t know to ask about me, which creeps me out, I don’t know why it’s even being brought up in the first place because it’s not relevant and we ended 8 months ago. Why is he still talking about it? May seem like an overreaction but it’s stressing me out, he wanted to be a dick, he wanted to leave so why go on like I’m the issue? 

Also I had a guy bang and kick my door at 3am yesterday early morning  and trying to get in shouting my name and it sounded like him but I can’t confirm this until I look at my neighbours cameras. It’s all just freaking me out a little and making me really uncomfortable, I’ve never regretted an ex or dating guys before but he is the exception, he’s still causing me crap and I’ve not seen or spoke to him in 8 months and I’m getting tired of this, I don’t even want to live here anymore. When I spoke to the police about it they asked me if it could have been an ex and at the time I said no as I didn’t think so but now I’m not so sure.

I moved to a new city about 9 months ago and so far have had zero luck with finding women or getting dates. I had hinge, tinder, and bumble and deleted all them because I could barely even get likes not to mention matches or dates which never happens. (I used to get a good amount of matches back home so idk why it’s a problem now). I have tried multiple meetup groups and that kind of thing, ideally for activities I enjoy but I never really mesh with anyone I meet there. Bars have never worked well for me and I am good at having an intelligent conversation but possibly the worst flirter on the planet lol, and with covid still a thing that option is even more difficult. I have a pretty good group of friends from work but they are all guys and not really many opportunities to find girls with the activities we do such as camping, hiking, golf, etc just to name a few. 

I feel like I am at a good place in my life to have a relationship now that I am out of college and am totally independent with a good paying job, but it just feels like it keeps getting harder and harder to have success. I have never had a serious girlfriend or any thing more than like a “thing”. I have only kissed a couple girls and never had sex. I have a good amount of female friends but never can get a girlfriend which I think has something to do with my inability to flirt and make my intentions clear. 

I really don’t want to have a negative mindset but at this point I feel like I have tried everything I can think of to put myself out there with no luck. I usually try not to think about it and just do things that make me happy and better myself but at the same time constantly seeing or hearing about people my age getting married and/or having kids and combined with my total lack of success in life makes it hard to feel like I never will. 

I guess I mostly just wanted to vent but if anyone has any advice it would be greatly appreciated.

Short background:

* We have 26 mutual friends on Facebook and through them I know he's a kind person.
* We live in a small community, so I will see him often, which will suck if I get rejected
* I have a fear of rejection, which is why I haven't asked him out, yet.
* I lose all sense of reality when he's around. I push the wrong buttons and bump into things. The other day he parked next to my car in the parking lot without getting out of his car (he was looking at his phone). When I saw it was him I got so flustered I forgot how to start the car. My friend sitting next to me just laughed.
* Even my ex-husband (we're good friends) approves of him
* I have worked with his mum. She's a lovely person and can be my MIL any time.

&amp;#x200B;

As I mentioned I have a fear of rejection. Mostly due to being bullied as a child. I feel my confidence is ok. I am diagnosed with a disorder that makes it profusely difficult to lose weight. I'm not obese, and I don't hate my body, but I hate the activities I cannot do (like running). I am active and love hiking up mountains, so I'm not lazy. I know he is very active and loves to run marathons, so I'm scared my condition will cause him to reject me. 

I also don't get the vibe that he feels the same way, but he could just be shy as a friend said.

**I want to try though, so now I'm asking for your help:**

1: *Guys: What has a woman (or man for that case), said to you that caught your attention?* 

*2: Have you been asked out on a date in a creative and fun way?*

We don’t want to blend our families right now, as there’s too much to consider, several kids have an ADHD/Autism diagnosis and so there are a lot of tantrums/fits/meltdowns/overstimulated kids. The kids get along just fine, but when something unpredictable happens, it throws them all off. Understandably. 
We’re at the point where we’re starting to do more activities together, as restrictions are easing up. Bowling, a day at the park, a weekend away together. Stuff like that. There had been some hiccups with the kids but they’ve been great so far. I wanted to know if there is a stage between “dating” and “living together”? I don’t want to rush things, and we’re enjoying things as they are right now. Still I feel like, as I see my bf once or twice a week, maybe we could do more?
