Other than being very beautiful what attracted me was their charm and talent. Usually a musician or artist of some sort. But after awhile I would find myself in a very mentally or emotionally draining situation. Find out they‚Äôre an alcoholic or cheater.
So now I‚Äôve been trying to date outside of my ‚Äútype‚Äù . Really looking for heart. But once it gets to the physical aspect I just can‚Äôt do it. I‚Äôm not turned on at all and discontinue seeing them.

2,oysw35,1628200759,Does physical attraction matter?,"I used to be a hardcore believer that attraction doesn‚Äôt matter. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care what they look like! I just care about their beliefs, personality, our shared goals, etc.‚Äù

Definitely not someone I‚Äôd want to have sex with. I think it‚Äôs kind of like being with a guy if your a lesbian. You might like the personality but can‚Äôt see it working long term.

When I‚Äôm with her, I feel like I can completely be myself and everything just feels right. We both are on the quieter side, I‚Äôm probably a bit more quiet which I know she might not be used to yet. Because of this, she thinks we might not ‚Äúclick.‚Äù

I asked her out a few months back and she told me she was only interested in being friends. Fast forward a few months later she seems friendlier than before and has expressed wanting to hang out with me in group settings.

I had mentioned wanting to play tennis with her a few times, but it had never happened because I never asked her to play on a specific day. When around friends she would mention wanting to play tennis in front of me, and once told me that she was playing with a mutual female friend of ours and said ""You see what happens when you make definite plans? I play tennis with people that make official plans to play"" So at that point I said, ""alright, let's play next Tuesday"". I set up a group thing and It was a friend of mine vs her and her friend. We had a good time and she mentioned wanting to play again.

We talked about other activities that I was into, and she mentioned wanting to do those activities as well. The next day that I saw her, she asked me to make plans to hang out at a cool place that I mentioned.

With all this to say, we have attempted to play tennis other times as a group, but it has not happened again because her friend has been very busy. She is usually willing to play, but her friend's schedule has been very busy. I wanted to ask her if she was open to playing with me 1v1 since her friend appears to be busy.

14,oyu06a,1628204321,How to get to know her,"As a 21 year old Muslim, dating is a bit hard. Family always say I‚Äôm too young, but my mindset is more mature than your average person. I‚Äôm a family kind of person, I look after my mum and my siblings extremely well, and take care of them all the time. 

I‚Äôve personally never had a woman be attracted to me and tell me. I‚Äôve always crushed on people but they‚Äôve never reciprocated. I would say I‚Äôm just an average looking bloke, looking to meet someone and live life happily. I‚Äôve got a cool job in government, and I do well for myself.

I recently (about a year ago) met a girl at a family gathering, and was quite attracted to her. Not only is she well educated, but she‚Äôs very friendly, and caring, and gets along very well with my younger sister (I see that mothering, caring side to her).
She is a year younger than me but she‚Äôs doing her degree in medicine , which means she‚Äôll be in school for years to come here in the UK.

I recently saw her at a friends birthday recently but we were all there. Family, her parents, her grandma. She didn‚Äôt seem too chatty this time, but pretty obvious given we come from a conservative background that she wouldn‚Äôt give a strange guy her attention in front of her family. Either she has no attraction to me whatsoever, and didn‚Äôt even think about me in that way, or she was shy.

Anyway: my question here, given my extremely limited dating experience, what do I do to get to know her. Bearing in mind I‚Äôve seen her twice in one year exactly, I can‚Äôt exactly just see her to get to know her. I don‚Äôt even want anything to happen, I just wanna see what kind of person she is. I‚Äôm a long way away from any relationship, I‚Äôm too busy focusing on my life and my career. But at the very least I wanna know her and see if she‚Äôs the right person for me, and whether she has any interest whatsoever.

I know where she works because I overheard it from a family friend as well. But I can‚Äôt just rock up at her store and ask her out, or pretend like its all a giant coincidence, I‚Äôd be too awkward and embarrassed. And by the time I get there, I will have overthought every detail a million times. 
So how do I get to know her without looking desperate and creepy? 
Bear in mind my mum really likes her and frequently brings up how good we‚Äôd be together.
I‚Äôm not lovesick or anything like that, I genuinely just want to see her to get to know her. But I don‚Äôt know where to start‚Ä¶",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oyu06a/how_to_get_to_know_her/

35,oywp9e,1628213597,Need perspective from other introverts about platonic and romantic relationships,"As implied by the title, this post is kind of a mix of dating and friendship advice-seeking. Both issues share a root cause in my life, so it feels fitting to post this here. Anyways...

I had a best friend for over a decade. We parted ways 2-3 years ago over a growing number of conflicts. I don't really miss him, I'm pretty well aware that if I rekindled anything there, it'd go to shit instantly. Whats bugging me is that this experience has made me realize how poorly I've managed all other social relationships up until this point. I never really cared for having a big group of friends - I generally dislike the company of others most of the time and find conversation tedious at best. So long as I had this guy in my life, making other friends and  meeting new people was never a priority. To paint a more specific picture, since middle school, I have made 1 friendship I can see myself  maintaining for the foreseeable future.

Anyways, now that my best friend is gone, I have had an incredibly difficult  time branching out my social circle in that time to fill the void he  left. I have a small group of friends who are dear to me, but most of them are more introverted than I am, and border on hermit/recluse territory.

I have put in a ridiculous amount of effort into making new friends over the past 2-3  years and I have very little to show for my efforts. I have joined  online DnD groups, posted on subreddits, and offered to stay in touch with people I date, and taken up volunteer opportunities. Most of this has been fruitless. I go  through lapses of being painfully lonely, yet when I try and socialize  with others, I find it to be extremely unfulfilling. I constantly feel like there is something people are getting out of social interactions  that I am not. My close friends are the exception to this, I don't mind  talking with them forever. With the right people, my social batteries never deplete. But like I said, they're even more  introverted than I am. The people who I enjoy speaking to are few and  far in between. I have spoken about this numerous times in therapy and have never gotten a good explanation or answer as to what I could do about it.

This flaw of mine has  had a negative effect on my dating life as well. I'm 25M as of the time I'm writing this. I have had 1 girlfriend ever, when I was 18.  Otherwise, its been one night stands and label-less relationships that  lasted 1-3ish months before I break it off. I just do not enjoy the  company of most of the women I meet. I almost never have crushes either. Its extremely rare for me to feel any kind of desire to pursue someone. For what its worth, I'm not exactly swimming in matches either. I'm an  average looking guy.

None of this is aided by the fact that the few friends I do have, most are super geeky guys like myself. I just don't organically meet women through my  limited social circle. It's almost all through dating apps, which, as sucky as they are, have been my only option.

None of this would matter if I didn't have a burning desire to share my life with someone. I'm not asexual or aromantic. I *do* want people in my life, both platonically and romantically. But I don't know what to do anymore over the duality of needing people in my life and not enjoying their company.

I need a bit of harsh reality and truth from anyone else reading this who feels the way I do and who is preferably a bit older. I am not happy  with the city I'm currently living in, and plan to move in 1-2 years. I  have also quit what was a well-paying job to pursue becoming a YouTuber  (please don't ask - it's about as reckless and stupid as it sounds, but I'm on some follow-your-dreams hippy-dippy shit). Meaning I'll be unemployed for a while. I don't think my job was helping me get dates by any means, but I don't think being unemployed will do me any favors with the ladies.

Beyond the unemployment, that'll basically make me 26 and living somewhere with zero social contacts. **Should I just resign myself to trying to build a fulfilling life alone?** I am seriously looking for realistic advice, please for the love of all that is holy do not tell me to use meetup or something, everyone there is 40+. I'm just tired of putting in effort into my relationships and seeing it amount to nothing. If it's going to be this way forever, I'd rather get advice on how to be happier alone.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oywp9e/need_perspective_from_other_introverts_about/
36,oyws3g,1628213894,Don't know the last time I met a girl that sparked my interest,"I gave up online dating recently because for some reason regardless of how the girls look they just are not interesting. The last couple girls I met either have no hobbies or they include sitting around doing nothing. Ugh this is the most frustrating thing in my opinion because I already know that this girl is in no way shape or form going to be able to vibe with me. I feel like I do quite a bit for myself mostly physically but also mentally as well. I enjoy being very active at the gym and being outside. I have had a perma tan since this summer started. I like walking trails near by, riding bike, and most importantly being outside with my dog. I always keep my eye out for girls to approach but jesus my luck isn't that great. Some I see on the trail are mostly listening to music and I'm not trying to air traffic control them to stop. LOL the light up wands on the runway. In my mind I picture a girl (future GF) doing at least 1/2 the shit I do on her own already. Being active and being a genuinely cool girl who knows how to have fun. I feel like that's such a basic request but these days feels like I'm asking for a rich super model. I refuse to ever lower my standards either because I'd be disappointed the rest of my life. Especially when it comes to personality the coolest girl I met was my ex girlfriend whos still a friend of mine today. I honestly don't think that's asking a lot if anything I should set the bar higher. 

I want to find someone but honestly don't even know where to look anymore. It's been over 2 years and being single is honestly so lame. I hate it and always have ever since I started sating when I was younger. Nothing is better than having ""my girl"" around etc... and love. If you ever had some deep love - Something deep and special that you'll either never forget or maybe already have. Nothing compares  to it and I'm anxious (not too anxious) to find it again. I get lonely sometimes yes but my friends don't really help that. Im ready for some completely new ones at this point honestly. Need advice

37,oywv03,1628214197,60 Year old male - needs pragmatic advice please.,"Hello:   Probably the oldest person posting here.  

I have been single my entire life.  I was lucky enough to have gone to good Universities and had a few women in my life.  Unfortunately those were brief due to us moving in different directions.  I no problem dating, I actually dated two well known ""celebrities"" of the early 1980s.  I fell so deeply in love with a woman in 1984 that it literally hurt my soul.  Also in 1984 I started having symptoms of depression, not the blues, full on depression that changed my personality and made me seek comfort in the bottom of a bourbon bottle.  In 87 ""the woman of my dreams"" dumps me, was kind of not really nice about it, what is done is done.

Fast forward to the early 90s, I've lived in most of the major cities of the Northeast, and I crash, lose a great corporate job with a multinational.  I get dried out, get some of the mental health help I needed.  I rebuild my career and work very successfully.  At age 42 I go to a Ivy League hospital and they diagnose me as bipolar II, just depression no mania, finally I get the meds that level me off.  I'm doing really well again in my profession, and I am able to retire right after I turn 50.  

My issue is I don't know how to meet women anymore.  Social media is really creepy, but I have tried it a few times Match etc.  Not much success.  I'm in good shape, run, hike, do the gym thing.  I have all my hair and teeth, financially independent.  I have found that women I meet in my age range have a lot of baggage, as we all do I guess.  I have dated a few younger women, and that was fair, seems like our interests didn't intersect often.  I have no illusions, I'm not looking to start a family or anything like that.  I'm just looking for someone to hang out with, do things together.  I was approached by two much younger women in the  last 12 months, very nice and attractive, but I have nieces older than them so I demurred.  Ten years ago I met a stunning Asian woman, never asked her age, but I'm guessing late 20s.  She was very interested, but I did the math and it didn't seem promising.

Where do I meet people?  What are some strategies to find people of common interests?  I've been alone all my life, which to be honest used to bum me out, but not so much anymore.

38,oywwyi,1628214403,I (25 f) recently got back together with my high school sweetheart (27 m). I found some of the old letters he wrote me.,"I was going through some of my old stuff and I found the love letters my boyfriend wrote me while we were in high school. We grew up across the street from each other and his sister and I have been friends our whole lives. He was like my friend too but I‚Äôd always had this huge crush on him. He and I dated all through high school and went our separate ways when he joined the Marines after he graduated. We reconnected last year at his sister‚Äôs wedding and recently decided we both wanted to get back together.

Anyway when I started my freshman year high school he was a junior. He secretly started slipping me little notes from time to time complimenting me on my hair or telling me he thought I was cute. It was all really sweet and I we kept our little crushes on each other a secret for a while until he asked me to the homecoming dance.

Then after we started dating he‚Äôd write me little notes all the time with these little cartoons on them. He even drew me a little comic book that showed us running off and getting married in Las Vegas then my dad chasing him out of the country. They‚Äôre all kids stuff but they‚Äôre really sweet and I decided to bring them to his house and show them to him.

He seemed genuinely touched that I had saved all of those letters. Almost two years of stuff that he wrote to me and drew for me. We read them together and he laughed at some of the corny stuff he used to write to me. I told him that as a girl 14-16 years old it was the thrill of a lifetime to get this stuff from a guy I‚Äôd had a crush on for most of my life.

Well it was a fun evening and like I said he seemed really touched by the whole thing. So before I left he drew me a little cartoon of me carrying him out of his job like Richard Gere did in that one movie. I‚Äôm going to frame that one.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oywwyi/i_25_f_recently_got_back_together_with_my_high/
39,oywxy5,1628214505,Don't Promise Me Tomorrow,"You know the story. Girl meets boy. Or as it goes in these times, spies a fascinating post, or message, or profile. Well-written, mildly amusing, and he seems considerate, so why not reach out and see if there's more where that came from. And he can text! He's responsive, attentive to detail, and slips in wry comments that elicit a great many laughs. Makes her feel special.

&amp;#x200B;

Still, actual human contact is so hard to come by, and even the most thought-provoking text exchanges can only do so much, compared to good company. So photos and details are shared. He's not bad to look at, and is at a decent place in life. She could do better, but she could stand to do much worse. And hey, he's appreciative, a beacon of positive feelings, and my is genuine attention alluring. The charm carries on, expectations are mounting, maybe she's even fantasized a time or two.

&amp;#x200B;

So as the chatter carries on, and the ardor keeps building, they find time in their schedules and eventually to sit down for a drink, take a walk, or break out a board game, and see if all the good vibes carries over to in the flesh. And hey, he's just the same in person, no misrepresentations to speak of. Maybe the chemistry sizzles on even, and it transitions into something clothing-optional. And sweet nothings are whispered, and plans for next time, but eventually, the night must end at some point.

&amp;#x200B;

Then comes the dawn. She's peeked behind the curtain, and the magic is gone. And without a word, she disappears, with only memories left to recall all those moments they shared. So to you future connections out there, when you do reach out, don't promise me tomorrow, and try not to let those expectations run wild. My heart is open, and never cold, and I wear it on my sleeve. So tread carefully, my resolve may be deep, but it is not limitless.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oywxy5/dont_promise_me_tomorrow/

50,oyxvpf,1628217943,Toxic crazy ex,"So on 4th of july my ex had texted me a day after we broke up saying ""i miss you"" I told her I wanted some distance she took offense because of that and said she hooked up with someone the day we broke up... as I quote her texts

 ""Good thing I didn't get pregnant to"" 
""We are still hooking up to""
""Go f*ck somebody you'll feel better""

She also claims it was the same hook up she told me about from her past... all of that hurt me bad but I still didn't say anything back hurtful to her I just told her she hurt me bad saying all those things so I blocked her and just tried to forget about it. Fast forward a month later she texts me at 2 am saying sorry and how she was drunk that day and made up the whole story about hooking up with someone. Oh! And that the reason she took so long to apologize was because she hated herself for hurting me so bad. This was on Instagram dm's so I didn't reply I just reacted to the message and liked it. Fast forward a few days she texts me ""I hope your doing good."" Again I didn't reply just hearted it.


Beside the fact that she hurt me so bad to the point that I was so depressed I had very bad depressive thoughts I still couldn't manage to hurt her like how she did to me (I was crying non-stop) It definetely affected me in the darkest way possible but I'm still moving forward trying to move on and I'm still gonna continue to be a positive person.

56,oyysj8,1628221322,Experienced something very bizarre,"Been out of the dating game for a very long time, got out of a traumatic involvement a few years ago that left me devastated and broken with a crippled mental state. 3 years later to present day I finally decided to try dating again as I am not getting younger and didn't want to live as a recluse forever. 

Matched with someone on a dating app fairly quickly and the person has a stable great job, very good looking and seemed to actively engage with me. I could tell he was straight forward and said he was looking for a long term sexual involvement, but also very sexually open so was into threesomes, group orgies and rough sex and being dominant. Most definitely far more experienced than I was as I haven't really tried any of that. I asked if for the right person If there is a connection, if they would also be open to a relationship and he said yes. (Yes I know anyone can lie about these things and their true intentions online but it's better I asked than nothing)

Since naturally I've been uninvolved with the opposite gender for many years now, I was craving that sexual experience with a new person and getting to know this person so after some intense flirting, I asked if he wanted to meet. He was pushing very hard to meet directly at his house that is quite far from me outside of the city in a rural place and I said no, I need to meet someone first. After asking many times he caved in to agreeing to meeting me in person near me in public and we arranged a date and time.

 Now this date was somewhat inconvenient because he was very busy in the evening for a few hours doing something but he was very eager to work around it and said it shouldn't be a problem so I agreed. He did say he wanted some face photos of me to confirm that I am who I say I am and this is where it gets weird. He had seen my full photos already and vise versa, admittedly I had the best photos of myself in my glammed up look with some makeup and nice clothes. I don't cake myself up so my face wouldn't look that different without it in comparison to some others. We were joking around about how terrible it would be to get catfished.

This time, I was running late from the gym and after an intense work out I quickly snapped a photo and sent him to him. Keep in mind, I now had pretty much no makeup, was kind of sweaty in my gym clothes. However, It was not a bad photo. I wouldn't have sent it if I looked disgusting, I just looked more down to earth, casual and approachable I figured and lots of guys also have said they love it when someone can be casual or even when sweaty after a nice workout. I also didn't think I looked unrecognizably different from my more glammed photos I had up on the dating site. 

However immediately afterwards I noticed a change in his demeanor. There was a brief silence and he said he needed to get back to me for our meetup because he suddenly got really busy. I said that's fine and the next day I sent him a photo of me dressed up to go to work and thought it looked quite nice. I'm also someone who gets complimented and checked out by other people as well now and then. Still, there wasn't a compliment or anything, other than saying I look a little different to what they expected (then saying it's a joke) and they would get back to me later. Not surprisingly, he ended up cancelling and said he was far too busy. When I asked to reschedule, he vaguely said his schedule is so busy all of a sudden he really can't be sure when he's available next. This is going from a guy who was relentlessly wanting to meet up with me to just flat out doing a 180. I gave him a 2 week time window to let me know because I didn't want to wait around forever which he acknowledged and zero messages afterwards. 

I kind of regret now giving him the 2 week timeline because I should have kicked the bucket as soon as he didn't attempt to reschedule. However I wanted to give the benefit of the doubt to see what else could be done since I don't like being overtly rude or giving up fast. 

The most bizarre part of this experience is while I know ghosting and flaking is very common with today's dating world, I can't make sense out of what major issue he had with my photos. Do most guys expect girls to look like permanent Barbies these days or something ? Has something similar happened to you where you sent a decent photo and you couldn't make sense out of their sudden reaction? Or had dates flake on you last minute with no reason?

I just wanted to share this also because I think it's important to address previous wounds. I still have deep trust issues so this experience really didn't help.

I wasn‚Äôt sure how to title this but, long story short, this one boy (let‚Äôs call him S) I‚Äôve known since grade 7, started to show some feelings for me in grade 10. 

I‚Äôm currently heading to university this fall and I realized something when I was in online grade 12 (I was too scared to pursue anything), that this guy was dropping some MAJOR hints on me but I didn‚Äôt believe him because I was so dense and he once liked my best friend in grade 7. (I developed feelings for him but I was so unsure how he felt, stupid I know). 

He would always talk to me, I never initiated anything because truthfully I‚Äôm really afraid of talking to guys on my own, he‚Äôs the only person I talked to and enjoyed talking to me, he always looks after me, I remember his friends looking at me all the time,, gosh I miss highschool so much, everytime id text him it would go on for ages and man, my mom was always teasing me because of it. He once asked me ‚ÄúHey, do you have a crush?‚Äù And I was like,, ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs yours?‚Äù Then he said some girl in our English class, then when I bluffed about my crush he said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think so, he likes someone else‚Äù HDHHS so then i just mentally exploded and said ‚Äúoh well I guess I don‚Äôt have a crush then‚Äù and man, once he asked me if I could come to his brothers festival in the winter break, I was with my friend and she clearly knew he had a crush on me, but I didn‚Äôt realize (I totally forgot to go to that festival too,, I felt so terrible,, he was probably waiting for me). Heck the whole fucking grade shipped us because we were so friendly and close.

**Now enough of me daydreaming, let‚Äôs just jump back in the past to see where it all went wrong:** One day while I was in my grade 10 class, my other male friend, O (he is gay but closeted) asked me ‚Äúhey the teacher needs a laptop from the computer lab let‚Äôs go get one‚Äù so I went with O. While I was walking with O, S passed by with his friend! But he looked so upset I was laughing and talking to O, because since then S dry texts me and left me on seen which he never does! :(

I really wanted to apologize but next thing I knew, we never went back to school. I never saw S again,, I told my bestie A about how S has gotten oddly dry for some reason, and then she puts me in a group chat with me her and S- I was so embarrassed, S was talking to A so lively compared to me, I felt so bad I left the group chat. **A would sometimes ask if I‚Äôm still friends with S, and knowing how S used to like A, I felt like she was kind of taking her chance in front of me,, and now that I‚Äôve started to ghost her, she started ignoring me and I feel extremely horrible for assuming the way she was thinking,,,**

I‚Äôm writing this today because I was talking to my brother about how I really wished I could talk to S again,, and he insisted me to think in a way that A was probably helping me talk to S but realized when I left the group chat that there‚Äôs no hope then they stopped. (I genuinely thought A was using me as a stepping stone to talk to S since A and S went to different high schools, and I went to the same as S) He also told me I should apologize because I broke his heart without intending to do so because of misconceptions :(

So I wanted to ask,, it‚Äôs been around a year and a half since I last spoke with him, should I even text him back? Or is it too much of a lost cause to even think about? My brother told me I should be taking risks and not hoping for someone to talk to me because that‚Äôs not how it goes.

What would I even say to him? I feel like such a heartless person for doing this to him while I have a crush on him but i don‚Äôt know if I can totally blame myself for not really knowing what was happening :(",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oyzl6z/how_would_i_talk_to_a_guy_that_i_havent_talked_to/

I'm out here in Los Angeles and it feels like a lot of women are just into an active lifestyle, healthy eating, vegan, hiking, biking, skydiving, partying, clubbing, smoking weed, drinking, etc. I don't feel any sense of connection with those types of women. I see these types whenever I go on apps like Tinder. When I got here I tried going on dating apps. I got discouraged and stopped going on these apps. Am I asking too much to want to find a woman I have things in common with? I care about looks to an extent but what matters more is who she is as a person. Her personality, interests, the kind of chemistry I feel with her, etc. That's what matters to me. I just want to find someone I can feel connection and acceptance. How can I just stop generalizing? Maybe I am just bitter. I haven't had a chance to really meet, hang out, or talk with anyone in the year that I've been in LA.

69,oz0m4m,1628228941,Did I miss the memo where monogamy is no longer a thing?,"TLDR: had three separate dating experiences after a nine year relationship and was cheated on each time. 

About two years ago I got out of a nine year relationship. There were many reasons we decided to end it, and though it did end pretty badly cheating was not one of the reasons. I was 17 or 18 when the relationship started. About a year later after I moved to a different state I started dating casually again. I was reluctant as I had expectations. After unsuccessfully dating online I gave up. I met a guy at one of my jobs and HE pursued ME. So I‚Äôm like alright why not give it a shot. We ‚Äúdated‚Äù for a month and long story short found out he was still messing around with his ex wife. I should mention that I‚Äôm a female who has only dated females before. So I wasn‚Äôt expecting it to last anyway I wasn‚Äôt torn up over it and it was literally only a month. 

After him I met a girl I had pretty good chemistry with. We hit it off and started out fine. She made the first move after a couple weeks of flirting. We agreed to keep it casual and everything was good. We went out a few times and I really liked her. I told her some of my expectations that I was only seeing her and I didn‚Äôt care if she was seeing other people as long as she was honest with me about it. She told me she was just seeing me too and she really liked me blah blah blah. Two months into that I found out she was seeing many other girls. I was a bit hurt over this one! Had she just been honest I would of been fine. 

So I decided I‚Äôm done dating I‚Äôm gonna focus on my goals and just work. I was doing good working on myself when I met another girl through working. This girl was just wow. Made me a weak gooey babbling fool. My heart raced and I got butterflies every time I saw her. It was something straight out of romance movie. She would flirt back and eventually asked me out. I turned her down twice before finally agreeing to a date with her. Her persistence won me over. I told her in the beginning though my experiences on dating and if she was going to see other people to just be honest with me. I won‚Äôt get mad we are both adults blah blah. She assured me she wasn‚Äôt like that and she only wanted to be with me. Now we had been dating for almost nine months and everything was good minus a couple mood swings here and there. Long story short on this one just found out she was messing around for the last few months of it. 

Seriously it‚Äôs hard NOT to think that it‚Äôs me at this point. I just cannot understand when I‚Äôve been clear of my expectations and how I will not be mad if they‚Äôre just honest! I really feel like I missed a memo or something that monogamy is no longer a thing.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oz0m4m/did_i_miss_the_memo_where_monogamy_is_no_longer_a/
70,oz0n4r,1628229071,Should I kick her to the curb or am i overreacting ?,"I am in a weird situation. My girlfriend seems to have what they call a ‚Äúwork husband‚Äù. She has been working with this guy for a year and I was kind of curious about him but she never really talks about him. She refers to him as ‚Äúguy from work‚Äù. I‚Äôve meet him only once at a work event. I‚Äôve been getting interesting info from another co-worker she has that knows me.

Apparently she is pretty close with this guy at work. They constantly get flirty with eachother throughout the work day. They pull pranks on eachother, playfully touch eachother and so on.  Once the person who told me all this walked in on her and the guy in the breakroom holding hands while playing some game on his phone. When the person asked wtf they are doing she simply said ‚Äúahah its so we don‚Äôt cheat with the other hand‚Äù. Another time that kid took something from her and started taking it away from him and was leaning all over him and holding his hand taking it away from him. And yet another time she let that kid put a mask on her face because he has some surprise in his hands and so on. They do all of this infront of several people sometimes. So it looks like they have no touch barrier at all. 

They go on coffee runs for eachother all the time. She added him recently on Instagram and facebook. After all of this, I looked through some of their texts and they seem to banter with eachother. He sends her a text that she should get coffee in the mornings and she goes and gets it for him. They send a lot of gif images to eachother.

Another thing that worries me is that she called another coworker girl a skank because she ‚Äúflirted‚Äù with him and apparently my gf was not happy.

I ask my other (F) coworker if she‚Äôs flirting with me and she says she‚Äôs pretty sure she is. 

Well my hot water heater was out and I brought it up in a group conversation and she offers me to take a shower at her place. I said I‚Äôd probably just power through my cold shower or go to the gym if I really needed a hot shower. Then I thought about it and thought ‚Äúyou know what? Screw it, I‚Äôll take her up on the offer‚Äù. So I approached her later in private and said I‚Äôd take her up on the shower. We exchange info, finish our shifts, I head home to eat cereal. 

I pack a shower bag and bring some condoms because I‚Äôm thinking things might go down that road. She invites me in and shows me around, then leaves to take her daughter to school. I finish my shower and she texts me saying I can leave the house (unlocked) or I can stay if I want until she gets back. I choose to stay. She comes back and puts something on Netflix while we hang out on the couch. I‚Äôm pretty awkward but I asked her if she wanted to ‚ÄúNetflix and chill‚Äù and she said YES, and I went over to my bag and said ‚Äúcool, I brought stuff just in case.‚Äù She says to me ‚Äúoh, you mean like snacks?‚Äù To which I reply ‚ÄúUhhh‚Ä¶ condoms?‚Äù

83,oz1xh3,1628235216,So I really like this girl... I know....super original title :),"Okay, so I (M22) have this coworker (20F) at work. I work in a kitchen so it's a pretty rough environment. She's been working there a few months now and I like so many things about her. She's the nicest person I've ever met. She does so many little things through out the work day just to try and brighten everybody's faces. She remembers what music different people like and plays them if you're having a bad day. She constantly does more than she has to just to help others. I really can't describe how nice she is.


We also have a great work friendship. We have little games we play with each other to give each other a little respite during the day. We tease and bully each other constantly (sometimes it goes too far lol) but we always make sure the other one doesn't feel bad about it or is hurt. We can talk for long periods of time where it feels like neither one of us is struggling to hold up the conversation. Every night we work together, we go outside and look at the sunset (like a lot of people do at our workplace since it really is a good view.) And we just talk and make jokes. I'm a little worried I'm too into her. She makes me sincerely happy and I love being around her. 


I've been slowly trying to get the courage to ask her out. I'm 60% sure she doesn't have a significant other since she's never mentioned one before but that could just be her keeping her work and home life separate. But I legitimately think she likes me. I don't usually feel that reciprocity with many other girls but I can almost sense it here. She laughs at all my jokes (even my bad ones). She stands super close to me a lot (closer than she stands to anyone else). I notice her looking at me when I'm not watching. She's almost always smiling this adorable smile when she's near me. I got asked just yesterday by a server if I was single (she's really close to to a lot of the servers). That last one may not be relevant. I feel very braggy in this paragraph but the only reason I'm writing it is to show how unusual this is for me and to give you guys context. 

I really want to get to know her better outside of work. She's coming over to my apartment to hang out with me and my roommate (who also works with us). I want to do this a couple of times before I ask her out just to make sure we still have good chemistry outside of work. But I'm pretty sure we will. After that, I want to ask her out.

But I've been out of the dating scene ever since I got out of high school. I needed some time to work on myself. I also never found someone who has made me feel the way she does. This comes with the downside of not really knowing how to navigate these waters. How do I find out if she has a boyfriend? I could ask one of her friends but then she might find out and then everything's ruined between us if she doesn't feel the same way. It also complicates things at work if she says no because then she might start to feel uncomfortable at work especially if I become a manager like I'm supposed to (which would put me above her).

We stayed friends.

We both cheated on our partners once through sexting on snapchat in April 2020. I broke up with my boyfriend afterwards. He stayed with his girlfriend. Hr felt guilty and cut contact with me. He blocked me across social media in June 2020.

In June 2021 his girlfriends broke up with him and he contacted me again. I asked him why did he feel the need to block me across social media if I wasn't trying to contact him and he died it. He said he deleted his account but that is not true because when I check him up on my friends account his profile is there and still active.

94,oz4138,1628245892,"Why is it generally assumed that when a relationship ends, it's because the man did something?","Not sure if this is the place for it,

But I've noticed in conversations, that people like to jump to the conclusion that the guy did something to end the relationship. I was talking to a coworker about a girl that ghosted me, (she asked about my relationships) and the first words she said was

""What did you do?""

(In my case, I feel confident I didn't do anything wrong, she just found someone better and never bothered to let me know.)

Im not upset but..It's not a unique case, I've seen similar happen a lot. I just wanna see other people's opinions on why that is. Its peaked my interest.

All my life I have been nice and supportive and good, so that they would love me back and have sex with me. But I just got used over and over again. Suffered from years of sexual inactivity, porn addiction and desire to burn the world turned towards myself.

The truth is I hate happy people. The people who convince themselves they are happy with what they have. I hate you. One day I will come for you, to sleep with your wives and make you have nightmares that your wives have made me go through. I will make you beg to sleep with your wives.

Just like alcohol people desire toxic relationships. They are just not aware. They have fucking unicorn horns for brains.

96,oz45er,1628246468,Finally have a crush on someone after 3 years and it feels great!,"Originally posted this is r/casualconversation but it got removed for being about a crush. 

I (21m) used to essentially be a helpless romantic in high school. When I realized I had a connection with a girl, I fell hard. Sometimes it worked well for me, sometimes it didn‚Äôt. I dated around in high school and always had a crush on some girl when I was there, but after I left for college I couldn‚Äôt find myself really attracted to any girl. It‚Äôs nothing against the girls in my school, frankly I just think it was just my anxiety among other things that allowed me to not get close to another woman again. I ghosted girls after I realized things were moving at a pace I wasn‚Äôt ready for because I didn‚Äôt feel the same way. I was basically wandering through this myopic asexual mess in college and honestly thought I‚Äôd be alone. But I finally met her.

I went to an internship across the country and met the prettiest girl of my life. She is single and we‚Äôve had our moments together. We recently got very drunk and just held each other in my bathroom and it‚Äôs the deepest connection I‚Äôve had with a girl since 17, including random hookups. I haven‚Äôt felt happier with an other girl since high school. I sadly know/think she doesn‚Äôt feel the same way since she talks very passionately about an old friend of hers and how she feels about him but I honestly don‚Äôt care. She reaffirmed that there are great people out there and these deep feelings towards her will eventually pass. she unknowingly showed me that there are great girls out there and people in general. Still kinda drunk after writing this but it just feels so good to have a crush on someone again. Who‚Äôs know, maybe there‚Äôs a future for us? I don‚Äôt think there will be sadly but I‚Äôm simply enjoying my time with her ü•∞. She gave me confidence that I can finally make a deep emotional connection with a woman again. It feels great! She‚Äôll always be special to me. Bye for now",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oz45er/finally_have_a_crush_on_someone_after_3_years_and/
