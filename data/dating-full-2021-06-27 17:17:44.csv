Backstory:

In my second to last semester of college right before Covid shut everything down, I (M24) decided to finally start dating. There was a cute girl (F24) in my bio class that seemed like we would share some of the same interests (she was also getting a Bachelor's in Computer Science). I started chatting with her after our labs, and after like a month or so, I mustered up the courage to ask her out to bowling. She said yes and I was super excited it worked out! Not to get into too much detail, but the first date ended up being at Baskin Robins because the bowling alley had an event going on and lasted like an hour or two. She said she had to go help her sister in law with a crafting project if I remember correctly. It was both our fist times dating but seems to be going nicely. One date I went for a kiss and she rejected it due to Covid, which made 100% sense to me. Ultimately, she was really into the safety of the situation as her dad had asthma and how she was. I had no problem with that and respected her stance on the situation.

As time passed, we ended up going on Minecraft dates as she wasn't comfortable seeing each other with the Pandemic but at the same time, the only contact with others I had was my mom and grandpa, so I was not going around partying or anything like that. Eventually we met up and started to get to know each other in person and progressed intimately. We had much of our dates at the time in her parent's camper to be alone. That's also an important note: we both lived with our parent(s). After that we started moving our dates to her house as her parent's house has a private basement, and my mom's house didn't share the same level of privacy and her car wasn't in a shape to drive at the time. Most of the time, we ended up watching anime and messing around a bit but never progressed to sex.  Anime/show wise, we almost always watched what she wanted and my suggestions were shot down most of the time generally, but I didn't mind. She seemed really sensitive about things and I didn't want to pressure her into sex even though I really wanted to.

I met and really liked her family, and we played video games with her brother and sister-in-law a good chunk. She was heavily invested in writing novels as a hobby and intended to eventually go full-time into the activity and spent a lot of her time writing. I ended up reading her entire first book to give feedback even though I pretty much hate reading like that. It's just not for me. We were talking about 6-8 months into the relationship, and she basically informally asked if I'd marry her eventually. I said yes as she seemed like the perfect person for me to spend the rest of my life with but am very logical and strategic about most things in my life and would not rush into things. Also, personally I wouldn't go to marry someone without having sex first.

We made a point that writing (for her) and computer stuff (for me) would not take priority over spending time together. There were a couple weekends where her parents would be out of town, and she invited me over to spend the weekend there with just the two of us. We didn't do anything too crazy and just slept in the same bed. Whenever I'd try to get anything going, she would just say she wants to just sleep or something. There were two weekends in a row that we spent together at her house. The first weekend we didn't do anything because she was having her period. The next weekend, she didn't initiate anything either. At this point, I was starting to get frustrated with the lack of intimacy, but couldn't bring myself to talk about it. I felt like I'd basically be begging to do something and wouldn't feel comfortable about that. Anyways, I started to feel very uncomfortable due to many small things like her dog (I'm not too into dogs) and how cluttered everything was at her house. On top of that, she had us sleeping on a tiny futon that really messed with my hips. There was another bed that we could've slept in that I totally forgot about at the time though. She was spending the majority of the weekend writing, and that left me wondering what I should do. I came over to spend time with her not do my own thing while she writes. I suggested we play Minecraft together, and she agreed. We played for like 30 mins then she got bored and went back to writing. Later I tried to get intimate with her, and she refused as she was still sore from her period. I decided to tell her after dinner that I was going to go home early (Saturday night). I told her it was because my hip was killing me and wanted to play a few games the next day with my friend on my PC at home instead of my laptop, which were both true. I didn't want to be rude about her house being a mess.

The next morning, I apologized because I felt bad and sent a bunch of apology hug emojis. Over the next week, she started to get more and more distanced. Then on Friday she called me, she almost never called me before as she prefers texting. She said because she wants to travel and we have different taste in houses, she was breaking up with me. For the travel, I have no idea what she was referring to, but for the house, we were talking about buying a house together for some time. I had pretty standard taste just looking for a normal 3 bed 2 bath  house with a garage and what not, but she kept leaning towards getting a house that would $1176 or less a month. I will never forget that number. For the money we had saved, that was kinda ridiculous not to mention we were both transitioning into software engineer jobs with great starting pay. I ended up showing her detailed charts on how affordable a standard house would be for us, but she never accepted it even though she said that was reasonable.

Back to the call, I asked if we can talk about it first as we were together for over a year, and she said no. The cherry on top was that my birthday was only a week or two away, and I had some plans in motion to spend time with her at my house and invite her family over for a dinner I would make. After the call, I was totally confused and upset. I gave her some time and attempted to contact her. She never replied to any messages I sent, so I called her. My number was blocked. I was even more confused at this point, so I used my mom's phone. Hers was blocked as well. I ended up calling her brother and sister-in-law a few days later. They had no idea what caused it either, and her brother said he'd talk to her and try to setup a meeting or something so we could talk. He never got back to me. I was just trying to  stay friends with all of them at least.

One thing to mention is one time she was late and had me get her a pregnancy test. I just went with it thinking who knows some even if we haven't had sex, something could've happened somehow. She does not seem like she would cheat and was pretty much at home all of the time due to Covid, but everyone I've told this to says this was a big red flag.

The aftermath:

This all happened back in March, and I've still not heard anything back. The past few months have been extremely difficult and depressing without any closure. I decided to go to my doctor and ask to be referred to a therapist and dietician as I'm a picky vegetarian and find it difficult to find the calories I need in a varied diet and was getting dangerously close to being underweight. I also decided to go onto antidepressants, but that ended up making things worse for about a month, and I quit them after. I feel one of the reasons this hurt so much was because I basically had 5 close friends and was cut off from 3 of them. Playing with her brother and sister-in-law may prove to be too difficult to handle, and I haven't even tried to reach out to them. Just a few days ago, I finally managed to delete the texts from here and remove her on discord and stream, but still have her as a contact. Seeing the messages just made me upset.

Today:

So far, the dietician has helped me gain 10 lbs, and I feel way better in that regard. The therapist hasn't done much for me, but we are setting up a foundation still for the most part. I started using some dating apps a couple months ago and had a few dates but nothing much. Currently, I found someone who I'm extremely interested in and it seems she feels the same. We enjoy a lot of the same things more so than with my ex it seems. I also used bumble to get a new close friend, but unfortunately, she's moving real soon, so we won't be able to do as much in person. Also, after about 2 months of extreme house grinding, I finally got a condo that I will soon be able to call my own! It was crazy with how the market is right now and was about my 8th aggressive offer. I'm really looking forward to that. I still keep having days where I miss my ex extremely and keep glossing over my regrets with the relationship. I wish I was more forward with my thoughts and opinions with her. One of my greatest regrets is not progressing the intimacy. It's not like I ever denied her or anything like that, and I feel like a douchebag or something for always feeling my greatest regret is not having sex with her. The whole situation has left me unsure and confused, and I'm trying to use it as a learning experience. 

I'm not really sure what I want out of posting this but feel like I need to share it for some reason and get feedback. I appreciate all feedback, and thank you for taking the time to read my huge block of text. I'm happy to answer any questions.

I’m 25M who was born and raised by a strict Muslim family in Saudi Arabia. I’m an ex-Muslim, despite that, I haven’t been in any dates my whole life. I spent 4 years studying medicine which I eventually dropped out of, then worked as a commis chef for 1 year before relocating to a European country to study bachelors there, so I’m like the oldest person in our batch.

Last weekend, I received a text at 11am from a girl who I’ve worked with once in a group project but it was online and we haven’t seen each other in person. She asked if I was interested in having dinner with her at the school buffet. We agreed to meet and she came alone. We talked a bit about ourselves and got to know each other over dinner, and when we walked back she opened her arms for a goodbye hug and she asked to go out again next weekend.

Yesterday, despite her having to take a train at 1pm to visit her family, she proposed we meet at 11:30 for brunch at the school cafeteria again, this time she wanted both of us to walk there together. She was alone again, and told me to keep the fact that she’s visiting her family a secret from others and said only I know about it. We talked a bit more about our hobbies and stuff, and again at the end she opened arms for a goodbye hug. She even missed the bus to the train station so she could spend time with me and instead took a cab.

Now, I’m not sure if it was just hanging out or if it was a date and she’s romantically interested in me.

I found her to be very attractive, although I wasn't too sure we were a perfect match. Our texting / messaging didn't have me over the moon and I wasn't sure we had a lot in common (tv and work mostly). For our 4th date we went to dinner and then to an art instillation. There was definitely a couple of brief moments during the date where I was like ""hmmm maybe not the one for me."" But I was still having fun and found her very sexy. She wanted to get a third drink at dinner and then wanted to get another drink to go while we walked to the art instillation. I don't usually push a lot of drinking on dates, but I was having fun. There were drinks at the art instillation and so we each had two more. The art instillation was dark and we were tucked away in a corner making out. When the venue closed, she invited me over to her place for a drink. I went. We went up to a rooftop lounge and shared a bottle of wine. She had told me I was a fast kisser, so I really slowed it down and she was like ""oh so you are a good kisser."" So we kissed some more. I was so drunk I recall ordering an uber, but she seemed a bit disappointed, so I told her I was happy to stay if I was invited. I was invited. So we go up to her bed and make out even more, slowly take each others clothes off. I eat her out for a while; she didn't orgasm and I came up for a bit of a break. She immediately goes down on me and I tell her that I may cum immediately. She tells me to give her a warning. I cum within a minute (it's a problem for me, especially with oral sex). She gets me a towel to wipe down and realizes it's 3am. We wake up around 9am massively hung over. She's ""upset at herself"" because she had planned two social events that day (she cancelled the first, not sure about the second). We cuddle in bed for a couple of hours (I was definitely probably pushing the cuddling, but she seemed into it). I said that was fun, we should do it again, she says yeah. I get my clothes on around 11:30am and say okay I'm going to head out. She's like ""I guess I can get up to say goodbye"". She gets up and gives me a hug (I wanted a kiss, but she kind of made it so that wouldn't happen). Then I put my shoes on while she's looking in kitchen cabinets. I open her door and turn around and say bye, she looks back from whatever she's doing and says goodbye. Felt weird; vibes gone.

The next few days she's texting me back, but it's not the same as before, I can feel it. So I text her: Now that we've almost recovered from last time we saw each other, should we make plans to see each other again. 

She says ""I always have so much fun when we hang out and so appreciate that you’ve been so consistently intentional about making plans! I want to be honest and not fade out on you and share that I’m not sure I’m in the headspace to be more than friends. I’m in the midst of sorting my stuff out and want to be fair to you and not waste your time. I’m totally open to hanging as friends if you are and I really and genuinely have enjoyed hanging and getting to know each other.""

I say:  We did have so much fun, which is why I wanted to see if you wanted have MORE fun. I’m totally open to hanging as friends, if that is what we were doing on Friday night 🙂.

No, she wants something platonic. I tell her I don't really have the headspace to go from passionate make out sessions and giving each other head to just being friends. She says fair enough.

I suppose I have some dating fatigue and I'm probably trying too hard as I really want to be in a relationship now (I am a mostly single person, but just feel it / want it now). She probably wasn't ultimately the one for me, but during the date I was like, yeah this is fun and she's hot. She was hot and I don't get that many hot girls from online dating. So anyway, just as I was coming around to liking her and definitely wanted to get naked with her again. So I'm disappointed, frustrated. 

I guess I cannot be too upset, if I had my doubts that she was the girl for me. At the same time, I just want something to work out for me!!! I don't know what went wrong with this girl, she seemed to be really into me until we woke up the next day? Was it my premature ejaculation (now I have even more anxiety about it!)? Is getting that drunk and hooking up a bad idea (it's been a while since I've woken up next to someone that hungover...but it didn't seem like a drunk hookup, it was our 4th date and it seemed to be going VERY well)? Did she just realize that I wasn't the one for her? Does it take waking up next to someone in bed to figure that out?

I don't hook up with a lot of people and most of my sexual experience is with people I dated long-term. It breaks my heart a little every time I get intimate with someone and then we break up (even after just four dates). I know that's life, but it's especially hard to have fun and get naked with someone and then hear them say they'd rather just be friends. 

Finally, what's with the friends thing? Who wants to suck a guy's dick and then want to still hang out as friends? I assume this is just being nice and wanting to let someone down easier.

I want to give some context and say that I have had a couple of girlfriends and flings before, but never really a FWB situation. 

So, I am visiting a different town for the summer. A week ago I met this girl at a party and we hooked up. After a lengthy session, I just dropped her home as she was busy the next day. 

I texted her a couple of days after saying that we should meet up again, and she came over 5 days later. Before she came over, I assumed she just wanted a no-strings-attached f*ck buddy. When I picked her up I saw that she had a backpack with her. During foreplay, she was very sensual and passionate. It didn’t feel like just a hookup. After sex, we cuddled, showered together, went and got food, and she decided to spend the night. The next morning, we cuddled after waking up. There even was head-scratches and forehead kisses. I made her coffee and we chatted in my bed before I dropped her off. 

I am not quite sure what’s going on. Are we just no-strings-attached f*ck buddies? Are we kinda seeing each other?

So yesterday I had a date in a bar with a guy, and it was probably the most awkward experience of my life. The guy was so awkward with me, he wouldn't make eye contact with me, he wasn't talking, his voice was so quiet and I couldn't hear anything he was saying. It felt like I was asking all the questions and I'm pretty sure I was talking 95% of the time because the guy was not communicating with me. He kept looking down at the table and barely looked at me, even the very few times he did ask me a question, he was looking down at the table. He was also being a bit odd with certain questions, for example, he didn't want to tell me what his job was and he didn't want to tell me what his ethnicity was. Honestly, the conversation was so dry and the guy looked so bored and completely disinterested in me. He also looked at his phone a few times which pissed me off so badly. 

So what did my stupid self do? I got drunk and started talking to other people at the bar. There was a guy next to us who I thought looked like my old school teacher and I found out it actually was my old teacher and we had a good conversation. There were a group of girls and boys next to me who wanted me to take pictures with them so I did, one of the guys started flirting with me in front of my date and at the time, I was drunk and didn't see anything wrong with it because my date wasn't communicating with me so I think my ego was a little hurt and the other guy was making me feel better. 

The next bit is what confused me, the date lasted for over 3 hours (it was mainly me talking and him staying completely silent) and I hinted quite a few times that maybe we should end the date early. I said things like ""oh it's getting late I would feel bad if you got home really late so we can leave now if you want"" and he said it's fine don't worry about it, I also said ""I would feel bad if you have to drive home at midnight so we can leave earlier"" and he said he had no problem driving at midnight, it doesn't bother him. The whole night, my date really seemed like he had no interest in me but when the bill came, he insisted on paying for it and I insisted that we split it, he didn't give me a chance to speak to the waiter and he paid for the whole thing. He then offered to drive me home because it was so late and he could tell I was drunk so he said he didn't think it would be safe for me to use public transport. 

Now looking back at this sober and level headed, I think I was the rude one.

I am of East Indian descent; however, I grew up in California. I have been told numerous times that I am a good-looking guy, and some people are even shocked to find that I have never had a girlfriend before. Throughout much of my adult life, I have been overlooked by girls. I have seen Indian guys score girls, yet I would be left with nothing and it often makes me think just ""What exactly is it about these guys that make them particularly appealing?"" ""What exactly do these guys have that I do not?"" I have a fair complexion for an Indian so I am quite often told that I do not ""look Indian"" but rather Hispanic or middle eastern, which irritates me. I am very insecure about my figure, as I believe that it is the sole reason that people have never respected me- I am 5'8"" with a slender build, which makes me look a lot younger than my actual age; I could very easily pass for 22. Many of these Indian guys may be taller than me-6'1"", however, they are not exactly the most refined of people- they are very callous and rude. Many times, where girls have expressed interest in me, there has always been some jealous male that has ruined it for me. I have tried using dating sites, such as Tinder, and much to my chagrin, I have never matched even once in the past two years that I have been using the app. For a while, I stopped caring by reassuring myself that I can live without a girlfriend, but unfortunately, I am reaching an age where I need to find someone. 

I ought to mention that I would prefer to date a girl outside of my ethnicity. I must profess that anytime I see a brown guy with a white girl, I become infuriated with jealousy because I often think that if that brown guy can score a white girl, why can't I? What exactly does that brown guy have that I don't? I wouldn't feel the same way if the guy were White, Yellow, or Black, but only Brown. 

One could contend that there may be something about myself that I could change, and I completely agree; however, one attribute about the physique that I have not been able to change is my height, and I know that women do care about that- they are lying if they tell you that it is not important. Consequently, I am strongly considering undergoing cosmetic limb lengthening surgery, which would essentially make me 5 inches taller, and put me at 6'1"", and not to mention people wouldn't bully me and women would be more likely to express interest in me.

Recent surveys have noted that women are starting to cheat a lot more in the younger age groups and older age groups are behaving more like they traditionally did.

When I create polls on reddit (which obviously has problems too) the vast majority of self-reported cheaters are women. Women are also more likely to say they’ve gotten on dating apps while being in a relationship. Putting all this together makes me suspicious.

Been out of the relationship thing since I was 18. Took the time afterwords to focus on myself. Honestly, it took me a while to get over it emotionally too. I now feel ready to start dating, and in fact just went on a first date a couple days ago for the first time since. 

The issue being, I am finding it way too emotionally draining. I’m looking for an actual relationship, and for me, that requires a complete and exclusive emotional connection. I’m dumping all of my eggs into one basket every time. I can’t *not* do that. 
This last date went well, imo and what she said, but I guess I got ghosted after we set up a second date. And honestly, it’s spirit crushing. I had little emotional connection or physical attraction prior, but that typically all happens after I meet someone on a personal level. Like on/after a 1st date. I can’t just look at someone and be attracted to them. 

All the expectations, nervousness, anxiety of meeting...just to then actually feel that connection and then start over with someone new. How do others do it? I’m not in it for hookups or anything, nor would I participate in that. I legit just want a relationship. It’s so easy for me to form my own emotional connections to people, and it takes so much out of me when it doesn’t work.

It like my second time ever actually going to one and first time taking shots and being as drunk as I was in the past two years. However, I kind of obsess over consent a lot and I would like to be respectful, but also be able to have a fun time. I know it is always best to ask for affirmative consent, but at a club, the music is super loud and you can't necessarily ask to dance with people. I know some guys ask, but I find it weird to have to shout a question and I think it would be even creepier if a stranger went in my ear and said, ""Can I dance with you"". There's a lot of physical cues I realized. So I was doing some grinding and would stop after the females would give me the nonverbal hint and I would. My only problem is that I did not ask before I would go up and dance on someone. I would like to think that I acted relatively slow and would try by like dancing in their general vicinity and then slowly putting a hand on her waist to see if she was interested. If she would move, then I would stop. If she would allow it, then that was a good indication that we could dance together and we would. Did I do anything wrong here? 

In the future, how should I respond, because I don't want someone to feel like I would sneak up behind them, and not give them a chance to react. I would usually just start with a hand placed lightly against her waist to kind of give the hint of what my intentions were. She would either back up or turn away. Sometimes a girl would be dancing and throwing it back and I would have no idea what she looked like and I don't even think she saw me.

""I don't mind being alone, I just hate feeling alone.""
I was feeling alone, like no one is there for me and no one will ever be.
Tired of being and feeling alone.

I'm seeking someone that can Understand me.
I'm seeking someone that knows my worth.
I'm seeking someone that ,can I talk without judgement.

So a little backstory...

For the past year, I've (19M) been in weird flirty relationship with my best friend (20F). It got to a point where I wanted to date but she didn't want to, so I tried being friends for a while and I ended up not being able to do it because I just couldn't stay friends with her when I loved her. So I let her know and for a few months we were in a weird state where we didn't really talk.

Fast forward to last week, she asked me out on a date. Said I couldn't get out of her mind and she couldn't stop thinking about me. I love this girl. We went on our date, and I personally thought it was average just because the anxiety levels were so very high and it made it a little weird. But I saw her a few times after and I thought the times after were spectacular.

Yesterday when I was in the shower, she looked through my texts (red flag I know) with my roommate and she saw that I texted him it was an average date and she left with tears in her eyes. She let me know later that day what happened and how she looked through my texts. I was not happy with her. But this all led to some arguing and brought up some of our deeper issues.

She would say how she is so worried that she's not ready for a relationship and that she has some stuff she wants to work on (she's been going to therapy for a few years now). I also feel like I have some things I need to work on too. She brought up how she feels like I think she's absolutely perfect and put her up on a pedestal, which tbh, she's not wrong. I kind of forgive her pretty easily and look past some of her faults while only focusing on her good parts. But I love this woman and she loves me. We both care deeply about one another. Also, I'm still kind of just surprised at how interested she's into me, which I think plays a role in the pedestal. Not that I'm an ugly dude or anything, but I just think she's so great.

I've seen the movie She's out of my League where the main character puts this girl everyone thinks is attractive on a pedestal and she feels cramped and trapped, so I can kind of get what she's saying. And I do think I put her on a pedestal. How do I go about fixing this? Or is it really that bad of a thing? Any tips are appreciated :).

I [M18] and this girl [F18] only went out once but i really felt like there was a sort of connection. She was laughing/smiling a lot and was very very cute.

We basically met on the streets cause i approached her and i asked her out some days after. She accepted and we only saw each other once ( 2 weeks ago ). Then, she was busy so we couldn’t meet but now that i’ve asked her out again she accepted. We’ll have our second appointment this Tuesday afternoon. 


But i’m done… i really want to show her my feelings. Ofc, the fact that i asked her out again might mean something to her, but i want to be more explicit, direct. It’s good to have appointments but we’ll end up being friends if we’ll keep on going like this.


So, i decided to compliment her for her eyes. They’re huge blue eyes, and when she smiles, she’s gorgeous.

First, here's a quick backstory.

I'm a 29M, and a very independent person. I've only ever been in a few relationships.

I matched with a girl on Hinge during the first week of May this year. We have a ton in common and always have fun together. It took me nearly three weeks just to get her number, as she indicated early on that she doesn't like to move too fast.

We've since been on two dates together (June 11th, June 25th), and had sex together each time. She's very openly sexual (more on this later), and the sex is quite amazing. We've felt a strong connection, and rather than conform to other dating norms, we've essentially just continued to do what feels right to us (this was verbally talked about prior to our first time having sex).

On the first date, she indicated that she's into BDSM and has a handful of clients whom she sees. She has a full-time job as well. As for myself, I'm busy with my full-time job, in graduate school, and training for a half-marathon. We are both very busy with our daily lives outside of dating.

Here's my questions:

1. Texting seems to be the best way for us to communicate at this time. However, it's becoming more scarce compared to the daily communication we had initially. If I text her/she texts me, we'll briefly make exchanges, but she'll often not respond back. I don't ever double text in response. One time, she went MIA for over three days. She recently apologized and told me that she would work on this. Thoughts about this behavior/responding to it?

2. I really like this girl, and it goes beyond just the sex. I often want to let her know that I'm thinking of her, among other things. However, I don't EVER want to come on too strong. Any advice/suggestions for moving forward in the best possible way? (i.e., long-term relationship)

3. I respect her desire to engage in BDSM. She makes good money doing it, openly talks to me about it, and just enjoys sex in general (she told me that she doesn't engage in sex with her clients).

We connected via mutual friends not a dating app.

She initially said she was interested in getting to know me and we had a call which went well ( just chatting ). She also invited me to a party the following week which never ended up happening. We continued texting on and off for a bit, she gave somewhat detailed responses and asked questions so all seemed well. 

One night we were messaging and the conversation of relationships came up. She said she wasn’t ready for any commitment but still wanted to meet ( The party hadn’t been cancelled at this point ) so that seemed good still. I was having a really bad mood swing later that night however, and ended up saying that I wasn’t sure about meeting anymore and didn’t want to be strung along. It was late so I went to bed. I had woken up and noticed two long messages but went back to sleep since I was still tired. The next time I wake up the messages were unsent so I just sent a long apology of how I was in a horrible mood and still wanted to talk. She said yes but obviously seemed a little annoyed because who wouldn’t be. 

After that some talk went on for the next couple days during which the party was cancelled so I managed to find the courage to see if she wanted to go out at some point and do something. I was worried given the previous situation. She responded that she was busy for the next couple weeks with social stuff already planned and said after a couple weeks she will be free but didn’t elaborate further. I took that as a soft rejection and just said that’s completely fine. She did follow that up with another message emphasising that we would be meeting at a now scheduled gathering so she will see me then.

After a couple days of occasional chatter one of our conversations ended with a mutual enjoy your night. I noticed that I had initiated basically every time bar the first so I wasn’t sure if she was interested, I left the chat for nearly 3 weeks and no initiation. I decided since she is coming over for a friends birthday just to naturally start the conversation relating to that. There was a short and sweet conversation and then the next day I just asked her how she was doing and we chatted for about an hour until I said jokingly that I would stop bothering her as I had to do something, she liked the message and now we are here the next day.

I would like to say:
- She can take minutes to a couple hours to reply

-She usually sends a sentence or two per message

-She has never left me on read

I just want someone to smack some sense into me and tell me if she is interested or just trying to be nice. I constantly feel like I am annoying her even if the chat might not imply it. I don’t want to keep bothering her as the lack of initiating makes me think she isn’t interested, at the same time she wouldn’t try and keep a conversation going if she wasn’t right?

I reiterate “no seriously no slapping.” And she goes silent. And once again to make it clear I say “seriously, that’s a hard line in the sand.” And she says very softly ‘ok I get it.’

The rest of the evening felt really off for me because she didn’t apologize or even try to explain that she was doing it in a joking way. I go home and eventually text her how the slap made me feel and she says “oh I didn’t realize it made you feel that way, I won’t do it again.”

So even after 4 prompts she did not apologize. From the start of the relationship she has playfully slapped me in the face but usually lightly and not to the point where I’ve felt it warranted to call her out.

We've connected on an amazing level, have so much in common and we've been talking to each other almost daily. 

We're not officially dating but we have met up and had sex with each other twice now and I have strong feelings for him, he's confessed he feels the same. He's really made me feel amazing and so sexy through his charm and compliments.

Today, a post he commented on (on Facebook) cropped up on my feed. It was a girl he is friends with profile picture and he commented 'wit woo 😍❤️' (a wolf whistle basically) on it. To note, about 75% of his friends are female. I get that we're not dating but he's told me that he's never felt like this about anyone before the way he does with me and alot of other things like that, so to see him commenting on pictures of other women like that made me feel a bit shit and confused.

So since I've been out the dating game for a while, could you tell me -  should I let it go and calm the beans as we're not dating, or should I be concerned and have the right to feel shit? I'm so confused lol.

I feel like I’m lacking some sort of attraction factor. Fresh off another slow fade rejection. It probably doesn’t help that I’ve been extremely anxious and depressed most of my life but I’ve tried so hard to make myself a decent human and have something to offer the world. For my whole teen and adult life, I can’t seem to keep anyone’s interest longer than 3-5months. Then I get super depressed and my self esteem needs another few months to be ready to attempt to meet someone new via dating apps which also feels extremely challenging to coordinate (social anxiety/depression/low self esteem). I feel like a black hole sometimes and it’s extremely painful and predictable when I hear “all I can offer you is friendship” or am simply ghosted. I also hate that I want to be in a relationship because it feels so stupid trying to believe love is something magical when clearly it’s just based on shallow things. There are very few couples I know where I think “yea that’s based on some deep, genuine blah blah” rather than looks/social status, etc. I guess the real source of my misery is not feeling like I have a person who really *cares* what the fuck my life is about or really feels like they want me in theirs. That part of my misery tends to feel more like a basic human need but maybe it’s all just worse in my head because I’m so anxious and depressed to begin with. I’ve struggled with these feelings since like 4th grade. I feel like I’ve been waiting since that age for someone to really have a crush on me or really pursue me and somehow I am just not quite the right combination of things for that to happen still. I know this is too broad and lacking specifics for meaningful feedback on what I could be doing wrong. In general I’d say I’m probably boring and just go with the flow and It’s like my worst fear to be needy. Then when I feel the rejection happening I just feel so miserable how once again I’m failing to be a meaningful part of anyone’s life. I mostly just want to know if anyone can relate. Don’t want pity or anything and not trying to feel sorry for myself.

Great guy, an absolute amazing person. By far one of the most amazing people I’ve ever met. 

I don’t coach with him anymore; I coach a different sport. But I can’t get him out of my head and it’s because of this reason: 

I went through domestic violence when I was 19-23. Never really thought I’d have a future. And for my first time ever in my adult life, I have that with him. Because he does the one thing I’ve always wanted which is to just let me be me. 

No pressure, no expectation, no getting mad if I don’t do something. He can read me like a book most of the time and we can finish one another’s sentences. He just gets it. 

I’ve tried. Believe me I’ve tried. I’ve gone on legitimate dates with other people, and it hasn’t worked. 

How can I acknowledge feelings for him in a way that is healthy? 

Here’s the issue of why I can’t acknowledge them: I struggle with depression/suicidal thoughts. But after the first time this guy and I hugged, it changed my brain chemistry. 

Now it’s like “Oh, I can’t do that now that my feelings are out in the open.”

I [20M] have been friends with this girl [20F] since November 2020 and we became pretty good friends. We’re both introverts (she’s more introverted than me), we share the same interests/hobbies, went out a couple times, text each other often and have deep conversations,etc. I kind of had feelings for a while but they started dying out after her recent behavior.

I’m overseas currently and things here are very cheap so at one point I told her, “btw if you want anything like snacks, food (stuff u don’t find in America), or anything else I got you” and she said “Lol thanks for the offer”. A few days later I go to the library and there’s an anime section that has books on her favorite show and I thought of her when I saw those books so I sent a snap of those books saying “do you want anything?” and she left me on read which I thought to myself hmm okay and gave her the benefit of the doubt that she might be busy or something. A week later I finished her favorite game (she loves talking about this game) and I sent her a snap showing that I finished it. She left it on seen..

I told myself ok she’s acting a little weird so I’m just going to stop texting her for a while so I don’t seem desperate (she’s left multiple snaps on opened). Fast forward a week later after not sending her anything, today I texted her “There’s a summer sale on steam rn and a lot of games have good deals atm” one of her hobbies is gaming but she isn’t as invested in it as I am (before y’all come at me saying she’d already know there’s a steam sale since she likes games). She left that message on read too so idk what’s going on. She watches my stories all the time (bonus info I guess?). I just want to know why she’d start acting like this all of a sudden. It’s been a little over 2 weeks and she hasn’t responded/texted while I’ve sent some texts and snaps (All left on read)

Part of me thinks: be a man, don’t text her at all and if she doesn’t text back then just move on. The other part of me wants to text her and ask her what’s going on which I know a man should never do because it looks so desperate and cringe.

I don’t know if they hang out outside of work, but I do know they’re friendly. She works at a coffee shop. 

You see, my girl doesn’t know who to drive. I don’t want to drive her cause I myself work to, and plus I can’t afford to spend that much gas haha she lives across town. 

So she usually Ubers her way to work. Sometimes she’ll Uber her way back home, other times she get’s rides from her co-worker. From what I understand, she’ll get a ride from either her manager, who’s a girl, as other times from a male co worker who I believe is around my age. She’ll only get a ride if they close together, otherwise she’ll Uber, or shit sometimes she’ll ask me to pick her up and we’ll eat lunch. 

Now when I was told this, I felt slight insecurity and jealousy, but didn’t say anything. In truth I don’t like feeling that way and try my very best to not let things get to me, try to be confident and secure. Eventually I forgot all about it and didn’t really care, I trust her. Makes sense to get a ride from a coworker rather than spend money on Uber. 

Only today we went out. Eating breast fast, then she casually mentions to be that her co-worker who usually gives her rides was hungry when they closed, so he decided to get some food before dropping her off. And offered her to pay for her food. So they together picked up some food. She didn’t eat but she did accept some ice cream or smoothie or something. Pretty sure they ate together regardless. 

I didn’t really react much, nodding my head or whatever to her story, telling me she was disappointed by her smoothie or whatever. 

In truth I’m not sure how I should be reacting, nor do I understand why she’s telling me that she went out with a co-worker. I mean it get either be 1. her trying to get me jealous 2. Testing my boundaries and seeing how I would react 3. Mentions it because she feels it’s the respectful things to do and doesn’t want me to find out another way. 

It’s worth mentioning that she’s invite me to her work often to get me a cookie or some ice cream or whatever. We’ll wait in line together holding hands or each other. So the coworker definitely knows we’re together. I’ve seen him a couple times. And he’s seen me. 

Now again I don’t enjoy being jealous, nor insecure. I’m not very used to. When I feel it I try my best to get over and revert back to a feeling of “indifference” and accepting things as they are. 

How should I proceed? Are my feelings getting the better of me? Or is this something worth being concerned. I definitely don’t want to be that controlling boyfriend, and refuse to be the “I don’t want you to hang out with him or her” type of person.
