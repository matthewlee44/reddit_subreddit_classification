0,r339z3,1637980820,Did I Dodge A Bullet?,"LDR, that just ended because he said he had a medical condition that caused impotence. He can’t be with someone he couldn’t be intimate with. Then said he figured out last week he wasn’t in love with me. But I’m a smart woman and I deserve better.

I’m hurt of course. Planned to move across the country and start a whole new life with him. 

The question is: did I dodge a bullet? On one hand I was angry and on the other hand I see his point. Seriously life isn’t all about sex. What’s your input Reddit?

2,r343ak,1637983403,Annoyed and single during the holidays,"I’m single. 46m. Single for a while. Off and on with someone who probably is really bad for me (off for good now) and missed out on a woman who is too good for me. I really, really hate this time of the year.  It started with losing a grandparent who was closer to me than my father, and then a year later finding out my wife was screwing around with more than one guy. It’s been about 8 years since I enjoyed the holidays.  I like them only for my kids, but they are 18 and now have their own lives. 

I’m single and annoyed. I’m jealous if the people who seem to have their stuff together. I used to think I was one if those people. I don’t want to get into a relationship at this time of year.  I wonder if I’m too broken to date, but also find myself wanting to spend time with someone who would appreciate a good guy.  I wish there was a way to get through the holidays and not dealing with happy family and friends, and being asked if anyone special is in my life.  I know why the holidays are tough for some folks.

3,r345i4,1637983605,"Transitional relationships - the one after the ""big one""","I (49F) am in the process of ending a relationship with a M of similar age. It's been over a year, it was going extremely well until a few weeks ago when several new and some pre-existing factors worked against us. I'm still in the processing stage and expect to be for some time.

&amp;#x200B;

Before that I was in a LTR (over 12 years) with the father of my kids. I ended that when it became obvious the dynamic was toxic and wasn't going to change. I felt like I did a lot of work coming out of that (counselling, self-reflection etc) to understand my part in in, and that did help in this current relationship in terms of speaking my truth, even if that hastened the end.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to talk about transitional relationships. I get a lot of wisdom from this sub, and remember ppl talking about the first relationship after a long term one. That we can gravititate towards someone who is the opposite of the traits we found so difficult in our ex. So in this case I went for a calm, gentle, emotionally aware, understanding and compassionate man. However, in delighting in these qualities and the relationship we created I missed (buried) a few red flags - avoidance, fear around commitment, different financial perspective from mine. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have also read that the grief when one of these relationships ends can be overwhelming. I've definitely been there this last few days. Why is that I wonder? Is it something to do with feeling ""this had to be it"" as it was so dissimilar from the previous LTR. or that you'd finally met ""your person""?

Tell me about your transitional relationship and what you learned from it. If you have a positive story about the next relationship after the transitional relationship, then I'm also keen to hear that : )",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/r345i4/transitional_relationships_the_one_after_the_big/
4,r36z9k,1637993254,Am I doing something wrong?,"Dating in my forties  (45F) has taught me a lot.  After being a widow for over a year, I started dating again.  I had a lot of fun, and it really taught me who I am, what I bring to the table, and what I need from a partner.  I have also realized what I am looking for in a person and what ""mistakes"" I have made in the past I don't need to repeat.   

Here it is 5+ years of dating and I am ready for a relationship again.  I thought I found the one when I started dating this guy (42M).  He is a great guy, and we had a lot of fun, but it wasn't love.  We broke up initially because he thought I couldn't make him a priority (single mom that is also finishing her degree). After a long talk, I realized what he wanted, was something that he was never going to provide for me.  I know how you have to juggle both your children and your partner and put their needs when it is needed.  He never had children didn't understand that.  After all that is said and done, I think he was scared.  He had said every relationship he ended came down to whether he thought they would make a good mother.  Now that I am a mother (which he constantly was telling me how great of a mom I was) he didn't have that excuse.  He also mentioned many positive things about me, and when it came to an end he listed a couple of very superficial reasons.   

After a few days of everything settling, I realized I loved the way he treated me, but not him.  So we talked again, and we became great friends.    I even brought up some of the superficial things he said and how he himself was no better.  (one of them was he couldn't be with someone that wasn't healthy... I have a minor knee issue that will require surgery here soon and then I will be good as new..... he on the other hand has a brain tumor that isn't causing issues right now, and he refuses to get it removed, but it is growing and could cause issues down the road)   He admitted that was lame!   

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I am great and know what I want in a man.   The point to this post (I swear I'm getting to it) is every man I start talking to seems to disappear or finds a reason not to take it to the next level.   Many friends and their boyfriends agree I am a catch,  I have my life in order, I hate drama and don't create it, I'm honest, upfront and there is no BS to me.   I don't believe in pressuring anyone to be in a serious relationship.   I am better than that and shouldn't have to beg.   I even had to end a friendship with a man because there was always interest in each other but due to being in different states, we couldn't commit to each other.  Unfortunately, he told me he wanted commitment, but after 24 hours he rescinded.   Then after a couple of months, he text me how much he was an idiot and wanted to try.... then 24 hours he changed his mind. So I said bye!  We can't even be friends if I open myself to an emotional relationship on;y for him to get cold feet, twice!

Our relationship was less than a year long, but it was intense and deeply emotional. Incredible sex. He was loving, sweet, funny, etc. Important detail: he’s a single dad, recently divorced. Although, he said he wasn’t in a place to be in a relationship when we broke up the second time, he told me a month after we ended it that he started seeing someone else. I was devastated. So, I moved on and stopped all contact. My life has been great since. I’ve been happy and thriving. 

Last week, he started texting me out of nowhere, as if nothing happened. I confronted him about it and said that I couldn’t even attempt a friendship with him. And asked him why he reached out. He just said he missed talking to me. Not that he missed me… He missed talking to me. Thank u, next. If I’m being honest with myself, I miss him way too much to even pretend to be friends. I need no contact for my own sanity. That’s why I’m so upset that he reached out. 

Why do people do this? It’s so selfish and cruel. If you’ve moved on, then move on. Stop fucking with people’s hearts. And now, he’s all I can think about because I still miss him.

62,r573ak,1638223851,What Effort Would You Put In?,"Struggling with what to do about my (M, 45) ""sort-of-girfriend's"" (F, 43) birthday on the horizon. The backstory on this is very long, but I'll summarize as best I can to take us to the present,..

We met online 13 months ago. We're both single parents of 2, her (F, 43) kids are a little bit older than mine (M, 45). We've had a few stops and re-starts along the way, but we've always stayed in touch, seemed to always have a connection. In the last several months we’ve grown more intimate, have had sex several times, but we have not defined what we are. We have not met each others’ kids, families or friends, though that might change in a week or so if she doesn’t back out of a Christmas party being thrown by a longtime friend of mine. Obviously, her coming with me is a big step.

With her birthday less than 2 weeks away, I am looking at the big picture of how she’s shown up in this relationship. I have reached a point where, I’m not sure I feel like giving the acknowledgement of it much effort. For example:

* Her main method of communication is texting, and she is a notoriously slow texter, even when she initiates (which is pretty steady that she reaches out to me). A phone call is rare.
* She has only initiated a date once, and that was for my birthday this summer. She is an INTP personality-type and hates to plan, and wound up leaving it to me to pick the place and try to make a reservation last minute. She wound up stepping up and getting it done, and we had a great night. I will admit, she never says no when I ask her out.
* Mother’s Day, I gave her a nice, potted flowering plant, and a card. Father’s Day—I got a text.
* When a few weeks had gone by without us seeing each other, I sent her bouquet of flowers, just because. To date, I’ve never receive one thing.
* When we hit 1 year since the date we first met online, I sent her a card I made to acknowledge it. She loved it, but she didn’t even realize we had hit one year.

I want to clarify, she has not stated any expectations of me to do something for her birthday. This is all me.  There’s the half of me who adores her, then there’s the half that’s frustrated with her. I’m not saying I should do nothing, but do I keep it as simple as a card, or go to the point of trying to do more (a gift, a dinner, a day trip)?

69,r5elrv,1638246116,Dating Women with Kids vs No Kids,"In my personal experience, I've found that women (specifically 40+) that don't have kids are uncompromisingly selfish in certain aspects that I think are important in making relationships work. Is this just my small sample size?

Over the last year and change, I dated 2 women (on separate occasions) who were in their 40s and didn't have kids. The red flags were there from Day 1, but by months 2-3 I knew it wasn't going to work. The first (a widow) refused to accept that I couldn't offer her more than 1/2 days a week of my time. She would attack me every time I said I couldn't do something with her. The second (never married) refused to be exclusive/monogamous even though I doubt she was seeing anyone else. Maybe I wasn't the one for her, but both seemed genuinely shocked and asked ""Why"" when I said that I didn't think this was going to work. 

I get that certain things that people won't compromise on, but if they were happy why not try to?

On the other hand, I dated a women with 3 kids when I was in college and she did everything she could to make things easy for me even though I never asked her to.

I can feel semi-confident about my body if I’m wearing the right clothes, but eventually, at some point in a relationship, those come off. And the thought of that gives me so much anxiety.

He calls it “almost cheating” because he never actually met the prospect before they broke up, but I consider it cheating because he most certainly would have! The timing thing was a technicality. 

It was a dead bedroom. That she was supposed to stay with him temporarily but then just wouldn’t move out and never contributed to any effort around the house. They fought all the time, etc. etc. etc.

He shared this as an example of a big lesson learned — ie that he would never stay in a dysfunctional relationship longer than he felt was right. That it was unfair to everyone. 

I like his personality and vibe but this story screams avoidant personality and dishonesty. He really wants to see me again. I told him I’d think about it.

97,r6e3yo,1638363271,It was a mutual break up. I seem to put myself in perpetual short relationships.,"TDLR - Both of us agree that there is no proper connection between us and we broke up before our Christmas trip.

I met this girl online about 5 months ago.

On paper she ticked all my boxes so i asked her out and we started dating.

Fast forward to today, we mutually agree it wasn't going anywhere so we broke up. 

I now understand when someone is not really into you and keeps you second guessing yourself it is probably high time to move on.

To give you some examples,

\-after our first meeting, I asked for her number and she said let's talk later. So later in the day, I messaged her saying it was a good meeting. When is it a good time to talk on the phone? She said let's take a raincheck.

\-I had initiated all the text messages and she answers in a couple of days time with some uninformative feedback.

\-She tells me she is not much of an online messaging person. So, I said I can call you instead then she says lets keep to text messages.

\-I asked her what is your ideal partner? She replies, I am more happy to be single but would like a relationship. I asked her, do you like children and thinking about marriage? She replies, I would like children if my partner wants them and I would get married if my partner wants it. In my mind, I was thinking that is confusing as fuck. In my head, im like then why are you on a dating site when you want to be single?

\-A couple of week ago, I asked her whether she was close to marriage from her past relationship. She chumped my head off saying I was bringing drama and baggage into the relationship. She doesn't like drama or baggage. [https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/qsrkok/gf\_doesnt\_want\_drama/](https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/qsrkok/gf_doesnt_want_drama/)

\-After that she said, I want a person who is confident and stable in his life. Umm..maybe I didn't say it clearly from the beginning. I don't deserve to be put into a situation where I am carrying someone's baggage. I addressed every one of her concerns and she said maybe she overreacted. At this point in her life she just wants to have fun with her partner. So we ended up doing a lot of restaurant events.

\-Today I invited her over to my place because I wanted to know how we were trekking as our Christmas holiday is coming soon. I've preempted the invitation with a text saying I would like to know what you think about seeing more of each other. So when she turned up she asked to speak first and said I don't think I am getting a connection with you and there is no point of continuing this relationship. Then I said, you are right I am not finding a connection with you as well and that is why ive asked you to my place tonight instead of dinner at the restaurant. She continues it has been 5 months and we have not shared physical intimacy because it should've happened by now. Then I said, I wanted to see you as my romantic partner but I just don't know who you are so how are we supposed to have a holiday together. I said, I wanted to get to know you but you don't do text and you don't do phone calls and so when I see you in person it feels like im talking to a stranger every time. I said, Ive asked you what time is best to call you but you don't respond. At this point, she just looked at me and nodded. She said, I feel like you want me to give you more than I could give you. So I asked her what do you think I need from you? She didn't answer. I said, I know we are on a different track in our lives and I've been more than generous and forthcoming with you but whenever we communicate with each other it is strained and weird. I know that if we have felt a connection then physical intimacy would have happened because someone would have already initiate it. We are basically friends ending our outtings with a kiss. I said, alright it was great to have known you and she said, likewise. Well, I will leave then and yeah, I will get the door for you.

99,r6gs2r,1638371087,Talking to a guy for 2 months - contacts me on another dating site.,"Makes me want to bang my head on a wall. Started chatting with a guy from Tinder, ended up exchanging numbers and snap chat. Have been texting and SC for almost 2 months. I didn't take his super serious since he would never set a time to actually meet, but he was fun to chat with. 
I deleted my tinder account and opened one on FB dating.  
He messaged me on FB dating last night like he had no idea who I was. It made me feel how uninteresting/undesirable I am. Never seem to be relationship material, I'm someone filling a void till they find who they really want. 
This is just me venting. Not sure why it struck me so hard. Guess realizing I'm not special. Just another lady in his contacts.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/r6gs2r/talking_to_a_guy_for_2_months_contacts_me_on/
