NSFW for talk of sexwork. 

I just wanna first say please be gentle but honest. I'm feeling pretty raw and tender right now, so please try to see me as human in your replies. 

That said, **the short of it is** that I dated a woman for two years which ended horribly because we ran into very MINOR financial trouble. My family is pretty well-off, but she didn't know this. We had great sex, a nice place, we both loved the same things, and we were happy for the most part. From my perspective, everything was great until money was a problem.  She still dumped me immediately after money problems, so I came to the conclusion that money was the key motivator in relationships. Eventually, after many arguments, she blocked me on everything as I was not civil about it. I was rude and cold as I felt she betrayed me (I took care of her and gave her money when she really needed it, but when I hit a rough patch she just left). I find myself hating her because of this.

**Most recently,** I tried dating a Sugarbaby. It was long-distance. I never met her in person. She promptly told me what she wanted. Things started mostly sexual. Everything was clear. No lies. Straight to the point. We worked it out for quite some time (about a year), but eventually I wanted an emotional connection. Of course, as I thought might happen, that didn't work because she said she isn't attracted to me at all even though we have a lot of similar interests. She was very straight-forward which I appreciate. I still think she was wrong to make this conclusion without even seeing me in person or many photos of me at all (In her videos and photos she sent me I felt she was like a 7.5 and I'm at least like 6-7 in looks), but that's her decision.

**From there, we downgraded to a friendship. Today, my friendship ended with the second woman** because she was over the sugar thing and found a new relationship. I didn't want to know the details, but she told me she lusts for them and that she never needed me. I was honest with her and told her that I want her and not to be her friend.  The sheer idea of me wanting her made her so uncomfortable she blocked me. She said she lost respect for me after I told her that I wanted her physically and emotionally to myself (in very plain language) - That I disrespected her relationship (she's been with this person for maybe... 2 weeks as far as I know, if longer, it was in secret). She told me, ""Money can't buy love, Soft-Secretary-7407."" I still very much feel attached to her, and I miss her even though she shut me down so hard and painfully and won't even be my friend.

In the end, I feel like either there's something severely wrong with me or that relationships just can't work in modern times as the apps are horrible for me. I don't believe in 'THE ONE' or cosmic love or something like that. I am feeling very lost, hopeless, and honestly a bit suicidal. 

Have any of you been through something similar? What would some of you do in my position?

We love each other's company but for the love of me, I cannot get it up. We've tried on two occasions already, once in a very comportable space (my apartment) but every time, the scenario is the same - it seems like everything is OK but then when we try to go all the way or when she tries to perform oral sex on me, my penis goes soft within seconds... We can be cuddling and it would seem like it's getting hard but then when it goes out of the pants - instant boner killer. We even tried twice on the same night with a lot of space inbetween with cuddling and just being with each other but again - it _seemed_ to be working when it was in the pants (though even then it's softer than I'd ever imagine it be in a company of a girl knowing how easy it is for me to get it up on my own) but then started gradually getting softer during the BJ.

I don't understand that cause I'm crazy about her and I thought that having an erect penis is going to be the least of my problems when the occasion arises cause I never had _any_ trouble with it but it's proving to be impossible so far. I don't use porn in any excessive amount and in the past weeks, I'm not even masturbating (with or without porn) and yet still even though everything looks fine, I cannot get it up in the situation that should seem _the most hot_, ie. her naked and the situation steamy. I thought that in a safe space and after a couple of dates it would resolve on its own but even though we cuddled for _hours_ that one night, it still did not help.

Is this normal? Can this take a few tries and just resolve on its own? I know that the subconscious stress, me not being accustomed to anybody touching my penis and performance anxiety probably play a factor but I just thought that even if this did not work the first time, it'd be sure to work by the second one, especially since the surroundings were familiar, safe and unrushed. I don't want to shove any medicines down my throat until I'm certain that's the only way, hence why I'm asking about the proclivity for that to resolve on its own. Any personal accounts?

We matched on **Bumble**. We were talking about our dating lives when she asked me, ‚ÄúSo how‚Äôs your **Tinder** experience so far?‚Äù

I smiled at her. Then we both laughed when she realized her mistake. She‚Äôs using several dating apps at the same time, and she‚Äôs been on too many dates that she‚Äôs confusing one guy over the other. She met me on Bumble, not Tinder!

‚ÄúSo why are you on Bumble? *And* Tinder?‚Äù I asked.

She shrugged, ‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù

I nodded. And after a short pause, I asked, ‚ÄúWhy bother?‚Äù

She thought for a while. ‚ÄúHonestly?‚Äù

‚ÄúHonestly.‚Äù

She sighed. ‚ÄúSomething to change my work-home-sleep routine?‚Äù

‚ÄúHow about friends?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe hang out. But it‚Äôs the same people, the same stuff. Dating is a bit different, at least.‚Äù

‚ÄúHobbies?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm overworked and underpaid. I don‚Äôt have the money, time, or energy. Dates take an hour or two over beers. And then I‚Äôm done.‚Äù

I‚Äôve been in a similar situation before. And the idea of swiping left and right compulsively out of boredom, and meeting people for drinks just to change the routine, wasn‚Äôt appealing to me. **Boredom dating is like boredom eating: You do it just because it‚Äôs there. But it‚Äôs tasteless. And usually unhealthy.**

In my experience, boredom is a symptom of something else: an unfulfilling career, a fear of the unknown, unattended personal issues. It‚Äôs easier said than done, but I‚Äôm happier when I deal with one of those symptoms first before heading back into the dating pool.

If you‚Äôre in the dating pool and you‚Äôre consistently getting mediocre dates, then one or more of these reasons is probably the cause. I talk about these reasons in more detail [here](https://psiloveyou.xyz/4-reasons-dating-isnt-working-for-you-b985cf3f11c1), but the main points are:

# 1. Showing up at a potluck expecting to eat, but not bringing any food 

I can‚Äôt count how many people in the dating pool have shown up with bland dishes and empty pots. Unfortunately, you can‚Äôt control what other people bring to a date. But you can decide [what you bring](https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/on34e3/how_i_genuinely_connect_with_any_girl_on_a_date/). 

And the first thing you don‚Äôt bring? A bucket of expectations. Don‚Äôt expect your date to be something. Instead, ask yourself: ‚ÄúHow can I bring out interesting things from this person?‚Äù

# 2. Qualifying dates

Online dating makes it even easier: You can specify what height or pet preferences you want from a date. But these specifications lead to missed opportunities.

Instead, think of the ONE thing you want to have from a date. And be honest with yourself. Are you looking for a fuck buddy? A friend to geek out with? A good, but platonic conversation?

**Don‚Äôt look for:** A good conversation with someone who‚Äôs into dogs and who‚Äôs also watched Sense8 and who‚Äôs cute enough to fuck and they‚Äôre not looking for a relationship right now, but they might consider it if the stars align in your favor.

This makes dating unnecessarily difficult. And it‚Äôs selfish. Dating isn‚Äôt about looking for and getting what you want. That‚Äôs what jerks do. Have you ever felt drained and used by a person? Then you just got jerked! And **we don‚Äôt want to jerk other people unless it‚Äôs the pleasurable kind.**

# 3. Being too preoccupied with oneself.

Dating is like taking a walk in a huge eco-park. If one is too busy worrying about their undone shoelace, or the smudge in their boots, or taking Instagrammable shots to show friends how much fun or not-fun one is having, the entire experience is missed.

# 4. You‚Äôve been on too many bad dates and you need to stop.

You‚Äôre burned out from dating. You‚Äôve become cynical. And it‚Äôs starting to show.

Dating burnout makes you more judgmental and closed to new experiences. So you‚Äôre not in the [best mindset to meet someone new](https://psiloveyou.xyz/how-to-genuinely-connect-with-anyone-on-a-date-48f54ccece4f). You‚Äôre almost always subconsciously waiting for your date to trip on your red flag minefield.

Solution?

* Step back and do other things.
* Have some fun again.
* Go on a solo trip (or plan one if you can‚Äôt travel yet).
* Hang out with your activity group (hiking group, running group, yoga besties, etc.)

# As for my date that night?

I've decided not to see her again. I'm better off not being someone else's boredom fidget. I sent her a message, of course. (""Hi! Thanks for last night. I don't think we'll work out together though. Have a good day!"") I don't ghost.

I love my boyfriend so much and I would have loved to marry him. He is an amazing person, but I believe we hold each other back.

We know how to have a good time together, lots of laughs with similar He is my second serious boyfriend while I‚Äôm his first. When we first met, I was struggling with depression + others and was at a really low point, mentally. I was needy and toxic; he was inexperienced and immature. 

I could go more into depth but basically, he‚Äôs a great and trustworthy dude and I sincerely love him so much, but I can‚Äôt help but feel like we should break up. We‚Äôve BEEN agreed that self-growth and healing needs to be independently done on both ends, but neither have enough time to make a genuine impact.

1) I explain why I‚Äôm upset ‚Äî&gt; 
2) he says sorry ‚Äî&gt; 
3) if I don‚Äôt let it go instantly, then I‚Äôll take solo time to think ‚Äî&gt; 
4) express those thoughts ‚Äî&gt;

Instead of letting go, you try to force yourself to interact with them as if you were extremely interested. You think that if you treat them like a boyfriend/girlfriend, they would eventually be someone that you want to be in a relationship with, but that never happens. This leaves the other party hurt. I think this is the reason why people 'lead people on'. Its not malicious, they were having an internal battle with themselves.

**(I am horrible at writing. If someone can convey what I'm trying to say more concisely, please do. Is there a name for this behaviour\^?)**

Below is a vivid dream that I had that led to this post (its horrible I know, I'll hire an english major to re-write it lol):

*You're a man living in a hypothetical world consisting of rooms along a corridor.*

*In this world, all single people spend time in 'Room 1'. You've been in 'Room 1' a while, maybe a couple of years; you've had trouble meeting someone that is willing to invest in a relationship with you. One day, in Room 1, you meet a girl who is very interested in you and is willing to be that person.*

*You take this girl's hand and you go knock on 'Room 2'. Within Room 2 is the largest store of dopamine, serotonin and oxytocin in this world. As such, the room is guarded. You yearn for the contents of Room 2... you've had access to it before.* 

*The guard answers the door, and opens it to the extent of the chain.* 

*You: ""Hey. I've met a girl (\*pointing at her\*). You can let me in again.""*

*The guard looks at the girl up and down..*

*Guard: ""Not tall enough, too fat, weird teeth. No way in hell I'm letting you come through this door with her. Come back with someone else"".*

*He shuts the door in your face. After taking a second to process what had just happened, you get angry. You begin slamming on the door.*

*You: ""Hey! What the fuck do you mean someone else? This person is smart and kind and they want to be with me! You think they're everywhere? Fuck you! Why do you have these rules? What are they for? Fuck you! Let me in!""*  

*You're angry. You want the contents of room 2; the contents are the whole point of this. In a normal situation, people move from Room 1, to 2, to 3. Room 3 is the room where you engage with your new partner and do all the cheesy things that come with a new relationship. In room 3 you send each other good morning texts, hold hands in public, and talk on the phone even if nothing interesting happened.  You know you shouldn't but you're desperate. You devise a plan to trick the guard and make him question his assessment of this girl. You want to prove to the guard that the girl is in fact someone that is 'good enough' by proving that you can stand to engage in couple activities with her. So you grab the girl and you head for room 3. You guys stay in room 3 for weeks and do all the things that madly in love couples do...even though you are forcing every act. Eventually, you return to Room 2 and you knock on it.*

*You: ""See! You were wrong. If she isn't someone that can qualify to enter this room, then how come I have enjoyed weeks of interacting with her like she's my girlfriend?""*

*The guard just sighs and shuts the door.*

*At this moment you breakdown. Sitting on the floor, you pull out your phone and you text the girl that you've made believe you are heavily invested in, and you tell her that you guys aren't going to be seeing each other anymore.*",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,911740,public,self,An analogy for why things sometimes end abruptly,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/op1wp5/an_analogy_for_why_things_sometimes_end_abruptly/,all_ads,6,,,,

I met him through FB dating and I was trying to stop thinking about a guy I met casually through my school because he was acting strange and eventually we went back home in his home country.

I developed a crush on him but I felt bad because he was giving me mixed signs and then he had to leave.

The first conversation with fb guy was promising and he seemed interesting, we met and he paid for my lunch.

He was nice and he texted me every day before the date. We talked a bit and overall it was fine but I didn‚Äôt feel a strong attraction in both looks and personality and honestly, I cannot understand his accent much.

He has been texting me every day or almost everyday and he said he wanted to meet again. I was open to it because I rarely feel super attracted after one date but he said he wanted to chill at my place or the seaside, he couldn‚Äôt at his own place.

I said I preferred to go for a walk and he was ok with it but then he said that day we planned he was busy. He keeps texting me everyday and the conversation feels...boring, very casual etc, we talk about stuff but there's no getting to know part. We don't talk about personal things aside from minor daily stuff.

He didn‚Äôt ask me out again and last time it was over two weeks ago, I am not staying here in this country for long and I may leave soon too.

I mentioned it because my plans keep changing due to covid and here it was supposed to be a temporary staying, he mentioned again chilling at home watching movies and tv series.

The self-inviting move by someone I barely met once seems a little too much...it would have been different if I asked him to come over but it seemed strange to want to chill at my house randomly.

Maybe he is trying to get laid or maybe I am biased because I am not into him  as I thought?

I would have accepted to go out again for walks and stuff, not spending money or anything to give him a chance but he doesn‚Äôt seem to ask anymore and chilling at home with someone I barely know is not appealing to me.

It's so god damn tedious!

All dating proves is that the majority of the human race are empty, shallow, shells that have NOTHING of worth to contribute to the planet other than CO2 emitions.

Even the ones who project as confident and interesting have just memorised a load of topics to distract you from the fact they have a borderline mental disorder. 

And have posted the three pictures they have of the fancy restaurant they visited three years ago. We all know you spend 90% of your time watching Netflix so why pretend?

You like to go travelling? Good for you. Way to sit right at the top of the fucking bell curve you average sheep.

You won't find out if your partner is intelligent and is willing and able to stand by you in a shit storm by swapping who your favourite Love Island contestant is so why the FUCK do we have to go through the same boring ass routine EVERY GOD DAMN TIME!?!?

Every time you fight to not get ghosted by staying engaged in the torrent of boring trash conversation only to find out they are as fucked up as the rest of us.

Then inevitably break up because neither of you were the exciting catch that you had to pretend to be to get that far in the first place.

Rinse and fucking repeat!

No wonder so many guys have commitment issues. You know why? Because going to a bar, playing some moves and sleeping with a woman who will leave the next morning is SOOO much better than dating.

Then what happens if you do find your way through the miasma of each others company? You can look forward to getting married and having kids..........great.

Dating and the torture of going through the dating process is like saying ""Instead of this prime cut of sirloin steak I'm going to try butchering a cow myself. But when I have gone through the effort of raising a cow and the mental scars of slitting it's throat and pulling it's entrails out I'll hand it to a factory owner and turn it into processed mince full of chemicals anyway.

Met a girl at my retail job about a year ago. Started talking to her and she started joining me on my breaks at work just about everyday we worked together. She immediately caught my interest as in my experience girls who are not interested do not go out of their way to talk to me or take breaks with me

Over the next 6 months i started to get to know her better in time we spent talking on our breaks. These talks would usually end up going 5-15 minutes over our scheduled break time once we got to know each other better. 

She started asking me more personal questions about my life, interests, and school. Alot more personal questions than ive ever had with any other co workers. She would ask about my family and follow up on the things I told her. 

She told me a lot about herself as well and always seemed excited to sit down and talk with me. She always wanted to know what I was up to on the weekends and told me she wanted to go to some museum once the pandemic was over. 

She even mensioned to me that she was single on valentines day and asked if i gad any plans. Then proceeded to randomly tell me that a few coworkers hit on her but she wasn‚Äôt interested. I changed the topic as i was un comfterbal. 

After about 6 months i finally got up the nerve to ask for her number. She gave it to me with no hesitation.  Texted her the next day and we texted back and forth about 6 times until i got distracted and didn‚Äôt get back to her until the next day. Texted her the next day and had to go to bed early and left the convo. 

The next day I texted her but got no response‚Ä¶ thought i was ghosted but then texted her a day or two after and she texted back  I then asked her if she wanted to go out on a date to which she said she didn‚Äôt think she could because she had a brother with health issues and may me vulnerable to the pandemic. I thought this was her way of rejecting me.  She didn‚Äôt specifically reject me or say she wasn‚Äôt interested but i took this as a rejection because if she was into me she would have giving me an alternative 

I told her i understood and I wouldn‚Äôt talk to her anymore. I understand how awkward it can be to be asked out and I didn‚Äôt want her to be un comfterbal. She said I didn‚Äôt need to do that as she really enjoyed our relationship. She told me to treat her the same and said a few other things that confirmed she understood I asked her out. 

Didn‚Äôt talk to her or hear from her until I saw her at work next. I tried to avoid her but that was impossible once she sat down with my on my break. We talked for an hour and the topic of that never came up. I didn‚Äôt know where I stood or how she felt about the whole thing. I decided i just needed to get over her

I texted her a few days later and asked her if it was ok if she could not talk to me at work because I needed to get over my feelings for her. I also told her I thought she was a cool person and was my friend, but I just needed some time but id like to remain friends. 

She told me that she was into someone else and I tried to convince her to shoot her shot because i thought we were just friends at this point. She agreed to being friends and I thought everything was fine until the next time i saw her she seemed very upset. 

It was not my intention to hurt her in any way, i just didn‚Äôt want her to feel uncomfterbal or anything like that. I texted her that afternoon and said it was ok if she wanted to talk to me at work again but i got no response

She seems to be aware and knows when people are hitting on her. She seemed used to it so idk why she wouldn‚Äôt just tell me she wasn‚Äôt interested. 

I went up and tried to apologize to her the next time i saw her but she wouldn‚Äôt even face me and said she just wanted to be vague. 

Today I was sitting in the break room alone minding my own business then she sat down across the room. My friend called me and after 30 seconds of talking to her on the phone, she gets up and hurries out of the break room. Just kinda weird.

One time we were going to a restaurant as a group of 4 and K called me and asked if she wanted to walk with her to the restaurant I stupidly said no because I already promised my best friend I would walk with him but her best friend actually got jealous and upset that she wanted to walk with me to the restaurant instead off with her since she was used as a substitute person to walk with because I said no. I would think her asking me to walk with her over her bf shows some level of interest.¬†

Met a girl at my retail job about a year ago. Started talking to her and she started joining me on my breaks at work just about everyday we worked together. She immediately caught my interest as in my experience girls who are not interested do not go out of their way to talk to me or take breaks with me

Over the next 6 months i started to get to know her better in time we spent talking on our breaks. These talks would usually end up going 5-15 minutes over our scheduled break time once we got to know each other better. 

She started asking me more personal questions about my life, interests, and school. Alot more personal questions than ive ever had with any other co workers. She would ask about my family and follow up on the things I told her. 

She told me a lot about herself as well and always seemed excited to sit down and talk with me. She always wanted to know what I was up to on the weekends and told me she wanted to go to some museum once the pandemic was over. 

She even mensioned to me that she was single on valentines day and asked if i gad any plans. Then proceeded to randomly tell me that a few coworkers hit on her but she wasn‚Äôt interested. I changed the topic as i was un comfterbal. 

After about 6 months i finally got up the nerve to ask for her number. She gave it to me with no hesitation.  Texted her the next day and we texted back and forth about 6 times until i got distracted and didn‚Äôt get back to her until the next day. Texted her the next day and had to go to bed early and left the convo. 

The next day I texted her but got no response‚Ä¶ thought i was ghosted but then texted her a day or two after and she texted back  I then asked her if she wanted to go out on a date to which she said she didn‚Äôt think she could because she had a brother with health issues and may me vulnerable to the pandemic. I thought this was her way of rejecting me.  She didn‚Äôt specifically reject me or say she wasn‚Äôt interested but i took this as a rejection because if she was into me she would have giving me an alternative 

I told her i understood and I wouldn‚Äôt talk to her anymore. I understand how awkward it can be to be asked out and I didn‚Äôt want her to be un comfterbal. She said I didn‚Äôt need to do that as she really enjoyed our relationship. She told me to treat her the same and said a few other things that confirmed she understood I asked her out. 

Didn‚Äôt talk to her or hear from her until I saw her at work next. I tried to avoid her but that was impossible once she sat down with my on my break. We talked for an hour and the topic of that never came up. I didn‚Äôt know where I stood or how she felt about the whole thing. I decided i just needed to get over her

I texted her a few days later and asked her if it was ok if she could not talk to me at work because I needed to get over my feelings for her. I also told her I thought she was a cool person and was my friend, but I just needed some time but id like to remain friends. 

She told me that she was into someone else and I tried to convince her to shoot her shot because i thought we were just friends at this point. She agreed to being friends and I thought everything was fine until the next time i saw her she seemed very upset. 

It was not my intention to hurt her in any way, i just didn‚Äôt want her to feel uncomfterbal or anything like that. I texted her that afternoon and said it was ok if she wanted to talk to me at work again but i got no response

She seems to be aware and knows when people are hitting on her. She seemed used to it so idk why she wouldn‚Äôt just tell me she wasn‚Äôt interested. 

I went up and tried to apologize to her the next time i saw her but she wouldn‚Äôt even face me and said she just wanted to be vague. 

Today I was sitting in the break room alone minding my own business then she sat down across the room. My friend called me and after 30 seconds of talking to her on the phone, she gets up and hurries out of the break room. Just kinda weird. 

Tl;dr: met this girl a while ago. Thought she was interested but she wasn‚Äôt... now its messing me up in future interactions because now i dont know whats just being friendly and whats interest.

Fast forward to this summer. My friends and I we're hanging out and they were drinking. One friend (S) asked me about that girl and the other (G) said that a different friend of ours (D) hooked up with her after I had moved. D had hinted at having interest in her when I was about to move but kinda played it off as a joke. S said that if D and the girl hooked up he would have heard about it. I asked G again later when sober and he said he heard it through the grape vine but can't remember who. 

Why does this matter? Well we both moved back and I was thinking about trying to hang with her and see where things go. I've always felt weird about sleeping with the same people as my friends. Some people don't care some do.

In the mean time, I've shaved my head and wore a cap most days and this meant I'm somewhat hidden but not quite. The only part of my face visible is my blue eyes and some nose. Honestly if you were to see me you'd probably think I look like Timothee Chalamet with the mask on and this is where my issues lies.

I've noticed a lot of girls sometimes just stare at me and start conversations with me instead of the usual vice-versa, it's easier to continue the conversation without the awkwardness I've had before.

Example, I was buying coffee and waiting a while, the waitress around the same age as me started the convo, we talked as if we knew each other on personal terms.

I needed time to recover from the relationship so i didn't start looking for anything serious until the end of March. I've tried nearly every dating app under the stars. It always ends up with either us matching and them never responding to the first text and unmatching, us talking for a little bit and the convo going dead, or us talking and it ends up in us just being friends . Since March, I've only met up with 5 people i've matched with on the dating apps. There's been only one person i've been successful with but after our 3rd hangout i asked if i could kiss him and he said no (so we're just friends and that's fine). I figured if i wasn't having any success with dating apps, i should get over my social anxiety and get out of my comfort zone and flirt with people in real life. Well i've done that, and it's failed miserably. Everyone has been taken. Also, i'm not sure if it's just where i live, but it feels like dating women is way harder than guys (for clarification i'm bisexual with a preference for women) . I rarely match with any girls on dating apps and it doesn't seem that many queer women are into hookups.  I went to pride and attempted to flirt, got rejected because i was too young, then tried to flirt with another girl and found out her age (she wasn't a minor but 18 is still too young for me). Also, no one ever approaches me. I always have to ask people for their numbers or ask them out and as an antisocial introvert it's absolute hell and takes me at a minimum 3 weeks to muster up the courage to ask someone's number which doesn't really work if you're probably never gonna see a person again unless you ask for their socials/number right in that moment. People say i'm super pretty and nice and i don't doubt i am but i wonder why if so, i'm always the one who has to ask for people's numbers etc. I've had so many rejections in the past 3 months it makes me wanna give up and wait for someone to just come to me. When i get super sad from this spectacle i just delete all my dating apps because in the same way being on social media for too long can cause you to get dopamine from likes, being on dating apps can do the same.

At the end of the date we hugged and he said he wanted to see me again. So today he made plans to set me up this whole indoor picnic.

Not too long into the day, he texts me to say he won‚Äôt have time to make the sushi so he‚Äôll buy it and then do the decorations. So I was like okay that‚Äôs cool, we‚Äôll do that then. Two hours before he‚Äôs supposed to show up he cancels on me saying he has a unexpected family thing. I‚Äôm like really pissed off by it and I told him that and he was apologetic but I‚Äôm still upset. I‚Äôm going out of town for awhile and wanted to see him before I left. 

I‚Äôd be lying if I said I didn‚Äôt like the guy but I‚Äôm pretty upset about him not coming.

I've ended it with nearly every gf I ever had usually cos of distance related issues. 

As the years have wore on I followed my cock rather than my heart or head. Slept with god knows how many hundreds of women now and I don't feel any happier or better for it. It's like I can't make a deep connection with anyone any more. We just use each other for sex and companionship but I never feel in love anymore. It's like I can't drop my armour and be vulnerable. I want to change and have tried to recently but it seems like post lockdown pandemic dating means women just want casual fun. I don't get it. 

I got burned the other week. Been seeing a girl for a few months which started off with her heavily talking about sex. Then it kind of changed and maybe she was interested in me as a partner, I don't know. I have been trying so hard to not just aim for sex with these women anymore. I want to try and feel how I used to feel. Sex is just a bonus. I hmmm'd and huh'd about her, never really knowing where things were going. But she was cute and interesting. Maybe I just can't communicate how I feel. Or maybe I don't commit fully. I went to see her one day and had quite the cute coupley day. In a precise moment I remember thinking, ok maybe she is worth a proper shot. I'll try be there for her properly now and commit to this a bit more. Kissed her as I left the next morning and thought things could be good.

Literally like some grand cosmic joke at my expense, she went deathly quiet and didn't text for a few days. Then she alluded to something going on and needing time. I instantly knew something bad was coming. Then 2 days later I get a text to say she bumped into am ex and they're getting back together and 'sorry for the run around'. I was so stunned and blindsided that I just laughed initially. Couldn't believe it. The timing of me deciding to change and this happening just couldn't be worse. Especially as I'd just started my own business and am under crazy stress. 

Nearly 2 weeks pass and suddenly a lot of terrible thoughts have set in. Like anxiety, trust issues, lack of control or emotions... Sort of questioning everything. What did I do or not do? How could I have not known or seen this coming? There was 0 warning or mention of an ex. In fact I thought she was pretty taken by me and I had nothing to worry about. All signs pointed that way.

It all happened just as I dropped the armour for the 1st time in years. I'm 30 and seriously worry I'm now going to be more jaded and closed off than ever now. The last person I wanted to trust just stabbed me in the back and didn't give me a 2nd thought. I've never known of a woman to use a man for sex lol. I think writing this crap out will help me get rid of the negative thoughts at least. I am tough and it's not my 1st rodeo.

I reassure her that I‚Äôm happy to go at whatever pace she wants she just has to be honest and she brings up that she was never looking for a relationship on the app and didn‚Äôt expect to meet someone she likes this much. I never told her I have feelings for her just that I really like her and care about her, and she said cause she‚Äôs confused she feels so shit since we have feelings each other but the prospect of being in a relationship makes her uncomfortable right now. She asked for my advice and I said look right now if we end it it won‚Äôt make sense, you just said you have feelings for me how about we continue to see each other after lockdown and if something happens it does. She agreed and stated she wants to try instead of just giving up. She lives on her own so I‚Äôm thinking the anxiety and loneliness might be getting to her and she‚Äôs a little in her own head?

So I started with a ""how's your day going?"". She said her day was slow and boring. *small victory* 

A few days later I asked her if her day was still boring , she gave a big expression of a frown and we shared a laugh. 

At this point after, I'm thinking ok, time to grow a spine and ask for her Instagram name. 

And I did it, she wrote it down on the back of my receipt. She accepted my follow request and when I saw her IG page,  I let out a big sigh and immediately regretted my decision.

She has 3 kids, and some pics with her and the baby father. I would ideally like to start a family one day with someone who doesn't have kids, but man 3 kids? The youngest just turned 1.
