1,pmgyiy,1631399832,Did I “cockblock” someone and should I feel bad?,"

So I was at an event the other day and there was this one girl who I met briefly. Later throughout the night I was bored so I went over the where she was and she was sitting at a table with the group. 

Now, there was this one other guy, I’ll call John to make things easier, was talking to her quite a bit before and they were sitting next to each other at the table. 

Went to the table grabbed a chair and said “you guys mind if I join you” and she said “no not at all.” She scooted over and I then unconsciously sat right in between her and john. If I remember john didn’t seem super pleased but he also scooted over I think. Pretty much we sat and talked and had fun conversations and teased each other a bit. 

In my eyes john clearly was into her but I didn’t try to “cockblock” him on purpose. How I know he was into him? he got up and went to talk to her as soon as I was leaving.

So story is : I have 3 dates with a guy. I am F36, he is 33 We met online. 1st &amp; 2nd were outdoor, the 3rd one was at his place. He asked me if I wanted to come over after my work. I said ""for what""? and He said "" to hang out"". 

I came over, we talked, watched movies. It was just feeling so right and comfortable.When we were off to bed, he asked if I wanted to stay, I said I do, but I asked where I was gonna sleep. I said "" I am gonna sleep with you on the same bed? I trust you, but I dont trust myself?!!! ""he laughed. Then he kissed me a good night sleep and that s it. LOL . Guys, dont get me wrong, I like him, but I am being cautious too. I dont want to get attached too quick and get hurt (been hurt so much in the past) 

The day after, he drove me to school (trying to do my Ms), we kissed goodbye, it felt so good again. I told him, that I feel comfortable with him. It was friday, then we did not set any specific time for next hang out. Saturday afternoon, I texted him asking how his weekend will be, he said He s tired and want to make sure he sleep well, He said he had plans in the evening, but he was cancelling it, and he said :"" I  will let you know how I feel on Sunday afternoon after my training (he is training fulltime)

 (For more information: the week behind this - the week we met- he told me that he didnt sleep well because his neighbor was so noisy early morning).

Question is : 

1. did i scare him or make a mistake by saying :"" i feel comfortable with him""??? I googled it and many people say When a girl say that it means she wants a serious relationship. OH jezzz, it is not what I meant when I said that. I am a pick woman, and 90% guys will not pass a coffee date with me, Thus, I am enjoying this guy a lot. Should I text him to ' explain' or make it clear to him that it was not what I meant? 
2. Did i make him feel unwanted that I stayed over at his place, but there was no sex? I believe I have the right to make it slow until I feel it s a right moment? How can I do that without shutting down the person?

6,pmheg0,1631401491,He waits for me now.,"So to give some context to this one, I (23f) am a college student (new to college life). I decided to actually go to school as a full time student now since I know what degree I want now. I currently live in non-traditional housing with my school. Which means dorms but instead it's a house and I get my own room. 

So this is where things get tricky. I met one of the housemates one night. Lots of stuff in common and he seemed chill. He's pretty awkward but over these last few weeks, he has been getting more comfortable around me. I want to clarify that I don't want to date anyone. He and I have never spoken about dating, feelings, or anything. Ever. It's only being 3 or 4 weeks of even knowing each other and talking a bit in the common area. 

I mention this because I definitely think he has the wrong idea. I never flirt but will have conversations with him and sometimes play the Xbox with him. Everything was super laid back until he started matching my schedule. 

For example, he knows when im home and when im at work. He is always downstairs if im home and never when im not. (Stayed homesick and didn't mention it which is how I found out). I can hear him just playing his Xbox from my room even though he could easily go play in his room. I also mention this because him playing in the common area is a new thing. He uses this as a way of sitting and waiting for me to come down to get food from the kitchen. (Sometimes he will watch movies with the others but usually he just sits in there all alone when I get home and leaves after I get my food) He started showing up at my job and even waits outside to walk me back. I asked him what he was up to, and he said ""oh nothing. Just walking. Is this creepy?"". At the time I said ""No, I saw you in the library so I figured I would see you out here"". (Just wanted to play it off as a one time thing as it was the first time I caught him) He did this once before but I was working late so he eventually left after realizing I wasn't getting off at that time. 

 I also noticed that he is starting to get jealous of my other housemate (let's call him Tim) who I am also pretty chill with. He told me about how weird it is that Tim is close to me or how creepy it is that he talks to me at the gym (my second job). The huge red flag also happened when we were playing halo one night and the 2 housemates (this guy and Tim)  started making a drug deal in front of me. This guy was VERY interested in buying from Tim. (In case you are curious, the drugs were DMT, Acid, Mushrooms, and some other weird names that I didn't understand. Even stuff to make these drugs) 

I'm definitely aware of my mistakes. I had invited him to go to the store with me or to go see stuff on campus as I don't have any friends and he was just sitting in the common area not doing anything. (Why not invite someone to join if they aren't busy either) I'm not flirty and dont even pretend to be into him. We literally just talk. 
So here is where I need help. Obviously this could go one of 2 ways. I am planning to be very clear and straightforward with how I feel. (This is going to happen no matter what) 

but he could A. Be super chill about it and respect that I am slowing becoming uncomfortable with this or B. He could get dangerous. 
I dont think he would do anything crazy but I also barely know this guy. We have ""hung out"" maybe 3 times. He knows my schedule. He waits after class for me, knows when I eat lunch/dinner, and even knows when and where I work. I really want to make sure that I approach this safely but firmly.

7,pmhjy2,1631402065,How Much is Too Much?,"So background, I'm trying to do some ""research"" on my ideal type.

To be honest, it's not research, I'm just trying to quench my anxiety before it flares up when I pit myself in this situation.

I'm what some people would call a 'youngin' and I have extreme anxiety, so much to the point where I go out of my way to make sure that everything around me is as perfect as possible.

Which brings the question:
How much effort is too much in a relationship?

I know from reading loads, watching loads of videos on why people hate specific types of people, like fetishizing, thinking of an item or award for something, and I strive to keep myself in a condition to where I don't cause any unnecessary stress for any potential partner or date that I my find.

Am I doing too much? Is it best to just wing it?

My biggest motivator through all of that was the good would come and I would be happy and myself soon. 

Well here we are 5 months later, and it hasn't gotten any better. I started college, being told I would make so many friends, but I'm a month in and I have not made a single new friend.

I am so alone and no matter where I went and no matter how far I put myself out there to meet new people, I have gained zero connections with anyone. 

I fought through the worst summer of my life because I was told the good would come soon and I would be myself within weeks of moving to college. That hasn't happened and I don't see it happening at all in the near future. I can already feel the depression back at the level it was right after the breakup, and the suicidal thoughts are creeping back.

And then we started arguing how society has changed in the past 30 years, with me claiming that today appearence plays a much bigger role in dating due to the ""iper-capitalistic"" time that is affecting the ""sexual-market"" and how the focus of it has shifted from ""what is sold"" to ""how it is sold"".  

She responded saying that is because i see the things this way that i am alone, that i am too cynical and pessimistic to be appealing.

I’m not looking for marriage material either but even your casual flings don’t have to be based on chasing narcissists or people with the personality of a beige kitchen cabinet.

If you’re even semi-interesting, there are probably loads of strangers out there that you could chat and hang out with for hours. Some people you click with and others you don’t and both are fine. Being honest and straightforward is very liberating and almost intoxicating. If that means you’re not getting laid that night - that’s fine, the sun will rise tomorrow.

I might need your perspective on the following issues she's facing under the sheets, and please consider I am sharing this from a place of trying to understand how best to help and become a better partner myself. 

Lately, she confessed she had many irrational thoughts about me during sex, for example that I might be faking orgasms with her. As a male, this is the first time something like this was ever pulled on me and I wonder if I could do something to help her rather than telling her that I really enjoy doing it with her and I would never fake anything at all. I asked her if I ever gave her the impression I didn't enjoy making love together, but she said that rationally she understands her suspicions are purely irrational and that she sees I really like having sex with her every single time.

Last week, she stopped halfway during sex since she was convinced I was doing one particular position only to make her happy, and not because I enjoyed it, which was not the case at all as I was really liking it myself too!

Last night, making love in the dark, she accused me I was not really enjoying it, and then proceeded to claim that I was losing my erection even. I immediately turned the lights on to show her I was fully erect and that her thoughts were completely irrational to the point she was making stuff up. 

Some of her background: while we had pretty much the same number of partners earlier in our lives, she had a very rough experience with her last ex, when after 6 years together she discovered he lied to her about many, many things, including taking and selling drugs, which devastated her and brought her to a near mental breakdown, from which she mostly recovered. 

Since day1 she told me she has always had difficulties in reaching orgasm, no matter how good her partner was. Also, she told me she would often cry during/after sex.

When we started sleeping together, she told me she really enjoys making love with me, and that she is definitely reaching orgasm much more easily with me than with any other ex she had. 

I often noticed she keeps her eyes closed many of the times we make love, and sometimes indeed cries afterwards or during it, telling me that this is just normal of her, which I found out with some research, it is for some women indeed.

However, often times she really can't get to climax or getting wet even, no matter how hard we try and she gets frustrated at herself when she can't let go, to a stage where she even avoid suggesting me what would help her getting there. In these cases I try to calm her down and do all the things she usually likes, usually with little or no luck. 

Sometimes instead it's all very easy and natural and we get to climax pretty easily with no apparent difference in what I do. She keeps telling me she thinks I am very good in bed, and that it’s her not being able to let go.

I am a bit worried these issues might not be easy to fix by ourselves, and that she/we might seek professional therapy. For the meantime, I am honestly curious to hear any useful perspectives that I haven't thought about yet.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pmjs5h/shes_got_issues_in_bed/

I broke up with my long-term girlfriend a little over a year ago and have had almost no luck meeting new people. I use tinder and bumble and that crap and I get matches but rarely get a convo going let alone make plans to meet people.

We texted throughout the week and made plans to meet for dinner at 7 tonight. She stopped answering me today, but I was still being hopeful. I showed up at the restaurant and didn’t see her so I gave her a call. She sent it to voice mail and didn’t respond to a text either.
So I just drove around the city listening to music instead. It fucking sucked. I know it happens to everyone but goddamn I don’t know what I did wrong. She seemed really interested.

39,pmkjwm,1631414430,Please feel free to share why you think it is so difficult for single people nowadays to meet other people and date.,"Please feel free to share why you think it is so difficult for single people nowadays to meet other people and date. Overall, I think both men and women long to be in a loving relationship and desire to be in love with someone, yet at times feel hopeless that it will ever happen. I have a number of thoughts on this that could cover an entire book, but here are my main thoughts on this:

1 ) The digital world has isolated people from each other more than ever. You would think that a digitally connected world would allow people to connect, but the majority of digital connections are not deep connections. People we consider friends are actually just acquaintances. True friendship in the digital world is lacking.

2)  Human mating is probably closer aligned to Lion mating than people realize. Male lions fight and the most dominate male lion wins all the female lions. The female lions are happy and content mating with the most dominant lion and don't mind sharing. The digital world has allowed women to find the most dominant men and pursue them. Hence, why executives and star athletes have hundreds of women available to have sex at any time, while a large portion of men rarely have sex

3) Men and women are simply more different nowadays than at anytime in the past. Period.

4) I think there is a large percentage of women who don't want to meet men and date. They are happy pursuing their careers, interests, etc. Basically, a lot of women don't mind not having a man. Very few men are not happy being alone. Period.

Context for my statement: I went through a divorce in 2019. The relationship was 12 years.  I am in my late 30's. I make over $100,000 a year and started a master's degree program in Aug 2021. I have numerous hobbies and interests. Yet, I find it almost impossible to meet women and date. I thought ""starting over"" would be easy and then I quickly found out that today's dating environment is an utter nightmare. Best of luck to everybody in today's dating world. I hope love finds you one day. In the end, life is meaningless without love.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pmkjwm/please_feel_free_to_share_why_you_think_it_is_so/

Should I go for it?,"19 M First year on campus for college because I was stuck doing online my first 2 years.Nevertheless , I was excited to meet new people. 2 weeks roll by , I am starting to get more and more open to just talking a lot to random people , despite me being a introvert. I decide to step it up a notch and join a boston science organization. I see this really cute girl , but I know I shouldn’t come off as someone who just wants to date and more so as someone who just wants to meet people. So I start organically meeting new people not particularly focusing on her over a few organization meet ups. But recently, I start having a conversation during a meeting with a few members and her, I got kinda butted out because I was new and they were already friends. After the meeting we start conversing, and its going okay, I start chuckling jokes here and there, but really we are talking about the usual start up to meeting. I noticed she starts asking about me more than I am trying to ask her. Usually the guy directs the conversation. We are talking , i walk her to her car, then she gives me like a side hug. Now this is the part where I should ask for her number , but I didn’t want to rush it or make it seem like I wanted a relationship off the bat because   I will have to see her again if she is not interested.What is the best course of action as she is showing signs but I am not 100% sure.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pmkkvx/i_cant_tell_if_she_is_interested_should_i_go_for/

48,pml26c,1631416593,I’m at my wits end,"I am a female (20). This is about my friend who is desperate for a girlfriend. We have been friends for over two years now and it’s the same every year. 

I should start this by describing my friend. 

My friend is a male (20) and he is abstinent. When I mean abstinent he does not want to have sex or anything in between. Only kissing and cuddling. We go to college, and he is constantly looking for girls in bars and sororities. Not to stereotype but girls this age do not just want to kiss. And especially not girls at the bars and in sororities. I have suggested going to churches and joining church groups, and I an agnostic have even said I will go with him. He refuses to download any dating apps no matter how hard I try. 

I go to bars with him and some of his friends and he will find a girl and start talking to her and buy her a drink. It usually does not work out in his favor. These girls only want to hookup and not pursue anything serious. I have seen it many times. He talks to these girls for maybe an hour and then after when they don’t respond on messages he gets butthurt. I tell him every time your looking in the wrong places, and that’s how it goes at the bars. It’s nothing serious and you win some you lose some. 

He will dm girls or add random ones on Snapchat and talk to them. He gets dates out of them but they don’t work out. He is not a very smooth person and I guess you could say uptight or ever stubborn. He gets stuck on these girls and gets so sad when they don’t work out. This happens way to often. Recently it was two different girls in 48 hours. I don’t have an issue with helping him trying to flirt. But it’s hard when he doesn’t want to be suggestive or ever listen to what I have to say. He will txt me or call me at least five times a day when he has one of these things going about what to say to a girl. It’s way too much. He worries on how to say how are you. Calls me over this way to many times. Just say How are you omg. We once had a 30 min conversation over how to dm a girl on Instagram. He settled on the exact thing he said at the start of the conversation. 

He has recently moved into a new apartment with three guys. One guy has good dating experience. He also asks him constantly on what he should say. This guy got annoyed by it because he would ask every time he would snap a girl. Same as me. He never takes the advice. 

He constantly tries for me to set him up on a date, but the main issue with my friends is that they are all mainly Democrats. He is not. Their views don’t line up with his and he doesn’t think they will work out. Which is fair, but he’s very picky. I have no issue with dating outside of my political opinions, but he does. He’s very Christian as well which makes this harder. He wants a girl that is a good Christian and who is waiting for marriage, but also has a “bad” side. 

I am getting increasingly angry at this because this is what we mainly talk about and he cannot figure things out on his own. He doesn’t take my suggestions and I have told him all of this. I am very blunt at this point but he doesn’t listen. I like having him as a friend because when we don’t talk about this stuff it’s great, but when we do it’s not great.

Meanwhile, this dude doesn't even HAVE TO LEAVE HIS CAR? There are a million and two other activities we could do that would have costed little to no money.

I think I’m planning to tell him how I feel the next time I see him. The other thing is— I wonder if a distance relationship would work? I know it would be difficult for us not to see each other everyday so I don’t want to hold him back from other relationships he may be able to have in person if I wasn’t in the picture… also, my parents have a very strict no-dating policy so even when I DO go back home, it would be quite difficult to see him. 

I have a lot of doubts but I just don’t know what to do. Should I try to let go of the feelings I have now, or should I give it a shot? I also have the age-old worry about ruining our friendship over my feelings… does this situation seem worth it at all?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pmlyot/conflicted_about_confessing_to_my_friend_who_also/
62,pmm289,1631420906,I surprised her with my piano skills in audio now she wants a video of me playing the same song.,"

I’ve known a girl, she’s beautiful, intelligent, funny and sweet. At the beginning I didn’t know how to approach to her, till I found this subreddit and see one advice that said to improve and show your best qualities and talents. Is been at least a year that I play piano and I can say that I’m pretty good.

So I started my plan to approach to her, the first thing I did to have her attention was to talk with one of my friends in front of her saying “today my class of piano will be so hard” it works, she was surprised that I played one instrument, she asked me if I was good and I said that I didn’t wanted to flex. I think she liked my confidence. 

So the next step of my plan, was to find which was her favourite song, I asked her and she said that she doesn’t had any preferences, so I asked her favourite artist she said Olivia Rodrigo, but I still need it a song so I asked her which song she preferred of her. She said it to me, it was favourite crime.

So I started to find a way to learn this song for this girl and I found one, but it was an easy version and I thought that she deserved better, I find one tutorial and this one was a difficult one, so I started, I think I put a least 5 hours of my day during three days trying to learn, play and master the song. 

Yesterday I was ready and I texted her that I had something to show her, I called her and explained everything that I’ve done, like why I asked her favourite song and all, she wanted to listen the song and I played it while we were in call, it was the 2 most stressful minutes of my life, I had practised this song a million times but at that precise moment I couldn’t miss a note, or it will be awkward. 

I finished the song and she loved it, and maybe you will think that it’s a good thing and yea it is but she asked me a video! So I decided to make this post for advice like 

-how do I dress (formal, normal chill)?

-it’s a good idea to do an introduction and conclusion talking  or just a video of two minutes playing the song ?

-in which angle do I put the camera?

-do I even have to talk ?

-is there a way to surprise her ?

-do I put rings or accessories in my hand to be better looking? 

-when and where do I send the video ?

I need help.

66,pmm7tz,1631421613,Blind Date Turned Four-Way,"I (24m) was set up by my best friend (24m) and his fiancé (22f) with one of their friends (22f). The plan was to go on a local vacation as the four of us to see if I and their other friends were a good match.

It became clear pretty quickly that we weren't. Nonetheless, we hooked up as we both acknowledged things were slow right now with the pandemic.

What followed was something that came totally out of left field for me. All three of them proposed a four-way to me, and it happened twice on the vacation. I was definitely unsure about it but went along as I wasn't totally opposed since this is what the three of them wanted.

Now that the vacation is over and it's not likely I'll see their friend again, my best friend and his fiancé are proposing to carry forward with three ways (sometimes they may do it with this other friend, other times they may want to do it with me). 

I have no idea what to do. Any suggestions? What started out as a blind date has turned into a strange invitation to take my friendship with my best friend and his fiancé to the next level.

Since then I've only ever met people who just wanted to have sex with me. And I was okay with that for the most part. But at some point this year I got bored with that. I wanted someone to turn to emotionally and not just physically. 

So now I find a girl who wants to know about my day, wants to talk about deeper concepts, wants to play Pokemon with me, is okay with my unconvential masculinity, and wants to grow a connection and I don't know what to do. I'm freaking the fuck out. This is what I've wanted for so long and I'm doubting myself. I've felt worthless and nothing more than good dick for so long I forgot what building an emotional connection feels like. 

My therapist is recommending another therapist that specializes in CBT for this case because while she feels I really should pursue this, I need to break my cycle of self destructive thoughts that manifest into negative actions. 

I guess I'm just ranting at this point because I feel like I'm not deserving of this but I know I should feel like I do.

They broke up not long ago and I was able to actually hang with her more. Few days later she hits me up and asks if I wanna fuck… oh his mind blown I was. She wanted to meet up that same day because of conflicting schedules any other day. We head to a park and decide to do it in her car, or at least tried to. Things went smoothly at first then when it came to the actual “insertion” part I couldn’t go all the way in. Idk if they call it vaginismus or whatever but I literally couldn’t go all in. It was hard even fingering her. Long story short her brother conveniently called right during the session and needed her home ASAP so we ended our session.

I hit her up on snap to ask if she wanted to hang this weekend to try to finish where we left off only to be met with no response or even opening of the message… this was 2 days ago. Keep in mind this is someone that was usually texted me every day, her initiating most of it. Didn’t think much of it I thought maybe she was just busy.

Talked on okcupid for a couple weeks, went super well. Got her number and we talked 40+ hours over a period of 6 days. She kept making assumptions about my religious makeup. Was telling me she could see herself falling for me. It was the best. I said the same.. it was so intense. She finally bails because of religion even though I keep trying to tell her I've been a Christian forever. 

Anyhow, I message her every now and then after that. We talked one more time a month later then are ghosts me in the middle of a conversation about jazz. I message her every so often and in Feb 2021 she replies. We meet in person. We start dating. We say I love you. It's the most intense and magical relationship I've had in 42 years of life on the planet. The religious assumptions continue. She can't be with me. Then she can. It's back and forth nonstop and always something she will randomly bring up. I never understand why. We talk of our future. Marriage. Kids. She says I have 12 months to decide to propose or lose out. I'm so much into her. She starts staying over then starts staying over 4 to 5 nights in a row, a couple times working from my place. We never want to part. 

Stuff happens. I don't see her for a week. She shows up one day at my door. It's only been a week but it feels like a year. I hold her. I kiss her face. She is back and forth nonstop. She can't be with someone who isn't religious enough. She simply won't believe me. 

Finally out of the blue, one day she's SO clingy, I miss you, I love you, why am I so attached to you? she asks me. She is smitten. I am too. 2 days later suddenly, ""I'm just done. This isn't for me."" She flees. Haven't talked to her since. Basically. 4 months and I still think about her every day. Every night I go to bed shes on my mind. I'd give anything to see her. To hear her voice. I'm dying inside over it. I want no one else. My heart just wants back the love we had.She won't talk to me at all. It's kinda soul destroying to be honest. It's like she died.

There are two girls that I really like, both equally. Girl 1 and I have a very strong connection. We know each other's deepest darkest secrets, and our personalities match perfectly. We have similar interests, and I think dating her would be a really good idea. The issue is that Girl 1 has an ex that she broke up with a month and a half ago, but she liked me during the relationship. She also tries to manipulate me into falling in love with her, but I'm not sure if that's a good or bad thing. The reason I say that is because if someone cares about me enough to manipulate me, that's honestly kind of flattering. 

Girl 2 I admire so darn much. She's the nicest person alive and she doesn't have an ex. She has this nerdy vibe to her that I see in myself every single day. I talk to her every day, and she doesn't try to manipulate me into falling in love with her. She doesn't play as many games as girl 1 does. She goes out of her way to do nice things for me sometimes and I'm very grateful to have her. 

Girl 1 is very popular, and a lot of guys want her. Girl 2 is not as popular, and she doesn't have guys crawling over her. 

I need some serious help, since if I don't pick, I'm likely to lose both, and I know for a fact that I'm going to lose one of them if I do pick.

72,pmmkiw,1631423272,Was it unreasonable of me to not consider these suggestions viable date options?,"This guy who I went out with a couple of times years ago messaged me on IG to reconnect. After exchanging a few messages, he suggested we “hangout” sometime soon. I’m not looking to make new friendships, so I clarified whether or not he was asking me out on a date. He said “yes” so given his response I assumed we were on the same page. Long story short, he suggested we go to WENDYS for our date. When I didn’t reply for a few hours he took his first suggestion back and claimed that it was a “joke.” His second suggestion was an evening drive and once again from my perspective, a drive is not a date. My rationale, on dates, I want to make a good first impression: which involves doing my hair, and makeup; picking an outfit, coordinating my accessories and shoes; organizing my day in order to accommodate these things and the date itself. In my opinion, those activities require minimal to no effort from his end - like he wouldn’t even have to leave his car? It’s not about money but rather the lack of thought and effort behind his suggestions. I want to go on a date with someone who is excited to be there, at least excited enough to put some thought into plans. 

I offered to FT or talk on the phone first as a vibe check beforehand thinking if there was a connection, we could plan an actual date activity.

We met through the same sport - from the beginning he was into coaching me and helping me achieve my goals as he was more experienced. Currently we’re talking long distance so meeting is not possible nor can he take “advantage” of me right now.

This guy is really respectful, good character (not just a nice personality) which is hard to find in guys close to my age. I’ve tried dating up to 26 but I guess they just didn’t click. 

(Also, honestly, it’s relieving to talk about deeper topics like adults without sexual innuendos in every other sentence...)

**I’m just bit worried about his past and the age gap**. He has had some traumatic experiences in the past that I have no experience of - because of those I’m not sure is there something I don’t know or something I should know? That’s holding me back a little. Also he has a 6yo child from previous marriage which seems foreign to me (?)

Also I haven’t dated older men much. I guess there’s the risk of getting easily manipulated although he seems like a good person and has always respected women by his own words.

I’m really attracted to the fact that he’s affluent and affectionate in a good way, and isn’t scared to back his words with actions, like getting me gifts and treating me every now and then. 

I know I’m young but I honestly don’t want to mess around &amp; he ticks a lot of boxes.

1) can provide 
2) seems mature (now)
3) backs up his words with actions
4) treats me well

Now I’m working on myself and am thinking of her. I miss her. Guess what I want to say is make sure you are good because a great thing will show up and you will want to be good enough to hold onto it. 

I actually can say that I fucked up and am happy for her now. I just want her to be happy and realize that I was in no position to be dating anyone. That Fuckin sucks to realize.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pmo7h2/i_fucked_up/

We talked for a while and as we talked more, I started realising she seemed really happy whenever we talked . Long story short, I ended up telling her I liked her and she said she liked me too a lot.

I however haven't asked her to be my gf because I have one reservation; whenever we talk/hangout, it's ALWAYS me reaching out or planning things. She never texts or calls first, and sometimes I feel if I don't text her first, we could go for days maybe weeks without talking. Sometimes when a girl texts you first it gives confirmation that she likes you too and wants to talk as well. We have a great connection and I can sense whenever we talk that she likes me, why doesn't she ever reach out?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pmol7g/girl_admits_she_likes_me_but_she_never_texts_or/

92,pmoyi9,1631435326,Am I being manipulated?,"Got into an argument with my partner over road rage. Some guy was tailgating us bad and once they passed she flipped them off and drove fast. I told her to stop doing that because it scares me incase they have a weapon. I assumed she was mad at me when she yelled back “that guy almost hit us and he endangered us!” 
So I just stayed silent. When we got to our destination she acted like she normally does, flirty and funny with me. I was still quiet. I assumed she was mad at me? 
When we left the store she sighed and asked what was wrong? I told her I was quiet because I assumed she was upset with me. Then we argued with her saying “just because I raise my voice at someone driving doesn’t mean I’m doing it to you or mad at you.” 
Wtf? 
She also told me “I’m not like your mom.” 
(My mom use to get angry with me and scare me). 
She told me to ask her directly next time if she was mad at me, and that she would’ve apologized and said no she wasn’t or be honest if she were. 

Is she manipulating me? I feel like I can never win and that I’m always misunderstood. 
I was quiet because she was upset over the shitty ass driver. Yes, I should’ve expressed my feelings right then, but I am working on it. 

Any thoughts?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pmoyi9/am_i_being_manipulated/
93,pmp2mu,1631435941,Dating is a waste of time.,"1. When you spend time on dating multiple people with hope it will turn into something - it's a waste of time. You can't make anyone fall for you, no matter how hard you try.
2. If you date on popular apps - you chances are low. You can look at someone's pics and feel attracted but in reality there will be no right chemistry. If you still try to ""make it work"" because they physical appearance is attractive, you will end up bitter after multiple ghostings, breakcrumbings and other fancy words to describe the situation when two people don't match.
3. Each one of us have that one person in mind. Our hearts, our bodies - they know who that is. Follow it. 
4. When you go on dates with hope that in the meanwhile you meet someone right - you waste yours and the other person's time. None deserves that. 
5. When you casually hook up without telling the other person that it's just to kill the time until you meet someone right - it's cruel. Nothing justifies this. 

When you meet the right person, you will naturally know. Follow your heart in this, it does not make mistakes. When you have initial feeling that something is ""off"" - listen to that, it probably is.

There are a lot of people stuck in unhappy relationships right now, don't be one of them. Don't waste your time on casual dating.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pmp2mu/dating_is_a_waste_of_time/
94,pmpc7n,1631437345,I’m so tired of this and I need advice.,"So this guy (m 21) and I (m 25) were friends for awhile and feelings started to blossom between us. We both had gone through recent breakups and were working on healing. Neither of us expected the feelings to grow, and they did. So we started talking about our future together, asking each other important relationship questions. We would talk to each other every chance we got. He was extremely loving and romantic with me, attentive. He was always asking me how my day was, if there was anything he could do to help, etc. This went on for about a month. 

One night he said he ran into a friend and they decided to see a movie. Something felt off but I ignored it. Three hours later he comes back saying they didn’t see a movie and they were sold out. ( ?? ) so he said he needs to think about stuff and go to bed. I asked if I should worry and he said he can’t answer that. (Uh?) So I left it at that and I went to sleep. The next morning he breaks up with me saying because of his depression issues he’s not emotionally reliable right now, and that maybe we could try again once things calm down for him, and we could be good friends.

Well we were trying that for awhile. It was painful af but I was doing it. Then a bit later he’d initiate sexual convos and I was confused thinking he wanted me back. I loved him so we ended up sexting a few times. He hinted at wanting a picture once but I’d always been shy. So I finally ask him once if he’d want one and he said “you need to remember we’re not dating.” (???) like no shit but dude you’re the one being fine with being sexual? And things felt off like he’d start to get really hot and cold with me. Sometimes he’d be so distant and give me one word answers, yet others he’d be initiating and sending me memes and talking so I was so very confused and hurt. Every time I’d feel something off, I’d ask him and he always reassured me I was fine. Yet during times when I would be spending time with a friend who happened to be male, he’d suddenly either start messaging me or want to show up. It happened a few times. 

So one night I find out from our mutual friend that he shared vulnerable messages I wrote to him and described me as “trying to date him” and that I wasn’t ready for a relationship emotionally ((?)) , he also told the friend we weren’t doing anything sexual which pissed me off because he broke my trust and lied to him and lied to me that things were fine. I also found out he was “kind of back together” with his ex, which he never told me. So I confronted him, he cried and said my message to him made him feel like he’d rather die, and that he’d do anything to keep me around as a friend. He said his feelings for me were genuine, and that his “ex” only started talking to him again that week. He said him and his ex “aren’t really going on, they’re just complicated” so I questioned that because he told me, that relationships weren’t on his mind at all because of his issues, and he said “I’m not in a safe place right now, so I can’t really commit to anything.” I’m having such a hard time trusting him, that it even feels like this is a lie. 

So he promised me he wouldn’t ever be dishonest with me again. So tonight I was trying to strike up casual convo, and he hits me with me “get some sleep”. At 1am, on a Saturday. I’m like if that’s you trying to tell me not to bother you, say so. He’s like you need sleep. (??)) So here we are. I really don’t understand this hot and cold dynamic and I’m hurt, tired, confused and sad.  

Tl;dr - Guy I had a thing with who is currently a friend is giving me a lot of hot and cold signals, he’s lied to me I confronted him, he cried and begged for me back. He’s initiated things sexually with me since breaking up despite talking to his ex again that he didn’t tell me about, yet claims he “can’t commit right now.”",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pmpc7n/im_so_tired_of_this_and_i_need_advice/

98,pmpiw8,1631438353,Dating in your mid 20's is a waste of time,"Hello folks

First of all, I must say that I am **NOT** a native speaker, so there could be many mistakes in my post. I apologize for that and hope you get my point :) 

I am 25 years old (male) and I am currently doing my Master's degree. I live in Germany, but I have moved plenty of times from one city to another one (due to my parents jobs). Till 2016, I never stayed more than 5 years in one city and I always had to find new friends and adapt to the new school etc. Finding a girlfriend on top of that was just not feasible for me. In 2016, I started my Bachelor's degree and this was the time, where I actually started looking for a girlfriend.

My main problem is the fact, that EVERY girl I know (through college, friends or at work) has a boyfriend. I am not joking around guys, it's the truth. My college degree program does not have many girls but at least 30 % of them are female. My Bachelor’s degree program was a bit complicated because you have to chose a specialization after the first semester. The one I chose was the least „popular“ one and there were only 40 persons in total and only 15 girls or so. Literally none of those 15 girls (at least the one's I considered attractive) were Single. I never asked them personally, but we follow each other on Social Media Apps or some of my friends were also their friends and knew their boyfriends personally etc. 

I seriously thought, that I would find my girlfriend in college, but that wasn't the case. I also had some project studies with several girls from college, where I had to work for more than 3 months with them (and get to know them better), but they were either not my type OR they already had a boyfriend. Even though I normally instantly lose interest, if they already have a boyfriend, I always tried to be friends with them and maybe get to know some of their female friends, but I quickly realized, that those college girls just ""need"" you for help e.g. giving them old exams or helping them during exam periods. Some of those college girls were totally isolated and had no friends at all. 

In my opinion most of those college girls wanted to ""exploit"" me because I am a rather chill and open-minded person, who likes to share stuff regarding college. In the end, I deleted their numbers and realized that they weren't interested in friendship. Now you might call me a ""bad person"" for not constantly helping them, but it just doesn't make ANY sense to me, to help them if they don't even want to be friends with me and only text me, if they need some college stuff. I am not their personal baby-sitter, who makes sure that they get their college degree and to be honest, no one helped me during my whole Bachelor's degree.

That's the college part. Now I don't have many people I could consider to be my „real friends"". Sure, I have some guys who are friendly and who were my college mates and we hang out during lectures, but I never had a real friend who would go out with me on a regular basis e.g. go to a club every weekend. I have three guys who are 3 years older than me (also Single, but they literally don't care at all) and who rarely go out with me (have a drink and so on), but that's it. I sometimes go to house parties, but it's always the same. There are ALWAYS the same girls (who are already taken) and guys and it's just a waste of time. I will not be able to meet new people or find a girlfriend through my ""friends"". I must admit, that I was never so lonely before and NEVER had problems finding friends. I was quite ""popular"" in my hometown (were I graduated from high school) and I wouldn't be single there. Life there regarding girls was so much easier, even though the city is way smaller than the current one.  

Besides college and my ""circle of friends"", I really had high hopes to find a girl at work. I started to work as a working student in a big company, but the only girl in my department is not single and isn't my type either. 

I was so desperate that I started using Online Dating Apps, such as Tinder, Bumble, Badoo or Jodel (Jodel isn't a real dating app, but you can meet new people there). I dated 18 different girls, some of them more than once, but most of the time, they weren't looking for a serious relationship, wanted ""fun“, were only looking for friends or they were just not my type (thanks to Filters everybody can look like a different person nowadays). In the end, I deleted all dating apps and I will never use them again. It’s just a waste of time for a guy because you have to compete with many, many guys and sometimes you get ghosted as well.  Nevertheless, I could gather some dating experience and I have no problems talking to girls or having a conversation with them. Sure, 18 different girls are not a lot, but at least I gathered some experience.

Unfortunately, I don’t have a brother who could give me some advice or help me in some way. I only have an older sister who also struggles to find a partner. I can't go with her to a club or so because she isn't the person for that and let's be honest, using your older sister as a wingwoman is just not a good idea...

I am not constantly looking for a girlfriend and I wouldn’t consider myself as „frustrated“ (at least no one would ever know my feelings if they get to know me in person). I am a very open minded, rather lighthearted person who likes to hang put with people, but the last two years were exhausting for me. Dating gets way more difficult if you get older because most of the girls tend to have a boyfriend if they get older. It’s simple math in my opinion. I wouldn’t mind if my girlfriend is 3-4 years younger than me, but I never meet girls who are in that age range.  

My problem still remains and I don't know what to do. I have never approached a girl in real life because I always think that they are not single and in my mind it's a waste of time. This is especially true for attractive girls because I always think, that they MUST have a boyfriend, if rather unattractive girls also manage to have a boyfriend. I am really afraid, that I will not be able to find a partner and I don’t want to be Single in my early 30’s. I really take care of my appearance because I know, that most girls want an attractive partner. I always wear nice clothes, my hair is always in shape and I work out. 

Is here anyone else in the same situation and has already found a solution?
