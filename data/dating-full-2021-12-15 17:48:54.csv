Recently my female friend gave me some dating advice. She told me to be more aggressive, go to more clubs and bars, and be more confident. But she also said mentioned that I have to stop being friendly and nice cause that puts me in the friend zone. I have to be cockier, play hard to get, and get some abs because ladies like excitement and fuck boys. 

I definitely agree with putting myself out there and being more confident. There is some truth in her advice but I don't really agree with the transforming to a fuck boy. 

I find this advice a little strange cuz when she was younger that's always used the date fuck boys but now the person that she's dating now is actually quite the opposite. He's very introverted, they were actually friends at first, he doesn't really go out much and doesn't go to the gym. She's actually very happy with her relationship and it's the longest relationship she's been in.

My question why is she telling me to be the person that she dating as a younger (20's) person but she's currently (32) in a relationship and a happy one with a person who is more introverted and shy? 

I would think that she advised me to actually just be myself and not be a cocky shallow guy?

We've been dating since September, and we just made things official official in early November. We met online, and after days of talking and long paragraphs, we met up for a first date and after the date was over, I was fine with not going out again--he talked my ear off and didn't ask me any questions. But he persisted and asked me out again, so I decided to give it a chance. 

He asked me to be his girlfriend in October after 3 or 4 dates (but didn't kiss me or hold my hand or anything until like the 5th date). Deep down I thought he was moving too fast, but I went along with it...I told him I want to be his girlfriend but I wasn't 100% sure yet. Hence why we weren't official until November. I felt he was moving too fast when he told his entire family, and extended family, about us, and he told all of his coworkers, and pressured me into making this official on social media, and even mentioning marriage several times. But it was just an uneasy feeling that I didn't know how to articulate to him. Thing is, if it was the right guy, I think I would love that he did all of those things so quickly. 

He's a really great guy. He is a hard worker, he's a family man, he is really sweet to me---he sends me these massive paragraphs about how much he likes me and how he's never felt like this, even in his previous 3-5 year LTRs, and how happy I make him and how I gave him hope and made him look forward to his future again. He compliments me all the time and makes me feel pretty and acts like I'm just the most beautiful thing he's ever seen. Always talking about how taking to me is the highlight of his day and seeing me is the highlight of his week.  He has been consistent and straightforward with his feelings the whole time. 

It's just that we have nothing---nothing---in common. We don't like the same music, we dont have the same hobbies or interests, I'm a homebody and he's not---which is all workable, but There are also some major core values we dont line up on, but I feel like he's tell me we have the same values because he thinks that what I want to hear, which is concerning. It also concerns me that he was physically aggressive towards his stepmother a few years ago. I also feel there are bug chunks of his life that he won't tell me about and he is always referring to this ""past"" that he won't go into detail about, although I've expressed that I need to know about his past. I feel like, though we only have a 7 year age gap, he has lived a LOT of life, and we aren't in the same league in that aspect. I'm in college and living with my parents, and he is in his 30s, has had 3, 4, 5 year relationships, he has lived in different cities and states, etc. My parents also don't like him at all. 

I think I need to break it off. It's hard struggling with the feeling of regret--he's such a sweet guy and he just likes me so much. What if I don't find that again? Or what if it takes years? It's so selfish of me, but I don't want to be alone again. He has no idea I'm feeling this way and he is still on cloud 9 and literally hinting towards planning an engagement in a year. I like him a lot, but I don't think he's the one and I don't want to wait longer and hurt him more. 

I think I could be happy with him for a while, but I think I could be happier with someone else.

Im not sure what the flair to put so sorry if its not the correct one, just looking to vent/talk it out.

Dating past: Been single for about 3 years. My ex and I broke up because her and a buddy of mine went behind my back and started talking, going on dates etc. Dumped me for him and then I guess he had a change of heart so she lost both of us. After the break up I tried going out with 2 other girls in the 3 year span. The first girl I was talking to ended it because I was ""lame and boring"". Okay I get it our personality and interests don't match that's fine. 2nd girl I was talking to I matched with on bumble, talked for about a month then found out she had a boyfriend the entire time. Couple rejections here and there afterwords.

Now: I asked out a coworker who is the same age as me so figured why not. She said yes and so we went on a date last week. I personally thought it went really well. We went out for some coffee and food for roughly 3 hours shooting the shit, laughing, coming to realization that we have alot in common (wierdly alot) and so I asked her for a second date on sunday for this coming thurday and never got a text back. This for some reason put me into a dark place mentally especially yesterday just because I got my hopes up and was all excited because she is absolutely stunning with a great heart and well put together in my opinion. I thought things were going well, our texts she seemed interested, engaged in our conversation very well, bit of flirting. But now no text back when I asked for a 2nd date.

The longest run I’ve had was 4 months. And that was the one girl I fell in love with

It is honestly just because I really don’t fall in love easily, really nothing more than that. I end things quickly because I think that if I feel I’m not going to fall in love with someone, it would be unfair to them to keep things going. My logic here is to try and end it before it gets to serious because then the hurt is bigger. 

I did this 3 times, with girls who were great and I genuinely thought it could work out. But it didn’t. I wouldn’t do anything with a girl unless I think there is a possibility of something serious 

I have been in love only 1 time in my life and got dumped after a couple months, which hurt me really bad. It’s 7 years ago and I still think about it sometimes. How ironic that I did the same now a couple of times. 

Girls I talk to always find this super weird, and keep asking me why. I tell them that I don’t fall in love easily and they always think that there is something more going on and I don’t open up much. Which sucks. 

Girls, do you care about this? How big of a red flag is not having had a serious relationship yet? Or am I just being too picky? But you don’t choose who you fall in love with so how can I be picky if I don’t even pick? I know you can’t force yourself to be in love

I wrote this because I’m lonely and feel like I’m incapable of loving someone and I’m starting to think that I’ll never love someone again and be alone for the rest of my life.

Trying to pick up the pieces and move on. But due to the c\*vid crisis, It's near impossible to meet someone since everyone tends to do social distancing.

Is social media the way to go? Instagram in particular? I wanna try something new, so I started showing some activity on there as well. Stories, pictures, stuff about the places I visited, a new picture of me here or there, or a meme. I do this so that everyone that is interested could take a look and see that what type of person I am, which is I guess better than just having 3 pictures and nothing else.

I also started adding a lot of girls. Now, I really want to meet someone, but most of these girls don't really know me in real life, so it's really hard to engage in conversation. I understand perfectly that it is a bit awkward to engage with someone's stories with a cold approach like that, but I'm always 100% friendly and respectful, engaging with a positive and organic comment. I've set myself up with a rule, if I comment 5 times during the span of 1-2 months (a story per week or two weeks, for stories that I find interesting, not every single one) I will take this a negative answer and stop trying to strike up a conversation. 

Do you guys have any advice about this? It seems very bleak and futile at times, and I'm starting to consider it a chore, instead of enjoying it. Maybe I should like a couple of pictures as they get posted, before I go in full on comments on stories?

We talked for like 2-3 days before I asked her on a simple coffee date. She was really slow at texting and pretty dry, but i figured meeting face to face would open her up some more. The date went okay we were there for like 90 min, she laughed at my jokes and I got to know her a little better, and she even agreed to a second date. She gave off some signs of being insecure and that she considered her self a boring person at times. She doesn't have many friends and is a teacher. So I chalked it up to her being a shy and busy person. 


She didn't text me after the date, so I shot her a ""Had a great time"" message later that night, and she responded with she had a good time too. I padded out some details about our second date, as well. After conversation I decided that I wouldn't text her first so waited about 2 days to see if she would hit me up first. I noticed on the news that bad weather would spoil our hiking date so I hit her up about it, and offered to reschedule to a different date and asked for alternatives to see if she wanted to do something else. She said she was still down to meet up, but didn't offer an alternative. So I put out the idea that we could go to a really trendy museum instead. She liked the idea and agreed to meet with me at certain time on friday and I put out there that I'm down to pick her up if she wanted since downtown parking is terrible. She said she would let me know.

Been about 5 months since my(m24) last relationship(over protective parents who had an issue with my race, age, nationality and culture). Really great girl but I had to call it off, lot of mental stress on her. Anyway I decided to use my new found time to work on myself. Fast forward to present day, (Everyday) I’m up at 3, at a boxing gym by 4, work(full time) by 6, bodybuilding gym by 4:30, basketball practice by 7, home by 8:30. I then eat, study( full time student), and sleep. I really take the “sacrifice your twenties” idea seriously. On my off days(2 weekly), I do data analyst work for my university. Always day I don’t have time for a relationship. 

Two days ago, a very polite young lady couldn’t stop complimenting me at my work before I could even introduce myself she complimented my hair, glasses and physique. She even raved about my piercings(she has a golden hoop nose ring on her left nostril and I have two in mine. I made sure she and her guests(I’m a waiter) were well taken care of and she and I kept making jokes. She asked for my number but I was so busy it slipped my mind. About 15 min later, she said to me “please give me your number before you disappear again”. So I did and saved the contact icon as a selfie of her and I. We don’t text often(holiday time is busy in our industry) but I suggested we grab drinks today. She said she couldn’t make it but in the same message, asked if I’m free in two days. I’m taking her out on Friday.

I liked her as I got to know her so I decided to give it a shot and ask her out.

I respected her words of course and just carried on with my life as if nothing happened.

As of late, she has been very flirty with me. She would just get really close to me when we're talking, touch me when she gets the chance (not inappropriately) and even one of our colleagues jokingly asks us to stop flirting every time he sees us.

Now before you tell me that ""I shouldn't shit where I eat"", this is just a part-time thing for me along with my studies and we don't have a no dating colleagues policy.

I feel like I'm getting played. As she gets closer, I carry on liking her even more. I don't know what to do really.

It all started in sophomore year of high school, she was the new kid in school and barely knew anyone. We never talked to each other, but we did have a class together. The reason why we started talking is she became friends with another girl I was friends with. The three of us went out for a small birthday celebration, that’s when we started talking more. 

Nothing really changed between us until halfway through senior year of high school. 

I came back to my school after leaving for that semester to take college courses and online high school classes. She was excited I came back, including a lot of other her and my friends. I got back on the school tennis team and started practicing again with my old teammates that didn’t graduate last year. I jokingly asked her to join the team and she said she would join with me. At the time, nothing really seemed special between me and her so I never really thought of us being in a “relationship.” When she joined and we started hanging out more, I started to like her more. We would always practice tennis outside of school every week and just have fun. After awhile, we started going to activities together and going to restaurants. 

This is where the story takes a turn.

After graduation, we had a lot of free time. Every week I went to her house and watched her favorite movies and shows. The first couple weeks were just me and her sitting there watching the tv and us talking. After a while, she started laying on me and touching me; which caught me off guard. Probably a month in, she was literally on me and and rapping her arms around my body. At one point, she literally grabbed my hand and put it on her ass. That night of the ass touching, we both went outside so she could say bye to me when I was leaving, and we did a 30-60 second tight hug, which was kinda awkward since I’m quite a bit taller than her. She also brought me around her family and her mom and dad loved me. Her dog also LOVED me, it was hilarious. She’s also in pageants and won the city last year and she was competing for state queen. I promised that I would go but something came up and it made it where I couldn’t see her preform. So I got her a small gift for what she did, and it was a cameo of one of her favorite actress’s congratulating her on what she did. When she saw it, she almost cried. 

After the gift, was when I gained up the courage to tell her my feelings. She did say that she cared also but since we were going to colleges that are pretty far apart from each other. Which I understood, I was in a long distance relationship at one point and it fell apart. So do you guys think I still have a chance or was she playing me in some small way? The thing that stings about it if she was playing me is that she seemed like the one. Whenever I tried to talk to other girls after her, I would grow disinterested with any other girl because they weren’t her. She was the perfect girl I was looking for; funny, smart; likes to play video games, same religious standpoint, and same political views. I know this is surface level but she is beautiful and she would always complain about her “assets” but I thought her body was perfect the way it was. I’m not a fan of girls having big “assets.” 

Some other stuff that happened that I don’t want to somehow cram into the story

- when we were playing video games together, she started talking about baby names and which ones I liked. Then she followed up the names she liked with my last name. 
- after the whole situation, her mom followed me on Instagram. 
- she out of the blue started checking up on me when I went off to college",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1137767,public,self,Should I(m18) try to keep in touch with her(f18) or is being quiet for months going to tarnish our friendship as a whole?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rh9gmn/should_im18_try_to_keep_in_touch_with_herf18_or/,no_ads,0,,,,,

It's indifferent, but at the same time there's hope. However I don't think people at any place would be interested and I just kept myself on my own and not really approach women, no matter how much my lustful side is beyond broken and out of control.

Thanks for clicking and I hope this read serves you well! I will say that I am a Counselor by trade but I have always had a fascination with love and relationships so my advice here comes from both my personal and professional experience. I want everyone to find their person that brings out the best version of you and that you can grow old with. It sounds great yet seems so unattainable for many people. These 4 things I am going to say you should also look for in yourself. It can be hard to give an unbias opinion of ourselves but give it a try and see if you see these 4 things in yourself. REMEMBER-You can't expect from a partner something that you also lack.

\#1- Impulse Control

This is the number one thing to look for because it is what I believe to be the basis of most conflict in relationships. People that react on impulse, rather than thinking and then acting, are bound to cause problems. Impulse control problems are the route of most couple conflict that I have seen. The best thing you can look out for is the predictability of a partner's response to any given situation. Basically, do you have an idea of how your partner is going to react when you give them bad news or when they are faced with aversive stimuli? If the answer is yes, and you don't like their response or feel it is inappropriate then there are only two options in this situation. Have a conversation with your partner and let them know how you feel about their behavior and create a plan together to work on it. It is this or break up. In every relationship I have ever seen or heard of, if one partner does not see a need to change when there clearly is one or does not put in the effort to change despite seeing it, then things never work out. The problem forever persists because nothing gets resolved without putting in the work to resolve it. 

If you have bad news to tell a partner but you are afraid to do so. Write down how you think your partner is going to react. Then tell your partner the news. If they reacted how you expected then show them what you had written and see how they respond. Are they defensive? Do they get angry? Are they concerned or apologetic? Whatever it may be, let them know that it's not okay and you expect change and not just an apology. No one should have to put up with such poor behavior. Let them know that you can work on it together and if need be maybe therapy can help as well. If they are not willing to or you see no effort from them to change then all you can do is leave. That's it unfortunately:/

\#2- Responsibility

Controlling oneself is very important but everyone from time to time might have an off day. Maybe you say something that is uncalled for or do something you regret. It happens, but all anyone can do is take responsibility for what they said or did. A person without a sense of responsibility is bad news for any relationship. Do you or your partner always pass the blame or go on the defensive? Neither will resolve anything and usually what happens is that people ~~forgive and~~ forget. This is a common cyclical pattern of behavior in relationships where something negative happens, there is an argument, some stewing in anger and hurt feelings, and then some time goes by and eventually both move on. Nothing was done to actually resolve the conflict and create changes that will prevent similar future conflicts. If you notice this about yourself or your partner but don't know how to fix it then I suggest going to counseling. Either individual or couples. They both can help. 

Find someone that takes responsibility for themselves and can listen to you when you call them out. They might want to tell you their side and you should listen but if what they say does not justify sufficiently what had occurred then don't back down. If you forgive or forget too easily then it will lead to resentment somewhere along the way.

\#3- Follow through

Don't you hate it when you have plans with a friend and they cancel last minute? If that friend does it to you multiple times then you likely won't continue being friends with them. What about if a partner does it to you? I find that people often give their significant others a lot more chances than they give their friends. Logically, it doesn't make sense because a friendship and a relationship are very similar. I always say the foundation of every relationship is a friendship. If you won't put up with this behavior with your friends then you shouldn't with your partner either. That goes for any behavior as well. You have to expect follow-through from your partner on a consistent basis. This is partly how trust is built because your partners behavior becomes predictable and predictability is comfortability in relationships.

Follow through can be more than just making and keeping plans. It is anything that someone says they are going to do. My dad and I have this problem. We always procrastinate and put things off and that can be kind of irritating to a partner. It's important to ask yourself how important is follow-through to you. We all have different thresholds and my mother for example has plenty of tolerance for it because my dad has so many other great qualities. I do my best to be cognizant of my partner and what follow-through she needs from me. I am not the best at it but she sees that I try and that is enough for her. You can't let this one build up inside of you and if your partner can't take some responsibility on changing their lack of follow-through then they probably are not the one for you as well.

\#4- How they treat others

How does your SO treat you? How do they treat their family, friends, co-workers, etc.? A good rule of thumb is that a person is only as kind as the way they treat a stranger. It doesn't matter if your partner treats you well. If they don't treat others well then eventually you will also be treated poorly. Are they rude to servers or do they seem to be involved in a lot of workplace drama? Usually people that are unkind to others either don't realize it or they rationalize it by blaming everyone else. Nobody wants to depict themselves as the villain so they make others into the villain.

I see a lot of people feed into this aspect of a person way too much. People try to be the healer, protector, savior, etc. Whatever it is called it is all the same. I have clients that come to therapy because they want someone to call them out on their stuff because nobody else will. Kindness isn't always about being kind. The motives behind one's kindness tend to not even be something we question with a partner but you should at least until trust is built. Often people want to be ""the savior"" because that is how they will earn a person's love. If your partner is always the victim and you are always there to protect or save them then they will never grow as an individual. True kindness in a relationship is wanting the best for our partner and behaving as such. No one is perfect but noticing victim patterns or savior patterns in ourselves or our partners is a good start at recognizing there is something dysfunctional.

Closing thoughts:

No relationship is perfect and partners may have a lot of good qualities that out weigh the bad ones. The things I listed are just foundational behaviors that create most issues I see but are often the hardest to resolve because they get overlooked or there is no effort being put to change them. My personal approach has been to look for someone that has these 4 things first; good impulse control, takes responsibility, has good follow-through, and treats others well. This is the foundation I think everyone needs in order to be as successful as possible in all relationships they make. 

Personally, I have been in two relationships. One lasted 6 years and the other is new as of this year. I think Reddit can keep my secret but I plan on marrying my girlfriend and I already got the ring! My first relationship ended because we were not the right fit and we wanted different things in life. It lasted longer than it should have because these 4 things we had covered and for the longest time is seemed stupid to just give that up. I think that shows that there is more that matters than just these 4 things but the foundation it creates when you and your partner both have them is very strong.

That being said im really getting tired of hearing that I need to lower my standards or date inside my league ( when I don't even know what my ""league"" is! ) now my standards are realistic and reasonable and I know what I want in a partner. Now me personally I've never been in a relationship before or had my first kiss nothing really. Not really interested in dating apps because I don't live on my own and they give me terrible anxiety I downloaded tinder once and it just made me extremely uncomfortable.

I'm the type of person if I where to go on a date with someone I'd have to be friends first with them and get to know them on a little bit on a more personal level before going on a the date anyway. 
I mean I could be demisexual? but I don't think you can be two sexualities at once I could be wrong about that but I am bisexual so I don't know really.

Anyways I always get asked what I would ""rate my looks"" now look I don't think everyone is going to find me attractive and that's perfectly fine but I've had men my whole life make me feel bad because of the way I looked or the way I dressed I did suffer a lot of bullying in school pretty much my whole life and last time resulted in a guy stealing my book back to make a ""point"" which i don't what he was trying to make.

I've also had guys who were interested in me but they only wanted one thing from me and I just didn't want to do that right now since I'm waiting till marriage ( because of trauma as a child that i faced ) 

And I run into the problem when i do meet people I'm interested in they never reciprocate or they are emotionally unavailable or they aren't looking for a relationship and the last date I went on was two years ago and that was my first date and only it didn't lead to anything else further. 

Then at my age everyone and I mean everyone my siblings and my friends are getting starting their lives and having another shoulder to lean on while me I had two toxic friends ( i cut them out of my life ) and im still recovering from not having any type of reciprocated love in my life rather its friends or love which unfortunately I don't have in my life right now.

If your going to ask I do take really good care of myself mentally and physically I go to therapy and make sure my depression and anxiety are always in check, I've been told I dress really nice and am a very social butterfly. But I still suffer from the trauma of not only being bullied by guys all my life growing up, but still having a hard time with fighting that I don't know what I would look like in a relationship with someone and having someone else see me for their point of view and showing me things that I might not have known about myself like small things.

I do believe I know myself pretty well I just wish I had someone who was willing to get to know me and not completely write me off. 

I've been feeling pretty upset about my love life but it honestly comes in waves I have days where I'm fine where I'm at and days where I don't know why the heck I'm still single? 

I've been told I'm really pretty and I'm super easy to talk to and have a really loving personality but not enough to be someone's girlfriend?

I'm learning how to gain more self confident in myself which I do think I'm doing really good at especially through the help of therapy. Right now I don't have friends to hang out with because me and my best friend are on a break. 

I am getting a job very soon at the beginning of the new year I'm happy about it but I can't seem to show it. I do know my love language is physical touch which being cuddled, kissed and said I love you to"" is something I've always just craved really. 

It just can be hard sometimes because I've been told women have it ""easy"" yeah some women but not everybody I've also met really attractive people who are in the same boat as me. Then I start getting worried because I know I do want kids in the future ( not right now not fanatically stable yet and don't have a house yet lol and not married ) 

I just hope that soon I'll know what reciprocated love feels like be able to fall asleep next to my partner and have another support system have someone who adds on to my happiness ( not the only thing that makes me happy ) basically something outside my friends and family. 

But yes I'm a women who asks out men I've done it all my life some find it bold of me and confident ( because I'm just a women who knows what I want in a guy ) but for some reason I can't attract that person because of unfortunate circumstances for some reason.  I think at the end of the day it just comes down to luck... it's gonna suck when I get older ( hopefully things will be different and I'm not single I'm in a healthy relationship) I have to go to weddings and baby showers.. and go back home to a empty house/apartment ( which i couldn't live like by myself unless ya know I had a partner because I want to get my own house built one day )

Disclaimer: nothing is always absolute, and there is alwys a few exceptions.

1. Good relationship with her father

How her father treated her is most likely how she will expect to be treated or what kind of an attitude she will have towards other men. Good father daughter relationship is a prime corner stone for a good relationship with the future SO.

2. Her parents are still together

Marriage doesn't last long these days. Half of marriages end up in divorce. If she grew up in a nice and healthy family enviornment, there is a high chance she will transfer that energy into your future household, and vice versa.

3. Her mother is a high quality woman

Mother is a sign of how you can expect your SO to look and act in the future. If the mother is a good, intelligent, well read and kind type of woman, which is still looking good in her old age, you can bet your money your SO will replicate these things as well.

4. Nice personality and kindness

She is honest, she doesnt gossip and talk behind peoples back. Has a high quality group of good friends, and behaves like an overall diecent human being.

5. Limited hookups

She had none, or very little casual sex adventures. Girls with high body counts of random hookups and casual sex, are more likely to cheat on you, and create issues further in life.

6. High quality friends. You are who you chill with. If her friends are low quality girls, drug addicts, promiscuous bunch etc, chsnces are, she identifies with them, hence they hang out.

Hope this post will help you bros in finding women adequate for a future together.

Not everyone is cut out for marriage. Do yourselves a favour, skip those, and find someone worth your time.

I try to help unaware/clueless men with their dating profile issues and this question came to me. The most common issues I hear are concerning their bodies or faces, but what about their voices?

Would you date a man who couldn't pronounce the letter ""R"" strongly? What if this guy could say most words containing R fairly well, but you could definitely notice some of his R's were off? 

Would him getting help currently (speech therapy) make any difference in your opinion? 

Lots of women consider this guy handsome, and he's jacked/ripped.

(I really don't want to see too much bias here, so let's just say he is funny and charming. He's ideal in many ways, the only thing is his speech).

I'm not saying any of you will give politically correct answers, but please don't answer this question unless you genuinely feel you may/won't date a man fitting that description.

He cuddled with me all night long and showed care ( whenever I'd get up he would ask me if all is good , during the night he would kiss my back or hung me tight.. etc) however at some point he mentions that he does not want anything serious. I say that's okay although it did sting a little. A week later he says we should just be friends. I Say where is this coming from and he says it's because if we keep doing this we will get attached and one of us will be hurt. I ask him if by one of us he means me and he says no I mean either one of us. And he says , if we keep doing this I too wil get used to it and I dont want that to happen, to which I reply "" I understand and respect your decision"". after this he stopped talking as much . I Did not talk either. He texts 2 days later to ask about me and I answer briefly and respectfully. Later that day we see eachother by chance because we go take language classes at the same language center. We briefly talk. Later that night at midnight he texts me "" goodnight+ name"" which felt a little intimate( maybe I just want to believe that because in case it's obvious yet I actually quite like the guy) then we dont talk for 2 more days and today I see him by chance again at the end of class ( we are not in the same class) I was standing with a group of friends and he with another group. I looked briefly in his direction and when he did not look back I just left and went home because it seemed ridiculous to wait for him to give me his attention. But then almost immediately after I left he texts me saying "" hey I wanted to come say hello but you already left "".. we exchange a couple of messages and then right now he texts me ""goodnight, it was very nice seeing you today even from afar"" .
Now guys, I already know I should just stop overanalyzing this and move on with my life but It drives me crazy because I'm like does this guy like me or is it all in my head. 
Btw this guy told me before that he has commitment issues because he went through the worst heartbreak when he was younger and that ever since he never could get into a serious relationship. 
Also, I know for a fact that he is veeery attracted to me physically. I Just sometimes want to believe that he liked me more than just physically but I'm afraid I might just be fooling myself.

I've been dating this girl for a few dates and so far we have not gone further than make-outs. The advice people have given here to increase sexual inuendo and sexual tension has worked great in general for me with women in the past, but not as effective with this woman. For example, we had an inside joke where we made a bet and the loser would have to do a dance or like a music video routine for the other person (really just a joke and not actually going to do it). But, she happened to choose a dance and sent it to me where one where a guy strips in the middle of the video so i joked to her that she only chose the video bc she wanted me to strip for her and then i teased her that ""why even pretend u want the dance if u just want a specific ""part"" of the video?"" and then i said no pun intended. She laughed but that was it. Then she said ""OMG I didn't see the full video so didn't know that part was in it so I will choose another one"" and then i continued along a little further with the joke but she just put all these emojis like embarrassed emoji and red face emoji and irritated emoji. Another time we were out and she said she liked the texture of something because its ""nice and hard"" and so I was being light hearted and said oh i bet you do like it nice and hard, don't you? And then i laughed and her face got a bit embarrassed and then she just laughed and that was it.

How to handle this and get beyond the make-outs? I feel like some will say just let her go and she's not worth it if she is not ready to have sex but I've had plenty of hookups so I am not necessarily just after that. I think its cool to have a girl with intelligence and personality too and she has a lot of intelligence and i like her personality overall (although not when it comes to the teasing parts like these examples). I think this girl would be good to date in general but I'd like to get things moving faster. I'm going to invite her to my place next weekend for dinner and wine so I will try again but it feels like I am having trouble getting past that make-out level. Is it possible that she just prefers to take it slow? Or maybe she is kind of asexual? Or maybe likes sex but conservative in the early going? How to break through? I do think her interest level in me is otherwise good as she was fully leaning in first for the make out we had and texted me a lot with pics she took from the night of me and how good i look in them. And she also usually tells me how great of a night she had with me after we go out. One other interesting note is that she mentioned she has been cheated on by a guy in her past.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1137806,public,self,How would you handle this kind of situation with a woman?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rhdc8b/how_would_you_handle_this_kind_of_situation_with/,no_ads,0,,,,,

There's a girl I like that stares at me a lot, but never texted back.

We're both 16, she's in two of my classes. I kinda thought I had a crush on her, so I was paying attention to her a little bit. It kinda seemed like she was glancing over more than usual, like there were times when I was working alone in the hall, she'd pass by and look over her shoulder, and she'd just glance towards me a lot in class. Eye contact would occasionally happen, she would usually look away quickly.

Luckily, a seating chart in one of the classes let me move and sit close to her, and I started talking to her. We have a lot in common, we both play soccer, similar classes, that sort of thing. She's normally kinda quiet, but I could make easy conversation with her and get her to laugh. After some time, I ask for her number.

She gives it to me, and I text her immediately so she has my number. I then text her that weekend, but no response. the issue is, now I don't sit at her table anymore, so I can't just talk to her about it. I mention it to a mutual friend, and that mutual friend texted her asking if she got my text, but the mutual friend got no response either. So now I just think I misread things, but she was glancing over more than usual that week.

I do manage to catch her before lunch one day, and I ask her why she didn't respond, and she apologized and said she was at a soccer game. She also said she didn't text the friend back because she was on a plane. That doesn't really make sense why she couldn't text back later, so I was still confused. In the following week, she is staring more than ever. I didn't think she wanted to talk to me so I avoided eye contact, but I could clearly see her repeatedly glance over towards me, even if I was behind her.  So, I text her gently asking if she didn't respond because she doesn't want me to text her. Again, no response.

But since then, she's been staring excessively. She would fix her hair several times each class, something she used to not do, but we have a mask mandate still so I couldn't tell if she was smiling or anything. By excessive staring, I mean every single class, every single day. If im behind her, she'll repeatedly glance over her shoulder. If i'm to her side, she'll repeatedly glance at me, even if the teacher is on the other side of the classroom. If i'm in front of her, she'll glance over the most, sometimes she just stares for several seconds. Even if she's blocked by something, she'll lean around it to look. I did try to avoid eye contact again, I didn't want to be weird and seem obsessed, as I had already texted multiple times. But pretty much any time I looked directly at her we made eye contact, and she was the one looking first.

With all the staring, I kinda would've expected her to come talk to me, but she hasn't. I was the one to go sit at her table and ask for her number too, so I stupidly felt I shouldn't be making more moves at this point. She did seem to want to be around me though, before thanksgiving break, she stopped to leave class with a group of people I got stuck with with instead of going around, and was staring at me when we left even though she knew other people in that group. But, she went home early so I idiotically didn't talk to her then. She would start talking to me whenever I was nearby without me initiating conversation though.

&amp;#x200B;

tldr, girl I like stares at me, I text her, no response she stares more frequently. I text her again trying to figure out why she didn't respond, and she now stares A LOT more, repeatedly every class, regardless of where I am or if something is in the way.

&amp;#x200B;

 Normally, I just would've thought she was kinda weird and moved on, but she's insanely pretty, and is in the top 1% of kids academically and athletically, and she's one of the nicest people ive ever met. If I still have a chance, I very much want to at least try.

Does anyone have a clue why she is doing this? I know what I have to do, I just have to talk to her, but I don't see that being likely to happen anytime soon, finals are going on in school right now. I really only see a two options,

1. she's interested but can't text back for some reason, and is too shy make a move, possibly because I avoid eye contact
2. she's not interested and just likes the attention, even though I try not to stare at her and haven't talked to her in a couple of weeks

neither make sense.

There are a couple of things I could do,

1. I could text her again, saying something like ""I like you,  I was going to ask you out, and it seems you were looking over frequently the past few weeks, so I thought you might want to talk to me. It also kinda seems like you can't text back for some reason, so i'll be in the library before school tomorrow if you do actually want to talk to me. Otherwise, I'll just leave you alone and not bother you""
2. Or, I could text her again asking her to meet somewhere at school tomorrow, saying it seems like she was looking over a lot and I don't know if that was because she wanted to talk to me, and that way I could ask her why she didn't text back in person, and ask her out in person if it goes well.
3. I could call her, but I'm not confident she'll pick up
4. I could follow her on instagram and try dm'ing her, but I hardly use instagram so that would be kinda weird.

I don't like any of those options, but I don't have classes with her tomorrow and we get off of school starting friday, so I won't be able to talk to her. It was a huge mistake to wait so long, but I was just really confused and kinda nervous, this is my first time doing this.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1137825,public,self,Im not sure of what to do,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rheb7n/im_not_sure_of_what_to_do/,no_ads,0,,,,,

I like older men in that age range cause they're mature, they are fliratious, they are very kind and super attractive to me. Seeing a man in my criteria makes my privates throb and pulsate with excitement and i get very warm down there and wet.


My criteria: My intention is not to be mean or offend anyone this is just like my interest: 
white men in their 30s and 40s, black short hair, super nerdy, average male height not too tall or too short, not a buff body kinda muscular not too muscular, some stubble on face like shaved off beard like around their whole mouth up to the ears cheeks, dark eyes like brown or black, like a pointed nose i guess, black eyebrows. Skinny man hands. They must wear glasses like clear oval glasses or like rectangular black frame skinny glasses. Almost like a teacher appearence or a nerdy like professor. 

Older male teachers are so hawt!My panties are so wet while writing this. My panties are so damp. UGH! all you men arouse me too the moon! I have fantasizes of sleeping with them and giving smoochies thats it. I have two male crushes in anime Mr.Mikisugi from Kill La Kill and Levi slightly from Attack on Titan and from My hero academia the teacher Aizawa. Those men are kinda my type.

Masturbation- I pleasure myself before bed and watch porn and hentai. I use my index and middle finger and rub my kitty area in circles near my clit. Touching my clit directyly is very sensitive and kinda painful so i stopped doing that technique. Im afraid of fingering my hole completely so i avoid the technique. It feels really really good and a escapism technique i use. It feels good for like 30 minutes to pleasure myself but after im done climaxing i feel so empty. I feel empty cause its just like drugs its escapism. Its just temporary feeling good time. I also get very sleepy and helps me sleep after i orgasm and I have wonderful dreams of older men arousing me!

seeing a teacher or an older man that meets my criteria seeing his boner bulge is the sexiest thing ever! I stare at guys boners in the store and its just so frikin hot! Like i cant take my eyes off and im wondering how big is it down there. Older men are packin. Wet daddies. Older men are sooooo gorgeous!

Edit 1: i want a man who like meets my criteria where can i find one? Im like done university and im settled in my house",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1137834,public,nsfw,Im attracted to older men in their 30s and 40s. I have a specific criteria in the post.
