11,mexvbb,1616922136,Is this a FWB situation?,"Out of a long marriage Oct 2019.  

Dated this guy start april 2020 then officially stopped July 2020. Still kept seeing each other.  This included at least weekly ""catch ups"" and sleep overs.

Passionate to excess, very touchy, feely, cuddly, after the deed.  This had continued through to this day.  We have also gone on dates,  which have been fantastic each time.  He agrees.

I did tell him October 2020 I would be keen to see him exclusively. We both know we've both been seeing other people. He doesn't want that but we have kept seeing each other. I have a high drive and enjoy our physical relationship but also the conversations as well. 

This has continued but cooled a bit in the new year of 2021. Our weeks with our children no longer match up, no sleep overs. 

In saying this,  we have seen each other 3 times in the past week.  2 out of the 3 include outings to dinner,  bike riding etc as well as the obvious.

When we're together the sex side of things is getting better and better each time, seriously great stuff.

 The conversations and post sex cuddles etc still continue. Great conversation.  We have very aligned values and ideals. I he appeals to me on many levels.  I am not looking for a new husband. My kids are teenagers and I don't need that right now. 

He has said he doesnt want anything serious, neither do I. I am still dating,  as is he but I feel we do each have a soft spot for each other. 

Is this just elaborate FWB? Part of me thinks he could just come and do the deed and then go.  Why hang around and be so affectionate? It's confusing. I think he's a bit of a ""cuddle sl*t"". I would value other opinions. I think I just maybe need to calm down about it and enjoy it at face value.

12,meyrti,1616926606,Best apps for UK,"46F
Ok I have been off OLD intentionally for lent. (40 days is a good time to have a break). Oddly have a few in person dates set up through people in met on reddit but the pond is erm very very wide, deep and can be murky. 

So recently been pondering if I reactivate profiles I have on 3 or 4 different platforms. 
Pretty much know what I want now. Casual dating for a bigger social circle and meeting fun, lighthearted interesting people intentionally for an eventual relationship. 
Being in the UK we are still pretty locked down till mid April/May  and what I am seeing is very few people are activity dating. Unless you fancy a sh@g and being honest that's pretty easy to find even in a war zone. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

So what have you found the best apps.ü§î
1. Bumble weirdly takes away the male chase and seems biologically counterintuitive.
2. POF/OKC - eh I am tired of reading and answering questions.üò¥
3. Tinder - still seen here as an app for a ‚õ≥
4. Match/eharmony - in 2 years paying for dating seems totally not the thing people do. Found my Ex partner on Match thoü§ë
5. Facebook dating- interesting and a bit odd. Seems to be better for above 40's, Even 30's.

Anyone else?

I went through a divorce last year, and a couple months later, was feeling lonely and felt it would be nice to meet a special someone again.  I met someone on a dating app who I've been seeing since January.  She said she wanted a friend who might lead to a long term relationship.  I thought that was okay.  She seems guarded due to experiences in past relationships.  We enjoy hanging out, and I've developed feelings.  It still feels fairly friendly from her side though.  We've said we like each other, and I thought she had given some other signs she likes me, but it still feels fairly friendly.  Also, she hasn't always felt well enough to hang out.  I don't want to scare her off, but having feelings for someone who might only like me as friend, and hasn't always been very available to hang out, has had me feeling a bit down &amp; depressed.  And especially if I don't hear from her for a while, I can feel lack of motivation to do things.  It can feel worse than just being single and not meeting people for dating at all.

I suppose part of it is that I can fall for people easily in the right conditions.  I can feel down with an outright rejection too, but at least I'd know I can move on.

I will try to make this as short as possible. I met a women (20y/o) (I‚Äôm 22) at my work and got along in person. The day we exchanged numbers we spent our lunch break together &amp; she was fidgeting a lot, fixing her hair &amp; showing me funny videos of her &amp; her friends and she wouldn‚Äôt show one video bc she said she looked bad. Then we locked eyes for a good 5 seconds while not saying much then I broke the contact. After receiving her # I messed up badly through texting (over pursuing or as ppl saying ""simping""). Lasted for about 2 weeks of texting not much coming from her side of the texts. Got rejected after 2 weeks of texting (she was very polite saying she was kinda interested in someone else but rly likes being my friend and wants to stay friends) told her I was disappointed but appreciated her honesty &amp; stopped pursuing. 4 days later she says she didn‚Äôt even see my text til today thanks. Pretended to have deleted her number and she laughed. Told her I was just kidding 5 days later &amp; hoped she did well on her exams. Then a couple days later I told her I was interested in a few women but truthfully felt there was potential btwn us &amp; that I respected her being transparent about her situation &amp; if she just sees friendship moving forward I acknowledge her decision. She responds by addressing me as homie sorry if I hurt ur feelings but I am not interested in a relationship with you. I left it there then she texts me back 2 days later saying her friends sent that and it sounded very rude also that she is now seeing the guy she was initially interested hoping everything‚Äôs cool and we can still stay friends. I Responded two days later saying I‚Äôd appreciate you give me some space thanks (I didn‚Äôt want to leave things there w/o saying anything. it‚Äôs now been 18 days since we‚Äôve spoken. I approached this women wrong by giving her too much attention. What do you guys who are not in this situation think of how I handled it &amp; how she responded ?

Whenever conversations about his ex come up, I hear a lot of terrible experiences, and am told that his friends never liked her and are so glad for him to be out of that abusive marriage. Yet his friends still like her posts, comment little funny jokes, wish happy birthday, etc. And yes, I obv creep her social media sometimes, I‚Äôm only human! The reason this weirds me out is when I‚Äôve briefly met his friends or family, I got a super weird vibe, like a fake friendliness towards me, and maybe it‚Äôs in my head but I feel like I‚Äôm being judged. He also is reluctant to introduce me to friends &amp; fam so maybe he suspects they‚Äôre not so welcoming to me for whatever reason.
Maybe this is a conversation I need to bring up with bf, just nervous so as to not make him feel bad/awk when it comes to meeting up with his friends in the future. Not even sure as to how I would bring up the topic, considering he does not have ex on social media, so it would be more like ‚Äúhey I went on your ex‚Äôs profile and noticed your family and friends, who you said have hated your ex for so long, are still liking her every post and wishing her happy birthdays, what‚Äôs up with that?‚Äù..
This is strange for me. Not sure if I‚Äôm overreacting? When one of my past relationships (4 years) ended, and despite my friends becoming close with my ex, my friends cut contact as respect and support for me upon finding out I was cheated on and that he was manipulative. This was pretty similar circumstances to bf‚Äôs past relationship, yet his friends remain in touch with his ex despite everything she did to him. Does he just have bad friends? Should I trust these people? Should I not be comparing this to my past experience because his ex was in his &amp; his friends‚Äô life for way longer than my ex of 4 years?

Plus I found out today that my ex is getting remarried (to the guy she was cheating on me with, but hey, I wish them the best of luck). I mostly don't really care, but it irks me endlessly that she was able to do it, but for some reason I can't.

I'm torn between the whole ""I like having my own space, my own time, do what I want, etc. and the other side is that some days, I just want someone to stroke my hair and tell me it is going to be ok.

My inspiration behind this is twofold:

1. I recently went on a date with an acquaintance I had met in real life and knew for certain I was attracted to in real life. When I came across his OLD profile... had I not already met him, I would have swiped left. It was... not good.

I've flip flopped back and forth about something she said to me as she is a bright woman, but not very introspective.  She believes you meet 3 special people in your life (not applicable to everyone!) - someone in your teens (first boyfriend or girlfriend), someone in your young adult years that you marry and then, someone in a  later stage in your life that can be deemed ""the rest of your life"" person.    
After she first said it I was feeling hopeful, as online dating was nothing more than a freeway pileup inside a tornado and that my person was out there, somewhere.

Divorced for almost 4 years. ‚ÄúUnconventional‚Äù personal style, to some. For lack of a better term. My Life is together but I don‚Äôt look like the girl next door. I look young for my age (I am told) and I‚Äôm heavily into music, art, old movies, actually reading and goth/punk culture. Much more but this isn‚Äôt my OLD profile. :) Being myself has never held me back, with work I‚Äôve been the boss, I raise my child to be an amazing human. Involved in the PTA. 
I‚Äôm a smarter, more creative, more responsible grown up version of my younger self. It‚Äôs not a phase! Heh. Anyway, after separating from narcissistic cheating ex after 16 years together. Whom I thought was my life partner. He was it! Oh No. much gaslighting ensued toward end. He has moved on quite easily. It hurts sometimes still. But we must go on. Ice cream helps. 
I Had a great relationship directly after. An old friend popped up out of nowhere. Almost too fast. Lasted a year. My dear Friend became more. Helped so much, listened, fun and is into same things I am. Same age. I pushed him away out of distrust and now he‚Äôs gone. I probably wasn‚Äôt ready. He is still missed this very moment but I really hurt him. Which hurts me. He Won‚Äôt even respond to calls/texts anymore. 
So...Tried OLD, reluctantly, met a great guy, surprisingly, (only interesting one thus far, so I thought and no offense to anyone)...into things I am, an amazing artist a musician..a 7 month relationship, him...50 yrs old, open minded but started getting controlling, didn‚Äôt want kids (he knew I have a lovely child).

Where do you find men on OLD that have their lives ‚Äútogether‚Äù (I don‚Äôt care what you have, who you are and sincerity is what counts) and have similar interests to mine? People that won‚Äôt show me pics of their abs or cars and ask if I‚Äôm DOM or SUB...call me a MILF simply because I look how I do. I find most OLD to be (no judgment) an endless pool of people who forgot who they were/are. One can evolve, IMO, we must evolve, ‚Äúgrow up‚Äù, if you will, yet keep some same interests. No? Be Your true self. Where‚Äôs the Whimsy? Still be young at heart, cool interests, yet responsible. I‚Äôm not looking for the curious or a hook up. Fun and serious at this point.

I have been on Hinge for about two months and there it was a slow trickle of maybe one or two a week - i.e. exactly what I was expecting.

Now, I know that with apps location matters a lot and maybe pof is what everyone around me uses? But I can't avoid being suspicious that all those likes are just fake profiles used to trick me into paying 40 bucks. Because this is not normal. Or at least, not normal for me.

Each one special in their own ways but there seemed to be something that was always a little off from being perfect. I thought that there was no such thing as the perfect woman (at least for me) and figured that I would grow old alone and die in my home with no one around.i decided to try the dating app on FB and within a few days I had someone that thought that I looked like I might be interesting. I checked her out and she seemed to have a lot of the same qualities that I have been seeking. 

After we matched she and I began texting to get a feel for each other, she asked if I liked Marvel movies ( I own them all) and I said yes, so I returned with the question do you like Star Wars. She said yes and at that point I asked if she wanted to meet somewhere. She agreed to a time and place and while I was sitting in the parking lot waiting a car pulled up next to me. At that point I got a text that she was at the place and gave a description of her car, the very same car that had just pulled up next to me. 

I sent a text back saying where I was and got out of my own car. We ranked about everything (our families ,past relationships, and things we've done, places we've been etc.) . The wind was blowing and her hair kept getting in her eyes and without even thinking I reached up and brushed her hair back.

73,mgf2zg,1617107959,New Attitude,"Remember that song, New Attitude, by Patti LaBelle?

The chorus goes like this:

I‚Äôm feeling good from my head to my shoes
Know where I‚Äôm goin‚Äô and I know what to do
I tidied up my point of view,
I got a new attitude!

So, recently by chance, I met someone.  The experience was so beautiful that I had drafted a  long detailed summary of how this came to be, which I was going to share via post here, but decided not to, as it‚Äôs such a special moment, sharing it haphazardly feels as if it would diminish it‚Äôs significance.

Instead, I wanted to share my thoughts on how I feel that our meeting came to be.  To do that, I‚Äôll share two small details as to kind of paint the framework.  

Earlier this month I went on vacation with only two intentions; one being to finish studying for an exam that I‚Äôm taking which will allow me to make a mid-life career switch from profession to life long passion, and two being to complete the work of accepting and being completely comfortable with where I find myself in life at 44.

While on vacation, I was completely centered, at peace, and noticed that by completing the work of accepting my current situation, the energy that I was putting out into the world was being reflected back by how others were receiving and greeting me.

By chance, I happened to meet a fellow traveler.  We discovered that we both had been going for walks each morning, and decided to walk together the next morning.  That walk turned into a four hour excursion, in which we met each other on an emotional level of pure transparency, vulnerability, and complete acceptance without judgement of what led to both of us being at a position in life in which we found ourselves.  That experience continued with a five hour dinner/chat the next night.

Upon returning from my vacation, I shared the long, detailed version of my experience with a beautiful like soul that I met through, and had been having a month long chat with, via a previous post.  We both found ourselves at a similar point of growth in life, which she described as ‚ÄúRadical Self-Acceptance‚Äù (I love that!).

Which brings me to Patti LaBelle and what I feel has been a life changing lesson learned.  While on vacation, a shift occurred in which I not only learned to accept and be happy with my current situation in life (I.e. I am exactly where I need to be at all times, I am at peace with the present moment, and open to and accepting of whatever the future may bring), but also accept others and where I happen to meet them on their journey.

I feel that this shift has caused me to attract a different type of energy; people who are more aligned to, and receptive of me in my natural state, and I of them.  I feel that this shift is what caused me and the fellow traveler to cross paths.  But the shift has transcended someone who I could possibly date; this shift has affected my interactions with both family, friends and complete strangers, if that makes sense.  

From colleagues to my parents, everyone has sensed a shift in my energy (I was already pleasant and positive, but what has occurred is akin to my existing positive energy being compounded).  In turn, it is as if they‚Äôve shifted their energy to meet me on this new level.

I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm capturing the essence of what transpired correctly, but the best way to describe it is it‚Äôs a feeling of ‚Äúthe universe will conspire to meet you exactly where you are.‚Äù  

If you are at peace with yourself, the universe will bring people into your life who are aligned with and in tune to your sense of peace.  If you are anxious and full of angst, you will meet people who further agitate that angst.

This newly learned revelation has completely changed my outlook towards dating over forty.  Having been in a self-imposed year long dating hiatus, I now find myself open to all possibilities, whether they be remaining single, or meeting someone who is a good fit for me, and I her.

My fellow likeminded Redditor and I continue our month+ long chat; she telling me new chapters in her story of growth (and offering sage advice), and I filling her in on my latest chapters.  

As for the woman whom I met while on vacation, we‚Äôve continued our experience (via daily emails) of two journeymen who happen to be walking side by side at this particular moment.  We haven‚Äôt tried to define what this is, nothing physical occurred, and it may not; we may wind up remaining friends or we may wind up dating, we don‚Äôt know and that‚Äôs ok.  We simply have committed to continuing an open, honest, truthful and non-judgmental dialogue without any expectations.  We‚Äôre simply allowing the path to direct our next steps, and it feels great!

So I wanted to share that with the group as we‚Äôre all trying to figure out how to navigate through these waters which sometimes shift from smooth sailing to extremely choppy at times.  

For me, the best approach came by first, identifying my current location on the map of life, second, aligning my compass with my current position, third, rotating my compass towards my desired destination and charting a path.  

The final piece was to follow and trust the bearings of the journey, but I don‚Äôt feel that would‚Äôve been possible without step one; both identifying and accepting my current location.

75,mghzje,1617116496,I would like to hear about meeting people IRL success stories. How did it happen?,"Hi I‚Äôm a 43m that got divorced over 5 years ago and really haven‚Äôt actually put myself out there dating since then. I‚Äôve been happy doing my own thing but now I‚Äôm thinking about actually dating. 

I had some success on OLD back in the flip phone days but reading here it appears the dating apps are hot garbage nowadays so I haven‚Äôt signed up. Meeting someone in IRL ideally would be the best way to go but just seems like some long odds.

I just don‚Äôt think I could ever feel comfortable approaching a stranger at the grocery store or somewhere similar and try to start a friendly conversation in hopes that it might lead to something. I live in the South so the majority of people smile and make eye contact with you so it doesn‚Äôt really mean like hey I‚Äôm open to chatting or anything. At least with OLD you know that someone on there is looking for someone whereas the woman at the store is just there to shop.

I walk my dog on a walking trail on a regular basis and imagining that I would have a chance meeting with a woman who was single, my age plus or minus 10 years, that I was attracted too, that‚Äôs interested in me and somehow manage to come up with a conversation that gets her attention as we are walking past each other in opposite directions seems far fetched at best! I live in a smaller populated area so there‚Äôs not a ton of people to begin with! 

I used to live near both a Panera and a Barnes n Noble. I spent a lot of time at both and don‚Äôt remember ever witnessing anyone trying to approach someone and those are places where you see plenty of people alone. I think most people want to be left alone unless they are actively meeting people like maybe at a bar. I‚Äôm not much of a bar guy myself. 

I know the meet up groups are recommended here a lot but is it okay to try to date people in a group? It doesn‚Äôt seem like that‚Äôs what they were set up for? 
I‚Äôm not typically a joiner but maybe I need to change it up some!

My best IRL scenario is the workplace which would most likely blow up in my face lol I work with mostly women and quite a few of them are single and I get along great with them but have never wanted to get into that potential drama. 

I would like to hear stories of people that met someone IRL that eventually became a date. It seems like I see a lot comments where a guy will say I flirted with someone at the store or I got smile or laugh but that was it or a woman will comment that I got hit on today which was flattering but I wasn‚Äôt interested in him. I‚Äôm curious about times it actually turned into something. Thanks!",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/mghzje/i_would_like_to_hear_about_meeting_people_irl/

I (41M) can‚Äôt really get to the first date stage, so I cannot comment about my own experiences on the other side of the fence.

77,mgksg7,1617124028,When is an attachment with (ex)coworker unhealthy?,"After several years of separation and finally a divorce, I thought I was ready to date. I met a cute guy through Tinder in the mid of a pandemic last year. We hit it off right after the first virtual date, and after two weeks of daily virtual dates he said he was falling in love with me (too soon).

He's a fun fella and we kept each other pretty happy during lockdown. But I picked up things here and there that made me hesitate. For example, he told me about a close relationship he has with a female ex-coworker that made his ex-gf of 4 years very jealous and think he had an ongoing sexual relationship with that said coworker and her husband.

Although he was very attentive and tried to be very polite with me as he said I was classy and different from the women he used to date, there were things that screamed ""douchey"" about him... For example, he said he had sex at work with co-workers because ""life is too short"". Anyhow, I gave him the benefit of the doubt, and thought the past was the past. He came clean and deserved to be forgiven.

When I came to visit him, I found that he only had pictures of a baby girl on his fridge. I asked who that was, he said that's the daughter of his friend - The woman who he used to work with at the same clinic for 8 months about over 10 years ago. They then went on to go to the same university to get an undergrad degree of the same field. She then got married to another guy and had a daughter. He even requested his mother to make a quilt for her baby. For a guy who doesn't even remember his mother's birthday, that's kind of unusually caring.

I wasn't jealous about that, but he kept bringing her up in our conversations regularly. And it crossed my mind that he seemed to have an unusual attachment to that woman. It made me wonder why his ex-gf was so jealous about that and accused him of sleeping with her and her husband (pretty sick, right?), but he stayed in that relationship for 4 years until she left him. As a woman, I would not stay with anyone who accused me of sleeping with someone I didn't, and wondered why he stayed. They said, there's no fire, there's no smoke.

Our relationship lasted only 2.5 months and it left me a lot of grief and I have stopped using dating apps.

IMO these are perfectly good people, who have probably had bad experiences, and wouldn't have chosen their emotional health conditions.

I've been seeing someone for the past couple (almost 3) months who is fairly guarded.  She has said her family dynamics growing up weren't very good, with love &amp; affection being used to manipulate, and she was also made to feel bad and unworthy.  There have been times when she has been feeling unwell and otherwise unavailable to meet up, and I've been patient, though I had started to feel she was uninterested in me (and therefore feeling down).  Recently, however, she said I'm the nicest guy she has met and really likes me a lot, and she wanted to tell me she can seem distant because she doesn't know how to take compliments and affection, and she just needs time.

I feel like this is both a success story and a learning experience.

I actually think OLD has gotten easier for me over the years - though perhaps it's just that I've become more comfortable and confident when dating?

85,mgq0hf,1617138336,Is benching now just a normal part of the OLD experience that should be embraced or are there still people who go through potential matches one at a time?,"First, this isn't a gender specific thing.  I've seen benching done with all sorts of gender and various sexual identities.  


For those unaware, benching is the term used when someone has a number of matches on OLD and dates each one at different times until they choose who to select for a partnership.  Each of these people is essentially on the bench waiting their turn for dates and is competing with the other people that the person has matched.  Think of the shows The Bachelor or Bachelorette except the benched people have no idea they are in a pool of contestants trying to date this person. 


I've never used benching in my dating life.  I have always started with talking to multiple people on apps, and when one of them seems like a match for a first date, I'll usually stop talking to other people and wait until that date ends to either continue on to a second date or, if it didn't work out, start again with talking to other matches.  In my opinion benching really contributes to the FOMO (Fear of missing out) that makes OLD such a shit show.  Things could be going really well with one person, but the fear of missing out on something better with another match just continues the vicious OLD cycles. 


When I've talked to people about this however, they say that it's a common part of OLD now and it is almost expected for much of the dating pool.  I can't get over how bad it feels to be benched and it isn't something I want to do to others; ""Hey I had a great second date with you, but my third date with this other person just went a little bit better so bye"" is such a shitty thing to do.

90,mgt1e3,1617147495,Dating advise for a 24yr old and a 40yr old in an open marriage,"I feel dumb asking here but this is new ground for me. I matched with this women on tinder who‚Äôs in an open marriage, I‚Äôm 24 she‚Äôs 40 and obviously she‚Äôs has a life and stuff going. We matched one day and met up the next day on her part to talk about what‚Äôs kinda expected and stuff. During our time together she had both open and closed body language which had this inexperienced young lad very confused we went for a 3hr walk from sunset to moonlight; she mostly did the talking. At the same time I guess it was romantic since it was a full moon and we sat and gazed at the moon ?? We were just meeting up so I‚Äôm not sure if it was suppose to be a date. 

She wanted me to walk her home afterwards and she allude that she wanted to meet up again for something romantic and what not even said how very convenient it was living nearby each other? . There was strong eye contact some mild flirting very obviously open body language. I still don‚Äôt know what the hell I was suppose to do but instinctively I tried setting something up but she said she‚Äôd let me know?? she gave me a long hug as we went our ways to our cars if that‚Äôs anything. 

Anyways I tried checking in and no response we (we matched and we‚Äôre meeting up she was texting back and forth non stop) it‚Äôs been a day and I know I know give it time but is it different if she she‚Äôs in her 40s?  this is new ground for me lol she‚Äôs really gorgeous she‚Äôs looking for a serious ‚Äúyoungster boyfriend with a high libido‚Äù (her words ) relationship thing to help fulfill her needs you know. I only know how to use 20 yr old tactics here totally clueless lmao

91,mgudgj,1617151908,Well I‚Äôm attracted to her but she has a boyfriend,"41, male, single, no kids, never been married. A relationship isn‚Äôt on the forefront of my mind. Part of that is because I‚Äôm never around women my age, much less single women. 

Well, I‚Äôm back in school for broadcasting and this semester there‚Äôs a woman in class with me. I‚Äôve only gotten to know her through class but I‚Äôm finding myself incredibly attracted to her. It‚Äôs annoying because she has a boyfriend. I haven‚Äôt flirted with her or indicated my feelings. It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôd have a chance anyway if I did.

Short of completely ignoring her, which will be hard as there is only one other person in our class, is there any sure fire way of killing a crush before it develops further? I don‚Äôt know her well enough to focus on her faults. This is so annoying.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/mgudgj/well_im_attracted_to_her_but_she_has_a_boyfriend/

93,mgwd3x,1617158580,Not sure about trying to date anymore.,"Is it just me or does trying to find someone to get to know and possibly date at this age seem like a completely pathetic and utterly humiliating process? I am coming out of a relationship of 14 months and it just seems like I have no ambition to try again. I checked out a dating site and it just made me feel like it's never gonna happen. 
No offense guys, but if you're dating profile photo looks like you're face is trying to be hard in the prison yard, I don't think that the ladies are lining up for that. I was also matched with a bunch of men in their 20's who then proceeded to each tell me that they are grown ass men and I should be open to dating them. I have already lived my 20s and 30s and I'm not interested in doing that again.
It would be nice to find someone my own age that isn't trying to act like they're in their 20s. I'm ready to grow and find someone to share a meaningful life with, and I'm also not wanting to just settle for whatever.

94,mgwit0,1617159126,Dating single parents?,"I am 41M with no kids. CFBC. 

And I don‚Äôt date single moms. Not because I have any moral concerns or what have you. It‚Äôs just that I don‚Äôt want the responsibility or to live the parenting lifestyle. Nothing against it, just not for me. 

But I have gotten some notable flack about it. 

‚ÄúYou just don‚Äôt want to be a part of something greater than yourself.‚Äù (She meant her family).

‚ÄúYou are lazy and you don‚Äôt want to step up and take care of responsibilities.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou want a child-free woman so that she can take care of you and baby you.‚Äù

Anyone else catch flack?

95,mgxrlm,1617163646,Do I want to see her or does she want to see me?,"Generally speaking, if I'm the one messaging about seeing one another next, do I state that I want to see her, or do I ask if she wants to see me? 
I feel like the first, since I would instinctively as the second, as why would I still want to see her if she doesn't? But I realize women don't work that way. The first shows initiative for one, also she's off the hook for admitting that she wants me to she just has to say it's okay.
