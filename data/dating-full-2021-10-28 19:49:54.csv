Hello, I’m a student (M19) and I got out of a long relationship (2,5 y) 6 months ago. It’s been a month of uni and I fell for a girl from my year (F20). She seems to be an introvert or shy in general and only stays in her little group of friends most of the time. We’ve talked a little and texted a few times, however she seemed like she was either too shy or not interested at all (objectively speaking). However, I did catch her looking at me a few times during lectures and I am not sure whether this means something or it’s just a pure coincidence. Despite all of this, I’m planning to ask her out tomorrow and I’m not sure it’s a good idea in spite of my friends telling me I should just shoot my shot. Could she be interested at all? Am I overthinking this? Should I just go for it or wait more? Would appreciate any kind of advice even if this seems extremely childish, thanks",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1104702,public,self,Should I ask her out or is it pointless?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qhv1t1/should_i_ask_her_out_or_is_it_pointless/,all_ads,6,,,

I met this girl almost 2 months ago off a dating app after about a week we really hit it off and I asked her out. She later canceled saying that she wasn’t ready for anything serious yet but that she would want something in the future, we basically then started dating but without labels, we talked about our feelings for each other a bonded a lot she even talked about falling in love with me, we FaceTimed everyday and fell asleep on the phone with each other most nights too Without going into any details I know that she has issues which didn’t bother me at all since I do too. A little over a week ago she said how she really wanted to see me then asked when I was free, after that we set up a date and it was sort of clear that like after this date we’d be like officially a couple, 2 days before the date however I was close by where she lived and we met up for the first time. I could tell if that she was nervous, we talked in her car for like 8 minutes and then she said she had to goto the store, I offered to go in with her but she said no then kinda just walked away. I wasn’t sure what was wrong as I didn’t look bad at all, and we didn’t discuss anything bad at all. The next day she canceled the date and felt overwhelmed, she the implied that I was the one making it more tense. Even tho she was the one actively pushing the relationship forward and I just fallowed her lead. She said that she still had feelings for me and that she just needed more time. At first I said that it was okay, but after this being the second time she canceled after being so weird this day before, it made me think that her feelings had changed, so after she had fallen asleep I sent her a large text saying how her canceling literally last minute hurt me and how I could tell that something was off, I said how I wanted to stay and make things work but that I needed to know that we were like exclusive and not talking to anyone else, I wanted to know that if I stayed I wouldn’t just be hurt. I also emphasized how I didn’t blame her for how she felt tho and that I wanted to stay. next day she was cold and stanoffish which wasn’t to surprising, she later told me how she saw some people at her job which was traumatic I tried helping her but she didn’t really let me. the next day she seemed more like her self. And even said how she wanted to FaceTime me that night, but sometime after seeing her therapist she disappeared for a few hours then texted me late at night breaking things off, saying how she lost feelings for me and didn’t see a future with me. Saying how she thought it was best for us to part ways, I looked on snap and she had unsaved everything and I sent her, all the pictures of me and texts and shit. That really hurt me bc she talked about how she’d save her ex’s texts to look back on and see when the times were good and how she had grown, but she didn’t do that for me. I sent at first a short response on snap and then unadded her, I also unfollowed her on Instagram on tik tok. Later that day I sent a longer text on iMessage, basically apologizing for the short response and saying that she mattered to me and that if she ever wanted to reach out for help I’d be there it was sent but she never responded to it. To this day a week later she still fallows me on Spotify and still fallows a playlist I made for her, I know that she couldn’t have forgotten about it, idk I basically wanna know if I even still have a chance with her or if I should move on, because I love her but I don’t know if the future I want is even possible.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1104740,public,self,A super long story lol,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qhve0r/a_super_long_story_lol/,all_ads,6,,,

How ever last date we talk a bit and she told me she was werided out about a freind of mine who mentioned me to her. I didn't understand why and she said ""i dont know why it bothered me"" and i just told her ""he knows i have been seeing you as he was there the day we met but im not going around telling people you are my girl or anything"", she replyed ""i dont care about that, never mind"".Anyways we went back to other stuff but it seemed like something there kind of changed.

She was less affectionate the rest of the night and she was kind of quite to leave in the morning. She did how ever say she had a great time after, etc, etc... and at 1 am that same day (it was a saturday) she told me she was just thinking of me and had a nice idea for us to do next time we met"". 

I proposed Tuesday to meet and she told me ""i'll let you know Sunday, but Tuesday came and went and nothing was brought up. I didn't push and made other plans."" During this week her answeres to my texts were 16 to 24 hours aparts. She wasn't cold cold but more than before and shorter answers.

She ended up saying ""work has been crazy, i dont have time for anything anymore"" ""have a lovely day &lt;3"" . I learn not to go crazy when women pull away a little so i just replied ""Better that than the alternative. Work pays off!"" ""hit me up when your schedual frees up ;)"" ""have a lovely day too"".  TO what she wrote ""weekends are ok but week days will now be complicated"".

So the question is: Do I ask her if she genuinely wants to go or if she is just trying to let me down easier somehow or ghost me?

Knew her through a friend couple of months ago and we hanged out couple of times in a group where she’d invite me to it. She’d also tag along with me often whenever I work out and would follow me around whenever I see her at school lol. But we don’t text often(we both take hours to reply) or flirt. She’d say stuff like “guys my (ethnicity) are in demand don’t get kidnapped”(that a compliment?) also would compliment my clothes. I’d obviouslr feel good about it but here’s the thing she  also said “why are you fixing your hair, you ugly anyways”.. is that supposed to be funny? I think she likes being with me but why would she say stuffs about her hookup with a football player? I don’t understand why she would invite me to a movie and brought it up.. Also she already asked me twice if she can come over to play my ps5 but I jokingly turned down both times.
Yesterday one of my friend asked if we were dating because she sees us all the time at school and I was surprised she said it.

Personality matters too, but you can’t measure personality online, and I still don’t even know what it means to “have a good personality.” What even are good personality traits that will attract others? I know confidence is one, but I still struggle with that. Being socially anxious or weird seems to be repulsive to women, but I still struggle with talking to people in real life. I rarely go out to places by myself, and I usually only go out if it’s with a small group of friends and I’m invited.

Women also want men who make 6 figures. Luckily I’m a man who has a job that does not pay minimum wage, and I will soon be working in a position where I will make close to $80k a year, but as long as I’m making a living that’s all that should matter. I hate how women are so entitled to this.

I don’t have a Master’s, but I have a Bachelor’s, so that’s another rule of 6 that I failed. I would like to date an educated woman, but I don’t want my education to be the only reason she’s dating me, and I don’t want to date a woman who barely has an education because I don’t want them to use me for the money I’m making.

So I failed almost all the rules of 6’s. I’m 6’3”, but I don’t know how long my D is. I don’t have a 6-pack or large muscles (I’m a little overweight but I’m not obese), I won’t be making 6 figures even when I start my new job, and my Bachelor’s degree is a 4-year degree (although it took me 5 years due to personal decisions). I’m not sure how I would describe my personality. Additionally, I’m not outgoing, I would rather sit at home and play video games than go out unless it’s with friends, and I’m nervous about talking to people, regardless of their gender, in public. I have some hobbies but I don’t do them a whole lot and even then some of them aren’t really that social or they don’t appeal to people my age.

I have been told for the most part that I am a 5, but I was told by one male that I was a 9. Again, physical attraction is subjective, but if I can only go up to, say an 8, is it even worth going on dating apps if I will be judged against all the studs who have their life in order? (And I’m sorry if my use of the word “studs” offended anyone)

If I go on dating apps and want results it seems as though I’m going to have to lower my standards and settle for whatever comes to me. I don’t want to do that again because it hurt the last person (I got into a short relationship with her even though I wasn’t attracted to her looks just so I could say I was in a relationship and I was desperate for attention and there was no one else at the time). It seems as though all the women I’m attracted to are out of my league. Swiping right on every single person won’t help because they will punish you for it. Eventually I’ll be in debt because of all the dating apps I’d be paying for, all because I’m not perfect.

We really hit it off and we began texting each other pretty often. She had a boyfriend at the time but it didn't stop her from flirting with me every time we worked together and over text, driving me home from work every shift, telling me I'm cute on multiple occasions, talking about me constantly to all her friends, and constantly telling me that we should go out for drinks or to the movies something.

Eventually she broke up with her boyfriend, and made it really clear to me that they had broken up (brought it up to me multiple times out of the blue). I didn't ask about her boyfriend or offer her any condolences (mostly because I didn't give a shit about her boyfriend), but later that night I asked her if she wanted to join my friend (she knew him too) and I at the club in a few days. She said she would if her new job doesn't schedule to work that day. So I told her to let me know.

About two days before we were supposed to go to the club I texted her letting her know we're going to pre-drink at my buddy's house first. She said cool and that she'll again let me know if she could go. The day we're supposed to go to the club arrives and I don't hear from her at all. I waited all day for her to text me and I didn't hear a word. 

About a week later I texted her about something unrelated and she apologized about the club, saying she forgot because she was busy with her new job, and that she still wanted to go out for drinks. So I ask her if she wanted to go out that weekend. She again says she'll check her schedule and that she'll let me know. I never hear from her. 

I asked my buddy about this and he says that she was into me, but I screwed up in two places. The first was for asking disinterested in why she broke up with her boyfriend, and that she probably expected me to offer to spend time with her. The second is that she was waiting for me to text her the day of the club asking her if she was coming. When I didn't text, she took it to mean I didn't really care about her.

I've never objected to being the one to initiate a romantic relationship because if it means I get to date a great guy, it's totally worth having to summon up the courage to ask them out. Ever since I've come to college, though, my confidence has been so shaken. I was in a long term relationship for over two years in high school, but we decided to split up before we left for school. In my first month in college, I fell pretty hard for a friend of mine from class. He was casually seeing someone at the time, but they split up a few weeks into school and about two weeks after that I asked him on a date. He said he'd rather be friends, and while it really stung, I was glad to have closure. So fine, whatever, I move on. I start hanging out with this other guy and grow to like him. I was getting better potential romantic vibes from him and after getting dinner together a few days ago and having a long talk about our romantic pasts, I ask him if he'd like to go on a date sometime. He also says no, that he'd rather be friends, and I've sort of been reeling since.

I'm just starting to feel so much less confident in myself. It seems like no guy is ever just interested in me first. I've never actually had a guy ask me out before; I've only ever been asked on a date in return after I'd already initiated multiple dates with that person.

I’ve noticed that most guys who I meet through work/other areas immediately start getting very touchy, flirtatious and making sexual innuendos, which I’m kind of uncomfortable with as I’m not looking for a relationship, or any intimacy. 

Out of curiosity, is this a sign that a guy doesn’t “genuinely” like me? I get the sense that if you really liked a person outside of some superficial reason, you would do your best to keep them comfortable. You definitely wouldn’t jump in making directly sexual jokes etc, or maybe that’s down to personality? I’m very clearly uncomfortable in these situations, yet guys keep doing it...? 

The second situation is random guys from my university days - some of whom I haven’t spoken to in 2+ years - spontaneously popping up in my dms and making conversation. Sometimes it devolves pretty quickly into innuendos, other times it stays surface. I’ve had several of these guys ask if I’m free to meet and they have gotten passive aggressive when I delay (this is my fault, I’m really non-confrontational so I tend to give very vague answers in hopes that they sense my disinterest and let up, which never happens). 

It’s weird because the vast majority of these guys, I didn’t even know that well. Maybe we’d chat once every few weeks in a lecture or something, and they would never seem particularly interested in me.

Slowly over the last 5 weeks we’ve started getting closer I think, he is 32 and I’m 22 (f). 
I just want some clarity on if he is interested from some of our conversations…at the start we connect on living in the same area in the past and over food, then after talking about a situation in with someone else in a group he interrupted and asked if I would be interested in older people. From there we started jokes about age and I think we both thought I was too young or him too old till we spoke about ex’s and we shared we have dated those ages, we have shared some deeper personal things, there have been quite a few sexual jokes, we have inside jokes and we always have eye contact and laugh. When I’ve helped him at work he compliments me publicly and not just in a professional aspect he’ll say I’m lovely or something. He told me he joined tinder a week after I said I was on it. I asked him what his type is (now I’m very alt looking so hard to fit a type) so he paused and got stuck on what to say then said personality and he wants someone who makes me laugh and I do. 

I messaged him outside of work about something and it got a little flirty till I hesitated then I think he held back, he did tell me he is quiet. He also said he feel insecure about his situation and his body. I know because of work he is cautious about saying the wrong thing incase it’s misunderstood and he gets in trouble and I feel similar but people have noticed us flirting. 

There was a couple of hints from him about seeing what I’m like outside of work and wanting to get to know me. I feel like there’s this awkward funny sexual tension and we’ve both said we want something deeper but never directly about each other.

I feel so guilty and I hate it! I don't want to be with the person anymore, she's with someone else now and I've even wished her good luck with her new boyfriend and said goodbye because I didn't want things to end on a bad note like my previous experiences.

How ever last date we talk a bit and she told me she was werided out about a freind of mine who mentioned me to her. I didn't understand why and she said ""i dont know why it bothered me"" and i just told her ""he knows i have been seeing you as he was there the day we met but im not going around telling people you are my girl or anything"", she replyed ""i dont care about that, never mind"".Anyways we went back to other stuff but it seemed like something there kind of changed.

She was less affectionate the rest of the night and she was kind of quite to leave in the morning. She did how ever say she had a great time after, etc, etc... and at 1 am that same day (it was a saturday) she told me she was just thinking of me and had a nice idea for us to do next time we met"".

I proposed Tuesday to meet and she told me ""i'll let you know Sunday, but Tuesday came and went and nothing was brought up. I didn't push and made other plans."" During this week her answeres to my texts were 16 to 24 hours aparts. She wasn't cold cold but more than before and shorter answers.

She ended up saying ""work has been crazy, i dont have time for anything anymore"" ""have a lovely day &lt;3"" . I learn not to go crazy when women pull away a little so i just replied ""Better that than the alternative. Work pays off!"" ""hit me up when your schedual frees up ;)"" ""have a lovely day too"".

Do you guys ever think about what could’ve been with someone you once liked very much. Like there was clearly something under the surface of both of your feelings, but you never got to know what it was and still think about them. Even after almost 3 years, all the flirting and the little moments and time together still reside in my brain, and I kick myself for not actually pursuing her or revealing how I felt, because im sure I would’ve had a good outcome. I can still see now all the of those moments where you could just feel that fire and thee heat between you two. And sadly I can also see where my window began to close and the fire began to die out until it seemed like she wanted nothing to do with me do to my inaction.

I was pretty much a virgin to any type of intimacy so I picked up on a lot of hints and flirting later than I wish but I could’ve, but I could tell she had some feelings for me and that led me to develop feelings for her. But I was so unsure, not only of her feelings but of myself and my worth and capability. Not to mention that family life at home was kinda turbulent. So even though on the outside I held it together and looked like I had everything under control, inside I was about as messy and out of place as my room at the time.

All of us do a certain something to express love to our partners; coincidentally these are also the things that make us feel loved.

We call these Love Languages, because they are how we speak love, and understand love. If you spoke english to someone who speaks russian, they wouldn't be able to understand you. Likewise, if they spoke russian back to you, you wouldnt be able to understand them. Our Love Languages work in exactly the same way, and your partner will not feel loved or appreciated unless you speak their Love Language. Visa-Versa, you wont feel loved and appreciated either so long as they dont speak YOUR Love Language.

There are five main Love Languages. All of these sound good and romantic, but usually only one or two will speak to you the most.

**1. Words of Affirmation**
Saying things like ""I love you"", ""You're so beatiful"", and ""You make me happy"". People who have Words of Affirmation as thier Love Language feel genuinely appreciated when their partners say nice things to them. They love it when you leave little notes around the house for them to find or send random texts of love and kindness to them while you're away.

**2. Recieving Gifts**
For people with this Love Language, a gift is a tangible symbol of your love for them. It does not have to be expensive. What they are looking for is a thoughtfulness behind the gift. Giving a gift to these kinds of people leaves a big impact on them, and makes them feel special and loved by showing that you are always thinking of them. When they see it, it will remind them of you as well.

**3. Quality Time**
Making eye contact, listening intently, and giving them all of your attention. People with this Love Language feel most accepted when you are engaged in spending time with them. You dont have to spend a lot of time with them, but when you make your time together count, it goes a long way.

**4. Acts of Service**
""Actions speak louder than words"" for people with this Love Language. Everyone has a busy life, so when you take time out of your day to help your partner with theirs, it shows that you really do care for them. Things like making them soup when their sick, volunteering to do the dishes after a meal, and picking up their dry cleaning are things you can do to show your affection.

**5. Physical Touch**
Being physically close to people with this Love Language makes them feel wanted and loved. Innocent, non-explicit things such as holding hands, giving hugs, and cuddling are some of the best ways to express your affection, as it shows them that you need them and accept them.

**How can I tell what my partner's Love Language is?**
Quite simply, pay attention to the things they do to show that they love if. If your partner is always trying to be helpful and ease your burden, then their Love Language is Acts of Service. If your partner often brings you gifts, that's a good sign that their Love Language is Receiving Gifts. A Love Language is both how someone shows their love AND how they receive love. Asking them about their Love Language is also a good way to find out, but be mindful of their behavior as well.

**A Word of Warning**
I cannot stress the importance of a person's Love Languag enough. Over time, neglecting their love language will make them feel unappreciated and rejected. I have seen many relationships end because they did not speak each other's love language, including my own. I learned a little late that Love Languages are as vital to a relationship as water is to a tree.

Some context, I am 23M, consider myself above average, pretty lonely, in college. 

I think I might be scared of women. From what I have observed and learned in online dating has subconsciously instilled this archetype of a college aged woman in my head that is at her physical peak, gets attention from guys anywhere, has a lot of success with online dating, and is a generally very well liked person. The issue is that often project these traits onto most somewhat-attractive women and in turn, makes me feel bad about myself as I struggle with the very same things, so why would I bother? It is a strange feeling because I actually consider myself a confident person.  While some of these traits may be true about women, it's not reflective on what that persons life is actually like and the issues that they face. Not to mention the doubt it causes me.

Usually not a big deal as life happens or we forget to respond. But its to the point where I feel like she's no longer interested. The worst part is that we really had a lot in common and respected each other's boundaries. Finally someone I feel safe enough to open up to. I have sworn off dating before because I got tired of being ghosted or used. It's to the point where I wish they would just tell me if they're no longer interested. This entire experience has been weighing me down and I just don't know what more I can do to improve my dating experience. I wish this was just a one time occurrence and I look back through the text logs to see where I might've been in the wrong, creepy, rude, etc. I just don't know what more I could do or improve myself.

She swiped me and we started texting like 5-10 texts per day for two weeks. I asked for her number to move the conversation to a proper app like whatsapp since I dont check the Tinder regularly and I dont want to be too slow with my replies. She said slow is fine so I said ok we will continue texting on Tinder itself untill she is comfortable. One day she asked if I want to meet her for a coffee. We decided on the time and place (still Tinder was the only channel of communication) .
This was my first ever Tinder date and Its been 4 years since I went out with someone on a first date. So I was really nervous and rambled like an idiot on random topics. However she was kind and patient throughout the whole date and even seemed interested in knowing me. She asked me questions about my culture , my country (I am a new immigrant) my views on topics like politics and climate change etc.
So everything seemed to be going well ,but towards the end she got quieter. When the waitress came for the bill she asked for separate bills. I insisted for paying the whole bill but she did not let me. We came outside of cafe and she said that she has to go home and do some reading. I walked her till her car. The conversation during the walk was cold. I got the hint that I blew it and I told her that I was nervous and apologized If I sounded weird. She said I did not sound weird . She gave me a hug and we parted our ways. At this point I was pretty sure that she is not interested anymore and I was expecting to get unmatched by her.
To test the waters though ,I texted her on Tinder that night that ""I had really good time"" and she replied the same. Then there was silence for two whole days without a peep and I started to go through the date in my mind to figure out what exactly went wrong. So I decided to ask her ""was there anything I said or did during the date which offended you because you got quite suddenly "". She replied that I did nothing wrong and there is no need to worry.I thanked her for clearing that up .I was relieved but still confused and did not expect to hear from her anymore. However the next day she replied over my message and asked how is everything with me. I would consider that a conversation starter. Now we are still talking on Tinder for 3-4 days but it seems like she is making sure not to send more than one message per day. I too am just replying the message accordingly .

Now I am really confused  about where I stand. Its been mixed signals after mixed signals. I liked her and would like to give it another shot. But I cant figure out whether she is interested or not. Honestly I would not have minded to be rejected by her or even ghosted/unmatched. Is she just being kind by keep talking to me (barely though) to soften the blow? Should I go ahead and ask for a second date since she is the one who asked me out first and might be expecting me to take the charge this time . But her being sending only one text per day is not making me confident enough to ask her out.
I would love to hear your thoughts on this situation.

TLDR: Went out with a girl on a decent first date. She did not ghosted/unmatched though gave signals of a failed date and now still talking with me however way less compared to she was talking before the date.

As the title says, I'm 28, have been single for 2 years after a near decade long relationship. I've dated, had flings, and a crush here or there but nothing to write home about since the breakup... until this week. 

Context about him:
Met a guy (34M) on hinge, we hit it off on the app beautifully and set up a first date straight away. A couple of days later we meet up for our socially distanced date where he reveals (among other things) that he's spent the last 10 years working on short projects as a civil engineer, travelling every 6 months or so to a new location. The last 4 years of that he was working for a non-profit, building schools for kids in Africa. When he talked about these projects he really sparked up, and I made a mental note that this guy's passion was that job and that he might want to go back to it in future. His last project there ended abruptly due to covid and he was forced to return to New Zealand with 2 days notice.

Emerging dillema:
Fast forward a few days we agree to meet for a second date (currently this date is supposed to happen tomorrow) but this morning he messaged me to let me know that he's been in contact with people overseas in the last few days and has been offered a job back in Africa. This will mean he leaves NZ around Christmas time... in less than 2 months.

This leaves me feeling super bummed out and torn... on one hand, this guy seems amazing and we have such awesome chemistry and I haven't felt like there was this much potential with anyone in this way ever... Also, moving to Africa in the future, if things were to progress, wouldn't be off the table for me, just not in 2 months time. Maybe in a year or so..

However, 2 months is a crazy short amount of time to get to know someone before they leave the country... Long enough for me to fall for him very hard and him for me... but is it enough time before he leaves for us to be able to know we want to keep a relationship going?

We talked a lot, actually she was speaking a lot about her interests and i was amazed how talkative she is. To be fair i like listening to interesting people. The conversations was smooth. The other thing that was kind of a 'sign' is that she stayed close to me, so close even had accidental touches. Interestingly i was in full control of where were going, probably because she didnt know the city.

so i recently went on my first ""date"" post relationship about 2 weeks ago now. i thought it went great- she is someone that i knew previously because we worked together a few years ago and remained acquaintances throughout the years. so one of the things i noticed about her almost immediately is that she is a terrible texter. which is fine.. not everyone has the time or energy to respond all the time, especially to someone you just started talking to. also, she doesnt owe me shit. im well aware of this. 

so we have our first date, and i thought it went really well- i know i had fun, and she seemed engaged and she was very open, as was i and we talked for probably 6/7 hours. she made a few hinting comments like ""sounds like your mom and i would get a long"", and when i hugged her goodbye she did the thing where she looked back at me before turning the corner. at the end of the date, she invited me somewhere the next day with her friends, but i had to decline. we're both FT college students, and i was working until later that day, then had an exam due that same night. but i made sure to remind her i would definitely like to do something else sometime soon, if she wanted to. 

now that was about 2 weeks ago. so the next few days that followed after that date, conversation slowly fizzled out- but shes not a greater texter... like at all. with the way i was raised (with romcom movies and whatever) i was under the impression that i needed to at least attempt to make conversation maybe once a day, once every other day or at least every few days- to continue to remind her that im definitely interested. so i tried, but she was a little taken aback by it. she still responded and reciprocated, but a little confused as to why i brought up a conversation out of random. so a few days after the date, i asked if maybe she wanted to do something that week (last week) to which she responded that she had a lot of school work (some exams that week) and that she wouldnt be able to that week, but ""maybe next week"". 

so that put my worried heart to rest a little.  then the next week (this week) rolls around. in an effort to not look desperate, i waited a few nights to message her. i messaged her tuesday night asking if she was still down to hang out this week- its now thursday night and i have not had a response. like im trying to respect boundaries here and give her the benefit of the doubt, but i feel like this is getting a little ridiculous..? 

im feeling very discouraged and extremely confused because there was a lot leading me to believe that the date went really well and that i shouldnt be worried, but i kind of feel like im getting ghosted. she could just REALLY be that busy and i would totally get it. and if she doesnt want to do it again, i can totally handle rejection- its just being in limbo like this thats killing me. because i feel like its too early to call it quits and be like ""hey i really had fun but i feel like maybe you didnt feel the same way, can i ask what went wrong?"" but i feel like not getting a response for two full days is also not the best sign either.

What would convince you (a male), that a girl is into you? We’ve had a few conversations and I’m trying to read his behavior, he’s either shy or hot/cold or I’m misinterpreting everything!

I’m trying to work up the courage to ask him out myself..but he’s older, recently divorced. I’m not sure if he’s interested in dating and I’m finding it hard to navigate this. We run into each other semi regularly so I don’t want to make things awkward.
