1,n8fhue,1620571070,How do I not ruin this?,"Be warned, wall of text. 


I'm mostly writing this down for myself, but I might end up posting this either way.


I (29M) have never been in a relationship before. 


I'm very inexperienced at making contact with women I like, and actually getting somewhere with them. A lack of confidence and being very overweight really hasn't helped in that regard. I'm generally not a very social person, though by no means am I antisocial.


I had basically given up on ever being happy in the love department. I'm not happy being alone, but I always have been, and I'm kinda used to it.


Well, the unthinkable happened, and a woman I'm very much into actually came unto me. 


We work at the same place, so we see each other every day, and have done so for the past couple of years. 


I was always acting very ""warmly"" towards her, so I never doubted that she knew I am interested in her - I doubt I can really hide that. She would usually also respond in such a manner, but, due to my inexperience, I'm honestly unable to tell whether a person is interested or just being friendly.


So, about a week ago, she came to say goodbye, since we were closing for a few days due to a national holiday. So she asked me if I wanted her to kiss me goodbye (very normal in my country; not so much now of course, due to covid, which I thought was why she was asking.)


Well, the kiss goodbye was a little less ""friendly"" than I expected, so it definitely helped make up my mind as to her intentions.


So the next time I saw her, I asked her out. We swapped contact info and I sent her a text that evening.


Both our schedules are hectic even outside work, so we haven't managed to go on that date yet. Covid-related lockdowns are also interfering. 


We finally managed to pick a day when we can go out, so that's happening soon. I won't be seeing in her in person until then.



So that's the backstory, and that's where we currently are.


In my view, even though this is honestly the closest I have ever gotten to properly going on a date, and hopefully a relationship to eventually follow, the hardest for me is yet to come.


I have no idea what I'm supposed to do here. 


I don't think my attitude towards her has really changed much, and I don't plan on changing it. I don't think that's a problem. 


But how do I keep her interested? I do want to get to know her, but I don't know how to keep a conversation going over texts. I'm generally very to the point when I text. But that's not conducive to keeping a conversation alive. 


She also has been a lot more laconic in her later texts, but I do know that she is pretty busy.


Do I need to worry about keeping in contact until we go out? I keep trying to find reasons to text her, but I'm finding it difficult.


I also don't know what's expected of me on the date. Maybe I should go in blind and wing it. But then again I've never even kissed a girl, and I worry that I'll make a mess of things.


That's what's been on my mind for the past week non-stop. I'm trying to tell myself not to worry about it. But I've made a mess of things before and I know I won't be able to just move on from failure here.


If you made it this far,  honestly, thank you for reading.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n8fhue/how_do_i_not_ruin_this/
2,n8fq3y,1620571759,I (31f) have been talking to a guy (40m) for almost 2 months now and it’s so confusing!,"So, I have been talking to this guy for about two months now. We initially matched on tinder (I know I know) by way of him super liking me, usually I think that’s a mistake when people super like on tinder just because whenever I super like someone it’s on accident and I forget that if I swipe up on Tinder that means super like and not seeing additional photos of the person. So I initially started off the conversation and it was good, I could definitely tell that he wasn’t a big texting type but also figured since he’s older maybe he just does not like to text. 

Fast forward to when we finally hung out probably two weeks after we matched (he didn’t message me for a week and then apologized because he was moving into a house and was busy). We had a great time on the date we met up at a bar and had drinks as well as ordered food and chatted for a little over four hours. We ended the night by hugging and him walking me to my car and saying that he had a really great time and wanting to do this again. In between the first and second date once again there wasn’t that much texting but with him being busy with work (he’s a professor) as well as him getting his house together I didn’t mind (I was also busy with my life and talking with other potential dates as well). 

Randomly we start talking about our city’s MLS team and I realize that there’s an upcoming game and suggested that we go to a bar and watch it together. He proceeds to tell me that his friend is actually coming to town and that they’ll probably go watch it at a bar but I could join them. I was a little apprehensive at first, just because I didn’t know if it was too soon to be meeting his friend and also didn’t want to feel like a third wheel. So we meet up at the bar and I meet his friend and everything was really great, we actually met up with another one of his friends and went to a restaurant and all got to know one another and I had a lot of fun. Then we all went to his place and watched some TV, and randomly he goes to hold my hand and put his head on my shoulder. I was OK with it because his friend was also there so I didn’t feel too uncomfortable and he’s never given off creep vibes within the two times of seeing him. We finally end the night and he walked me to my car and then hugged me and asked me to text him when I get home. When I got home I noticed two text from him saying that he hopes I made it home safe and that he had such a great time and me being there made the night that much better and I fit in well with his friends - I agreed. Fast forward till now and another week has gone by and he didn’t really say anything so I finally said that I would like to see him again if he is interested in seeing me again of course, and he said yes I would like to see you again but this past weekend when we were supposed to meet up he pulled a rain check and said he couldn’t hang out I said that was fine. And then another couple of days go by where he doesn’t say anything, and I just don’t know what to think of that. Like he super liked me on the app and then he introduced me to his friends and said that he had a really great time and the two times that we did hang out was a really great time and he even said it himself so I don’t really know what to think happened, of course I do realize that he could also be talking to other women and he may have found someone that was a little bit more of a fit for him, I just wish he would’ve told me when I asked him if he was still interested that he actually wasn’t interested anymore or may have met someone else - we’re adults and should be able to say to one another if we’re not feeling it anymore. 

I should also preface by saying I found his Instagram and he was married before, so I understand if he’s apprehensive about getting into something new with and also potentially seeing someone younger.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n8fq3y/i_31f_have_been_talking_to_a_guy_40m_for_almost_2/

I went on a date with a guy and he showed up wearing board-shorts, a tshirt that was dirty (idk what it was even but it looked like wood shavings by the neck of the tshirt), and flip flops. We went to a brewery so it was casual but like, its a first date at least put some nice shorts on and make sure your shirt is clean. His nails also weren’t trimmed and his hair was like he just woke up from a nap. I dont get it. He’s not even attractive to where you could say he can get away with it. There was no way to tell this from his pics because most of them were outdoorsy pics. I felt stupid making myself look nice (nothing fancy, I wore converse, but I looked nice and  like I put some effort). Needless to say there wont be a second date.

5,n8h02s,1620575561,I'd love to get some opinions on this situation,"I was chatting for a month with a guy I met online. We went out on one date and it was great. He texts me daily to see how I'm doing and tells me he misses me and can't wait to see me again. I've asked him a few times when are we going to see each other again to which he responds about my schedule. I tell him what days I'm available and then nothing. No response on scheduling a second date. Crickets.....

He continues to text me daily pretty much saying the same thing daily which is asking how my day is going, telling me he misses me, telling me he can't wait to kiss me again, and then wishes me a good evening. And now he asked me to go on a road trip with him in a few weeks to which I told him perhaps would be best that we go on a few dates first and then we can revisit the road trip idea. He said fine. There is no way in hell I'm going on a road trip with a man with whom I've only had one date!! 

Wtf?? This guy wants to commit to a road trip but he can't commit to a second date?? I don't get it. What am I missing here? Does he think he has a better shot of getting laid if we go on a road trip? I am going to assume he is dating other women but why continue to string me along?

We are both 28. He ended things with me about 3 weeks ago saying he ""couldn't see himself with someone who was not Jewish as his grandparent was a Holocaust survivor"" and how important being with someone Jewish was to him and that he had actually been seeing someone else who was Jewish and wanted to get serious with her. He went on to reiterate that he was not religious but wanted to pass down the Judaism for his grandparent.

I am not Jewish (as he knew from the start) and felt very blindsided when I was told this news because we had had many conversations about our backgrounds, if we wanted children, families, etc. He always just reiterated he was not religious (never mentioned the grandparent) when I'd ask him about his background. I felt like he had had many opportunities to mention this. I was also a bit confused why he had ever matched with me or asked me out knowing that he could never see himself with someone like me. On our first date he told me he liked who I was ethnically. I will never fully understand the Jewish culture as I am not but I do understand how he can not celebrate Jewish holidays anymore or anything but still want carry on his heritage/genetics to honor his family. Though I do wish he had been upfront from the beginning as this doesn't sound like a sudden epiphany he had.

My issue now is it's been 3 weeks since we last spoke and just last night he sent me a long text message saying that he was wrong and a fool to let me go. That he is in love with me and it doesn't matter to him that I am not Jewish because he chooses me. Obviously this is what I had been irrationally dreaming would happen because I too was falling for him. But I am very hesitant - will the fact that I am not Jewish become a problem again?

20,n8j7hc,1620581994,Ex date (F26) is dating someone new but I (M23) would like to date her again. Should I tell her?,"Hey Reddit, i was looking for some opinions.. 
Little backstory: I was in a relationship with a girl (let's call her J), which was my first love. We broke up around 1.5 years ago. After a few months I met M (F26) and we started dating. We had an amazing time and it was all going really great, with a lot of passion from both. 

It all went well until J contacted me again and again trying to get back with me, which I refused, but where I also didn't completely block her. After a while though, because of her being my first love probably, she got back into my feelings a little bit and it felt I couldn't continue with M. A while after, I got back together with J, but after some time we also again noticed why it didn't work out and why we just didn't fit together. Looking back at it, I should have known and it was a bit against advice of people, but I guess I had to learn it this way. 

Now, a few months after again breaking up with J, M messaged me to just send me happy birthday wishes. I already had a little bit in mind that I fucked up and should have stayed with M, because everything was so amazing with her, and I guess I was blind.. But then last week it was her birthday and I send her a happy birthday message and in between we talked a bit every here and there after not having contact for months. Now I went to her place for her birthday just to talk and have a fun day!

So I went there, we were talking updating each other, having fun, got some food for us, drank a bit and it was just all fun and laughing, making a little walk etc, all just pretty much like it always was. At one point she mentioned she just started dating someone again, which she said was going very good. From the one side, I was very happy for her, also realising that she was hurt in the past mostly by a guy that cheated on her etc. From the other side though, I wanted to ask her that day if she wanted to try it again with me, and it was a bit of a bummer also hearing that she started dating. 

Because I was happy to see her feeling good and not trying to get her confused or something, I didn't mention that I wanted to try it again with her. However, the rest of the night was also just very fun, and I also slept over at her place, in her bed also. She always was just okay with that and said it was no problem, but I also kind of sensed she was feeling very good and comfortable with me.

Now, what I'm struggling with a bit is what I should do. I want to respect her (that's also why I didn't mention that I wanted to get back with her explicitly, and I didn't try anything with her that day), and I want to see her happy. On the other side, I just would have liked to start dating with her again. 

So reddit.. Should I just let it go a bit, get some time over it and maybe next time when we meet that we talk about it? Should I just text her that I didn't want to tell her at first, but it's something that's just what I want? Or should I just not tell her about it and see what happens if it continues with the new guy she's dating? I am just looking for some opinions, or advice.

She didn’t seem too interested in me/ getting to know one another, or having a good time. He send her two recent pictures of me prior.

I felt kinda stuck. I can have a good time no matter what but it was not in my best interest/worth my time and money to play chauffeur, go out to a bar or two, buy drinks/appetizers for someone with zero chemistry/interest.

I am an easy going guy so it’s hard for me to just bounce out, especially in this social context. I want my buddy to have fun and maybe get laid but I have my own self interest in mind too.

On top of that my date asked to be dropped off somewhere else after we left the bar. I should have said sorry I’m not headed that way (2 miles out of the way) but again, too nice?

Reflecting on this, I guess these were things I would have done differently.

1) talk online/on Ig prior to meeting. Vet them prior. 

2) Eject after I met at the apartment. Just make excuse and head out

3) drop them off at a bar and drive myself home/elsewhere.

I didn't like my friend doing this since I didn't give him permission but he asked her if she was interested in me and she said no obviously. Now my problem is that I tend to crush hard so even after this I was still really into her, but didn't do much because I knew it was not going to work at the time with covid and classes. Switch to spring semester, I was still into her and there were moments around January-February where I tried to talk to her, but she still seemed uninterested. I interviewed her for something around this time and later privately asked her for coffee, but of course she said no stating that she was really busy. Was not surprised by that at all. At this point, I was getting mad/frustrated mostly because I have not actually had a good opportunity to where I could actually have a conversation with her. Even during that January/February range It was only for a couple of minutes nothing more than that. At this point, I am trying to get over. There were situations where we would cross paths and she would look at me, but I would just ignore her and say hi to her friends. About 2 weeks after I asked for coffee, she messages me saying she's sorry for being rude and all to me and then said she would like to have coffee or anything with me. Since spring break was coming we decided to meet after. We tried to meet up but due to our schedules it never happened. Please keep in mind that even throughout all this she was still taking a really long time to respond back. I tried one more time but deleted it because she didn't open it for like a day, and was getting frustrated. Now since we're both south asian we're both involved in this organization that basically helps us connect to other south asians, but due to covid we didn't all meet and talk until around mid to late March. This is where I am starting to get confused. We had an event called Holi (if you don't know what it is look it up but basically it involves applying colors on other so it involves touching). During that event she would keep coming behind my back and apply color on my back. She did this twice. I didn't do anything to her or talk to her because around this time my final exams were approaching and didn't want to get distracted. Even after this, there were times where she would ask me questions regarding clubs we were in or whatever. Small talk in other words I guess. I remember one time I was sitting at the library by myself and she and her friend are coming and she just keeps staring at me until I look at her and when I slightly glanced at her she waved at me. We were also in the laundry room one time and I saw and waved at her and she acted as if she was surprised that I noticed her. I could be wrong on that part. Overall, during this time, it just felt like she had some interest in me. It's been 2 weeks since we all moved out of our dorms and this past Thursday I decided to text her. I said 'Hi"" and ""How are you?"" It's been about 3 days and she still has not responded to me. I don't know if I'm overthinking this whole situation or what, but can someone give me input as to what could be going on here? I'm thinking about sending her another text basically calling her out on her unresponsiveness (in a jokingly way of course), but I don't want to appear desperate and rude. Can someone help?

So, I've\[31m\] recently gone back ""on the market"" and when I was looking through OkCupid  I found a former classmate\[27f\] on there. We were in a couple of animation classes together and we worked on a stop motion group project at one point.

Well, when I finally got around to reading it, it was one of the best profiles I've seen on that platform. She's a super geek like I am and she's into a bunch of my favorite shows and hobbies. It sounds like we would be really compatible!

I'm waiting until I get my second shot, but I don't want to wait too much longer. I'm thinking of sending her an FB message to ask if she wants to catch up and if things go well I'll ask her out.

30,n8kfo6,1620585477,"Dating for 2 weeks but she suddenly ghosts me a day before we meet irl, need advice","I (m35) met a really great woman (f33) 2 weeks ago on a dating app. For the last 2 weeks we were calling eachother every evening for a minimum of 3 hours, and through out the day we made eachother laugh with memes and jokes, and flirted like crazy. We have the same sence of humor and made eachother laugh all the time. Few people make me laugh like she does. We both have the same hobbies and outlook on life and we even slept together one night with our phones next to our beds. We also got sexual via text and calls and she sended me private pictures of herself. We also talked deeply about our past experiences and opened up to eachother. She writes poetry and only shares that with people she holds dear, and a few days ago she shared some with me! She is caring, warm, and very beautiful and is all around just awesome. The whole package! I don't really fall in love that easily, but I was genuinely starting to get there, she ticked all the right boxes and she is stuck in my mind all day.

We were suppose to meet that weekend but it got canceled the day before. She was telling me the last couple of days she had an argument with a close girlfriend of her and they were going to talk it out that day. It was important to her and I supported her in that. She asked me if we could meet next weekend and if I was okay with it, and I said yes you are worth the wait. She told me everything afterwards of how it went, and it wasn't pretty, she was pretty upset about it.

Today (Sunday) we were finally suppose to meet irl and I was really looking forward to it! But out of nowhere she just ghosted me. I haven't heard from her since yesterday. I don't know what happened.

A little backstory about her.
She was single for 1,5 years and dated alot of dicks. Before that 1,5 years she was in a relationship with a narcissist for 6 months and that guy damaged her greatly. Because of all of that she developed a distrust in men, and I can't blame her. My brother was also a victim of a narcissist in a relationship and I know second hand how devastating it can be, it was like he was dead inside, just like she told me she was. I was understanding to her and listened to all she had to say. She was afraid I would discard it as woman issues, but I don't see it like that. I want to be there for her and show her not all men are like that. She also said she was over it and was past that issue.

That guy messaged her a couple of days ago (Wednesday) and she also spoke to him on the phone the day after that. That ripped open old wounds. She talked to me about it and was crying and angry at the same time, she said to him to leave her alone and doesn't want anything to do with him. I said it would be wise to block him and she did during our call, at least she said she did. She was sad but was still open to me about it. I made her laugh and tried to make her forget her problems, and it seemed to work, at least just a little bit. The day after that (Friday) she seemed very energetic, she even changed her look and cut her hair. She told me she wants to make a new start and get rid of the past and look to the future. She was all around positive and high energie.

The last time we called eachother was on that Friday evening. It started of good and we talked about alot of stuff and watched YouTube together. But later on in the evening she became more low energie, and more distant. It also didn't help that the connection (we called via WhatsApp and her internet is shit sometimes) was very bad, so the conversation struggled a bit. Earlier that day she told me she had to make a call that evening with an old schoolmate to plan a reunion. And the call ended different than all the other times, something seemed out of place. She said it wouldn't take long and call me back right after. She called me back an hour or so later but I missed it (bathroom break) and i called her back in around 30 seconds, but she rejected the call. After an hour or so I told her I had to go to sleep and wished her good dreams. She responded with sleep well. And that's the last thing she said to me.

Yesterday (Saturday) she was going to meet up with a girlfriend of her she didn't see in a long time. Something she already told me a week ago. I texted her that day to call me when she was available because I had another thing in mind for our date, no response. At the end of the day around 10 I texted her and said she must have been busy that day, but that I hoped she had a fun day. I told her I was really looking forward to our date tomorrow, and that we were going to make it a fun and relaxing day. I also said that if she didn't feel like meeting irl it would be no problem, and said I can wait a little bit longer. I don't want to pressure her into meeting because of her past experiences and her recent contact with her ex. I also wished her goodnight and sweet dreams and that I will call her the next day, no response.

Today I called her at around 10 in the morning, but she didn't pick up. I texted her a funny picture she shared with me, no response. I called her again a couple of hours later and again she didn't pick up.

And now in the evening, nothing.. still no contact. She hasn't even read the text I send her. And the only things I can think of is that she's anxious because of her past experiences, that I royally fucked up somewhere and I didn't notice it, its a shit test to see if I get angry of needy, she's bored with me or done, or simply just wants to be left alone.

She told me she never ghosted anyone in the past, and she is also the kind of woman that is very direct and isn't afraid to say what is on her mind.

The last thing I send her after my second attempt to call her is, hey everything alright? Also no response. And that's it, and I don't know what to do now. There is already a wall of one-sided text and every ""rule"" in the book says I have to stay quiet and/or move on, but I don't want to let her go just like that.

This shit hurts and is very confusing.

Do I just leave it at this and give her space or is there something else I can do?

36,n8kuvc,1620586665,Help me make the right decision.,"Long story short, a month ago my brother’s now-girlfriend tried to kiss me (they were just starting to see each other romantically when this happened). I finally decided to share this with my brother because I felt guilty for not telling him about it. We had a big argument about it and apparently she had already told him about that situation but have presented it completely differently and makes me look like I am the bad guy in the situation and I have misread her intentions, I have been mistaken and have had no clear idea of what was actually happening. I don’t have the best relationship with him and unfortunately when I presented my side of the story, he didn’t believe and said that he will never believed me and that he believes her instead. He said that she had showed him the conversation between us (after it happened I confronted her about it but she gave me the most vague answer) and that she has assured him that she doesn’t even like me and she has only rejected me in this vague manner not to bruise my confidence.

So I went through my chat history with her and found something she said that in my opinion proves that she lies and that I’m telling the truth.

So my questions is do let it go and I do not tell my brother, I stay in the “wrong” and allow my brother to think that he can’t trust me while he is “happy” with her and we all stay friends  OR I tell him about it and again live to be the villain who has ruined my brothers relationship and the dynamic in the friend group?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n8kuvc/help_me_make_the_right_decision/

Long story short, he is in a 3 year residency program and moved here for said program. His plan was always to move back to his original city or stay here for a few years with me until moving back. I have a child and he appeared invested in that, knowing full well a relationship with me meant serious and long term, not a fling.
Our relationship was for the most part REALLY good, we had a lot going for us. For those almost 2 years he talked about a future together CONSTANTLY. Where we would live, what cars we will drive, baby names, careers, financials, literally every aspect together.

However, for the last several months as his program grew closer and closer to an end he seems stressed about having to make big life decisions. Kept going back and forth on which job he wanted, where he wanted to live, etc.
After months of this back and forth I gave him an ultimatum because I didn’t feel like he was genuine in wanting to 100% include me in his future plans. Yes he talked about the plans, but I was willing to pack up everything and move to wherever he went. I can’t say he would’ve done the same.
So I told him I could not help but feel like he was going to drop me at the end of his residency and move on. That it felt like for me I’m giving 110% into this relationship and he has one foot out the door.
Well after a day later of him mulling it over, he decided that he couldn’t ‘take the leap’ and that he decided I wasn’t the one for him. Apparently had “issues” regarding some of the stuff I did or said in the past and he “couldn’t get over it”. 

I’m having a hard time wrapping my head around this. I’ve never been the one dumped in a relationship, and certainly not under these circumstances.
Since then, we’ve cut all ties and haven’t spoken or seen each other at all.

How can someone go from telling you they love you one minute, to telling you “maybe you’re right, maybe this isn’t right”.

I never really put forth much effort into dating because of constant rejection and poor self-esteem.  After becoming more self-aware, I decided to start making changes in my life to better myself and my circumstances.  I started eating healthier, exercising 6 days a week and started CBT therapy.  I consider myself a much improved person mentally, socially, physically and spiritually.  

I started dating my first girlfriend around a year ago but broke things off with her after learning about her sexual past.  From there I’ve learned that it’s very hard for me to date because I’m very uncomfortable about a potential partner’s past.   This makes things almost impossible because almost every woman in my age bracket has been with multiple people.  I’ve tried to just get over it but it’s not that easy.  I’ve brought this up in therapy multiple times but nothing seems to be working.

I’m more upset with myself than anything because I’m a late bloomer and feel like I’m weird because I’ve only been with one person in my entire life.  

I don’t mean to ramble on.  Guess I’m just looking for a friend to talk to about this or any sort of guidance.  If you feel like helping, I’d greatly appreciate it.  Thank you and have a great day.

however and in hindsight maybe this should have been a red flag but she randomly message me a month later apologising for ghosting me and explained that she had exBF drama to deal with and basically she was ready to move on.

So we started talk again everything was going great and then she started being weird or at least I felt she was, so I asked her what was up and I got a genetic response so I basically layed it out how I saw it and she kinda dodged a lot of it and tbh at the time I felt as if i was being a little OTT tbh so I dropped it. Anyway about a month later she out right ghosted me out of the blue like one day everything was normal and the next nothing 

So I left it for a couple of day you know in case she had family stuff going on or something even though I could see she was clearly still active on everything and so sent one message say something along the lines of ""idk what going on but it is what it is and I wished her all the best"" and I'm not going to lie I really did like her and its been an adjustment not speaking with her but I've noticed that she always looks at my snapchat and Instagram story without fail and I'm not sure why considering she was the one that ghosted me. 

So I was wondering if this is a common thing that happens?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n8m93n/ghosters_that_stalk/
52,n8m9q7,1620590657,"Same day same time different floor, a 25 year old and a 40 year old flirted with me and I didn't realize it.","So I work in a bistro and a lot of customers comes in and me being short and skinny I do get some attention as I run around the shop. I have a necklace which is quite unseen when it's inside but it do get out at times and it's silver and it suits my skin tone I guess, and I do have defined jaw and neck area. 

So this incident happened last week as it was a normal day, I signed in at 6pm for work and this 40 year lady was already there with her male colleague.I would say she's beautiful, a nice body for her age. So I have seen them one time there and I've only been working in the bistro for one month, but this lady is a regular customer there. And I went to the lady to give the beer and she noticed me and the guy had a chat with me as he knew me from the last visit in the bistro and we had a few dialogue and as she started noticing me. 
The guy mocked me with ' He bunks his class and coke here for work'  we three laughed together at the joke and she started asking me questions like ' where am I studying, what do I do, what's my name and things ' and after few questions she just asked me if I'm single in a casual way and I told her yes and I was so shy, she could see I was very shy and she said ' Aww you're cute ' . 
Then I gave them another round of beer and that's when I noticed that she gave me a look, a thirsty one, like I could read her eyes what she wanted and she just wetted her lips and swallowed the saliva (I don't know to explain that part well) . She asked me where I'm living and then she told me she lives near like two metro stations away from me and I just smiled at it and she was still giving me the same look, like scanning my whole body. Normally everyone will get uncomfortable but I did enjoy that look coz it's been a long time since I got this kind of attention. Then after some time the guy offered me a beer and I politely said ' oh no I'm working but thank you for the offer ' and then the lady offered me a whiskey which I politely said no and then again she asked me about my favourite drink which I replied with I drink everything I don't have a preferred drink. 

Then they ordered a dish ' chicken shawarma' so , this dish is a bit big so it's cut into half which makes it eatable for two people as a starter. So the guy had one piece and they called me, so I thought it was another round of beer, but the guy said, this piece is for you. And gave me it I was surprised and I thought they are just teasing me but she told me no it's for you, you have to eat it as you didn't drink with us, so I had no choice to eat it. But just before that she told me ' hey take off your mask I want to see your face ' and there is the thirsty part "" I WANT TO ENJOY THE VIEW"" and then k took my mask off, there I was standing looking ugly with some mushy facial hair on my face not fully grown just here and there. She told me I'm handsome lols!!! . And then I ate the whole shawarma as she enjoyed the view of me eating it. 

Then after eating it , it was late so we had to clear and clean the shop so I went to do my job and she left after sometime, I didn't get to say bye to her :/

56,n8mrbw,1620592083,Self Sabotage?,"Self Sabotage?

I’ve (25M) been reading posts here for about a day and it looks like I’m in the same boat as a lot of people. Got to know someone (30f) for over a month, met up a few times and really hit it off. Now they’re pulling away, citing that they don’t want to be burdened by making plans and keeping consistent communication with someone (we talk or text twice a week). Maybe that’s true, we live about an hour from eachother with lifestyles that are similar enough to be relatable but definitely different. It could also be that they don’t want to waste time on me. It’s probably some combination of both. 

Thing is, I approached this interaction knowing that while they were definitely showing interest in me, there was a good chance it would not last. I fully believe this person to be out of my league with how much more life experience they have. They’re a little older and well traveled, while I’ve been building my career in the same place for the past 6 years. Not that I don’t have anything to offer, life is going well for me right now and my work is fulfilling. But I could feel a level of knowledge/experience/self-sufficiency that I have not reached at this point in my life. I believe I did well at conveying confidence despite having that belief. I think my only expectation with the whole interaction was that I would be vulnerable, learn something, and my feelings would get hurt. 

Was it self sabotage for me to pursue this person despite the clear disparity? Is setting myself up for failure like this unhealthy? I’m aware that maybe just the fact I think there is a disparity shows through me and is off-putting. It stems from comparing a negative view of myself to my perception of this person. How do people become more secure in themselves when interacting with people they feel are out of their league? Is it a skill or is it something about yourself needing to be changed?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n8mrbw/self_sabotage/

58,n8mycq,1620592631,Struggling to be myself when dating? Any advice?,"I’ve (25F) have been dating off of OLD and have some moderate successes (3 month known end date fling, 20 month relationship and recently a 6 month situationship). After the crash and burn of my most recent dating experience I have been analyzing and reflecting a lot. I have come to realize that I have an issue being myself when placed in a romantic situation with a guy. When I approach/meet with a guy with only friendship in mind, I feel like I can be myself more often, but can never see the guy in a romantic aspect ever in the future. While if I meet with a guy already feeling that romantic connection or with the thought or possible romance, something in my brain switches off and I lose my entire personality. I feel like I get starry eyed and lose my personality. 

Some background: 
I’ve had a lot of guy friends (within our group of home town friends or college) that have overtime expressed interest in dating me. After being friends with them I could not see myself with them romantically at all, even though many of them have qualities I look for in guys. I tried dating a friend and could not get over that missing romantic aspect. And for a short time after the most recent break up I hoped back on Tinder to find some sort of connection (bad idea I know). I ended up meeting someone that was mutual in keeping it 100% platonic and I feel like I can chat and be normal with him as I only see him as a friend. 

But then in each case I meet someone with the idea of forming a deeper connection, I seem to lose the capability to be myself and express my own opinions and personality. Something in me shuts off and I become submissive (not the best word for it). I play more to their wants and needs. I currently believe this mental block is a big piece in the failure of some of my relationships, as I wasn’t able to express myself, leading to their eventual disinterest. Recently I have been thinking about reaching out to the situationship guy in terms of friendship to help my brain switch and be able to show him the parts of myself I was too scared to reveal during our time together romantically. 

Does anyone have any advice/insight on how to get over this?

There 's this girl ,whose friends have been bugging me for HALF AN YEAR to ask out ,and we recently went out ,but in a friend group , definitely not a date. We went along perfect - she watches anime ,plays videogames ,and is kind of a loner - A FEMALE VERSION OF MYSELF. I instantly regretted not asking her out way earlier. Nevertheless ,we talk the whole day and night about things in common. It came time to say goodbye. I caught feelings ,like she is the cutest little thing. But here comes the shaky part. During all this time ,we hadnt followed each other on Instagram ,because ,again ,I am a secretive guy and i guess she didnt want to give herself out ,despit her friends literally telling me she likes me. So I shoot her a request and it has been 2 days and going that she havent accepted it yet. Is she doing this on purpose to play with my head? Her bestest best friend has told me the girl liked me multiple times and the girl herself has asked me out but in an uncomfortable time for me.

After around a month I asked her to be my girlfriend and she said yes! I knew from the beginning there was somethin special about this girl. 

We have an almost electric chemistry and as a bonus shes drop dead gorgeous to the point it took a long time for her to convince me she actually liked me for real. She is so far out of my league its unreal although she convinced me thats not the case il always feel like that to some degree as shes the type of girl who could have any man they wanted. 

The issue is that being single for so long and also just being a bit slow sometimes I say or write insensitive things and she gets upset. It's not her being easily offended it's me not thinking before I act. Every time this happens I'm convinced she is gonna leave me and go into full blown panic mode. I've tried to convince her I love her and want to be together forever but sometimes my actions and words doesnt match this mindset. 

I just wanna stop saying the wrong thing and make her feel secure but keep putting my foot in it. I'm not known for my sensitive nature but need to fix up so I dont fuck it all up.

I think astrology is legitimately a scam no matter what way you spin it to me. I believe in astronomy and facts. However, based on my hours of research, I really just think astrology is a way for people to excuse/reason their shitty behaviors and judge people instantly. Just another way for charlatans  to make some profit, ultimately. It's almost the equivalent of people who judge other people for the types of phones that they use or other shallow shit. Also seems like there's too many people with severe mental illness into this, based on my encounters. I can't seem to find any MALES online with this sentiment to date yet.

I have never online dated but the amount of men who seem to be interested in astrology who are millennials..is a turn off. I don't want to let it influence me if I do end up online dating.

Now, he's very close to them. They all go out to dinner or eat dinner together at home often. I work over night so it's hard for me to get a lot of time with him, and my schedule is not set. He works normal hours in the morning to evening 4 days a week.

My issue is becoming that he has like...dates with them. They go out for drinks, dinner, and then they go home and play a game or something.

Recently, his roommate's bf left to go visit his parents out of state, and his gf stayed here...with my boyfriend. I don't even care about that; they live together and I'm very confident that he's faithful and that he's really only into me. But I feel like he does ""dates"" with her without truly realizing it, and it's bothering me.

After the bf left, my man and her apparently had a paint and sip night....and he never specified that it was only with her. I think because after it happened, be realized it was going to bother me, and tried to cover it up. But I thought about it and I knew that her bf had left a day before my bf had the ""paint night"".

It's not like I think he's cheating on me. I feel like he isn't prioritizing me as his girlfriend and his partner. I know we haven't been together for *that long* and they've been friends for a few years, but, we haven't even done stuff like that. I just feel like it's pushing boundaries.

I feel disrespected by both of them, tbh, because as a woman she should know that it's odd to have a drink and paint with someone else's boyfriend while they're at work.

82,n8qb4a,1620602504,I like my girlfriend but I'm not in love with her yet.,"I (21M) have been dating my girlfriend (22F) for 2ish months now, it will be three in exactly two weeks.  I'm conflicted because I've never had a proper long term girlfriend before so I don't really have any experience to base this situation off of.  I will admit, adjusting to having one has been a little weird and at times uncomfortable to me, as I am somewhat of an introvert and value my free time.  Also, I'm an avid musician so I like to spend a lot of time making music, which I have had to sacrifice a bit because of the relationship, so that is defiantly new.  

That said, I enjoy spending time with her forsure, and she's like ""perfect on paper"" if you could call it that.  I legitimately do not find any problems with her.  She's funny, incredddiibly caring, sweet, really pretty, smart, artistic, witty, we are into a lot of the same things, and all my family and friends love her.  We have fun when we our together, we can chill, watch tv/play video games, or just talk for awhile and enjoy it.  Doesn't have to be anything extravagant all the time.

With all that being said, I can honestly say I am not love with this girl.  It frustrates me as I'm not sure why.  I've felt waayyy stronger feelings for a girl that treated me like shit,  a girl that I was never even with, and one that I only new for like a month and a half but I was manic as fuck and it was a bit chaotic (separated bc we went to diff schools) .  Like this girl checks all the boxes, she's dope as fuck.  yet i can't seem to feel those feelings for her, at least not yet. 

Also, I was a virgin before we met, and we just recently had sex because I was working up to it.  I was really hoping that doing that would jumpstart some heavy feelings for me, but it sadly has not.  I feel dumb for thinking that would work, and if we do break up it seems like i basically used her for that which is awful, I don't want her to think that because I do care about her way more than just her body or the virginity thing.

&amp;#x200B;

Oh, and the big thing to mention is, so a little under a month of us dating she asked me if I'd ever been in love before, which I said no (I've felt really strong feelings like I said but I don't know if it ever truly was love).  She made a big distinction between being in love with someone and loving them.  She's had one long term BF before and a couple other longish relationships, so I was surprised when her answer was although she's loved people she's never been in love.

Then come a few weeks later, she tells me she's in love with me.  I know how hard it was for her to say that because she's not the best at communicating her feelings.  It's really awesome to me to know that I make someone feel that happy, but at the same time I've been scared because I know I don't feel the same way, and it still hasn't happened yet. I know she deserves someone who loves her and I want to be that, but I just haven't felt it yet. (FYI I did not say I love her back and she was okay with that)

To make it just a little more complicated, she just graduated this year and has to find a city to get a job / live in for the immediate future.  She was definitely thinking about moving to a different state before me, but now she says that she's been looking for some good jobs around my city, which she never really visited before me ( we go to different colleges).  I'm worried she might be doing it just for me, even though we've talked about this and she said I am definitely not the only factor, she does like the city, has a few friends here, and there's some good jobs around here for her.  I don't want her to move here and then we break up and she's like well fuck.  but I do want to keep trying. 

So my real question is, how long is long enough before I should be in love with her, if it is to ever happen?  I want to keep trying with this girl, but I don't want to give her less than she deserves / fuck her life up, she's wonderful and deserves the best.

I'm going to talk to her in a few days, I don't know exactly what I'm going to say yet, but its been on my mind so much I know I need to say something.  Any help is much appreciated and if you made it this far thanks for reading this lengthy post.

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR**:  My first long term girlfriend is awesome, but after 2.5 months I'm still not in love with her yet, but she is with me.  How long is too long before its just not going to happen?  Am I being an asshole for staying with her and trying?  I want to keep trying to see if I do because she's legit awesome as fuck, but I don't want to give her less than she deserves and waste her time.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n8qb4a/i_like_my_girlfriend_but_im_not_in_love_with_her/

I was mad and well I made another snap account to confront him. He messaged me saying “You’re not my type, it’s me. I’m sorry.” Then blocked me again. It’s been 5 days and we’ll I just don’t get it. I instantly assumed maybe I said something wrong but I feel like the excuse he gave me makes no sense bc if someone was not your type then why have sex with them?!

91,n8r9rq,1620605706,I’m burnt out.,"If you’re reading this beyond the title - here we go. 

I took time after my last serious relationship to heal. Focused on therapy and even had my fun with a few causal dates. 

It wasn’t Until I met someone I can see myself getting serious with. I will not go into detail- it was simply a learning experience that left me very confused and hurt. 

Ultimately, I decided to take time off from dating for about 4 months. I took the time to focus on making friends and learning new hobbies. 

One night I found myself on a dating app. My first red flag (from myself) was I knew I wasn’t ready to date. I still needed to complete a list of goals I had written. 

But the loneliness got to me and I found myself talking to someone I instantly connected with. It was only 2 weeks and 2 dates. 

The second red flag should have been how I let it consumed me. Or how I lost myself into something that was eventually going to end. 

That ended this Friday. For the last 2 days I’ve been a mess. In bed. Feeling so sorry for myself. I can’t even pinpoint why. I know her and I were not compatible. I know it’s for the best. It still hurts tho. 

Now I see myself going into my old habits. It scares me to think that maybe people do not change. I’m back to looking for casual sex to avoid getting hurt. I’m back to drinking more to avoid dealing with my feelings. And I’m becoming isolated again. 

Please don’t let be you. You’ll know when you’re ready to date again and when you should take a step back from it. 

Dating isn’t rocket science. Dating is supposed to be fun. If it’s not, take a step back. If it feels confusing and complicated, take a step back. You’ll know when it feels right.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n8r9rq/im_burnt_out/

i just came to this place to scream into the void here to feel better, so i don't really know how to put this without coming off just straight up pathetic. It's just that i would be happier if i could not have crushes on people anymore. I am not unattractive but somehow, the only people i can attract are guys that either fetishize me or those that just want to eff me for a night and act like they are interested in me to get what they want. Whenever i crush on someone, i mostly do so because they make some kind of contact first. (at that note: respect to all guys that muster up the courage to talk to women, i could never do that and i salute you!!!) I don't crush on people often because I'm really shy and have all these negative experiences from the past creep up on me, but i try to give it a fresh start when I end up being interested in someone. Yet it never gets anywhere.  I even considered to be self-sabotaging myself, but when I'm interested in someone i try my best to let the other person know, i even slide into their DMs and try initiating a conversation once or twice, but apparantly i still pick the ones that are not interested in me despite making contact first. So if i could wish for one thing, it would be to not get crushes anymore because they end up hurting me more than i would like them to. My friends always tell me that i come off as ""dreamgirl"" but the problem might be that i ""don't look like i need someone"", and it's true that i live a fulfilled life chasing my dream at university nowadays, but I guess the problem is deeper anyway.

94,n8rkhz,1620606672,Thoughts on Improving Oneself,"One of the recurring complaints guys seem to have is the lack of matches in OLD. It sucks, not gonna lie. That being said, the most common advice given is to focus and improve on yourself. That is simultaneously great advice and horseshit. Horseshit because it's too vague to be of any help, but also great for a little bit more of a nuanced reason. I think it's meant as a way to remind yourself of what you can control. Hear me out. **You cannot and will not ever control who is attracted to you.** That being said, there *are* things in your control. ""Working on yourself"" is always such a vague piece of advice, but being in better shape will be more attractive to more people. Having a hobby/passion is something that you can control that will make you more attractive. Dressing better is something that you can control, too. You cannot ever fully control the outcome, but you can control the input. That's just part of the risk, so to speak. Nothing is ever guaranteed.

And before you say ""but I've worked on myself and there's nothing left to improve"". Bullshit. There's always something new to learn. You can save up and travel. You can try a different hobby. Everything you do doesn't have to be related to dating, either. Even then, maybe improvement comes in the form of learning to be ok alone and with your thoughts, or having a better outlook on life. Neither are easy skills to learn. The lack of matches can get to your head and sometimes you just need to step away for a bit and come back at it with a clear mind. Don't be afraid to ask for help or talk to a therapist, too.

To start, i was involved with someone for just over a year and we met through work. In the beginning, i was 100% percent interested in her and wanted to see where things could go. But after some time, i realized i wasn’t ready to be in a serious relationship and i made her aware of that many times. We continued to see each other and remained intimate. For the record, i didn’t have any other women i was interested in nor was anyone else in the picture which i reassured her of that. At the beginning of the year, she stopped reaching out which i didn’t blame her for. I didn’t want to waste her time or prohibit her from getting what she truly wanted. I cared a lot for this person, but i didn’t feel like i could give everything i had to her without being secure within myself. I have my master’s, a good job, financially stable but i had my own shit to work through which i also made her aware of. I think the reason why i couldn’t full commit is because eventually she wanted marriage and kids and i knew there would be some pressure to give her that. A few months go by and we stopped speaking as i said. I reached out not too long ago to see if i did something wrong for her to stop speaking to me. Long story short, she is seeing someone else. Since i found this out it hasn’t sat well with me and it’s been killing me inside. Maybe i cared more for her than i thought or maybe i realized i let something good go.
