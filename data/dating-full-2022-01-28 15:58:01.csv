I‚Äôve never considered myself a short guy but that changed when I started dating and seeing how most girls wouldn‚Äôt give my the time of day since I‚Äôm under 6‚Äô. Barefoot in 5‚Äô8, 5‚Äô9.

So when I saw I got more matches online when I put 6‚Äô (and life is typically better socially if you‚Äôre taller) on my profiles I decided to buy some insoles that boost height. I bought two inches which brought me up to 5‚Äô11, and when I put on shoes I got to an even 6‚Äô. I pretty much wore the insoles whenever I was in public with women I was interested and with people. By the time I had to take my shoes off in front of them they didn‚Äôt notice.

So I met my girlfriend through Tinder 2 and a half years ago. She is 5‚Äô3. We met went on a few dates really vibed, and not here we are. I‚Äôve of course have been barefoot in front of her and she‚Äôs never said anything, I assumed she saw but didn‚Äôt care So last week I was filing out a medical form why she was sitting next to me. I guess she glanced over and saw it because she asked why I put my height as 5‚Äô9 when I‚Äôm 6‚Äô.

I asked if she was being serious. She said she was. I told her that I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9. She didn‚Äôt believe me. She said that I‚Äôve been 6‚Äô since we‚Äôve met. I told her that I usually wear insoles to give myself a boost in height. I brought out the insoles and showed her the difference. She has literally never been able to tell because she‚Äôs so short that everyone seems talk to her.

She then proceeded to get pissed off at me. She told me that I lied to get to get her to date me. She said that she wouldn‚Äôt have dated me if I had advertised that I was shorter than 6‚Äô. I told her that my height shouldn‚Äôt matter 2 years later, especially since she couldn‚Äôt tell the difference. She told me that I tricked her and had been lying to her for 2.

I'm  a guy (18) going to school. About 1 year and 1 few months ago I met  this girl (14). We exchanged numbers and are writing messages since  then. I wasn't interested in her at the beginning. However, a few months  ago I started thinking that she is actually cute and I could imagine  going out with her, but I wasn't brave enough to say something. I still  think that she likes me because she's still very giggly when we see each  other.

I sometimes ask myself if  I'm just pretending to like her. However, I was thinking about asking  her out. I have read many blogs and articles between the relationships  of a 14 and 18 year old and often they end badly. That's why I want to  try my best. I don't know if it's too cringy to just go to her and ask  her: ""Hey I really like you, wanna go out sometime?"" - but I don't know  how to ask her else, since we don't have any activities or so in common  (probably because of the age gap).

Now, it may be true that you're more likely to succeed, however, this advice ignores a very important part that is arguably why many guys cold approach in the first place, and that is because the risk of negative outcomes is higher in a warm approach.

To explain further, if a guy creeps out a woman cold approaching, that sucks, but is ultimately not consequential. It's unlikely she knows anyone he knows, and in the small chance she does, it's unlikely they will make the connection that it's him. However, if a guy creeps out someone he knows, then it's over for him in that group. Any future interaction with her will be tainted by the fact he did that. If she tells anyone else about him, they're likely to view him with suspicion, and confirmation bias may cause them to find actions he does that would normally be innocuous to be seen as creepy. Any time a woman joins the group, everyone will have to warn her about him. At worst, he might get banned from the group or will be unable to show his face around there.

To put it in simpler terms, if success is a fulfilling conversation, a date, or more, and failure is rejection, cold approach may have a lower chance of success and a higher chance of failure, and warm approach may have a higher chance of success and a lower chance of failure, but warm approach ALSO has a chance that should not be ignored of CRITICAL failure.

Though we go to the same classes, she has a completely different friends circle and I have like 2 friends out 150 students :)

So, We don't/can't talk in college often and We only text to communicate because her parents are so strict that hour long calls are forbidden and she can't go out with guys.

 I can't stop thinking about her and she revealed she can't too.. I think I'd feel better if I see her she, go on dates with her, at least once a week. I need some reddit wisdom guys hit me with it :')

I‚Äôm in my late 20‚Äôs and I‚Äôve had a lot of relationships, most serious (or with the intent to be serious). I‚Äôve been in a few long distance relationships, all of which started in person and then life got in the way. I don‚Äôt seek out LDRs, but I do have a habit of getting back with exes or past flings later in life after we no longer live in the same place. I dated two of my exes more than once, for example. I give a lot of chances for people who I feel like I connect with.


At the start of the pandemic back in 2020, I started talking to an old flame who lived on the other side of the country and completely fell in love over the phone. And then after about a year it didn‚Äôt work out, for reasons unrelated to the distance. It was devastating. Then I dated in person in my city during the pandemic and had some short relationships, but I didn‚Äôt feel like I truly connected with anyone. One of these short relationships ended badly in November with something that brought up a lot of childhood trauma. 


Basically, like clockwork, as soon as it was over, a different old flame came back into my life. Virtually. They live several hours away. After my most recent doomed relationship with the person I met here in my city, the thought of dating in person and regularly dealing with someone truly freaks me out. So I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing now with this ‚Äúnew‚Äù thing with my old fling who doesn‚Äôt even live here. I thought it was just a fun flirty thing, but now I‚Äôve become aware that they are back on dating apps and it feels like a matter of time before I watch them get into a real relationship. with someone who actually lives there. And that‚Äôs really depressing to me. We haven‚Äôt talked about our feelings or done anything sexual but it seems clear to me that we like each other.


I have good friends, a good support system, lots of hobbies that I‚Äôm obsessed with, and a solid job. But instead of a real relationship, there‚Äôs something comforting about a phone relationship. I know it‚Äôs just a shell of the real thing, but sometimes it‚Äôs so hard just to have good conversation with people when there‚Äôs sex, other people, so many other things going on when you‚Äôre with someone in person.

The other day I started writing stuff about dating mindset/inner-game on my phone. 

It turned into quite a big list.

All of this has helped me level up my inner game over the years and hopefully, it can help you do the same. You may not agree with all of it, which is fine. Maybe just copy/paste the ones you agree with into your phone and repeat them to yourself on a date.

**Anyway, here it is...**

* It's not up to me to convince her to like me.
* I don't make demands. I extend invitations.
* I lead the dance but with a soft grip.
* I'm there to explore her and the chemistry between us and see where it leads. On a date, I let chemistry be my guide, not my ego.
* At most, I desire her. I want her. I don't need her.
* I only want women who want me back. I don't waste time with closed doors. Ever.
* I prioritise being authentic. If there isn't a connection when I am being authentic and genuine then it's ultimately best for both of us.
* I am never afraid to express my desire for her through touch, eye contact or even direct words of affirmation. My desire for her is just valid as her desire to say yes or no. 
* Our desires are not a choice so we need not judge or shame theirs or our own. Each and every desire is valid. Whether it's a desire to gag her with my cock. Stroke her hair. Ask for my feet to be massaged or to cuddle and be told I am okay. All is accepted. Nothing is off the table.
* I am direct and honest about my intentions. I don't over-share, apologise or justify ... but I am always real.
* She needs trust and safety in order to open up to me. If she doesn't feel safe with me, I won't push.
* I allow for the possibility of rejection. I don't shy away from it to try to minimise the risk of it. I get my NO from her, not from my own mind.
* On a date, I allow the ebb and flow of emotional/sexual energy...  
*Sometimes deep. Sometimes shallow.*   
*Sometimes playful. Sometimes serious.*   
*Sometimes horny. Sometimes platonic.*   
*Sometimes fast. Sometimes slow.*   
*Sometimes chatty. Sometimes quiet.*   
*Sometimes close. Sometimes spacious.*  

* However it wishes to manifest, I allow.
* I am not afraid to reveal my darkness and my pain to her. The real and raw nature of my life and myself. If she leaves, then she's saved us both time. Thank you.
* If I don't like the conversation, I will take it where I want it to go.
* I see a date as a co-creation. We both want to enjoy ourselves and each other. We want the same thing. Intimacy, passion, love and connection. We are fundamentally on the same team.
* I accept her wholly and completely just as she is. Her madness. Her quirks. Her imperfections. Her hiccups. With me, she is safe beyond words. I show her through my presence that every fibre of her being, I accept. There is nothing she could show me that would cause me to turn away. She is perfect just as she is.
* She wants to be desired (if that desire is genuine and she feels safe). Beauty needs a witness. I am that. I'm not afraid to tell her what I see.
* The more attracted I am to her the better. I do not shy away from women who turn me on. I pursue them directly. My desire for her is a gift and a sign from the universe. I do not suppress it.
* The language of the body is the authority. My body tells me if I want her or not. If I should pursue or not. I remain connected to my body when I am around her. First and foremost.

**---**

Hope this helps in some way. Some of it probably reads like some Zan Perrion bullshit but honestly, this stuff comes from the heart. 

Dating is not a game. IMO it's way deeper and more beautiful than that.

Thanks men.

I thought I'd share how I feel, as it might be relevant to some of you..

So I've been going through some emotional shit this past year(s). I've struggled with anxiety and depression, got out of a very long relationship that was going nowhere, got diagnosed with ADHD (at 35, no less), and also decided to move back to my home country and rethink my life.

After a long, long time not being able to even bear the simplest kind social interaction, last October I began to feel the need for intimacy and companionship again. I've been on dating apps since then. I met a few people with whom I just didn't click, and also a few people who were great for sexting and talking, but it just didn't go into anything serious.

Not long ago I met a lovely person, with whom i connected emotionally, intellectually and (even though we didn't actually meet in person) we also seem to match sexually. We texted all the time for weeks, videocalled daily, and fell asleep texting each other every night. We lived only a couple of hours away from each other, and were planning to meet in person in a few weeks. The problem was that, as our feelings grew deeper, all my social anxiety, insecurities, and overall mental self-fuckery (which had been mostly under control in the past few months) sort of woke up, and it ended up blowing up on my face. Suddenly the want for intimacy and the need to have someone to talk to everyday became something that I just couldn't handle emotionally. I literally wanted to, but my body was reacting like I was asking it to walk over molten lava. It got so bad that I ended up blocking and ghosting her, because I just couldn't face dealing with explaining how I felt. After a few days later, and after talking with my therapist and getting a bit better, I managed to reach out to her again, apologize, explain the whole thing, and end things the right way. It just not fair to anyone making them care for you and felt cared by you, if that is not something that you can actually continue doing. Luckily she understood (I hope) that it had nothing to do with her, and that it was all me.

My point is‚Ä¶ It has been very had to acknowledge that as much as I want to be with someone, and as lonely as most nights get, I am simply not well enough yet to actually be with someone. It's like my brain is divided in two voices: one asks me to reach out and meet someone, the other voice asks me to pull a blanket over my head and not talk to anyone.

So anyways, if you are going through something similar, hang in there.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1155461,public,self,"The difference between wanting to be with someone, and being able to be",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sf3enp/the_difference_between_wanting_to_be_with_someone/,no_ads,0,,,,,

I've used dating apps on and off for years, and while I've gone on fun dates and had a few relationships from them, by far the biggest problem I've run into (other than the usual flaky people or ghosting) is someone using old pictures 

Let's be clear - there's nothing wrong if you're a certain size or shape. But it's very wrong if you use older pictures when you were a different weight and deceive others into thinking that's what you look like now. I can't tell you how many times I agree to meet up with someone, only to get to our date and find out they don't actually look like what's on their profile. I'm not sure I have the words to describe how embarrassing it is, and how trapped you feel because it seems like a dick move to just leave

This has happened to me more times than I can even count, and it happened again tonight. Had matched with a girl on Bumble yesterday evening and we'd been messaging back and forth. We agreed to do a video call tonight as an icebreaker. I called, and what do I find out? Her pictures are old. And it instantly killed any chemistry there might have been between us

I don't understand why people do this - if you're insecure about how you look now, sure, I get it, but what are you expecting to happen when the person meets up with you and finds out the truth? That they'll look past the fact that they were lied to and fall for your personality?

Thankfully, the video/connection glitched at some point, and that gave me an easy out, but Christ - I'm 33, and the people I swipe/match with are in their late twenties/early thirties, and I hoped this would stop being a thing as I got older. But not at all

It started out great. I woke up and he had put sticky notes all over the mirrors telling me how amazing I am and how much he loves me. 

Then a little later we started talking about our careers (we're both actors) and he said all good actors can do a lot of accents, so I jokingly said ""I can't, am I not a good actor?"" He straight up said no.. and that kind of upset me because I'm a lot further along in my career than he is in his and I've had four years worth of classes. We got into an argument over it and he started saying that he thinks I'm amazing, but when he said I'm ""not good"" he meant that I'm not perfect and no one is. He said I should have known what he meant, even though he literally just said ""no, you're not good."" 

That eventually blew off and we started talking about money and how I'm stressed. I dance (strip) and make around $1,200-$3,000 a week depending, but he doesn't have a job and I pay for his child support ($600/month), weed, alcohol, and try to get him everything he wants. I do this because my job is extremely flexible and I can't think of one he could get that would be as flexible. He does do all of the cleaning, cooking, etc for me though. However, I'm the only one with a license so I have to do all of the driving and we travel to different states a lot for filming. He has offered to get a job in his defense, but he's also told me many times he prefers it this way and also I'd have to drive him to and from work. Anyway, I do admit I'm expensive and buy hair extensions for $250 every four months, lip injections for $500 once a year, contacts for $130 every 6 months, and I get my hair done for around $150 a month.. but now that I'm adding that up it really doesn't seem like a lot considering how much I make, that most of it isn't every single month, and how much I spend on him. He said that I need to learn to make sacrifices and that made me very mad because make great money, it's just that I spend so much on him. He started saying that I wouldn't be able to survive on my own either with all that I want. I told him I'd be find if I didn't have to pay for all of his stuff and he said ""I'll give it all up for you! I'll I'll give up my weed, which is like my medicine (because he's mildly autistic) in order to make you happy!"" But he's said that before and never actually given anything up. He said I've always been spoiled and I don't know what the real world is like. 

Then he said I didn't have to worry about him anymore and started packing up his stuff. I started crying my eyes out but I told him to do what's best for him. 

We eventually calmed down and everything seemed okay, but somehow the conversation got back to how I care about what he thinks of me and he said that I shouldn't and he isn't going to think good things 24/7. I told him that's fine, but it matters to me that my partner thinks that I'm a good person, I'm pretty, and I'm a good actor since that's my career. I told him someone not thinking that is fine and that doesn't mean I think they're a bad person, but I'd rather be with someone who thinks all of those things. He said ""well I guess you'll never find anyone else if I die if you need all of that."" 

That upset me because I know that wouldn't be hard for me to find. I am a good actor and have had many years of training and projects, plus I get told that I'm good all the time by coaches, other actors, and just random people. I know I'm conventionally attractive. I'm not absolutely flawless, but I've always had guys chasing me my entire life and I make pretty much the most money at the club I work at. And I also know I'm a good person even though I have my flaws. 

He started saying that people only compliment me so much to get in my pants and when he said pants he grabbed me and I took his hand and swiftly/forcefully moved it away. He got mad and said he should be allowed to touch me whenever he wants since he's going to marry me, but something about him touching me whole angry just rubbed me the wrong way. I took my ring off and said we're just not good together and he grabbed my fingers extremely hard and said ""you're not f****** leaving me b***."" 

Then I went into the other room and eventually he said that I need to stop listening to what he says when he's mad and he doesn't mean any of it. I said it hurts and it confuses me. He told me that I'm just as bad constantly asking questions for reassurance and ""messing with an autistic guy's mind"" but the main reason I need reassurance is because when he says things like that when he's mad it confuses me and I'm left not knowing what he really thinks of me. I do ask a lot of questions though. I asked him if he could stop saying mean things when he's mad and he said he has anger issues and he does that so he won't physically hurt me and asked me which I'd rather have. I said neither and he said that I need to compromise some.

He posts on Instagram often but not like all the time, maybe a few times a month.

He has also posted a few stories but I refuse to watch them or like anything. Do you think this has anything to do with me or is he just scouting more chicks?

She has never lived on her own in her life and her parents do a lot of things for her such as cook and buy groceries. Her mom is a housewife so she has a lot of time to do things. I dont like Ohio at all because of the cold weather and lack of opportunities. Currently, I live in the South and love it a lot but would give a lot up to be with her (would have to move back and be in Ohio the rest of my life). The fact she is not independent worries me because I dont know how long I can wait for her to grow as I continue to go back and forth from state to state to see if this works. She also has not given me a set timeline because she does not feel our relationship is stable enough to give me one (we have been on and off for 3 years). I told her that I, not really a fan of her parents spoiling her at her age and the fact I have to go over her parents house when I visit her. She immediately says I hate her parents which isnt true I just like privacy (she told her parents I said this later). I dont know what to do with this because I feel like I am too old to wait but at the same time she is very sweet, thoughtful, gorgeous and our chemistry is great. What would you do in my situation?
