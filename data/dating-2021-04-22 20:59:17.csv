3,mwl31i,1619144591,He knows all about my mental health issues before even having a first date? Do I stand a chance?,"I \[25/F\] met this man \[32/M\] I'm really interested in in a very unusual and unexpected way. He has a PhD and is conducting a research study on depression. I was a participant with depression in this study. As I came in for sessions over the course of two weeks we started having nice conversations and getting to know each other. He would text me about books and articles we had discussed and told me to he wanted to hear my thoughts on them. Toward the end of the study I started noticing (what I think was?) flirty banter between us. It was subtle but he was doing his job in a professional work setting. (He asked me questions about my life, remembered things I told him, he seemed nervous around me, playfulness and teasing, etc). After the last session he texted me about a café we talked about and said ""I don't how your schedule is after your exams but if it's free let me know, I wouldn't mind going again. :)""

So basically here I stand. He is obviously very aware that I have depression and he will probably now be reading all the very thorough surveys I filled out about all the very intimate details of my depression. (How awkward?!) I'm not even fully sure if I got the right message about him being interested. Maybe he just sees me as a friend or something? I have self doubt...I wonder what would such a smart, highly educated man would want with me? I am currently an undergraduate studying a field similar to his but still...I am nowhere on his intellectual field. What do I do now? Do I have a chance or will he probably read about my issues and be turned off? Do I just wait for him to get back to me about that café thing or do I say something now? Please help give me some insight! THANK YOU.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mwl31i/he_knows_all_about_my_mental_health_issues_before/

6,mwl6yi,1619144926,Did I [24f] ruin things with him [32m]?,"I won’t give the entire backstory but a month ago I started dating a guy I met on a dating app. He immediately asked me out for a drink and we quickly hit it off. We met up 3 times in that first week. He was sweet, held my hand, hugged me really tight, it felt amazing. Fast forward to about 2 weeks ago, I went to his house and we were about to have sex and he asked if I was a virgin and I said yes so he stopped, concerned about me getting too attached, which upset me. We spoke about it a bit the next day. Then that following day, I went back to his house and we ended up having sex. He came a little quickly, seemed a bit frustrated about it but he made me finish through other means. I text him when I got home and he said he enjoyed having me over. 

The next day he texts me, saying he was glad that I came over the day prior and I said me too &amp; that I hope we could do it again soon and he said “I’m sure we will” with the kissy emoji. Then I didn’t hear from him for a few days, so I text him and he didn’t respond for nearly a day. He answered my question and that was it. Then I text him the next day asking about his recent vaccine, and again he took almost an entire day to respond, and I asked if he wanted to get a drink that night and he said he’s working long hours so he can’t but he thinks the hours will change soon. 

I (regrettably) say I understand and that it was just weird that I hadn’t heard from him much since we had sex. He responded that he was just trying to catch up on sleep when he could, and that “we’ll get that drink sometime”. I responded “I understand, my anxiety just screws with me sometimes. I hope you get some rest”. That was about 3 days ago and I haven’t heard from him since. 

So tell me, did I ruin it by sounding so insecure? Or was it already ruined? It didn’t feel like he only wanted sex, he could have tried to much earlier but stopped at heavy touching.

7,mwlai9,1619145238,Need advice getting into the game as a 30M,"Hello everyone, I'm looking for advice on some things I should look out for/things to do to make sure I am successful dating as a 30+ year old man. I'll be 30 in a couple of months I know that hitting that milestone of 30 definitely changes everything. I just want to make sure that I'm doing all I can to set myself up for success. I've also been thinking about my goals and what I want to accomplish with dating, as I really view it as an avenue for personal development and knowing myself better.

I've been taking stock of what I bring to the table, so my strengths and weaknesses. As for strengths, I'd definitely say I have height on my side, I'm 6'1"" and I'm relatively built at a lean and muscular 200 lbs. I can say I'm relatively well-spoken, I did tend to be a bit verbose in the past because of anxiety, but I am doing my best every day to minimize that. I make a decent income, nothing crazy - I bring in 75k from my regular line of work and I'll probably net an extra 20k from side projects, so maybe around 95k. I am relatively self-disciplined, which makes following through on things easier than not. I also don't do drugs or drink too much. Overall,I think I have a high growth potential as a person but it will take time to hit it, which may not even be till my 40s.

Now my weaknesses, which are many, haha. I have/had terrible social anxiety as an adolescent/young adult. I've sort of grown out of over the past couple of years by personal development and increasing my self-esteem/self-efficacy but it's still there especially with attractive women. I don't have much dating experience. I hooked up a few times in college and afterwards in my early to mid 20s but I've never had a girlfriend. I know I'll be competing with guys who have much more dating experience and the women I'll be seeing will have had boyfriends and such, so I know I don't have a lot of room for error there. And also I unfortunately still live with my mom, though I plan on moving out soon. My 20s were not kind to me financially and I did my best to pay off my debt while living here. It was good I was able to support her financially and most importantly, emotionally - but it did not help my social or dating life.

I have a few timelines in my head as of where I'd like things to be at certain ages. I did eventually want to start a family but I know time is not on my side. I was wondering if it's good to just have a sort of hookup/casual dating phase just to ""get my feet wet"" so to speak and then start looking for ""marriage material"" or just go ahead and start dating with the intention for a LTR. I'm just trying to think of the most effective way to maximize my time and effort doing it.

So yeah, I'm just looking for advice so by the time quarantine is over, I'll be locked and loaded ready to just go for it.

I don’t have the time to give to someone for an a relationship rn but I want some male company.

I get to know them and then if there’s a bit of a spark, I’ll sway it to something a bit more sexual. I want to regularly sext someone. I’ve been successful but I end up wanting and expecting more. The conversation switches to a regular one and I see myself smiling at my screen (what am I even doing?!). I’m checking my notifications too, eagerly waiting for a NORMAL response.

I see myself getting attached, normally by that point we’d be exclusively dating. I do the only logical thing an call it all off because I start to like them. I’m honestly too sensitive.

Now I’ve tried to not get to know any details about the guy before hand. I went straight to the sexual part. I wanted to know if it was something he wanted too so I waited to see how he reacted. He responded well and still kept things respectful. My issue is now I don’t want to talk to him like at all.

*And I'm a terrible fisherman*

...in the sense you have to Hook (via your profile/face); drop a Line (get conversation flowing); and Sink it/Reel them in (get a number, date organized).

I'd say I'm a 6 on the arbitrary scale of 10, maybe a 7 on a good day. Very much the average guy. I can get the odd match 2-3 times a week but I am struggling with the Line part. (Yes-- I'm sticking with the fishing analogy)

I never send anything crass or sexual. I don't not put effort into it either with something like: ""Hi"", ""Hey, how's it going?"". I will pick something in a bio; comment something reasonably funny about a picture; or, if there's nothing to work with, ask a random question about something totally unique.

Usually met with silence (which is kinda normal for an average guy). Or simply an un-match. I gave a nice compliment yesterday and immediately was gone, haha.

Do women not appreciate being approached gently? With respect and dignity? Because it doesn't seem to work for me! I honestly lack the wit for one liners; I shudder at the idea of making puns from someone's name; and I am too well raised to be rude/sexual to a stranger.

19,mwm8rm,1619148376,feeling like im failing as a woman.,"I feel like im failing as a woman. Im in my early early 20s and ive been single my whole life. Ive only really casually dated one guy I met through a dating app when I gave up trying to meet people in real life (also due to the pandemic) and it was a terrible experience. I didnt realize he was sleeping with other people and despite being such a horndog ( he also watches quite a lot of porn) it seems like I was the only girl he couldn’t get hard for. It was a bit strange because he was the one who sexually pursued me pretty agressively and he assured me it wasn’t me, but I didnt understand because hes clearly not having this problem with other girls. That was also my only sexual experience ever so it was a huge blow to the ego. I ended it with him a while back because I was trying to be understanding with his problem but I didnt realize he was sleeping with other people.  Then shortly after that started talking to/ dating ( we didnt even kiss so im not sure if I can say we were ""dating"") another guy. He was so sweet and messaged me every day and we went on some really fun dates.  I was so excited talking to him, he was one of the most attractive guys ive ever talked to, but he ghosted me after a month. He didnt even do a slow fade, it was just consistent communication for a month and then disappeared. He’s the only guy ive honestly straight up cried for. Ive talked to plenty of people ( by talked I mean online or maybe one date but nothing after that)  and had feelings for them but never cried after a talking stage. My dating experience has been really conflicting. I can get dates, but nothing ever comes out of it. The most that ive done was with one person who couldn’t even get it up. I thought I was a decent looking girl and had no reason to believe I was ugly,   but my self esteem has taken a huge hit with dating and I’m kind of a little terrified of starting again because I'm not sure I can take feeling so unwanted by another person. I feel so strange embracing my sexuality due to this because I feel like I just dont have any sexual appeal and it would be extremely cringe to wear lingerie or initiate sex or post sexy photos online. I know dating requires thick skin, but I feel that it's still fairly easy for most women my age. You dont neccesarily feel sexually unattractive and after a few bad apples, it tends to work itself out. I’m not sure why I have such different experiences from most girls. Ive never been able to relate to being approached or asked out in person that really very very rarely happens for me and online dating has been a garbage fire for me. Since I started dating last year, ive seen so many guys ive talked to get in and out of several relationships. I’m always suprised at how easy it is for most people to find someone, I genuinely have a hard time finding someone I like that also reciprocates.

This girl (20) and i (m 22)  have been texting for a couple weeks now, super flirty at first, said all the right things about wanting to meet up, even said she wanted to take a “nap” with me. 

However she’s been super flakey about meeting up, keeps saying she’s busy cause of school work etc. Said she was “busy” this Saturday and working Sunday but that she’s not working next Saturday. At the advice of my friend, I did not reply to her for almost 24 hours, after which I replied how I was sooo “busy” and that she should hit me up the next day. 

Hilariously, she plays the same game, waiting exactly 24 hours to hit back! We talk back and forth, she asks what I’m doing I say chilling in bed, wish she was there with me, to which she responds she wishes she was and to “invite” her. She says how drunk she is and I say “next Saturday. U and me. We’re gonna get RIPPED hahahaha” to which she replay “hahahaha yes I wanna” 

See a pattern here? All the right things being said but I still feel like she adds the “I wanna” in there cause she’s still not all in. Despite saying she’s off. Why can’t she ever just give a straight up yes?? 

Met a girl at the yankees game last night, took a pic with her and put it on my IG story to make her jealous earlier today. She saw it but didn’t unfollow or anything.

What do you guys think about this whole  situation?? Does it sound like she’s gonna meet up next week?? Why does she say how excited she is to meet and all this sexual flirty shit and then push it off??

We talk everyday, but live in different cities 4 hours apart. We've met twice, the second time we met in a city halfway between us, we hooked up, and it definitely felt like a pretty romantic weekend. I don't know what to feel, we know so much about each others lives, so it feels like were more than friends. We both don't have any immediate plans to move closer I don't think. I might get a job soon in my city, and he has a successful career in his city. We've actually never really talked about our feelings for each other, just kinda been really great friends who talk on the phone/text everyday, and have hooked up once. I'm scared to admit my feelings for him because I feel like the might be unrequited, and on top of that, I just don't know how realistic a long distance relationship with no end goal for at least the next year would be. It's definitely had somewhat of an effect on my mental health, like when he say's he's hanging out with another guy. I really want to see him again, but he hasn't really invited me to his city, and I'm scared to invite him to mine. I don't really know how to text him that I'd like to see him in person again. I don't see where this relationship is going, and it honestly makes me depressed to think about. I don't want to talk about it with him, just because I don't want whatever our relationship is to end.

I’ve noticed a trend lately of younger women identifying as bisexual, and desiring to be involved with other women sexually and romantically- at a rate that far outpaces that of men. Of course, if women are dating other women, then... who exactly will date men? I feel like this trend will make dating significantly harder for straight men, as there will be less women in the dating pool, and much more competitors.

I’ve never had a girlfriend and am still a virgin, and it’s super discouraging to get back into dating given how inexperienced I am compared to everyone else. It seems like all my peers have been in at least one relationship and it’s unfortunate I haven’t had that learning experience yet.

For one, women don’t like inexperienced guys and that’s a fact. How can I deal with this pressure and stay motivated knowing the odds are stacked against me while I’m already down.

Second, this is more of an internal problem, but how can I get over the fact that my first girlfriend will likely have a much higher body count than me? I know one’s past shouldn’t matter, but I don’t want to commit and have my first relationship be my last with someone whose already experienced it all before me.

I just feel mentally stuck and unmotivated cause of all this. And yes, I’ve been focusing on myself and self improvement. I have for years. I’m doing well in school, graduating with a full time almost 6 figure salary out of undergrad, pretty fit, etc. I’m not being arrogant; I’m just trying to show that time spent on myself is all I’ve ever known.

38,mwnuru,1619154296,"Hi everyone, I need some advice regarding a girl I was seeing and would like your thoughts.","# Hi people, I just have a question regarding a girl who I was seeing and wanted your thoughts.

I am just after a women's point of view. Any help would be much appreciated. I hope its okay that I am posting this in here, but I have done so as I see this sub is a very friendly and non-judgemental place. Most subs are full of sexist men and women, but this seems like a really supportive place.

I (26m) recently started talking to a girl (23f) a few months ago, and I really started to like her, and I honestly think she's pretty great, which is unusual for me, as I seem to meet a lot of fake people, and this person was very real and genuine I feel. I am naturally a very confident, nice and happy person, but unfortunately around that same time I started to become very anxious (unrelated to her) which made it really hard for me to communicate with her. I would often think the convo was going badly, when in reality it was going fine or quite well. This sucks as over the last year I was (extremely confident) and worked on myself so I wouldn't be nervous.

Anyway, we had met a couple of times, and it was all going smoothly, but on this date, I acted very nervous and acted out like a boy, rather than a confident calm man that I usually am. It pissed me off as I could tell the date didn't go as well as it could have (or as they usually would with me). We didn't talk for the next 2 weeks, however I hit her up, and was surprised she replied. She said she is going out with her friends to an event, and I said I would come. However unfortunately the day of I started to get quite nervous again, and didn't want to be nervous around her again, as that's not who I am, and not who I want people to get to know me as. I messaged a friend of hers who was also going, who is a good friend of mine, and said I couldn't come, but I didn't say anything to the girl I was interested in... I said nothing... Nothing at all. I don't know why, for the first time in my life I just didn't know what to do. I am a bloody man for christ sake. That was a month ago.

At the time I thought to myself: ""I will just go away for the time being, get myself back to my normal self, get myself right, and then talk to her, and everything will be fine."" But now that I am not so nervous anymore, I am starting to see that what I did was 'ghosting'. Like why would anyone want to talk to someone later on down the track, who ghosted them? Thats just rude and immature to ghost someone... But I wasn't trying to be that way. She is a really happy, relaxed and normal person, and those are great qualities and the things I like about her.

I knew IF it was to ever work, I needed to be a confident person again.

She hasn't contacted me since, but I think that's because what I did was technically rude? When it wasn't meant in any malice. She also hasn't unfollowed me on socials, so I can't tell if I am just overreacting or not.

Also I think another bad thing is, I was nervous so I put her on a pedestal.

So my questions are:

\- Could what I did be seen as ghosting? Or am I just overreacting?

\- Am I better off contacting her now and explaining the situation? (""I wasn't deliberately ghosting, I am not like that, I was just in a tough spot, and trying to do the right thing long term."").

\- Or should I just leave it for the time being until I am fully confident and message her then? (Or is that worse, as instead of ""ghosting"" for a short period, its more like 6 months or something.)

\- What do I say, do I just be totally honest?

I am very interested in her, but just feel like I am not ready yet.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated! Thanks so much everyone, you're all amazing!

39,mwnx8e,1619154585,Still can’t move on,"Three years ago I stumbled upon photos of another girl on my bf’s tablet. I never confronted him until a couple months later and when I finally did, he blocked her - I assume to make me ‘happy’. However that didn’t stop him. He continued to hide his phone and made me so paranoid to a point I felt crazy. It was a very hard and confusing time as he had made such an effort moving to my country to be with me, and that didn’t stop him from doing what he did. Not to mention the girl knew I was in the picture, she knew he was living with me, she didn’t give two shits though as long as she was showing off her body for some sort of attention or validation (it was very obvious she wasn’t really into him when I saw their conversations). 
I never confronted her and she had every possibility to message me and let me know what he was saying behind my back to her. She would flirt and send him inappropriate snaps that he would somehow save that I eventually found in a vault app. 
There’s a lot more information that I don’t feel comfortable sharing, but three years on I am still with him. Every single day I still think about it. Everyday I remember the pain, the hurt, the confusion and I am still over analyzing everything; trying to fit the puzzle pieces as to why he felt the need to be obsessed with her when at the same time he was saying loving things to me. 
Don’t get me wrong, I love him to the moon and back and the past year and a half he took it upon himself to change and be committed to me and only me. He has really proven himself, he makes it clear he loves and only wants me, However, I still can’t stop thinking about it. I wish I could get some sort of closure but when I want to bring it up I just can’t, or he’ll change the subject. I feel so alone trying to deal with this and I know I should be over it by now. 

I just needed to vent, it’s been a very horrible mental health night.

40,mwo40s,1619155333,I finally confronted and deleted the serial dater.,"I 23 f  broke up with my ex in December of this year. After a month I deceived to get on tinder and weigh my options I found a guy I thought was fairly cute and had the same interests in me. He wasn't expecting anything I told him that I'm not ready for a relationship but if I'm putting time and energy into someone I'd rather it be serious. I did hook up on the first date which was a mistake. We hooked up and hung out for hours once a week. We had an amazing time went out for dates and I let him know I deleted tinder and he wasn't seeing anyone. 


Eventually I started telling him that I want to have a talk about us 4 months in when I started to feel ready for a relationship. He said he wanted casual I was disappointed but I didn't have feelings for him (didn't let myself get connected) after he said he wanted casual he said he wanted to break it off saying that he has already had 5 girls fall from him this past year and during these faux-relationships. I call them that because these ""fwb"" don't normally go on dates to fancy places or act like they're exclusive or anything. He mentioned that he wanted to get serious with someone he actually liked and get them flowers, treat them like a princess.. 

I told him if he has hurt 5 girls this past year he has a major problem. Yet he blamed the girls saying they don't communicate. He said he didn't do anything wrong since the girls weren't mad at him and he shouldn't have to date someone he doesn't like. I told him that you don't have to but dating them basically exclusively for 2 months is leading them on and hurts girls. He got extremely defensive and basically stated he didn't care about hurting them and that's their issue not his. Then he blocked me!

42,mwo65v,1619155566,First crush need advice,"Hi I'm Ryan. So until a few weeks ago I thought that I was Asexual because I had never had a crush on anyone before. Keep in mind I am in the 10th grade so I thought that if I was anything other than asexual then I would have felt something by then. Anyway though I have released that this is not the case. From what I can tell so far I am actually straight. 

     So a few weeks ago me and my friends who I will call Ben, Chloe, and Tyler all went to see Godzilla vs Kong. Ben i had seen somewhat recently but Chloe and Tyler it had been a while due to COVID-19. Lets just say I was excited to see them. 

     Me and Chloe got along really well. We had just gotten back in touch a few months earlier when we found each other on Discord. When I walked into the theater Chloe was already there. We chatted a bit and I was really starting to notice that she was actually very cute. I had never thought of her as anything but a friend before hand.  When Ben and Tyler got there with the tickets they asked who wanted to sit by who. Chloe immediately yelled ""Im sitting by Ryan."" Ben then handed us our tickets. I sat in between Ben and Chloe.

     There where some moments where I could hardly watch the movie because I just couldn't get her off my mind, but was mostly able to enjoy the movie. After a scene jammed packed with action she randomly high fived me. During the final battle Ben was upset at us because of how crazy excited by the action we were.

     After the movie ended and we all got out of our seat and were about to walk towards the exit I felt a tap on my shoulder. It was Chloe. She then hugged me and I hugged her back. We went out to the lobby where her mom was waiting to pick her up. Her mom agreed to take a photo of the 4 of us. Chloe put her arm around me. Now i wanted to do the same but I didn't want to make it obvious that I liked her so I also put my other arm around Ben. As Chloe was about to go the two of us hugged one more time. No she didn't hug anyone else.

     That night the four of us hoped on a discord call. Tyler greeted the 3 of us with a simple ""Whats up Ben, Whats up Love Birds"" Both of us were pretty pissed off at what he said. We both denied that we were dating (which we aren't) and denied that we liked each other in that way. Me and Chloe can talk for like hours if we are aloud to. We once spoke for 8 hours of the day. I am realizing that I like this girl and that I want to be with her. 

     I know it may pretty obvious that she likes me back with the hugging and insisting that she sits by me, but I am too afraid to tell her how I feel because of that 2% chance that she only likes me as a friend and that I that I will make things awkward between us. The two of us are very close and have similar interests and like the exact same personality. Another friend of ours named Elliot has a joke were he says we are ether soulmates or we were separated at birth and I can confirm that it is not the ladder.

Like I really appreciate that he wants to show me off, it makes me feel good, I've never had someone do that so much for me, but I wonder why he doesn't want to spend time alone with me? Is that a red flag? When we do spend time alone together, he is nervous and weird. He is confident with his friends, he introduces me to all of them, but in private he gets subdued. Do I bore him?

44,mwobj1,1619156131,Not sure about dating heavily overweight women,"I feel really shallow even broaching this topic, but it's giving me some concern so I am unclear on what to do.

Being overweight (or even obese) is not unattractive to me. I value people's bodies are secondary to their personality. However, I find myself shying away from obese women because I am concerned that our lifestyles will not line up.

I spent most of my adult life cruising around 300 lbs, and at 5'11"" that made me medically obese. I have a number of health issues and it took a LOT of effort to learn how to manage them. After a few years of struggle I dropped 100 lbs and am now active 5-6 days per week. It's still a daily challenge to make the right food choices since I have a lot of medically-necessary dietary restrictions.

Given my own weight issues, I feel very hypocritical saying this but I'm hesitant to date obese women; I'm afraid it will cause me to slip back onto old habits. Obviously this would be my fault and not theirs. I'm also making assumptions about their lifestyle based on how they look, and that feels... unfair at best. I do not believe people are defined by their weight, nor do I see it as a reflection of their values. Nevertheless, I find myself avoiding obese women (overweight is fine). Am I being shallow? Is this hypocritical?

Thought we could maybe continue chatting and getting to know some more about eachother in person.  She said maybe, as far as I'm concerned a maybe usually means no.

Decided to ask why match and chat on a dating app if you don't necessarily want to go on a date. Or like why not just say no.  She said it's a vetting process to filter out ""creeps"" or the impatient ones who just want to get laid...what is so creepy or impatient about being proactive and asking someone for a simple drink/coffee date after multiple days of talking?

Am I nuts for wanting to go on a date after multiple days of chatting on a dating app? Can someone please give some insight into what this could mean? Am I the weird one?

46,mwopfg,1619157701,Physically Ill 38F about status of my dating relationship with 40M,"I've been seeing this guy. Things were going quite well until about a week ago, when he went off the grid for a few days....for very legitimate reasons. He told me what was going on (personal, family things) I have no reason to suspect otherwise.

He re-surfaced a few days later, but without the same rapport and vibe that we had prior to his break. But, we were still in communication, I just took it that he would probably just need some time to return to ""normal"" after a likely emotionally taxing few days.

I mentioned to him yesterday that we needed to get together. So, he asked me how my schedule was for Friday. I told him. I was hoping to see him today, actually, but I was fine to wait till Friday if that was what would work for his schedule. We didn't make plans for Friday, but continued to talk.

So, then, late afternoon, he suggests that we could go out tonight instead. Which that's what I was hoping for yes, but I would have been hoping for a little bit more notice. He mentioned that he would need for it to be an early night due to lack of sleep the night before. Well, by the time I could have gotten showered, ready, etc., I didn't really want to have a quickie date and be rushed and him be tired and so on. I'd rather just wait till tomorrow, when he would feel fresh, we'd have more time, and so on. So, I told him no, that he should get some rest, I made up something about me feeling kind of tired too so he wouldn't feel bad; he was very disappointed. At one point he says to me, ""After all that, you don't want to go out after all?"" Which isn't what I said. He kept insisting he would be fine, but he understood.

So, finally, before I go to bed, I ask him when he works tomorrow, what his plans are....he then tells me that he probably won't be able to see me tomorrow. He won't know till in the morning, but he probably had a lot of work to catch up on. And, he has plans tomorrow evening.

Just the fact that....he has the opportunity to see me, and doesn't want to.....well, that's what led to the physical reaction of being sick to my stomach. I haven't felt like that since my ex-bf broke up with me 2 years ago. It's the first time I've really cried....really, really cried....over this guy.

But on the other hand hookups may leave me feeling empty, and FWB has the risk of getting my feelings hurt and catching feelings eventually.

I’d say that I maybe want someone who’s into me for more than just my body, we share mutual feelings for each other and spend time, without him just wanting me for my body, and just enjoying that time without the pressure of any relationship and just seeing where it goes?

So I now believe shes just dragging this for nothing but attention and after all this time I was willing to speak on good terms and fix our issues and misunderstandings but she wanted me to initiate which I was not willing to but I made an attempt after this huge gap and have emailed her on both IDs of her but I knew it , She bloody enjoys this approach of mine to fill her ego hence its been 2 days since she hasn't accepted my invitation so I think her last chance is finally gone.

This proves her intentions are nothing but a huge load of vengeance she desires or am I wrong or should I permanently block her for life and finish the last way of communication or should I wait another 24 hours even though I wanted to express my feelings to her but this is above my capacity now kindly suggest.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mwpj88/i_was_wrong_to_fix_this_and_now_im_just_tired/

53,mwq6me,1619164262,"My mother keeps projecting her dating values and opinions on me, which affects me emotionally. What to do?","
My mom met my dad at 19 and they were each other’s firsts. They had never dated anybody else. 

My parents are also pretty old fashioned, I’m the total opposite of that. They see intimacy, kissing and everything as an enormously huge thing and are scared of hookup culture.

I was chatting with my mom and she basically said I (F21) shouldn’t worry about sexual experiences or anything and that she hopes “I’ll find a good man and get married and have a good life”. I agree, but when talking about sex, she projected her own values  **that I should only have sex with a guy I could imagine having children with**.

I disagree with almost everything she says, and you could say, that’s it, we just have different opinions. But i’ve always been a people pleaser and it drives me crazy that I’m do something opposite from what she would want me to do and it ruins the moment for me. 

I want to live life how I want but her projected values are always in the back of my head and kind of ruin the whole moment when I’m e.g. being intimate with a guy I’ve known for a few weeks. I know she would be absolutely shocked about that but I’m it’s my body and my values.

I wasn’t expecting to feel so broken up about it but I do anyways. I put quite a bit of time into this boy and for him to not even give me a heads up or let me know that things were different is killing me.

65,mwri0y,1619170366,Is anyone else bored of their dates having massive ego’s because of their social media following?,"Hi all - this might be a bit of a niche post but I’ve dated a few girls now that have had anywhere from 10k - 800k followers on Instagram. Their accounts have been based on a number of things from fitness to comedy to cooking. 

All of these girls have been so focused on constantly reminding me about their social media presence. I understand they are proud at being successful at something, it’s a part of their life and at first it’s great to see someone driven at building something but when they mention it everyday it slowly becomes a “look how great I am” thing and gets very tiring as it dominates their conversations.

I’ve picked up another commonality with these people that they seem to think everyone likes them or finds them attractive because strangers on the internet find them engaging and they x thousand likes on their posts or they get x thousand of DMs from people trying to slide in, when in reality they are a little bland/basic (subjective to my perception).

Maybe this is a venting post rather than a question but I’m pretty sick of the value people place on magic internet points and the fact they’d rather constantly boast about it to stroke their own egos vs. have a different conversation.

67,mwrstb,1619171751,Going on a date with a girl with A disability,"Okay, so I’ve never like airing my issues or anything personal about romance. But I kind of need to get this off my chest. 

I recently went on a date with a girl with a tick issue, could be Terrets I don’t know she was in the middle of being diagnosed. To explain met on a dating app. We hit it off because I was being my natural autistic self this is not a pun either. I am on the spectrum, but that I feel only plays a little into this issue. 

So anyway we were talking for about a month. We talked about a lot from sex, to politics to viewpoints, personal stuff. we even started snap chatting each other every day. We were planning our date out and everything because time related issues we couldn’t meet up. I was always double checking and triple checking with her on things because well I’m a strong built person and while she was the same height as me I could easily lift her. She knew I worked out and stuff and I am of the opinion that girls should be given the comfort of safety before anything else during the date.Then she told me some news that was kinda a kick in the dick. 

There was another guy she was talking to for a while and thought nothing was going to happen but she told him about me and he got jealous and so our date was to test the waters to see which guy she wanted to go with. She never had this happen before is what she told me. So when We finally we worked up the courage to go on this date for Chinese. Me being autistic dumb ass was uncomfortable giving physical touch to someone who wanted a hug who I technically just met face to face for the first time. So I was hesitant for giving a hug. We couldn’t go into the restaurant cause COVID. So we ate in her car. It’s important to note she was having ticks this whole time but I didn’t care. That’s not the issue that bothered me. Because to me everyone has baggage, but I was too entranced by her to care.

I ordered basically finger food because I was too nervous to even eat. (Being my first date in years)while she ordered rice and noodles. At this point the date was going fine we laughed and talked and it was going good from my perspective. 

But when we had to eat in her car she from what I could tell was getting upset because she couldn’t pick up her food. Because she didn’t have a table. Which made her tick more. 

So I took initiative and hand fed her. Now before someone says I babied her or something she didn’t mind she thought it was sweet actually even telling me this. After a few dozen bites that felt like they took forever to get down for her and her being nervous we went bowling.

We drove my car which I thought was messy due to me having to replace parts etc. but her car felt the exact same in cleanliness if not just a little more clean than mine. We listened to her music my suggestion because I wanted her to be as comfortable as possible.

She was actually really good at bowling, way better than me and I cheered and supported her the whole time. Even during her ticks and kept ensuring her I was having a good time and didn’t care about the ticks. 

She then ordered a large lemonade drink that she then kept trying to pour on herself but not the the extreme as was in her car.

After 3 games we drove back to her car we left at the restaurant and sat and talked for 2 hours.

During those 2 hours she started to have worse and worse ticks again this time trying to pour her drink all over herself so I took her drink and held it for while she drank from a straw.

I held her hand because that’s what I thought I would want if I was in her shoes and told her that I didn’t care about her issues or any of that. I told her if we worked out I would be there for her even if what ever she had was worse than what the doctors thought. 

I did that for a while and made circles with my thumb because that’s what I do when I’m nervous. When I felt she was uncomfortable I let go immediately as soon as I realized it. 

I complimented her on her ticks every time she started to feel embarrassed or scared and said I enjoyed them because it was well her. I don’t know where I messed up at really. I did comment on a few of her ticks sarcastically but not in like jabs or making fun of her. I even told her that and tried to make myself as clear as possible.

We talked about random stuff a little more she then left, I walked her to her car gave her a good night hug because that’s what she wanted. Then we parted ways.

Regardless she chose the other guy that Sunday night over me. Our date was just that Friday... and I told her I wasn’t going to fight for her attention and stuff because that was her choice and said the other guy must have been special. I was willing to fight for her heart but when the lady makes her mind up I won’t fight it. So She left me thinking about her and thinking what could have been and I’ve been having a rough couple weeks since then.

But I caring on, even when it feels like for every step I take. It’s two backwards as well.

Sorry for any misspellings, or grammar I work nights so I get scatter brained. I tried to retell everything that happened as best I could to my memory and tried to be clear with my actions. Because I really don’t know how to feel about this whole thing or if I’m at fault any for my actions. 

TL;DR: went on a date with a girl with a neurological issue, she had ticks and spasm that led to me having to hand feed her, and kind of reinsure her it was okay. I tried to make her feel as comfortable as possible and watched my actions because I didn’t want to make a wrong impression. I even reinstated this through vocal questions asking her if it was okay. Because I rather not get “me too moved” by accident for mis interpreting a social queue for being autistic spazz.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mwrstb/going_on_a_date_with_a_girl_with_a_disability/

If it’s usually negative; such as a breakup, you have a right to feel bitter about that from being wronged. If you have felt unrequited feelings more times than you can count even if you’ve lowered expectations, you have a right to be bitter about that.

Stop looking down on people for feeling genuine human emotions. We are all human. Feeling certain emotions like jealousy from time to time doesn’t make someone a psychopath.

Sometimes heading straight towards bitterness is the only way to heal and let go. It serves its purpose so stop treating it like people are bad people for feeling the emotion.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mwrup4/stop_criticising_people_for_feeling_bitter_during/

Anyway, I recently thought my luck was finally changing as I’ve finally had a girl accept to go out to dinner with me, personally I thought it went well and it didn’t seem like she obviously disliked me so I was like hey maybe I finally gotta chance. So after that I hit her up a couple days later asking if she wanted to hang out again, she said she was busy so I said what about that weekend and same thing so I just said eh maybe she’s just actually busy. A few days ago, since I had not had any communication with her beside me asking her out again like aforementioned and playin a game on iMessage, I asked if she was tryna FaceTime, and today marks the third day I’m left on delivered.

74,mwsowd,1619175528,A few pieces of Enlightenment!,"Its been a few weeks since I joined this sub. As far as I have seen, most of the questions revolve around same things. Some are exhausted of trying on online dating apps, or not finding a good partner, or having a bad dating experience in general.

Here are a few pieces of enlightenment:

* **Why so desperate?**: I have seen many posts of 16-20 yr old school/college kids fed up or their dating life. There's enough time for all of you to find a partner. Life has just started. So relax. ***Don't go hunting for your partner***. Good girls/boys aren't going to finish. It's not a limited sale!! 
* **Go Slow**: Most of the bad experiences are because of non-compatibility. And then I see posts asking for advice for a person you like but have met only once/twice. Slow down! Let things grow naturally. It takes time to know a person - what's their goal, their outlook for various things. Once you know a person, then you love a person! And lesser the chance of having a bad experience.
* **Friend-circle**: Sometimes you don't need a relationship, but a person to talk to. So, have a group of friends (not just social media connections) who know you and you can talk to them about anything. They'll know what's good for you if you are ever confused. When you have friends to share things, most of the negatives in life go away.

89,mwvp0u,1619185821,If anyone here is in a situation where they feel there's something they need to address with another person(such as the other person losing interest in them) - Honestly talk to them about it! Not your friends! Not to the internet!!,"  
So this is something that I really want to stress. Sometimes we like to vent on reddit or to friends, strangers whoever about an issue we have with our partner or someone we have gone on a few dates with.  Yet a lot of the time we fail to have an open and honest communication with the person themselves. I wanted to share two experiences I've had where honest communication( that has either been initiated by me or the other person in the scenario) has really helped me and the other party move forward.

  
A few years ago I met a girl on tinder who i really liked. We spoke almost everyday for a fourth months and eventually we went on a few really awesome dates. At one stage, thinks were really good between us, we would message non-stop, she planned one date herself and she even told me she wanted a relationship with me. But then after a while and a few more dates, things would begin to fade out from her side of things. She would take days to respond to my texts(whilst I saw she was posting other stuff on social media), when she would respond she would become very dry and not ask me any questions back and she bailed on a date once. During this whole fade out period my anxiety levels went through the roof, because I felt left in the dark and didn't know what to do next.   


At first I tried to 'play it cool' and act like I didn't care. But the longer things progressed; the worst thing's got for me, I struggled to sleep and eat, I was coming to work late. I was venting to my best friend non-stop. I was making posts on reddit about this. And it wasn't until someone suggested that I should tell this girl how I was actually feeling that really got to me. Eventually, I summoned the courage to message this person. I told her it was awesome to have met her, I reassured her that  I was cool with the idea of her not being interested in me anymore, and that she could always feel comfortable telling me how she really felt about me. It was through having an honest conversation with them, that I was able to figure out how she was actually feeling. Whilst I still regret to this day, not having a conversation with her about it earlier (when I first felt there feelings began to fade out), I feel like that gave both of us a chance to move on, and we were able to remain friends.    


Now about a month ago I faced a similar situation with another person but this time roles were reversed. I knew someone for 3 weeks and we we had a first date that was nice - but I just didn't feel that she was right for me. After our date they were texting me and I was struggling to communicate to them that I didn't see them in a romantic way. I made a lame excuse that I was 'busy with study'(something I'm not proud of) when they asked if i was free one week. I was scared to hurt them because I did like them as a friend. And then they send me a similar message letting me know that they felt anxious and insecure in figuring whether I felt I wanted to see them again; and they would prefer to just have an honest conversation with me about this. So I ended up telling them how i was actually feeling and that I wish I told her the truth straightaway, and we ended up sincerely ending things .  


Thanks for listening to my vent everyone. Offcourse, there are times when I think we should move on rather than addressing an honestly an issue with someone. No ones anyone a full explanation of how they are feeling. And we should always be mindful about the other persons perspective and their side of the story .  But to conclude if their is an issue that is continuously on our mind about another person, i think we should always address this issue with them in an open and honest manner if we believe it is necessary to.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mwvp0u/if_anyone_here_is_in_a_situation_where_they_feel/

92,mww9p1,1619187453,question about a girl I've breifly dated,"Hi, I'm 19(M) and I'm wanting some advice on what to do with my 18(f) ""friend"". I put friends in quotations because I don't even know what our relationship is anymore. To give some back story a couple of months ago I and (f) became closer with both having an interest in each other and eventually, I asked her out. She sounded really up for the idea but as soon as I planned some dates.... she found excuses as to not to. I eventually confronted her about this and she said that she really doesn't want a relationship as she's not ready and apologized for leading me on and wanted to stay friends. I was cool with that until recently I've noticed some weird behavior. First of all, I can tell she is still nervous when texting me with many awkward phrases in texts as well as in person. We don't even talk at social gatherings and it just gets really awkward unless we are in private talking. She also has brought up the topic of sex in the past couple of times I've talked with her and its really throwing me for a loop things like ""This guy wanted to hook up with me at a party"" and even divulging the fact that one of the friends in our friend group asked if she wanted to hook up. But the biggest thing she said happened yesterday when she started talking about how she really wanted to fuck some guy at a party. This topic occurred randomly in a car and it was very weird. She kept going on about how he looked like he could fuck good and ect. She then mentioned how she shouldn't really be talking about this since I had a crush on her. Awkwardness followed. My thing is I'm finally getting over her and wanting a normal friendship but these incidences are kind of reopening a wound I have. So my question is: Is she trying to say something to me? My gut is telling me something is up and I honestly have no clue what. Is she playing games? Using me for attention? Idk.I'm really tired of this and don't need this in my life. I asked myself if all the stars aligned and she wanted to get back to dating I would do it within a heartbeat. I understand this is not the case but maybe I'm still holding on to something I need to let go of. Or there is more to this story. Let me know what you think.- Thanks.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mww9p1/question_about_a_girl_ive_breifly_dated/
93,mwwazm,1619187556,"Texting pattern changed, it doesn't feel good","So, I (23F) decided to start using Tinder about a month ago, met someone there who seemed cool, had lots of things in common and he put effort into his messages, they were long and thoughtful. We talk about meeting in person next month.

But lately I've noticed things have changed, like he just responds with one word texts or emojis. He doesn't put any effort into the conversation like he did before. I thought, well he's not interested and kind of stopped talking to him, but when I do that he texts me again asking me how am I doing and sending memes and so on. Then he does the same thing again, sends one word replies.

We talk again about meeting in person and doing a call this next week, so I guess he's interested? 

I'm just confused, to be honest. Because he seems interested, but then he does that thing. 

I've been also trying to keep my options open, and kept talking to more people, but it feels wrong somehow. And it's exhausting... 

I'm a bit insecure, but I don't want to feel bad because someone I haven't even met has changed. How do you guys manage this?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mwwazm/texting_pattern_changed_it_doesnt_feel_good/
94,mwwbu6,1619187621,Rant on hookups,"20sF here. This could just be my experience but why is it so hard to find a good man to be in a casual relationship with. I thought it would be so much easier than looking for a real relationship but it seems to be just as hard. 

I don’t get why guys will match with you and ask you to come hang out at like 2am. Some guys act like they can’t hang out at reasonable times. Idk I just like to be prepared and plan ahead but these dudes expect you to come over on command.

Secondly, where do you find guys who aren’t complete trash in bed? Most of the guys I have hooked up with finish way too fast and they generally do not take their time with things. My drive over to your place should not be longer than the actual sex! I jus don’t see how guys even hookup with women if that’s all the effort they’re gonna give. 

Unfortunately, I try to go in optimistic when hooking up with guys but for the most part I am always let down. Do any women also feel the same? If so, how do y’all manage?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mwwbu6/rant_on_hookups/
95,mwwgzi,1619188022,Is it over now that I’m a kissless virgin at 22?,"M22 is it over for me? At this stage pretty much everyone has had sex/been in a relationship meanwhile I’ve only been on one date ever this year where nothing happened. I know for a fact girls hate any flaws in men, so being highly inexperienced is most likely a massive deal breaker for &gt;95% of them. I’m thinking of just hiring a hooker at this stage, it’s legal and safe where I live so why not? i don’t think I’m ugly or anything, I get told I look like Jonathan Byers from stranger things if that means anything.  

Expect I’m not as skinny, though if no woman has wanted to touch me after 22 years of being alive I probably am ugly and should just give up.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mwwgzi/is_it_over_now_that_im_a_kissless_virgin_at_22/

I broke up with my last girlfriend because we both went to different countries so I didn't want a long distance relationship. Now I got back in the dating scene and this pandemic hit, everything became centered around Tinder. I suck at Tinder, absolutely horrible at it but there's no other way. I'm honestly baffled on how bad I am at it, my pictures are alright and I'm quite confident I'm not a bad looking guy. But I get like 5 likes in total.
