She calls me somewhat often, 2-3 times over like 4 days most recently, and it seems two sided on the interest side. However, I fear my interest is romantic while hers is friendly.... 

Today we were playing leauge together and someone made a joke about us dating (a random, not a friend) and she didnt say anything negative about it, just basically that hes carrying me(shes new) but it was kinda left at that.

Ive been trying to come on too strong too fast, and so ive been trying to keep it tame for now but i couldn't help but notice...

She often calls me bro, b and bb. Im not really the greatest at recognizing this sort of thing, so ive swung by the reddit to ask...

She then typed and asked why I deleted them (I didn’t want to feel like a complete copy cat by always copying what she did) and I said “There’s reasons.. lol” trying to make it sound jokingly and flirty. I think she misinterpreted what I meant, because now she takes hours to respond and only sends wall pics. What do I do?

4,mlqk54,1617757277,"After years of trying to better myself and trying to put myself out there to date people, I think I’ve come to the conclusion that I’m just straight up not an attractive person","
Back in school I used to watch people entering their first romantic experience or two and I’d say to myself I had plenty of time left, it will happen to me before I leave school. Someone will come along. When I got to college I said to myself, ok, maybe not school, but everyone has some kind of experience in college, right? In college I watched people enjoying their time, fooling around, hooking up or meeting their first serious partner, and when the only couple of ‘experiences’ I had were 2 drunken make outs where both I, and the other girls involved, were too drunk to remember it, I told myself it’s fine; I have plenty of time left to meet new people. Someone will come along. Then I graduated. Then covid hit.

By the time the world starts to resume regularly scheduled programming I’ll be 23 and had no real sexual experience. And by this point you’re thinking this guy must be a neckbeard or hates women or some other shit like that, cause a lot of people I see commonly assume and joke that people around this point who haven’t done anything like that fall down that trap inevitably. And for me personally, it couldn’t be further from the truth. I’m introverted deep down but I don’t think you’d know it. When I’m around other people I seem really outgoing and pretty confident; people often tell me I’m one of the funniest people they know, or that I’m so kind, or whatever else. I have good friends of both sexes. I go out. I dress well to the point it gets complimented on. I work out. I read. I learn. I work. I have a degree. I try to be as kind as possible to people and hate starting fights. My friends laugh at me for being a massive progressive; I’m the furthest thing from an angry, bitter, woman-hating type. 

And I absolutely understand I’m not owed sex by anyone, but fuck man, making it this far living a normal life, and not even a drunken pass, a flirtation gone a little too far, not a single girl with feelings for me, never heard anyone tell me they like me that way, or they want me, or they’re even attracted to me or think I’m hot, every girl I’ve ever liked giving me a soft rejection, feeling almost sorry for me it seems like, and honestly it all builds up eventually. You end up feeling broken. Now I’m past the stage of my life where meeting new people comes easy, where you’re young and dumb and rush in to these things and make mistakes, people around me have found people, they’ve settled down, some even moved in together, some even fucking have kids, but at the very least, everyone I can think of that I’ve socialised with at all has had some kind of mutual romantic experience.

It hurts lmfao. And I’ve racked my brains trying to work out what to do. I’ve worked out, I’ve worked on my confidence, I’ve downloaded dating apps, I’ve made myself message people I’m interested in, I’ve tried to be more confident, I’ve become more social, etc. Still, it’s like I’m just not seen as a sexual being. Girls I’m friends with tell me I’m ‘cute’, meaning in the non-threatening, puppy-like, completely sexually unappealing way. You don’t want to have sex with things you go ‘awwwww’ at. I have no hard feelings about this at all, and it’s just one of those things, and I don’t get bitter about it, just kind of sad. 

There’s basically two possibilities in the end. Either It’s something internal, or it’s external. If it’s internal it has to be some personality thing I’m just not aware of or some part of it all I just can’t figure out. But I’m social enough. I’ve made lasting friends in my life. I go out all the time (well before all this I did), I put myself out there, sure I’m a little awkward or whatever, but I own it and people find me endearing. But what if I’m just some clumsy, overly nice, unthreatening, vanilla guy? Like everyone likes vanilla ice cream, nobody has anything against it, but because of that very nature nobody LOVES it. Nobody wants to spend their life with it, cause if you appeal to every common denominator, nobody finds anything in there to love. 

But I dunno about that. I know funny people, serious people, reserved people, loud people, shy people, people who are insecure, good dudes, bad dudes, guys who are interesting as fuck, guys who are fucking boring, anxious guys, weird guys, guys who everyone likes, etc., and these people find someone. It just happens. Something just works that has never even come close for me. The belief that I’m somehow, inherently, an unlovable person has made me try so hard to be better, to be well read, to work out, to educate myself on social issues, to try be funny, to be smart, to be kind, etc., it’s made me into a person I think is good, but somehow not good enough still.

So the thing I think it is is that I’m just plain, straight up, not externally attractive. I’m not someone any girl will ever look at and be attracted to. At least, not enough to actually want a relationship with or to go all the way with or whatever. I’m small. I’ve still got a baby face (where the ‘cuteness’ comes from). I’m ‘funny’ in a clumsy, dorky way. I wear glasses. Even if I work out a lot, I’m still just a ‘little dude’. One girl who’s 2 years younger than me that I’m friends with jokes about how she still sees me as her ‘little brother’ despite the age difference. I’m never gonna be the guy that a girl’s gonna look at and instantly want to be with. I‘ve always known that. 

But am I gonna have to make peace with the fact that nobody is ever gonna even want to see me in that way at all? The fact is some people just aren’t attractive. And that doesn’t mean I don’t put effort in; I have a good haircut, I’ve got good skin, I dress well, I have good hygiene, etc. But It’s a fact of life that someone who’s a 1 can’t ever make themselves a 5 or a 6, you know? No matter how hard you polish a turd, it’s a turd. And I’m not resentful of it. But at this point, after years of putting myself out there, bettering myself, watching people who have never thought this deeply about this or done any of the shit I’ve felt obliged to do just to be interesting enough to talk to get together with each other so easily, after watching my young, stupid years slip away from me and having absolutely nothing romantic happen, I’m kind of starting to think I need to accept it won’t happen. If I was remotely attractive, someone, surely, by this time, would have hinted at that, or reciprocated, or made that clear. 

I used to fall for people all the time, pretty hard, I got big crushes. Now I don’t really at all, it’s kind of like my brain’s given up, and I just don’t have it in me anymore to get my hopes up. I’ve been told to wait, that people can’t see why it doesn’t happen for me, that there’s nothing wrong with me, hell I’ve been called a liar a few times before for saying I’m a virgin, but at this point I think people are just being nice and they all just feel sorry for me cause they know people just don’t see me that way. And honestly, I’m truly starting to believe it too.

**TL;DR:** Spent years trying to look good, be more confident, be kind, be social, be interesting and put myself out there, but nobody is ever attracted to me in the slightest. After thinking it over time and again, trying to figure out what’s wrong, I’ve genuinely started to think, for a variety of reasons, that I’m just not an outwardly attractive person, and that it’s out of my control.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mlqk54/after_years_of_trying_to_better_myself_and_trying/

Adios fucker,"When I started going through puberty I started to not appreciate my penis very much. Uncircumcised. Oh no! A very noticeable pink dimple at the urethra that I used to think represented some kind of infection, pearly penile papules along the corona, and on the smaller side of normal. I got pantsed in high school once and earned the nickname “little goose.” Made me feel great.

Anyway, around the start of puberty I started to notice my raphe running from my ass all the way up my scrotum and onwards down the entire underside of my penis all the way to my urethra. It looked like a scar. I started to wonder if I was born hermaphroditic or something and they corrected me the wrong way and no one told me. I felt like I should have been a girl. My penis disgusted me. It seemed diseased and abnormal. I didn’t work up the nerve to show it to a woman until my 30s. Because I thought they would be grossed out by it. Think I was carrying an infection or something.

Well fuck my penis. I’m sick of it. It wasn’t quite all that bad but no one else has appreciated it either. It’s a worthless organ. Freud was insane about the penis envy thing. Wtf do women have to be envious about? No one values penises. Almost everybody sees them as gross in fact. And I’ve always seen mine as a defective, strange one. So where does that put me.

Same taste in music/movies, similar energies, we even have similar academic/professional interests, not to mention she's downright gorgeous. I've talked with her at a few events and we get along really well. I'm very interested in her.

Last week a group of us went out to dinner and another girl in the org came who's been very obviously into me for the last few weeks and who I'm definitely not interested in, we'll call her Miranda. A number of times throughout the night, Miranda would say things like ""oh yeah you told me about that"" or ""I was with you when that happened"" (things along that line, kind of implying that we were ""talking"" or more I guess), and stuck by me the whole night. From what I've been told by some of my female friends who were there I was being ""claimed"", which may intimidate Taylor or keep her from starting a talking phase or whatever you want to call it. I don't really notice or think about these things and didn't think much of it at the time, but now I'm worried that Taylor may have been warded off or something because she's seemed a little distant since then. 

I am very interested in Taylor and think that we really hit it off but I'm worried that this other girl who I am NOT interested in as anything more than a friend may have hurt or ruined my chances. My first instinct (as it is with any problem) is to address it directly and clear the air, but I don't think that's the right way to go especially since I met Taylor pretty recently.

Now my roommate is actively dating and I have no feelings of jealousy or envy towards him but my paranoid brain just told me ""what if he hits it off with her (assuming she's still single) and he brings her home one of these days?? How would you deal with the awkwardness?!""

31,mlt45m,1617765764,Lessons after being rejected 4 times by my crushes,"I was rejected by 4 different crushes and here are some of my takeaways.

&amp;#x200B;

**It is completely fine to be rejected**

I used to be super depressed when I was rejected by my first two crushes. It was literally heart wrenching and I couldn't even think straight but thank god in one way or another I managed to pull through all of that by my own. By the time I was rejected by my third crush I started to channel some of the depressive energy into improving myself and started to adopt a few healthy habits which helped me realize that I can actually be absolutely fine by my own. Those habits helped me get through the hard times and gave me the confidence that I will be able to dig myself out of any hole I find myself in. By the time I was rejected by my fourth crush I started to feel more of an apathetic indifference which ironically I found solace in. I realized that rejections are just another part of the journey being human and one more rejection wouldn't even harm me that much anymore.

**I am no God nor Saint**

I have this tendency to point out to people their mistakes or overlookings and try to tell them what is more correct. In my mind I am trying to help them but then to a general person who is not ready for help themselves, I'll come across as being insensitive.  This tendency magnifies itself whenever I have conversations with my crushes which can be a big turn off for them. Well, after being rejected so many times, I just think now that I'll not meddle with other's issue without them asking for help themselves. It feels sad watching someone unnecessarily suffer, I may be overdramatizing, but I think now that it is just inevitable that some people need to go through certain processes in life by themselves. If its meant to be its meant to be then.

**Rose colored glasses**

I think most of us guys easily put girls on a pedestal and it is normal for hormones and emotions to flood our minds and cloud out judgements. We suffer unnecessarily when we have an image of someone that is unreal in our heads. We think of them as perfect and we put unrealistic expectations on them. As Seneca once said ""We suffer more in imagination than in reality"", I think the best way to be real is to talk to the other person, to understand them well and to acknowledge the fact that none of us are perfect as humans. I had the opportunity to know my fourth crush well and I knew about some of her history that made her into who she is today. After thinking it through and literally making a list of pros and cons, I found out that she had a large burden to bear. She had trust issues with men who are interested in her, she has pretty low confidence in herself and she is generally emotionally scarred. Its all normal I know, we as humans have our own history and I am willing to help her on that if she was willing. Obviously things didn't work out and by realizing these facts, it helped me to somewhat make sense of what had happened.

&amp;#x200B;

I am not sure how my future will be, perhaps being rejected would be my destiny. But I know for sure that one way or another I will be fine and that things will straighten out eventually. I have the confidence and will come back stronger as always. To think of it, life's probably much more fun and interesting this way. Thank you for coming to my TED talk.

32,mltbia,1617766490,What do you think?,"I posted this on another sub, but curious what the answers here would be like too.

So I met a guy on Bumble and we had one date. The date went pretty well and I liked him enough. We also have had good conversations through text; however, life got busy, so we haven’t gone on a date in a while (couple of months). 

There are a few things that bother me. I like the guy, but over text, he mentioned two of his exes cheated on him. He mentioned this because he wanted to explain why he had to move home and is living with his family. I know shit happens, but this still raises alarm bells in my head and I also would prefer for a guy to be living on his own, at my age. Though I understand these things happen. 

The second thing that I don’t really like is that he has talked to his family about me. I mean, I’m flattered that he likes me that much, but I’m a very private person and it also takes me a while to warm up to someone. The other day, I saw one of his family members tried to add me on FB 👀, which is interesting considering he didn’t know my last name, so I thought. 

I’m really unsure how I feel about this guy. I know he is really into me, but it feels too much at this stage and I’m definitely not comfortable with his family’s level of interest with me. 

Idk. I’ve dated for a few years now, but have never encountered something like this. However, I really don’t have much experience in terms of the red flag department and I’m worried I’m overlooking them.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mltbia/what_do_you_think/

34,mltixi,1617767224,Does online dating portray people as something else? How do you move on from a bad experience?,"I’m 23 (f) and early last year I got tinder just for the ‘fun’ and met a boy. He told me basically everything I wanted to hear and lied about everything - I didn’t find out until 6months later after he asked me to be his girlfriend. As if these lies weren’t bad enough, he told me he was in love with his friend and had been for 2 years and that I wouldn’t compare to her. He only finally told me the truth a few weeks after I told him I was a Virgin. Basically he just wanted to use me for sex to get over her. I still hold a lot of anger towards him... think it’s because of old ‘rona   - been stuck in the house for a year straight and nothing exciting happening lol 

Also, my mum got cancer a few months after this all happened and life really sucked for a while. The cancer cause me to change a lot with my attitude to things and I don’t really cry at anything. I’m quite the stone wall now because I feel like I’ve heard the worst I could. 

I don’t want someone to tear down the shield I’ve built for myself by coming into my life with all these false promises just to lie and be gone like that boy did. If a boy broke my heart and something bad happened to my mum near the same time, I would simply not be able to deal with it. 

In hindsight, I know I wasn’t fully myself in any of my relationships and I now that I’m a bit older and I know what I value more. I am quite an independent person, I like going out and meeting friends etc but I really enjoy my alone time. 

But recently I feel lonely. I have to be so strong with all the cancer stuff and I don’t like to talk about it with anyone because I don’t think people will understand. I’m tired of talking about sickness with my family, we need a break from it so I hold it all in.  I need some support or something ? Idk exactly what ... I’m not expecting one person to do this or whatever but it would be nice to occasionally talk to someone I know is gonna be there and will just listen and of course I can listen to them and find out about someone else’s life and care for them...But I’ve got a bit of a fear of finding someone because it’s all fun and games at the start but always ends up being sh*t tbh  and all the breakup feels etc.. also with this whole situation I cannot take any games or playing with peoples emotions. 

Also, the whole virgin thing(I was brought up religiously) - when I was younger this stressed me out so much it’s actually hilarious. Society says we should do this and shouldn’t do that but thankfully I’m past that judgement of ‘you’re so weird’ and I do whatever the hell I want, but I do understand that it’s not typical of someone my age 

I know this is a whole rant but I need to let it out and I need some advice: 

How do you put your ‘flaws’ and the past aside and be ready? Do you just go for it and happen to be ready? Is meeting someone in person and not over online dating realistic for the foreseeable?

At some point, I started to have romantic feelings for her and I eventually told her how I feel. She told me she wasn't ready to date, and she told me I wasn't ready to date either, given that I still talk about my late girlfriend like she's still alive. She also said that if we dated and broke up, there was a very good chance she'd never talk to me again.

But, she didn't tell me she didn't like me like other girls have in the past. A part of me still thinks there is a chance while others tell me not to lose hope.

38,mlu3re,1617769363,"Electricity vs. Consistency, a lesson I hope I remember forever","I (30f) think I dodged a bullet today even though it felt very not good. An old fling reached out yesterday out of the blue and told me he really had feelings for me. It was surprising because, at the time, I liked him a lot but I thought he wasn’t very serious and kinda wrote him off. One day I just never heard from him again and I was upset but I got over it and continued to date. 

So, I was stunned by his revelation and honestly really happy. We texted a little bit about why we each felt like it didn’t work before. We made plans to see a movie tonight. I was so excited and nervous about it. 

We texted this morning and he tells me bad news he didn’t get movie tickets in time they’re sold out. I didn’t care about the movie. I suggested an alternative date. Then he tells me work is crazy and he’s not sure he’ll let me know.  I say okay, but I was really hurt and I knew I’d be waiting to hear from him for the rest of the night. 

This is where I did something I normally wouldn’t. All the sudden I remembered everything from before. I write him back and say you know what actually this is the problem we had before. You make a plan and then you flake. We aren’t at that level. I don’t really know you. Sure I like you but not enough to ignore this. He basically replies with a very lame sorry and an excuse about having poor time management skills but that he has good intentions. Good intentions pave the road to hell, my friend. Do better. Be better. He said sorry again and he would. I said okay call me when you do. In the meantime I’m out. He was clearly surprised by my response. Hell! I was too! 

I thought about this for the rest of the day. I felt bad for being so sharp. I felt bad for being mad. I’m normally not so pointed. I really hate it because I truly have never felt the way I do about him. Maybe it’s just chemistry but being with him was like nothing I’ve experienced before. But I’m looking for consistency and stability. He’s all talk and no action. 

A new guy I met recently texted me out of the blue tonight asking me to come over for banana pudding. Hell yes, sir. Be right over. We don’t have the same electricity, but he means what he says and does what he says. I think everything worked out fine. 

Ohh also, I looked online and the movie tickets were not sold out anywhere in town. So I think he lied to get out of going. Red Flag City. 

TLDR: Guy professed his feelings for me out of the blue. I reciprocated. He planned a date. He immediately flaked on said plan. I called him out. Told him to forget about all of it. Got invited by another guy to have a very wholesome spontaneous date reminding me that actions always speak louder than words.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mlu3re/electricity_vs_consistency_a_lesson_i_hope_i/

Not even in regards to covid,"I'm pretty sure i actually have some sort of undiagnosed social impairement, because holy fuck i don't understand all, or honestly any, of the artificial ritual and mind games of dating. There's so many expectations for you (me [men]) to just magically know what move to make in some bogus psychological chess game in the opening minutes... Hours... Days... Of dating, rather than just having organic and enjoyable social interactions and seeing where they go.

I don't know if I'm asking girls out too quickly or too slowly after meeting/matching them, if I'm getting familiar too quickly or slowly, if I'm getting flirty too quickly or slowly, but whichever direction i try to take it, I'm still wrong.

What really struck me about this is a video i just watched where a guy was basically catfishing girls ""for the lolz"", and he insisted on really goofy, artificial conversation ""tactics"" that made no sense to me and all should have been convo killers, but it kept working. Somehow throwing out fake half-formed thoughts and ignoring women was peaking their interest more than just trying to engage in straightforward mutually enjoyable conversation.

I don't even understand what's going on enough to articulate what it is i don't understand, all i know is I've been ghosted, stood up, or used for a free meal more times than i care to count and I'm just checked the fuck out. Which really sucks because I've been in love before, a few times in fact, and that mutual feeling is super dope!... Right up until the other person decides to sabotage it and throw it away...

One of the most confusing parts is that the only information I have as to why my dating life is in such a sorry state is because I'm tall (?) From what little i can gleam, being tall makes me theoretically more desirable, which is somehow making me less practically desirable (?) Because that makes sense somehow (?) And yet all the short fuckers i know meet women just fine (?)

Is anyone else as fucking exhausted as i am? Is there a cure for this? Some sort of introspection class i can take to force thoughts of romance and dating out of my mind? Aside from really missing how dope romance and love and stuff are, i also have a pretty high libido, so all these years of being single have been really frustrating, no matter how furiously and frequently i beat my meat to smithereens.

I literally don't have and cannot acquire the information to figure out where I'm going wrong in my dating ""strategy"", so just shutting out the dating world entirely seems like the only option.

It wouldn't be fair to me or the other person to even start that relationship.

So I have been using Bumble because it allows you to filter out people who want children. There are very, very few people in my area who fit that description unless they already have a child, and I'm not exactly looking to date someone who already has a child (I mean, that's the whole point of me choosing not to have one).

So... any advice? Any dating apps that might show me a larger pool of child-free people? I'm starting to lose hope here 😥",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mlvnbv/any_advice_for_a_gal_who_doesnt_want_children_ever/

She agreed to the date and hung out with me at work(I work 3rd shift by myself) well at the end of the 2nd day. She says she has a bf and never agreed to a date(yes she did) and goes off on me about how all guys just expect something(I expected the date she agreed to....) 

 well since she comes to my work. I played it off like I made the mistake just to keep the peace at my job.

63,mlwimr,1617779224,Should I stay as a backup option or should I totally break the relationship?," 

So I don't want to bother you with the whole story so I'll try to resume it as much as I can.

So I've been dating this girl that I met last year. Well, I was. So we moved into an apartment at the same time last year when covid Hit and that's how we met and around August last year we started to date and we decided to go on a road trip but I always keep the distance because I'm insecure about wanting to go to the step of having a girlfriend. So basically that's where I always go wrong I stay in the dating phase because I feel I don't have the time to invest in a Girlfriend. So going back to the story, on the road trip she stayed somewhere along the way I kept going, and during 3, 4 months we kept seeing each other every now and then traveling to where we were.

In December she had to renew her passport so she traveled to another city, She decided to stay there (We are In Australia by the way, she's a backpacker I'm Studying, so I have more restriction when it comes to traveling :'( )

The thing is I feel she was waiting for me to go visit her and I kept saying that I wanted to go but couldn't due to time and money because I keep going into projects and that's what I mean with not having time to go into a girlfriend. So she ended up meeting another guy there and they decided to go on a road trip together as well.

The thing is we kept talking at least 1 or 2 times a month through calls and the last time Is when I asked her about the other guy and I told her that there was no point for me to stay there, I'm out of the equation. But she didn't want to. She insisted to stay like we were, talking every now and then. I asked her if she had other friends with which she did something similar and she said that the only ones she has constant communication with are her mom and me.

So, I'm always more keen to end things like ""you go your way I go my way, there's no point for me being here"" but actually I don't know where this situation is going I don't see each other meeting again especially if she is with another guy I'm not going to visit her. So why keep in contact I actually don't get it and don't see the benefit of it.

But I would like your opinion or what you guys would do in a situation like this.

PS: I know If I say bye connection will be lost and hope to get together in the future is probably 99% lost.

But if I stay is like we know we both are interested in each other to a degree but it's not going anywhere

""I'm going to need lots of advice when it comes to this girl I'm talking to online:

1) She was just engaged in January to someone and they broke off the engagement last month and she is still friends with the guy on social media

2.) Me and her were getting to know each other through messages a couple weeks ago when she told me she just wants to be friends since she was seeing someone. But yesterday she said she's interested in dating me because the guy she was currently seeing wanted nothing to do with her after one date and she got really depressed. I don't know what signals she is sending because I went from ""just friends"" to ""wants to date me"" in a matter of a week

3.) And she has a different last name than her Facebook last name when researching her to see if she's worth dating. I don't know if she using a different profile to talk to other guys.

66,mlwn6a,1617779740,Most people are going to end up alone,"Dating has changed so drastically thanks to social media and online dating that it’s literally broken. 

My observations is online dating and social media has reverted human beings back to a tribal form of dating. 

This is due to “greater access” to partners. So what basically happens is women have more access to top tier men (male model/rich men etc) or men just in general out of their league. 

Women go for these men, because why not? I’m a dude and if supermodels wanted to bang me id obvs do it. However, then those men use them and don’t commit because why would they. They have endless options of women wanting them also. 

The mathematical results of this comes out to, the vast majority of men getting scraps or nothing in the dating world while the top 5 percent of men are running through like 20 women each. Then the majority of women end up alone because that top tier guy can only settle down with one chick.

Then after women have been with top tier guy number 1, they “refuse to settle” because that’s their new expectation, which they fail at actually obtaining a guy at that level committing because the dude was just using them for sex because he didn’t see them as in his level. Men will have sex with many women that they have no interest in being in a relationship with because they don’t find them THAT attractive. 

I see this process going on constantly. This “great access” of social media has basically ruined the dating process. In the past we knew many less people or had access to less people so there wasn’t this hyper competitive result / expectation that there now is.

So if I had to take a wild guess I’d say in 20 years the majority of people who wanted to settle down and get married will fail at this goal, both men and women and social media / online dating is absolutely to blame.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mlwn6a/most_people_are_going_to_end_up_alone/

69,mlx0go,1617781452,Be careful and set high standards for yourself!," All of you doing online dating these days, stay safe and take care of yourself, and really trust your gut. 

Set a lot of boundaries for who you pick. 

Recently I’ve been dating someone for about 2 months, she was a recovering addict that had been clean for half a year, and was getting her life very much back on track - she started working and was about to go to university. I had a bad feeling about it, but all my friends said I should go for it, and they thought it was cool that she had moved on, maybe it could even be that she had better communication skills because of it. 

Ignoring my gut feeling I decided to give it a go, and it felt alright, all was good. Relationship was growing and we see each other more and more, we get closer and intimate. I felt like we were very compatible, and supported each other in many positive ways. 

The last time we spoke, she said she had stopped seeing other guys, and that I gave her a care that she hadn’t had before. When she left, we agreed to see each other some time next week. I had all my hopes up, and it seemed good for both of us. I was actually very happy.

Two days days ago she texted me that she didn’t want to continue seeing me, because she had an ""extremely wild side"" of her that was coming back, and that she said it was a very few people who could handle it. Basically it was a goodbye message. I was curious about what she meant, because if it was a quick relapse I thought maybe we could work through it. 

I asked if she'd be up for a call just to end things well. 

She agreed, and we had a call - 

Apparently she had debt in “services” to local gangs.

In Denmark there are a few major gangs. 

These majors used to fight a lot, often very violent scenarios ending in many deaths, causing trouble in the streets. At some point, most of the majors had a peace alliance, and instead they have moved on to focus on recruiting members throughout smaller gangs in different cities. They often go for middle school kids, when they get edgy and start smoking, stand right outside their schools and say they can come to a party with free booze at their place, at their expense. The way these guys operate are just straight out psychotic, and no human being deserves being even close to them. I am also fairly sure these guys do it out of desperation as well, all of these people need to be locked up.  

The gang members apparently tried to pull her in, being the nicest guys possible to her. She has known these people since a very young age. They ""supported"" her with drugs for free when she needed it the most and had no money. This is their investment. They solved her addiction by fuelling it with drugs. They also solved her loneliness and isolation from friends and family that the drug abuse gave to her, by being absolute caring and generous guys - most likely smoking with her, giving her all the care she needs, genuinely supporting her like nobody else did in her life. Except, it is the exact opposite of genuine what they really are doing. 

They love bombed her, gave her so much emotional support, care, excitement and party - even took her our in the city and had many fantastic nights out with her, which is what I assume to be everything needed to fuel her addiction what so ever. I assume that she at some point would even have felt actual love for them. 

I think she might have fucked the gang members in attraction to them, for “caring” and “helping” her so much. The love bombing goes so far, that she thinks she actually likes them. The most caring guys she has ever met. This is where the guys just take advantage of her, because of course at this point they have everything they need of her. If she tries to get out, they have nudes of her, and probably also videos of them fucking, proof of her doing crime. 

They made her steal from people, have sex with many people, what I assume mostly to be gang members, also tried to get her to sell drugs. I'm not sure how much of this she actually did, but she did do some of it. They pressure her to keep working for them in numerous of ways, they threaten and actually did send nudes and maybe even sex pictures of her to her new boss, once she got a job and tried to get a new life.

I never knew any of this was still happening, and thought it belonged to her past, it just escalated once she decided to break it off with me. 

This person chose crime and debt over an actual genuine caring and loving guy, and a new life. 

I’m glad she broke it off with me when I didn’t see it coming. 

I went through a tough time coping with all of this. Yesterday I went on a long walk with a close friend of mine, so I am already feeling better and is ready to move on. 

Maybe I was the victim from the beginning, at least to a degree. 

Bullet dodged, this has been a wreck for me. It would have been so much easier had she just said something like ""I don't actually like you all that much, and I think we should stop seeing each other"".

It is in the past, and I have successfully moved on, at least to a degree, hence I share what happened. 

I don't want her back like the illusion she served for me, with all of those issues, it just is not possible, and it is not even my problem, nor is it something I can control or want to control.  

Sad part was that I thought we really got along, we often laughed a lot, shared interests in movies and lust of adventure. 

But there is no turning back to this, and that sucks, but I accept it and move on.  

I’m not sure if this gang story is true either, or if it was just a lie she made up just to get rid of me in a way so that I had a reason to move on. I do believe in it though.

Never buy anything from gangs EVER, these guys are out to guilt trip and recruit any weak person they can, they abuse people, make them addicted to drugs so they get fucked up, and turn them into criminals and sex workers, digital or not. They do everything they can to make the victim depend on them, this is how they take advantage of their victims. It is extremely hard to get out of, pretty much the only way is to either get threatened, maybe even beaten up, have family and friends beaten up, until they eventually give up. They invested money in the victim, so therefore they do their part to keep their life as shit as possible. 

Don't buy or do drugs! If you really, really want to buy drugs, find people who make them themselves, grow your own weed or whatever, just don’t fucking ever buy it from a gang. Never buy sex either.

In this few weeks I have realized how badly he always treated me: he would dismiss my thoughts and problems, call me a ""whiny baby"", would never have anything nice to say to me, or even a tiny detail every once in a while. He would never make plans first, he was always hesitant about introducing me to his friends, he would never ask me how I felt... And even now when I know all of this, it's like he haunts me. He's always in the back of my head. I've even started to become afraid of going out just because it terrifies me to see him.

71,mlx3b9,1617781832,The main reason for peoples dating problems is not complicated but it is depressing,"So many people post on here about dating woes women and men and over complicate it. It literally all breaks down to the same shit 98% of the time. And it’s cruel and people don’t want to accept it. 

When women complain about a guy leaving them or not committing, it’s always (usually, unless there were severe compatibility issues) based around the same reason. The guy found someone hotter. Or the guy just doesn’t find you that attractive and dated you for convenience and regular sex. I’ve seen guys so this innumerable amounts of times. This is also usually the case because women tend to “date up” so the guys are usually out of their league (hence the lack of commitment) and can in fact find other women easily. Cold hard truth. 

When men complain about women leaving, it’s literally for the same reason, but you could add in maybe the other guy has more money/status. If women don’t want to date you, it’s because they get hotter guys than you on a regular basis so you don’t really exist to them at all. (Cough, Tinder.) Women don’t need to date less attractive men to get sex. They can get sex literally anytime and from men probably more attractive than you. 90% of men do not exist to women at all. If you don’t get a ton of matches on tinder, their algorithm has literally told you scientifically, you are in the bottom 90%. The top 10% of men get a shitload of matches, trust me I’ve seen it. Cold hard truth. 

The reality is the dating world is narcissistic and cruel. In a much more hyper and exaggerated way than it was say 25 years ago. The reality is your expectations don’t match what you’re able to garner. You’re reaching. People leave, don’t commit or don’t match with you because they have better options than you.

75,mlxies,1617783817,Unsure whether it's up to me (26F) to reach out to my ex-boyfriend (35M) or if he should be. Advice?,"I’ve been dating this guy for about 8/9 months. We’re 9 years apart and I don’t notice the age difference. 34m, 25f. We get along like a house on fire, always laughing together. He tells me regularly ‘I laugh so much with you’, I know his friends, his family know about me but we haven’t been able to meet due to Covid. He used to call his parents every Sunday but since we’ve been dating, it’s become less and less. We normally see each other a few times a week, sometimes less or more depending on our schedule. He invites me to all the 'big' things in his life, for example, we were going to go to his medical ball together (he would've been seen with me in front of other girls if there is anything nefarious). When we drive or hangout in different areas together, he likes to look up the prices of houses. He's also said in front of me how cute kids are and that he can't wait to do that one day. Signs to me he's testing my reaction and seeing if I want that as well.

A few months into dating, he asked to make sure that we’re not seeing other people. He isn’t into casual sex and I think exclusivity is important to him. A few months ago I was anxious about what we were - he hadn’t asked me to be his girlfriend and I thought this is something that he would’ve wanted to do. He’s traditional, wanting something serious such as marriage/family. We had a few talks about the direction of our relationship, he said there were a few things he was a bit concerned about, a few things we maybe didn’t have in common (he’s very risk-averse and overthinks everything).

He’s studying so after that conversation he said he would decide at the end of his exams, his exams have finished now. He went away recently with some of his University friends, he was unsure of whether to go (seemed like he wanted to be with me, haha) and wanted to see me before he left. I’ve felt good about everything between us post-exams as I had a feeling he was going to slowly contact me less and less and try and see me less - due to his uncertainty.

One night on the phone, I told him that I wasn’t quite sure whether continuing to have sex with him was a wise idea as we aren’t boyfriend/girlfriend. He was confused that I said it was casual. I said ‘well, we aren’t in a relationship’ and he said ‘you are my girlfriend’ I’m certain he went onto say ’I thought we’ve known this since we started dating’ so I then asked him ‘well if I was to meet a new friend of yours that I haven’t met, would you introduce me as your girlfriend? And he said yes. Unfortunately, he has to repeat his exams so I may not be able to see him for a while, I do need to clarify that he actually meant this.I just wonder why he had this hesitancy a few times when we had the discussion a few months back though? There was even a point where I suggested we should end things because he wasn't so sure and he agreed. Maybe this is natural though and a reflection of his risk-averse attitude about things. There were just some uncertainties on his part. He said he could've been overthinking it. As a result, it sort of made me more anxious and I suggested we should end it.

He said it’ll be good to have a proper chat about things as we’ve both been putting things off, as so he said.

I got to his house, he said yes I have been his girlfriend all along and he doesn't know why I would think otherwise. He said that he feels it’s not going to work because of our age gap and he claims we're very different people. I personally do not see this as I feel like we share the same values, we're compatible in a lot of areas etc. He told me that he finds me beautiful, loves my sense of humour and that we get along and have fun together. I did mention that we handle conflict differently but our only arguments have been over text/call and since that's such a poor form of communication - it's hard to tell.

He started to cry (this is the most emotion I've seen from him), saying he won't be able to cook me any more dinners and our memories shared together. He then went back and forth and said he doesn't know if he's making the right decision, that he will never find someone like me, I am out of his league etc. He said maybe he's just one big idiot after all and he's made a stupid decision. I was calm in my response and he said ""why don't you get angry? this is making it more difficult"" in a somewhat cute way. He just kept saying that lately everything has been solidified in his brain that it's probably the most responsible decision. He asked me if I thought he was being unreasonable.

Now I feel like since we've been arguing quite a bit the past few weeks and he's been stressed, possibly his decision is skewed. I hadn't seen him in 2 or 3 weeks due to exams and I asked whether maybe we just got cold feet because of us not seeing each other. I remember months ago he said he sometimes questions us in absence.

We spent over 4 hours talking and it was like he didn't want me to leave nor did I. He then asked if we should go to dinner together. He finally walked me to my car and he couldn't stop crying.

Something in me decided to message him the other morning after I left:Me - Morning 📷 I don’t know if messaging you is the best idea, but I hope you haven’t woken up too sad. If you ever want to catch up on neutral grounds, a coffee or lunch, don’t hesitate - I still consider you a friend. Even under these circumstances, it was nice to see you last night and I am saddened I won’t be able to have more of them with you. That’s all 📷Him - Morning! I was in two minds as to whether to message you with the same sentiment 📷 I feel very much the same. Like you say it’s always nice seeing you, and it’s hard for me to think we won’t be sharing more moments together. I really hope you’re feeling ok today 📷 Enjoy the rest of your weekend 📷Me - Aw, well if you’re keen to catch up in a week to come or a few months, let me know. I’m trying to not make this any harder for us but it is difficult. I didn’t react with anger because that’s genuinely not how I feel about us. I miss you, enjoy your morning eggs 📷Him - Will do 📷 miss you too, at least you can have your eggs with olive oil today 📷Me - These thoughts are best discussed in person but I’m not sure if that can happen and they’re weighing heavy on me. I do think we could work through the issues as I feel there are more positives than negatives. I am aware that the past few weeks have been pretty nasty for the both of us but I’ve been particularly harsh on you. If I don’t hear back from you, I will, of course, assume you do not feel the same way and will accept your decision.Him - I thought I did explain that although the last month or so has been really difficult, it hasn’t been the main reason why I reached the decision I did. Of course I’m always really happy to talk to you about anything though, so if you still want to talk things through naturally I’m happy to do that 📷He went onto say that he hates that he's upset me and that it's all really difficult for him but he **thinks** it's all for the best.

We caught up and went to the beach together. We had a good time, he just feels at the moment he thinks it’s the best decision, although he isn’t fully confident he’s doing the right thing. He said maybe in a year it’ll make more sense and we realise we’re fit for each other. He said that he told his mother we broke up and she got really angry. Something was quite odd, he told me his friend (who I know) broke up with his girlfriend but they’re back together. We then went back to his for a cup of tea and we talked a bit more. He admitted that he does get in his head a lot and could be overthinking things. Said again that he's scared he's going to lose someone amazing but feels it's the right decision **right now**. Again, I feel because I've been arguing with him over text lately and he feels overwhelmed. When I left, he said he wants to see me again in a week or 2.

We spoke on the phone and I told him it’s really painful catching up with him and I don’t want to feel like an option to him or being left on the back burner, he said that wasn’t his intention and he would never do that as he has too much respect for me. He said it was hard catching up with me recently as well. He said he agreed to catching up because he felt like it was something I wanted. We spoke a bit more and he said that if he has a change of heart in the future, he won’t just sit on it. He’ll tell me. He told me he hopes I know how beautiful I actually am.

He ended up calling/messaging me over Christmas and NYE. I do feel like I am the one who predominately initiates contact with him first, I’ve been sending him sort of lengthy messages and he claims he’s overwhelmed by it. Recently we’ve been having an hour or so conversations when we usually would never have that as he was never one to speak on the phone. He expressed doubts about our break up as per usual and said he’s probably one big idiot after all. He told me he’s been on 2 dates with 2 girls as I asked, said he’s sort of interested but it hasn’t gone anywhere. I was quite upset and he assured me he wants to stay single for a while, he also said it’s not like he even wants a relationship with them. He said to give me some context that there were girls before we met that he was interested but it didn’t go anywhere. I was quite offended because he went on dates with girls that he basically broke up with me for. He broke up with me over an age gap but then went on dates with girls my age? Makes no sense. He said it’s all really regrettable and then told me that it's not that he wants a relationship with these people and said they’re just friends he wanted to get to know better. He said he wishes I could see his phone. Near the end of the phone call, he got teary about the fact he thinks I'm so sweet and don't deserve this.

He said over a month ago that a catch up would be good to clear the air. He also wouldn’t directly answer the question when I asked if he just sees me as a friend. I’ve decided to pull back, but it seems like he wants to catch up. At the start of this month, he offered to call about something, I think he was sort of surprised by that as I usually am jumping at any chance for us to speak on the phone. He sent me a message about the date/time tba (which I didn't respond to) and then he sent me a follow up message about a week later saying “Morning, when works this week for you?” with a smiley face. He then said whenever is fine, to choose a day/evening and let him know. He then said he hopes my mother is doing okay. This was 2 weeks ago and I didn't responded. He sent me another message 2 weeks later saying he hadn’t heard from me in a while, was wondering how I am and asked if my mother is okay. I replied and I was friendly, but brief. He replied and said a few things and then said ‘we never caught up in the end, let me know if you would still like to’ we talked a bit more and then I told him that I feel he just wants to catch up to free himself from guilt and that we can only catch up if we both feel it’s best for us to be together. He responded with saying that he understands and he didn’t think it would still be really difficult but he understands and there is a bit of truth in wanting to free himself but he thought it would be healthy in general. Apologised for the pain he’s caused me and wished me all the best. I told him that I just felt him talking about clearing the air was ominous and I just wanted to have dinner with him and not talk about us. He said that he understands how that could have caused it and apologies and said it’s the furthest from how he wanted to make me feel. I didn't respond and that was 3 weeks ago now. For my birthday, I never received a text from him and I didn’t receive anything over easter either.

\*\*TL;DR\*\* ex-boyfriend broke up with me in November 2020. He cried a lot that day. He's expressed doubt and says he's probably one big idiot regarding his decision. We caught up a week after we broke up but I've decided to not see him for my own reasons. Lately he's been initiating more contact and has been quite persistent in catching up with me but conditions the catch up as 'clearing the air'.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mlxies/unsure_whether_its_up_to_me_26f_to_reach_out_to/
76,mlxigk,1617783824,"Thinking about knitting a stuffed animal for someone that i had a crush on in Middle/High School and recently began talking to again, is this a bit much?","Currently 22(M), we’re about the same age, and just began talking again in mid February, and the same way i liked her back then still applies now when we began texting daily. I even think she may have liked me back then too, but I’m not sure.

She likes her stuffed animals and has multiple, so I thought this might be a cute surprise to let her know that in some capacity I like her, which I’m not too sure if it’ll come off as overly so 😅

For more context: I’ve never knitted before and have the materials coming tomorrow. Whenever I’m particularly happy i like to learn new things and get relatively good at it, so even if it might not be a good idea to make one ‘for’ her, I’d still like to knit some stuff to practice anyways.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mlxigk/thinking_about_knitting_a_stuffed_animal_for/

78,mlxuzr,1617785540,Indecisive about whether I should ask out the cute girl that moved into my complex,"There's a cute girl \[26\] that moved into my \[30M\] complex 2 months ago and she stays one floor above me (I live on the ground floor). On the day she moved in, she knocked on my door to ask me if I could open the gate for the movers transporting her furniture as she did not have a gate remote yet. I immediately felt an attraction to her but I was shy/nervous to make more conversation than just to tell her to give me a heads up when the movers got to the gate. We did not exchange names. I was also going through a bout of depression at the time, and did not feel very confident in talking to people in general, let alone women. So I didn't have the courage at the time, to go to her flat, say hi, and welcome her to the complex.

The next time we bumped into each other was 1.5 weeks ago. I hadn't thought about her too much till then, because I'd sort of written off the possibility of introducing myself, owing to a lack of self-confidence to do so.  I was collecting a food delivery, and she was seeing a friend off by the gate. We made eye contact (no smiles because I had my mask on), but didn't have any conversation. I haven't been able to get her off my mind since, because I find her incredibly cute. I have been coming out of my depression over the last few weeks, and I was able to muster up the courage to say hi to her and introduce myself. I went up to her front door 3 times last week, but she wasn't at home. Finally, I got to say hi to her yesterday. I was very nervous at first, but relaxed after about 2mins of conversation. I also felt a slight attraction from her end and a bit of shyness. I did not want to ask for her number at the end of the conversation, because I thought that might be too soon. Also, I am not sure if I should take things so fast, considering we are basically neighbours.

Can anyone give me some advice about how I should approach this situation? I know that she is into hiking, and she seemed intrigued when I mentioned that I am into indoor bouldering, which is something she hasn't done before.  I was considering asking her to join me for a climb this weekend. I felt like that might be a much more chilled setting to get to know her a bit more than asking her out for a drink for instance.

81,mly9qz,1617787480,Too many people are focused on finding the right partner vs being the right partner,"I see it on advice subs, in my social circle and just generally everywhere. 

Now, I’m not talking about abuse. I don’t condone victim blaming/shaming.

I’m talking about people who try to find the perfect person right off the bat. Someone who fulfils all their criteria, without even considering whether they fulfil their partner’s criteria or needs.

People are dynamic. Relationships grow and people change. People get busy/stressed/sick etc. So this “checklist” is completely useless. Because when things change, feathers are ruffled. And most people then want to know if they need to jump ship because they don’t want to weather the storm. Storms don’t last forever but somehow people just seem to want an eternal paradise. It’s just a fantasy. Good on paper but not in reality. 

If only people worked on themselves and tried to be a better partner, I do believe many issues would be dealt with swiftly. For example, I saw on a subreddit that someone was contemplating leaving his girlfriend because she’s too busy to meet up with him because of a course she’s doing and she has two part time jobs. He’d like for her to come over to his apartment more often. Why not compromise and go to her instead? Have a meal together during her lunch time?

If someone is ghosting you or constantly blowing you off, by all means leave. But creating dealbreakers out of a very fixable issue seems ridiculous to me. A little communication and small acts of kindness go a long way in a relationship. You can’t just jump relationships and expect there to not be any issues. The grass isn’t greener on the other side so taking care of your own garden is the only way you’re guaranteed happiness.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mly9qz/too_many_people_are_focused_on_finding_the_right/

90,mlzmh3,1617793505,Feeling like shit after great date,"Hey guys, 

&amp;#x200B;

I really need help. I (M23) had a really good date with a girl (23) which I met once before. I stayed at her place, we laughed a lot, we talked a lot (also about relationships) and everything was fine. So I left this noon (could have stayed a few hours more if I really pushed for it I guess, but she has to work later on so I wanted her to get some rest without distraction and time to prepare herself. But I did stay a few minutes longer after her asking for it).

So here comes the turning point, I really feel like throwing up and crying. It was such a beautiful time and all I wanna do is meet her again and do things together. I know it's unhealthy and not very attractive to be so head over heels for someone. I already had a similar situation in the past and the conversation kinda stopped after 2 dates and it really broke my heart, I am so scared that it can happen again. It seemed to me she really had a good time and even said that if she didn't want me there she would have already thrown me out with an excuse. But still I am so scared that something can go wrong. 

I can only think about her right now, having to do over tasks is annoying as hell to me and I am kinda frustrated knowing I have to do it and I know she will be quite busy the next days so a next date has at least to wait for a little bit.

Can somebody give me advice on how to proceed? And how the hell can I chill/not be clingy and avoid crying when I notice things won't go further? Hope somebody can help me...

TL;DR: Had one of the best dates of my life with a girl and now am kinda angry that I can't spend more time with her right now and also really scared to loose her.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mlzmh3/feeling_like_shit_after_great_date/
