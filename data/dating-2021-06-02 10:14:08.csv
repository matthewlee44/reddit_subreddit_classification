I got out of a relationship then &amp; wanted to give myself time before I got back out there.

Anyway, I just wasn't ready then but I'm ready now &amp; well it's been crickets. I'm still attractive. A lot of people think I'm younger than I am, but I'm just not getting matches. I'm on Bumble &amp; Hinge. Most of the guys on Bumble honestly lately there's not a lot of catches imo. Hinge has a better selection but the success rate at connecting with someone just isn't sparking. Even the men don't seem to be putting in much effort. I gave one guy my number &amp; he texted me but then shortly after that he stopped. 

Idk if it's something I'm giving off? It took me a while to slowly build back my confidence as my last breakup really affected me &amp; I was in a low place for a while. I'm also in therapy to get help with that. 8 thought maybe I'm not quite ready, or the timing to finding matches are just off.

16,nqps2j,1622651231,Dating a cheater,"Dear Reddit, 
I will try and streamline my ordeal the best I can, but please forgive me if it still remains too long.

A few years ago, around 2019, I met this girl and we quickly became really good friends. I had not seen her to be a sort of person I‚Äôd date but yet, deep down, I could feel a disagreement within myself. A few months later, as I grew closer to her, I Learned that I indeed had feelings for her. I didn‚Äôt know how to express this so chose not to. 

When I finally decided to give in to my feelings, as they had remained persistent for a few months, she told me that she had been hooking up with this guy but he was not treating her well( he sometimes forced himself on to her, when she was not in the mood)  , as I tried to comfort her, I simultaneously felt a deep pain in my heart, I have never felt this kind of pain before( I should add before her I had never dated before and  chose to have casual encounters, this was my norm) 

Upon learning this, I decided to keep it to myself but this only lasted a few weeks. We are now in January of 2020. I decided that I have to tell her and whatever happens happens. I told her and she asked for time because she never saw me this way. She became distant from me, prior to this we spoke everyday and I would say that we had been best friends.  She took time from me yet continued hooking up with this guy, even though she said that she wanted it to stop. 

By the time March rolled around, we had reconciled and agreed to remain friends, despite me having feelings for her, we had also grown much closer by then. She still continued to hook up with this guy. They were not in a relationship but just hooked up. 

COVID had become serious now so she went back to stay with her family across the country. We stayed in contact and again spoke everyday on FaceTime, a month had now passed by and she informed me that she was going to be coming back, I ,still having feelings for her told her that I still feel the same way and I‚Äôm comfortable not being friends because it‚Äôs uncomfortable to have feeling and be friends. She said she understood and let me go. 

Around mid may, she reached out to me and said that she wanted to give us a try because she feels like she could be missing out on something great and we stated dating, long distance, this wasn‚Äôt bad as she would be back in June. 

When she‚Äôs back, things were great in the beginning but she would constantly be sad, she would randomly start crying on random days And when I would ask she said she was stressed, I wanted to be a good boyfriend so I supported her 


This is where I begin to need your advice.

Around July now, things are going terribly , she has become much distant from me and has expressed that she feels like she couldn‚Äôt fall in love with me . I understand because it had been such little time how can you even start talking about love. I hold on but I noticed she started being on her phone more whenever we were together. 
I began to feel that she began dating me because the guy she had been hooking up with refused a relationship and so she came to me. I have never been insecure so I figured it was just me worrying .  On July we break up because again she said she couldn‚Äôt fall in love. 

She doesn‚Äôt want to stay even though I tell her to stay so we break up. 

From august to November , I ask her out twice again to get back together , she repeats the same thing, she can‚Äôt fall in love with me and doesn‚Äôt want to try .
I couldn‚Äôt understand why until I learned she started hooking up with the guy she was with before we got together. 
I was already heartbroken but now I was shattered , on November 17th I decided that I would stop talking to her and deleted my social media and vanished to go and work on myself. I change my number as well

Now In December of 2020, she begins to reach out to me to try and get in contact on my email . I ignore everything, she even contacts my sister to try get to me but I tell my sister to block her. On New Years I receive an email saying she loves me and didn‚Äôt know until I left her. She wants to get back together 




I can sense desperation, yet I choose to allow myself to go into it,

It is now January of 2021, I have allowed myself to return to a relationship with her and she says she loves me and I feel as though I have always loved her too so I say it back. Things are good now. Honestly even better than last time,  yet this feeling within me lingers that, she must have tried to get into a relationship with the other guy, he told her he didn‚Äôt want it, and then she came to me again, and this time I knew that she fucked him, it was bothering me to my core so I decided to talk to her about it.  She confirms she slept with him but it didn‚Äôt mean anything, she never wanted a relationship with him but they just fucked and I should know what that‚Äôs like because of how many one night stands I‚Äôve had. 
I tell her that I don‚Äôt mind she hooked up with someone but rather she hooked up with him, I had asked if she had anything to do with him before we broke up and she said no, yet after we broke up she fucked him. She tells me it truly didn‚Äôt mean anything it was just sex and I should know what just sex is.  So I ask why him, she says because she had sex with him before and so it was convenient so they fucked, I ask more than once, she says yes. 

I ask for time to work through my feelings and I decide that yeah we were broken up so it doesn‚Äôt matter. I feel as though it was more that I stayed loyal even though I had the chance to fuck other people but I didn‚Äôt because I wanted her, yet she was sucking someone else‚Äôs dick. So I ask her, did you try being in a relationship with him and then it failed so you came back to me, she said no and asked to please believe her, she just wanted sex. 

We are now 5 months into the relationship, things have been really good, she talks about marriage sometimes and meeting each other parents and family.  
YET I STILL FEEL LIKE SHE BROKE MY TRUST BY  GOING BACK TO THAT GUY
I don‚Äôt think about it often, less than I did before but It still lingers in my mind. 
It‚Äôs not that She had sex with someone, she could‚Äôve fucked 8 people while we were together and it wouldn‚Äôt have mattered but the fact she went back to the guy she said she had nothing to with, bothers me so much. 

So I turn to you because I do love her and she had been there for me in some tough times while we were friends , but I feel as though I sometimes hold back from falling for her 100 percent because I don‚Äôt think what she did was right. 

I just want to know, what would y‚Äôall do, leave ? Stay ? I‚Äôm just confused. 

I want to add that , it‚Äôs not that I can‚Äôt  find someone else, so if someone were to say that they feel like I couldn‚Äôt get anyone else,that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm staying ,  this would be false, I believe I do have options but I do love her, but this Bothers me to the point where I sometimes battle with leaving or not.

It's obvious that we have a lot of respect for each other and don't want us to hurt each other and we've been trying to talk about everything openly, although there are still awkward moments.

 The problem is: on the first day we slept together, I also met a guy (he's friends with friends) with whom I got along very well. I wasn't romantically interested in him, I just thought he was really cool. however, I think he is romantically interested in me and we've been texting. I talked about this with my best friend yesterday and he said he didn't like the situation, that it made him feel bad, mainly because he boy is interested in me. now i don't know what os the best thing to do... i don't know if i should stop talking to this guy, although i'm 100% sure i don't like him (i really like my best friend a lot).

19,nqqc30,1622652593,A vent on my inexistent dating life,"M20 So, I've been having a couple of questions in my mind about my relationships, just got out of, funny enough, my first labeled relationship with someone i met online, lasted one month. Backstory, I've had 2 girlfriends my whole life, one at 15 and this one now, and I've always wandered why I haven't been in more, or longer relationships.

1. No I'm not ugly, I'm not a supermodel either but I'd say 7 or 8

2. I have a good group of 10-15 friends so not antisocial either

3. I'm not boring, i play the drums and I'm Eric forman-ish funny, I

play basketball, used to play soccer and swim 4. Im thin but defined and I'm 1.80m

5. I think sexual stuff is private and I'm reserved in that aspect, I'm a virgin and i want to be

6. I tend to hunch my back

7. can be a bit needy

8. Don't drink, smoke or do drugs

Considering all of the point above, what's up? At school got rejected by a couple of girls, but at the same time i knew other girls i wasn't attracted to had crushes on me. I've heard my sister's friend say: whoever end up with him will be really lucky I'm described by everyone as cute. Gave dating apps a shot, wasted my time for more than 6 months until i got a girlfriend, and all went to trash because of her mental state. Now back to square one.

My theory: I'm uglier than what I think I am. I also don't go out much, and when I do i don't meet anyone, I'm in engineering and there are no women in my classes and it's a loop of not meeting anyone i can't scape.

What's your opinion? What's up with me that makes it so hard to find someone to be with?

And she said I do want to see you I'm just a lil upset that's it.But then she kept the slow fade going after that, she left on seen sometimes but also replied to me suoer fast others, and most of the time she always replied, is just that her text were kind of dry sometimes and she kept saying she was busy but never saying when she was free, never initianing contact and also being online and not even opening my messages.She kept watching all my stories,reacting, liking my pictures and she even reply to one of my storie saying "" Heeeeeyyyy"" I reply to her but she left me on seen and that was one week after no contact.

So she was the last one to reach to me with that hey, I don't really feel like she ghosted me she was just doing the slow fade.I mean the last messages we exchanged were not really that important were she also left them on seen.It was not a question or something like that but I honestly stopped reaching out because I saw that she was not making any effort at all to see me.I kept asking her to hangout and she kept saying she was busy that she let me know.

But I feel the need to reach out to her again and maybe apologize that I posted some stories directed to her that I did not mean to make her mad.etc which I denied at 1st when she told me that but I got to be honest I did posted some stories thinking about her cause I know she was seeing.Is been like 2- 3 weeks since we don't talk to each other.

I didn‚Äôt take him seriously first because he was phrasing it quite jokingly but I kept pushing to ask if he was serious and he gave an answer like ‚Äúif you‚Äôre down then sure‚Äù. The first week after this, we spoke everyday over message and he was being too intense for my liking. Every time he would say something about spending our life together I‚Äôd just ignore that part of the message and keeps he conversation going. I mention I need time but I never mentioned whether I was actually interested. He got the hint that he was being too forward after we went a whole weekend not speaking.

Now, he‚Äôs a lot more chilled and we still talk everyday. He still hints majorly that he wants to be with me and I can say that I‚Äôve started to catch feelings. However, this might just be because of exams, but whenever I flirt with him he says something ridiculous like ‚Äúsorry I have a wife‚Äù. Like he‚Äôs scared of rejection or misinterpreting. The other night we phoned for hours and every time I‚Äôd dig into him about who he likes he would say we can speak about it when finals are over. Just before we got off the phone, we had a bit of an intense flirting sesh where he asked if I want to be his *insert any female half of a TV couple* and I was like hmm perhaps and I ended the call for effect. An hour later I messaged him saying I‚Äôll b his *other half* and he messaged back ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gay sorry‚Äù . Why is he being difficult when I actually like him back??

Also I mentioned something along the lines of going on a date and he simply made the ‚Äúcandice‚Äù joke (tiktok trend). It‚Äôs actually playing with my emotions at this point.

29,nqrs5k,1622656316,Uncertainty but also filled with confidence,"Not entirely sure if this is a vent? or if I need advice but we'll just say it's a vent

Awhile ago, I checked out of my 2-3 year relationship. Despite a few things I didn't like that my SO did, (which wasn't the reasoning behind the breakup) I felt that we drifted apart. I found myself making time for anyone and everyone except him and it just came to the realization that I didn't want him as my boyfriend anymore. I felt guilty more than upset. It was really strange to be at that point where you were so sure of the strength of a relationship but then completely flipped and felt cold. It always happened to me so me being on the other side I felt bad.

Now, I'm single and its been a few months. I thought about dating again or going on OLD apps or something but honestly, i can't bring myself to. Plus, for the first time, I don't feel like searching anymore. Without much planning, I told a friend I liked him since it was the truth.. I didn't do it out of desperation or needing someone. Simply because it was the facts.

One date happened but I wonder since I don't necessarily hear from him all the time and since he's a friend it's literally been always like this so it's not that dramatic. In addition, I'm not a big texter and so it doesn't necessarily bother me (and also i've been horrible responding LOL) but I only bring it up since on OLD and these reddit threads people are so insistent that constant communication is vital. Honestly, I got nothing to say everyday LMFAO but also I wonder what the right move is?? Not sure.

Overall, maybe i just needed somewhere to write this down but I can say for the first time that I'm really confident with myself. But there's a bit of nervousness since I don't want to push this current situation forcefully. My friend wants me to be upfront and ask if he'd like to continue down this path which i could but also despite my demeanor I'm a bit scared? It's scary when I may have to come to the idea of what if i don't talk to him for a few months to get over how I feel. It's scary really. I don't believe I'm any less of a person or that there's anything wrong with me if that happens but it's scary to think about.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nqrs5k/uncertainty_but_also_filled_with_confidence/

32,nqs4m6,1622657228,Why to do if I find out someone I‚Äôve been talking to/‚Äúdating‚Äù has been seeing someone else?,"Hi, so I‚Äôm new here and not sure how things go here. Same way I‚Äôm new to dating/relationships lol. I‚Äôll try keep this as short as possible.

I‚Äôm a guy who‚Äôs had my fair share of experiences with girls. Never had a strong connection to any of them tbh, so never had a relationship. I‚Äôm not entirely sure what the definition of dating is cus everyone seems to have different definitions but what I did learn is dating and relationship isn‚Äôt the same thing? Anyway imo, I‚Äôd only say I‚Äôm dating someone after: going past the talking stage, gone out on dates at least twice and chilled together at her/my place at least once. Someone please correct me if there‚Äôs a reliable and clear definition please.

So, in my case, long story short, over the course of a month, the girl in question passed all the ‚Äúcriterias‚Äù except going on two dates, we went to a party together and hung out at my place another time. Within that time her replies got really bad (less than 6 or so messages a day) but I‚Äôm just taking her word for now as it seems to add up most the time (she has two jobs and had some family issues), which is why we haven‚Äôt gone on any dates yet. She keeps talking about all the things she wants to do together like dates, chilling, working out together but there‚Äôs always one reason or another with her. Though, at one point, she was at a get together with her friends nearby, left them, came by to apologise in person about how we haven‚Äôt been able to do anything, so I thought she was genuine but I told her I‚Äôll let her do the planning (cus if she was really serious, she would arrange it like I was. A few days ago she brought it up saying she‚Äôs about to get her work schedule next week and let me know her availability.

Anyway, 2 weeks or so after still talking everyday, I see her on a date with another guy (according to him it was). Turns out it was my friend (he doesn‚Äôt  know me and her were doing whatever we‚Äôre doing). So apparently they‚Äôve been on a date twice and she‚Äôs been round his place the first date. I haven‚Äôt told him anything but he seems to actually like her. 


TL:DR - I have been talking to/‚Äúdating‚Äù a girl for a month, she‚Äôs busy a lot and doesn‚Äôt show up to plans cus she‚Äôs scared she‚Äôd mess things up, came to my place to apologise for messing up, I give her another chance, I see her on a date with my friend 2 weeks later.


I feel like I‚Äôm being played or kept as a second option, and idk what to do because the reason why I‚Äôm even this bothered is because I actually like this girl for once. However, I‚Äôve been told if people are dating, it‚Äôs ok for both parties to still see other people unless explicitly agreed you won‚Äôt. Idek if I‚Äôm classified as dating, before or past it?? If we are dating, I‚Äôm not bothered about it but if we are, idk what to do.

33,nqsjma,1622658215,"I met someone through online dating and in two weeks, I was almost convinced she was ""the one"" and the feeling felt mutual. All of a sudden, with no warning signs, she becomes distant to an extreme, which makes me doubt her reasons. She is now ghosting me and it breaks my heart.","Hello. I wanted to share my story in a sort of AITA structure to see if there was anything I should have done differently and if there is anything left for me to do.

I (28M) met someone (29F) through online dating, let's call her Avocado.

We met in person at a casual dinner and drinks and we immediately hit it off. We talk about common interests and how similar our backgrounds are. She mentions it's her birthday weekend and not too long after the date, she mentions I'm welcome to join her and her close friends to her birthday celebration. I am super excited and accepted.

It was a small group, all vaccinated and we had a great time. I felt comfortable and the group was great at including me in their mix. Avocado took pictures and seemed to have a great time. I left the party a bit early and that's when we first kissed. She mentioned that she really liked me and I told her I did too.

Right after that, we spent more time with her friends, where spent the day outside and had dinner together. Again, everything went great and I didn't feel like there were any red flags; it all felt right.

For the next week, we spent what I thought was a lot of time together. Which I wasn't going to complain about it; every time I was with her, I felt happy and relaxed. We even got to spend time with my own friends that were in town and had a very similar experience as to when I met her friends.

In other words, our first two weeks of getting to know each other went by a bit fast, but it felt natural and positive. Nothing felt forced.

After those first two weeks, there was a point where she became a bit more distanced, mostly in her texting. We both have full time jobs so we would have quick text conversations throughout the day and I immediately noticed her responses took longer and were more cut and dry. I did sense it quickly but I didn't think anything of it, I just thought she was having a busy week.

This went on until Friday, where I asked her if she was free and wanted to meet or if she was busy. She said that she wanted to see me but just for a quick walk.

I went over and immediately she is cold and quiet. We went for our walk and she mentioned she was having trouble at work. She told me the details, which I won't go into, but it was definitely something serious, as it involved legal issues. I listened the whole time and mentioned that if there was anything I could do to help, I can be there for her.

Here is when the first small red flag appeared. She quickly mentioned that she is not good at communicating herself when she stresses out and she tends to distance herself from the world when she is uneasy. She even mentioned that she has had trouble with past relationships because of this.

Now, I don't think I ever had this brought up in any of my past relationships. Although communication has never been consistent with my past relationships, I feel that in general, I never had an issue with expressing myself. I mentioned to her that I believed it's healthy to vent, to ask for help and to not go through tough times on your own. I told her my experience has never been perfect but just making an effort goes a long way.

Shortly after out talk, I left early once again, noticing that she felt anxious and wanted some time alone. I texted her a few more times here and there during the weekend, but gave her the space she asked for.

Starting the week again, the texting became more and more distant. The week went by with minimal contact and dry conversations again. That weekend she headed out to see family, so I thought that would be good for her, maybe clear her mind up and find support.

However, it was right after the visit that it got to the tipping point. After not replying to texts for days at a time, she decided to give me a call on a Friday night to talk about why she has been so distant lately.

She tells me she's going through a family crisis, one that involves her step-father and a terminal disease, which she found out on her recent family visit. I was heartbroken when she told me the story and I didn't know how to even react. I tried to console her and offer words of support, but she caught me off guard and wasn't sure it did any good. Our conversation was mostly her telling me the news and how she most likely will be distant for the time being. She had no idea how long that could be and mentioned that it was just how she deals with these type of things. I told her to take her time and that, again, she could always ask for my support in any way she needed.

After hanging up, I felt very upset. I felt upset because I did not want to lose her but I also wanted to give her the space she needs. It sounds selfish but I just didn't understand why we could not continue the relationship even though she is going through tough times, especially when I'm willing to be there for her in her time of need.

After the weekend passed, I sent her a voice message explaining how I felt and how I thought we had something beautiful going when we met. I then went on to say that I thought she should give us a chance and let me be there for her, whether it's to listen to her vent or to do nothing all day or go someplace quiet; whatever she wanted. I explained that the uncertainty was unsettling to me and I was not sure how long I could wait.

After I sent that, two weeks went by with no answer. I recently sent her a short text saying that I hope everything is getting better with her and her family, as well as mentioning that I was going to assume that whatever we had wasn't going anywhere anymore.

It's been a slow burn and I still feel sad every time I think of her. I think the worst part is simply not knowing, staying in the dark through this whole process. I know she must be feeling worse for her family but I am wondering if she felt anything about our relationship too and whether she just didn't care if it fell apart. And if she did care, I definitely couldn't tell. And worst of all, I even wonder (and I have myself for saying this) if this was a lie and she simply didn't want to see me anymore for other reasons, like if she met someone else or something like that.

And that's that. I blocked her off of social media and deleted all our text history in an effort to not be reminded of her. I still get the occasional thought and it brings me down, I hope I get over it soon.

AITA? Did I say or do something wrong? Should I have been more patient and let her do her thing? Should I be glad that I am no longer going out with her? Is there anything else I can do at this point or should I call this 100% over?

I know there's a million post just like this one on this subreddit alone, but I'm posting this just so I can get some outside advice on this if possible. I'm just gonna list some key things and not go into extreme detail of what all has happened while we've known each other. This post will probably already be decently long anyway.

-I'm 20, she's 18. Both of us are pretty introverted people, her moreso.

-We work together and have started to hang out once or twice a week outside of the store. We both initiate planning stuff, so it doesn't seem to be one-sided. We've even planned stuff to do months away from now. So far she's never turned down the option of going out or has flaked on any our plans.

-When we hang out, it's always with a group of people or one other person, but that tends to be because of me inviting others to be honest.

-A mutual friend of ours who is always with us seems to think she's into me, but isn't 100% sure. The main reasons she thinks this, in her words, is because she laughs at most everything I say, hangs out with me fairly often, wears a necklace I got her as a Secret Santa gift everyday, and teases me a lot or acts very comedic or nervous around me. These seem like pretty obvious signs I guess, but I feel like there could be reasonable counter-arguments made for all of them.

Now for the key points that kinda make me doubt she's into me.

-When there's not another person with us, a good amount of our conversations are dry. I do get nervous around her when we're alone sometimes and I'm sure that's the main contributing factor, but it doesn't seem like she has too much to say either.

-We rarely text each other. Once again, this is an issue I myself contribute to. We're in a group chat together and talk in there sometimes, but it's nothing of substance really. Usually when we text each other, it's just to make plans or send a meme. To be fair though, I don't really like texting people and she's said in the past that she doesn't either.

Those are the only negative things I can list, but I feel like they may mean she's not actually that interested in me.

54,nqw3ak,1622667258,I think I have found the ultimate secret of building a successful relationship!,"Folks, I am looking forward to your inputs and discussion. 

After a 1 year of self-reflection upon the end of my relationship of 3 years, I think I have found the ultimate sauce of building a successful relationship! 

1- I have noticed that partners tend to involve in a relationship with nonrealistic expectations. They think subconsciously that the relationship should be always fun and enjoyable 24/7 all year-round. The danger of this mindset that partners fail to recognize the basics of life. The fact that life does not work in that manner at all, there are going to be sunny and rainy days, no matter the hard work you put, there are going to be rainy days.  

2- Partners fail to recognize that we are humans, we have flaws. Unless these flaws are a dealbreaker (cheating, abuse ...etc), the relationship is mostly workable if people put the work on it. 

3- Relationship is a full-time job. It needs hard work constantly to work out. Relationships are not easy, nothing in life is easy and unless you recognize this basic thing in life, you will always end up in a failed relationship, one after the another. 

4- It looks like me that capitalism has a role in this dangerous mindset. It makes us always trying to pursue happiness and if sadness comes along, we reject it and we reject the relationship we are in.

55,nqw4et,1622667340,Do I tell him that I‚Äôm keeping the baby?,"Previous post : 

‚ÄúI (F27) started dating a guy (M31) a few months ago. We had the exclusive chat really early on and got on like a house on fire. 

After a few weeks went by, I started to realise that he‚Äôd lied about little things, I.e his job title, where his hometown was, exaggerating his career success, country of birth etc. I found out through a LinkedIn suggestion but didn‚Äôt confront him. 

One weekend he had an ‚Äòemergency‚Äô and told me that his dad had a heart attack and bailed mid date. 

He told me that he was out of town taking care of his sick father. I drove past his house (it‚Äôs an apartment block on a main road on my way home from work) and saw his car outside. I confronted him and asked whether he was in town, he admitted he was and said that he was back temporarily. 

I ignored him for a few days and messaged him later in the week asking if everything he‚Äôd told me had been lies. He said he didn‚Äôt know what I was talking about but broke it off because I ignored him for days and blocked me. 

Two weeks later I found out I was pregnant. We‚Äôd been careful and I was on BC. It was a horrible shock and I cried for days straight. I messaged him and told him that I thought he had a right to know and that I hadn‚Äôt made my decision yet. Radio silence. Nothing for over 24 hours. 

My question is, if I decide to keep this baby do I tell him? I was under the impression that I was doing ‚Äòthe right thing‚Äô in telling him, but perhaps not?

P.s please be kind. I‚Äôm very low and confused right now‚Äù

Question : 

I thought that I‚Äôd had a miscarriage but the hospital have confirmed that I‚Äôm still pregnant (I still haven‚Äôt t heard from him).

I have tried getting a nice haircut, buy some nicer more fitting clothes, and get back into shape.  However, I'm starting to get very insecure about my teeth.  I take care of my teeth including brushing, flossing, and regularly going to the dentist (though I need to schedule an appointment now that COVID restrictions are relaxing).  However, My teeth are slightly crooked and my two front teeth have asymmetric length and shape.  It isn't easy to tell from a distance though on face photos it stand out to me and I think to myself that I'm ugly because of my teeth.  I never got braces as a kid because when I was at the age where I was supposed to get braces my parents convinced me not to because my teeth weren't really badly crooked (perhaps they were just trying to save money or perhaps this was part of the homeopathic phase they went through), but I notice the slightly crooked teeth and the fact my front teeth are asymmetric in shape and it stands out TO ME like a sore thumb.   


I keep hearing how women are turned off by bad teeth and I keep thinking to myself that nobody will like me due to my teeth.  Perhaps that is why women are swiping left on me and maybe I'm not getting matches.  I can't get braces now that I'm an adult (not that I can't, my insurance just won't cover it and I can't pay out of pocket at this time).  At this point, I want to just hide my smile.

I absolutely hate common dating advice.

I‚Äôve read, listened, studied, asked, applied and still nothing. 

I‚Äôm in this suspended state of wanting to just give up but wanting to try at the same time. On one hand I‚Äôm thinking, ‚Äúmajority of people have to do this and they figure it out.

I don't see a reason why there's still this sort of ""shame"" attached to admitting you want a relationship. Or doing online dating to get into one.

When I take myself for example, I've been single for three years now. I've dated a little on and off though, tomorrow I'm having a third date with a guy that I met online, and I'm having a blast. But I'm not going to break down if it ends, either. I just think dating is fun, and a great way to meet new people, even if it doesn't lead anywhere.

I have my life where I want it to be. I'm having lots of fun exploring my career options, even though I sometimes stress the hell out when I can't figure it out. I talk to my friends about it, and don't feel like I'm missing out because I don't have a partner to tell. I sometimes wish I had a partner when I see my friends in great relationships, but the thought of it doesn't consume me. I have hobbies. I imagine my future by myself, in my own little apartment, with a dog or a cat, and I don't see a problem with it. Hell, I'd love that even. I can imagine exactly what I'd want to do with a year if I had to be single the entire time. So I feel like life is fun either with or without a partner, however I still feel like it would be even better with someone to share it with.

And I feel like many, many people feel the same way I do, yet like me, feel ashamed to actively look for a relationship or try online dating and being open about it. Can we all just have a chat about it, and admit it's perfectly fine and natural to want a relationship for all the right reasons?

I knew she has a pretty bad drinking problem and I knew she smoked way to much weed but I never really cared because she is super cool and chill. 

Anyways she invited me camping after hearing about my dating catastrophe that I posted two weeks ago. She admits she kind of likes me and wanted to spend more time together. 

I got super happy and excited. I agree and we end up going to this underground rave camping thing in the middle of fucking nowhere. 

There are hundreds of people and she is pretty well known and everyone knows her and I thought that was cool she's popular. I was so fucking wrong. 

I'm going to skip a lot of shit but here are the highlights:

She talks shit about me to everyone saying how she wishes I would go home
She is fucking her best friends boyfriend
Fucking her coke dealer 
Fucking her lsd and shroom dealer 
Going back to the shit talking a few people I ended up talking to told me all the shit she said. Apparently she called me an annoying piece of shit who is pretty pathetic and won't stop following me around. And was wishing I would go home. 

I end up leaving the next morning and driving back home 8 hours the day after I got there and it was supposed to be a 3 day thing.

&amp;#x200B;

she is quite insecure and has anxiety, i truly care about her but just couldnt handle the waiting anymore and seeing how she would try her best to meet up with friends who didnt invite her often and ignored her pretty much and not asking me ONCE.  i decided to end it when she met up with her trainer on a terrace to talk about her coming back to the local sport group. im not jealous in the type of way that she was meeting up with a guy but more in the sense that ive been waiting months and she never could take initiative etc.

&amp;#x200B;

so i decided to end it and did it 1 day later, i asked for her to call and she said she didnt expect it (i ignored her pretty much all day, so she already had asked why i was silent etc) then when i said i wanted to call to talk she said she didnt expect it and couldnt call, then she started about what i said about initiative and wanted to call me the day before to ask to go on a date. i just couldnt believe it anymore so said i didnt want to anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

she responded quite angry and at the end said that she understood my choice but if i ever changed my mind i could text her. i ignored her for 5 hours to cool down and in the meantime she said that i could always text her if something was wrong. i said that i thought that she wasnt ready for this so this was for the better and wished her the best, she responded to that with that with i hope the best for you too and if you ever change mind you can call me, but i dont think you will but just so you know. she also changed her profile picture and status to something as leave me alone.

&amp;#x200B;

i never responded, i got some guilt feelings and decided to sent her a message with an apology for the abrupt ending and that i thought she wasnt ready or just didnt want to date and maybe in the future if everything was okay a casual meetup/drink

&amp;#x200B;

she responded to that with that it was nice of me to send a message and that she regrets for letting me wait so long and that it was sad that it had to go this way and that she agreed that she wasnt ready because she still needs to love herself and that she simply couldnt believe anyone would want to date her even how ridicilious it sounds.and that she needstime to get better and that she still wanted it but that i was right and it was better this way. she also said that she felt sad about it that i thought she didnt want to date because she really wanted to, and that she still wants too but that it for now was better this way, but that she really wanted it but that covid and her mental issues didnt make it easier.

we have had some troubles earlier and then i said that i agreed and we should part ways she started saying as if 'this' didnt mean anything to me and that we could work on it and not give up.

she really has mental problems and i believe that but i just cant believe that if she truly wanted it why didnt she do anything? could her problems be this big really?  she is insecure and has spend days crying about her life etc and being worried that i didnt like her and that she had dreams that i went with another girl and it made her jealous and feel like shit.

i just really needed to vent this and maybe hear others people opinion on this, and maybe get some opinions of people who have the same mental issues(not meant negatively) and can tell me something about this?  i stand with my decision of ending it and said that if she ever got over it she could contact me(im not planning on contacting her again)  sorry for the incoherent mess. i got some previous posts about this same person on my profile so maybe that can give some extra insights?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nqy7lg/stopped_talkingwanting_to_dategirl_with_mental/

I also confused the situation cause I previously said I don‚Äôt have sex unless I‚Äôm exclusive, and then we did it. My mistake and I get that part. But he was very jealous that I was seeing other men while seeing him and he basically gave me an ultimatum.

He said that girls that see multiple men at the same time end up getting a reputation. Honestly since agreeing to be exclusive I‚Äôm now feeling anxious cause I don‚Äôt know that I want to be exclusive with him, I‚Äôm still getting to know him. We have been on 7 dates and there are things I like, and things I don‚Äôt.

I don‚Äôt know what to do.

TLDR feeling anxious after agreeing to exclusivity. Feel like I shouldn‚Äôt have. He got mad that I slept with him while also seeing (non sexually), other men",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nqyz8d/he_got_mad_at_me_for_sleeping_with_him_while/

83,nqz9a1,1622675956,Would You Cancel A Date Due To A Headache?,"Maybe I am a pessimist in this dating world, but I am wondering about this....

Had a second date (with a girl I had a date with a long time ago) set up tonight. I confirmed last night and she seemed to be looking forward to it via text (exclamation points and smiley face emojis), today I texted her to say let's go to a different spot than what I had said last night and she said see you there.

Well, an hour before the date, she texted me saying she got home over an hour ago with a headache, took meds, but they didn't work. To be fair, she apologized, and asked if I am free Saturday, but for whatever reason I just feel like it's a total excuse, could be valid I guess.

Anyways, I said I hope she feels better, no worries, and that yes I could do Saturday. She said thanks and apologized again.

Am I just being negative or would this seem valid to you all/would you actually cancel a date because of a headache? Also, do I follow up with her Friday about it or let her reach back out?

Thanks you from a negative dating thinker.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nqz9a1/would_you_cancel_a_date_due_to_a_headache/

We met up at a local restaurant, got food, got drinks and shared lots of laughs. Afterwards, he asked me if i wanted to continue our date, and we ended up going to a dive bar. He ran into some friends and co workers and we all just hung out. The following day, we hung out all day/night, he took me out for a picnic and we watched the sunset. He was being really sweet, we held hands, he had his arm around my waist, we kissed. He also made it a point to tell me that i was the only girl he‚Äôs talking to. 

My issue is that unless i text him first, he won‚Äôt text me. He was supposed to call me last night, but then texted me instead that he was exhausted from work and going to bed. He does work long hours but I‚Äôm just confused? He said that he wanted to continue hanging out, when i brought seeing him this weekend, he said that he might see me but he already has plans.

Idk if he‚Äôs pulling away at this point. When i asked him if he wanted to continue hanging out, he said he does want to.

85,nqzjlw,1622676848,How should I (m23) respond to the girl I had been talking to and seeing?,"So quick backstory, we met on bumble and it seemed like we clicked on a good level pretty much instantly. We talked for a day or two and she gave me her snap and phone number. She was the first to suggest meeting up. We met up the night before she went on a 2 week vacation. Date went very well, we sat and talked in a tea bar for 4 hours and then went and got food and talked for like another hour and a half. The night ended and we both said we'd like to see eachother again.

We were talking every day for almost a week into  her vacation then she suddenly stopped responding. I waited almost a week then messaged her again, something to the effect of ""hope your vacation is going well can't wait to hear about it when you get back"". That sparked up another convo that lasted a few days then again she just stops responding. So I waited again and finally decided to just ask her if she was still interested in going out again. She said she'd  ""love to"" and asked when I was free. I thought of date idea and said ""x"" day and that didn't work for her. So I said how about ""y"" day and then again she never responded. 

At that point I figured I had nothing left to lose so I just asked her if she was still interested and that there were no hard feelings if she wasn't. Never heard back so I just casually texted her and said I had fun and I can't say I'm not a little disappointed but I wish you the best of luck and left it at that. Now a week after I sent that message she texts me and says how sorry she is and that she's embarrassed with herself that she did that and she's not even going to try and explain herself because there's no excuse. 

Now im not sure if I should even respond or if I do how I should respond. I'd like to think she's genuinely sorry but she also told me she would ""love to"" go out with me again and then just ghosted. I also felt something there with this girl, more than any other girl I've been casually talking to for the last 4 months. I don't want to let her right back in for fear that she's playing games with me but I also don't want to shut the door completely.

86,nqzkkp,1622676933,I found out I was the other woman. What was this dude thinking?,"So this is kinda of a rant/ attempt to understand men...... Because sometimes I just don't know anymore lol.

Anyways, I started seeing this guy in the fall. He's 30 I'm 28. We had talked for several months beforehand and had chemistry.  We work in the same field. He was recently out of a longterm relationship and he had let me know that. He had told me his girlfriend had moved away and that she just wasn't the one but that she  was a great girl. I really didn't have any reason to think he was lying to me. 

We saw each other for about 4 months and I had a nice time. It was during quarantine so I was glad for the company and he was smart/nice. Long story short.... We got in a fight in the winter (a small one and maybe our first ever?) and I hung up on him. I just needed some space and I was irritated at the time. I called him the next day to explain/ make up and realized I realized he had blocked my number and blocked me on social. So I literally had no way to contact him. Everything except for Facebook. I tried messaging him on FB and he doesn't' respond. I was kind of annoyed, but I didn't like him enough to put up with this kind of behavior so I stopped trying. ....

Anyways, about two weeks later I still haven't heard from this guy. Our fight was small so this seemed really weird. He posts a story on Facebook with his ex-girlfriend showing they are back together. And something just felt off.... Like why wouldn't you just say something? I thought maybe they had just reunited... but I thought she had moved to a new state? Never heard from this guy again and this kept bothering me. Something felt off. I didn't want to say anything because I didn't know all the details... but it kept bothering me. 

I found out her name via his Venmo account and did a little digging. A few months later, one of my friends anonymously reached out to her and just let me know he had been seeing other people.... she kept details to a minimum, but gave her enough information. They broke up. I can tell because her social is scrubbed of him. 

My question is..... how did he really think he would get away with this? And why would you do this with someone who works in your field?? Is it just the thrill for these dudes? I really don't understand why you would risk your relationship like this?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nqzkkp/i_found_out_i_was_the_other_woman_what_was_this/
87,nqzok2,1622677287,Guy sprung the date question,"In online dating I usually settle at a pace of talking for 2-3 weeks before meeting someone in person. I check my messages about once every 2 days and it usually involves longer, more in-depth discussion. Typically guys are pretty good at segueing into asking for a date when it seems like we've gotten to know each a little bit, a decent overview.

This guy sprung the date question after a few days. I don't really know him at all. His reply itself was nice but he also mostly ignored the things I was talking about in the previous message, he didn't ping pong the ball back so to speak. Kind of gives me a ""OK I'm bored, I wanna meet now,"" vibe but who knows. There's plausible deniability there because it could be just different preferences or a tactical tumble on his part.

In my experience you neither want to meet too soon or too late. Too late is bad because you may realize you spent a lot of time talking to someone you have no chemistry with inrl. Too soon is bad because it may turn awkward as you run out of topics to discuss because you don't know each other at all.

Yeah IDK, not sure what to reply. It's an awkward thing to reply to. I could be honest and say my meta thoughts on the subject (date too soon = bad), but that's not very fun and not necessarily conductive to actually getting the conversation to start rolling again",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nqzok2/guy_sprung_the_date_question/

I dont know why people wanna use dating apps and not take them serious. This is the second time this has happened to me on Bumble.

She said ‚ÄúOh I dont have any money‚Äù I said I will pay for your drinks its not really that much, then she said ‚ÄúIs it ok if my mom brings me? I dont have a car?‚Äù I was like ‚Äúsure...I dont think it matters who brings you.‚Äù She replied ‚Äúalrighty, see you tomorrow at 8 for drinks‚Äù So the next day comes and I am kind of excited about going on a date with this girl and she texts me 2 hours before we are to meet ‚ÄúI am sorry we cant meet tonight‚Äù After reading that I decided I would just go bowling with my family.

 For a little bit of back ground I've recently moved to a new city, matched with someone on tinder you know how it is. We chat for a couple days and then she goes out of town for a few weeks before we can meet up but that's fine. Now I'm going out of town for like a month before we can go out. 

Anyway we've been talking constantly with each other over the past couple weeks, and I'm super into her and she's said herself she's really into me, and we're completely fine waiting another month for what would be our first date.  

Now I don't know if maybe I'm just dumb, na√Øve, old fashioned or whatever. But when I'm into someone I don't pursue anybody else and if whatever I've got now doesn't work out, then I put myself back out there. But its p obv she's still talking to other people or matches from tinder or whatever. Which I part of me understands not putting all your eggs in one basket but it still makes me feel kinda bad I guess. Like her talking to other people invalidates  what she's said to me, like if she's so into me why bother with other people, does she say the same to them? Are they backups I guess?
