There is an instructor at the gym I go to whom I think is quite cute and has a great personality. It took me months to work up the courage, but I finally asked her out. She said yes at first, but hesitatingly, so I told her no pressure, just be honest. She back peddled and said no, but only because she doesn't date people in her workout classes due to a fairly recent past bad experience she had with doing that. So, I said how about letting me take you out for a social drink instead. She said yes to this.

Fast forward a week and a half and we just had that social drink. My hope was that she would see what a great guy I was and perhaps change her rule on dating guys from her class. The conversation seemed fine, we both had some good laughs, and nothing was really awkward. However, I noticed she did not really dress up to the occasion (which was one sign I was using to try and read non-verbal interest cues). She had limited, maybe no makeup, sandals, t-shirt, hair up in a bun etc. She only had one drink which was another cue I noticed and she seemed distracted and anxious to get going by the end (maybe my negative mind reading into it, she said she wasn't when I asked I she needed to go). She also made several comments that she just wasn't looking to date at this time and that she felt sticking to her no guys from class rule was important (I guess this is the sign right?). 

I am divorced for about a year and this is the first time I have actually felt this in to someone, probably more that I should be at this point, and I'm not really sure why. Not wanting to give up on my hope, at the end of our time together I asked her if she'd be interested in doing a social drink again or a hike or whatever (really open-ended). She said yes, but I've convinced myself it wasn't a wholehearted yes (maybe without any evident to do so). I'm probably in full denial based on what I've said above, but I just cant get my emotions to accept what reality appears to be and it's really bringing me down. 

Objectively, this is probably never going to go anywhere, but subjectively I feel like I'm into her and want to try more. There are legit stories where perseverance has paid off in the dating world. I guess if I knew if she just wasn't into me definitively (maybe my looks, the fact I have kids, whatever) it would make it easier than ""she has a no dating students"" policy (or is this her polite way of telling me she's not into me?!)

My question is this: do I give up and feel like shit for awhile, or do I struggle through emotionally and stay in contact to see if there really is any interest on her end in another social get together (whatever that may turnout to be and in the long run to see if that turns into anything). If I don't just give up, how long should I wait to make contact and what should I say? Would love to hear from both M and F with perspectives.

I replied in an understanding manner and let it be. After that, I began to consistently text her to check up on her and she’d often take hours to reply or not reply at all. She doesn’t respond or return my calls either. However, she would still watch my stories on social media and act like everything was fine when I saw her at church on Sundays. I have been trying to give her the benefit of doubt but now it’s clear as day that she isn’t interested. 

Therefore, I have decided to move on but seeing as we see each other weekly, I am unsure of how to get over her. We’ve been friends for a while and are not strangers to each other. We serve in many organizations together. I would greatly appreciate any and all advice. Thank you so much!

Is this universal, or do some men maintain the most attraction for their partner? 

To be clear: I understand that attraction can't be helped, but steering my mind back to my partner has always been my solution, seeing them as my number 1, etc. But I feel like my partners entertained these thoughts more, and some may have even acted on them.

So after he moved out, I finally texted him asking if he’d like to get coffee or something sometime. I figured that it’d at least lift his spirits. He left me on delivered overnight and then left me on read the following evening. It’s been a little over a week and I still haven’t heard from him. 

I can completely understand why he wouldn’t feel like dating right now, but I guess I was hoping he’d appreciate that I was still interested in him and he’d be open to talking to me, at least. I know it shouldn’t, but it’s really messed with my head and hurt my self esteem. 

I really thought he liked me and even though I’m shy and quiet, I’ve always felt like I’m fairly attractive. Now I’m questioning everything and I feel like anytime I thought a guy was attracted to me, I was just being delusional. 

I feel like if I was actually attractive, he wouldn’t risk missing an opportunity to be with me, no matter how badly he might feel about himself. I mean, he knows I like him enough not to care - I still asked him out.

We were together for 4 years and I think it stemmed from feeling pressured into a relationship that I didn’t entirely want to be in, but that’s not what this is about. I’ve moved on, grown up, and I understand how my actions affected her. 

I recently began talking to a girl and things were going really well. We had already planned multiple dates for different situations in the future and I was incredibly happy. I decided I needed to tell her about my last relationship because I didn’t want to hide anything from her and hurt her and potentially ruin what we had. After I told her she was taken aback but respected my honesty and said we should take some time to both consider what it is we’re actually looking for, and I agreed, because I respect her feelings and don’t want to rush her into anything she isn’t ready for. 

A few days pass and we talk briefly and she, basically, wanted to thank me for being so understanding with her and for being honest about the situation. She had also said she would “definitely reach out” and she “thinks we could get a fresh start once we’re ready”. 

I’ve been incredibly stressed because I don’t want her to just say that as a way to reassure me when in reality she has no intention of actually talking to me again or something, but also I don’t want to feel like I’m pressuring her into a relationship. I feel like the right girl is worth waiting for and, with the way things were going, I definitely felt like she was the right one. I feel like we’re not doing ourselves any favors in not speaking to each other about what our thoughts and feelings are on the situation, but I don’t want to force her to talk about it or seem absolutely insane.

I'm aiming to explore it through a more controlled setting such as online NSFW chatting, and I have *zero* intention of meeting up or starting a real intimate relationship with anyone significantly older until *minimum* mid-20s.

Honestly, think individuals spanning PSH's role in the movie 'Charlie Wilson's War' to the cop Jim Hopper from 'Stranger Things', even to 1990s Quentin Tarantino.. and I don't know why?

I've considered possible 'daddy' / paternal issues, and I don't have an unusual or traumatic relationship with him - if anything, my relationship with my mother is the main source of my childhood issues, so that can't be a factor for me.

To add to this, I'm also disinterested in getting married at all, or having any kids (I'll stay the cool aunt, thank you!). I'm not looking to be dependent on another person if possible, and actively enjoy and pursue aims to remain independent and 'solo' wherever possible (if that's a relevant factor?).

I found this odd because usually when I have been messaged by scammers on dating apps they ask for money within the first day or two at most. ""I need money I'm stuck in xxxx and can't get home"" etc. I work for a cybersec/antifraud company and we actually work with several dating apps so I'm familiar with the many scams on these apps. And scammers usually always ask for money very early on in the convo because it's a volume game: most people won't respond to their request for money so they have to phish as many people as possible in order to get the small percentage who will fall for it.

But I've never seen anything like this before, I even mentioned to this girl it sounded like she was scamming and she sent me a picture of her ID for some reason.

Boy, was I wrong. He said he didn’t remember what he said (he told me he did remember that night the day before) and said he doesn’t have time to date right now due to work and starting school again.

So i Said, cool, then lets meet Next friday. She asked what i had in mind, i told her about a rooftop bar i wanted to go to. She replied ""you thought of a place already! Impressive"". Througout the week we talk on WhatsApp a bit, She sometimes disapears for a day and then replies or i send her another message and She apologizes. Shes not doing anything right now because university hasnt started, mind you.

And this brings us to today. I texted her this morning saying something along the lines of ""are you ready for today?"" And i happened to see She was online at that moment. No reply. Fine. The day went on and no reply. It is now almost 19h and the date is at 21.

Everything was good, and we had good ""chemistry, I would say.

So subsequent dates were at his house where we watched a movie/kissed, and overall we had good physical chemistry, with no sex, so overall, I was pretty happy to have met my match.

&amp;#x200B;

About two weeks ago, we had a wine/card game night where we played a game I had bought on amazon named CONVO and CHILL, so it is a conversation card game with various topics that helps you get to know your partner/friends better. 

We played the game for approximately 2 hours, and it ranged from questions regarding gender roles to love/marriage and so forth.

&amp;#x200B;

As we played, I have to say I discovered so many things about him that were red flags, such as his views on gender roles and so forth.

With that been said, This card game lowered our overall chemistry as I realized how different we were when it came to fundamental topics and that it would undoubtedly be a battle of compromise and so forth if we were to be together.

&amp;#x200B;

I think he realized this as well as he had told me that if this did not work between us, he would love us to stay friends as we have a fantastic flow between us and can speak to hours non-stop in person/via facetime.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyhow, im 24; he is 30, so I have never had a boyfriend but have been on a few dates over the years, so this is my first time utilizing a conversation game card to know a date better.

 It was very much efficient for us figuring out if we were compatible relatively earlier on, but I was also surprised at how this game helped me to truly dig out some things I would not have thought of asking on a 5th date.

I’m a just turned 19yo male who was very quiet in beginning of hs (9th,10th) . Around that time, I talked to a couple girls from my school but never really talked to them in person because I was shy and just weird honestly . I always talked to them on Ig or Snapchat, but never really in person. Looking back at it, I feel like slapping myself. A couple of girls did like me, and did want to form friends but I was to shy and too stupid, and missed plenty opportunities. The girls I liked I never made a proper move, or I’ll just never get a chance, never opened their messages or just left me on seen. In my old hs days, I guess I wasn’t as “cool” or “acted hard” as the other kids around me, and me growing up in a small ghetto town around Philly I grew up all around different cultures and how kids around me were raised a little different from me, and I guess girls liked kids with that lifestyle compared to a more quiet kid in my city. 

I always been a good looking dude, curly hair, lean body, nice eyes dress good stuff ppl would say is attractive etc. I’ve had girls and guys compliment Me for my looks especially since 11th grade, but we’ll get into that soon. In 11th grade is where I really stepped my game up, talked to girls way more in person, ask them out, became more confident and just grew as a person, I always was a nice and funny person , so my personality grew too. I was at a new high school, so I had more ppl to meet too. But the same problem kept on going. There was many girls that I liked and thought were cute, but never batted me an eye. I slide in their dms, tried to contact them but kept taking Ls. I had girls who I did succeed in forming a relationship with or just talking to them, i had a gf for 3 months, but still couldn’t “pull” as many girls as people think I pull and just in general I got rejected a lot . 

I started wondering, what was wrong with me? How come most of the girls I want to attract and fw, ignore me? I was decently popular, good style, good looks, nice and wasn’t in drama. Am I actually ugly? I believed so many things, I compared myself to my brother when he was my age and he was WAY better with girls, and he even says I look better then he did and etc. was it my game? How could it be my game, 50% of the girls I tried to get in contact with in social media never even opened my first message OR follow me back.


Fast forward senior year, I started to work in my game, my social skills , I grew taller, grew a beard, became more confident but even worse luck. Lots of men have the ability to attract girls, but I guess I just couldn’t , I always had to make the move and by then, I was getting rejected left on read etc. Was it the lack of actually confronting girls in person? Does just dming girls not working for me? Would my charm actually work if I go up to a girl at the mall? Nothing ever matched up, fast forward to now I haven’t had a gf, I been through 3 talking stages but in general I still take so many Ls, the girls I wanna match with in tinder don’t match with me, I get left on sent when I dm a new girl 70% of time and when I do succeed with a girl whether it’s if I met them online or in person, it never works or they ghost me. I’m tired of trying to figure out what’s wrong with me, and feel like I’m a loser. I was raised near boys who were bagging chicks way more then me and if I don’t or if I take all these L’s I’m a loser. I guess now I just continue to only focus on getting money, working out and being alone. What if I am just a ugly person? There’s something wrong wit me and I can’t find it. Maybe the mild bullying in middle school affected me in someway.

I just turned 30 and I’m LITERALLY the only single person I know in my family or circle of friends. I can’t talk to anyone about this stuff because none of them them can relate and have zero idea about what today’s dating world is like. I just tried to talk to my best friend who just got married and his advice was to, “I’m sure you’ll find someone eventually.” 🤦🏽‍♂️

Just this past Labor Day weekend I went to one of my friends BBQ/party. She’s married of course and maybe 35-40 people were there. I would soon come to learn I was the only person there not in a relationship; it felt amazing being the 36th wheel 😭

My boyfriend is 45M. My marriage ended in May 2018 because of his severe chronic alcoholism. Exh moved an hour away shortly after he moved out.

I did not date anyone or do any dating for a year after that because i knew i had nothing to offer. I had to heal. So i stayed single and worked on getting divorced.

After my one year was up in May 2019, i started online dating for the first time in my life. What an eye opener. I'd rate the whole experience about 6/10. The only benefit to OLD is access. I am a busy professional in a rural area. So yeah.

I went on about 10 dates with 10 different people. Of hat 10, i dated one for 6 weeks, another for 3 weeks, and then one for 4 months. One ended up annoying me and was too intense, one wasn't over his ex, and the 4 month one, he simply didn't have the time for a relationship and I ended it because 1) he wouldn't and 2) i didn't care about him because of the lack of time investment.

So a year of online dating was up in May 2020. I reflected and decided that it was more toxic than healthy and adjusted accordingly. I got rid of all my profiles and started using ONLY Zoosk at the suggestion of colleague. It's not free so people have skin in the game, and it skews older. I got far less matches, but the ones i got were decent. And the platform requires you to answer questions, etc. 

so in May 2020, my only profile was on zoosk. The summer of 2020 i became disillusioned with it all and by September i was ready to delete that profile and cancel. The reason was that i created a fake profile to see how people lied about their intentions. And gosh, do people lie about their intentions. The abyss looked back at me.

During this time, a few people had messaged me. I did not reply because i was DONE with it after looking into the abyss. One night i was in bed, and this voice popped into my head. It said ""You aren't being fair"". So i logged back in and looked at the messages 2 men sent me. They were decent messages and they had clearly looked at my profile. I messaged both back. After talking to J for about a week, he took me out to nice restaurant and had a great time.

That was a year ago come October 1,and we have been happily together ever since.

The lesson i learned is that you and them, have to want the SAME thing, at the SAME time and WITH each other. Wow, talk about the star having to align. but that is exactly what has to happen.

Also, there are a lot of bad actors and people acting in bad faith- saying they want a relationship, but don't really. Not over their ex, not offering their best, confused about what they want, not logistically in a position to date, seeking validation and attention, already married, criminal records, etc.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,999968,public,self,Another Dating Success Story,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/plrsgb/another_dating_success_story/,all_ads,6,

and I've been trying to date most of 2021. (been on like 8 dates or something, with 7 girls). the only second date was with a young woman who has also been through trauma but was not ready to open up emotionally with me (or presumably anyone).

I am really worried that any woman who hears that I've been in trauma and therapy for it and single and working on myself for a while and not talking to my parents... just too many red flags. Like I worry my positives cannot overcome the damage that things out of my control caused.

I feel I can't really open myself up to women because I believe my true self (all the ""baggage"" if you will) is too much for them to handle. that I am permanently a broken human being...

I am not looking for a woman to take care of me, I can do that myself... I just expect them to walk away because... well because I've had friends stop talking to me after opening up to them. 

Anyways. advice on how to talk about this with women?  Is some of my thinking here wrong? is there things I need to still deal with that are visible to you?

And ranting is useless, but wondering if anyone else here can relate.

Had a mutual breakup under a year ago, I figured it was for the best, she did too. Learned a ton about myself and how to master my emotions, and how to be a better boyfriend. Was completely over it at first. After 6 months, decided I was interested in dating again and tried dating apps for the first time. I came into it convinced there are a ton of girls out there just as good or better than my ex. Now, after putting a lot of time and effort into these apps, I can’t help but realize how statistically rare my compatibility with my ex was, and it’s messing with me.


I’m very driven, take great care of my body, social (naturally extroverted), great career, have a lot of hobbies and usually do 2-3 hours of physical activity a day. I’m certainly not “hot”, but I’m average looking at least. My ex was just as driven, we really pushed each other to constantly be better athletically, professionally and learn new things together. We had the same views politically and shared a lot of hobbies. Both ate very healthy and liked teaching each other new things.
What was great, is I am in a male dominated career, and we were in the same profession. I liked dating someone who I could share my career with, and looking back, I was incredibly lucky, given the ratio.


Going on dating apps has made me realize I might never have this kind of compatibility ever again in my life, and it is really getting to me. It seems finding a woman I click with who shares my career is very rare as is, but throw in someone who has the same drive, love for health and athletics, and loves to grow and learn is pretty darn difficult. I had never done dating apps in my life because I had always really enjoyed being single, I find a lot of joy out of being with my friends. I think you shouldn’t be with someone that you’re merely content with. My “type” physically is actually a big nose, big forehead and plain looking, I’ve never been attracted to the california Instagram girl. My ex was exactly my type physically, instant attraction.

I came into OLD with a very optimistic view of the dating pool, and I now feel like I blew it with a one in a million type girl. Statistically, I’ll likely never find a girl in my career field ever again, and have be okay with keeping my vocational passion to myself for the rest of my love life. I’ve kept an open mind and have matched with people who I’m luke warm on but willing to give a shot. After going on 18+ first dates, it’s been disheartening to not have found any chemistry. 70% of the time: fun people, but little drive, different politics, they’re more religious than initially lead on, doesn’t like being active, no intellectual interests outside of politics or quiet/awkward (nothing wrong with that at all, some men love that, just not my type sexually). 30% of the time, I couldn’t find physical attraction

I know this post will rub some the wrong way, but I can’t be the only one here who wants a partner who pushes them to be better/smarter/healthier every day, and shares the same passions.

All of a sudden , I’m scared I’ll be that ex who can’t move on after way too long has passed by. I already am in fact. She is now dating someone new, that door is closed.

I’m a 30 year old short Asian American working in healthcare. Sadly I am not a doctor or nurse, just a staff member that helps out in labs and research sometimes. 

I had sick parents for most of my life so I was never able to hang out a lot during my 20s. So I don’t have friends that I go out drink with etc. so I don’t really have anyone to introduce me to people either. 

 I’ve also never had a relationship though I guess I’ve been on a few dates. 

I was surprised at how little feedback I get from dating apps, and trying to hit of girls i real life… I just end up being cordial. I guess years of customer service has stuck onto me. 

Generally I like movies and video games, but I also enjoy working out and riding my motorcycles. I like coffee but I’ve noticed it may be to a ailing degree…

This was after a long night of talking and enjoying each other’s company. 

I have never dated a girl in earnest before and I’m kind of nervous on how to act. How should I engage with her differently now that we are “officially dating”? What type of physical relationship should I expect? 

My love languages are service and physical touch. I enjoy holding the door for her, or helping her with homework, or whatever she needs. I really care about her and I want to be able to show it. 

But as much as I desire to help her, I also at times want to embrace and hold her. Growing up that’s just how my family would show love and with my own friends growing up, we would often greet each other with fun handshakes or engage in some horseplay. It’s just how I learned to show love. 

We have both been clear that we fully intend on waiting until marriage, but aside from that, I don’t know what she wants and I don’t want to make her feel uncomfortable by asking her too straightforwardly. She might interpret it wrong and think that is the only reason I want to be with her.

Trying to understand male psychology here! Any help would be great!

I just sent the text to end a casual fling of a guy I was developing feelings for. He told me early on he didn’t want a relationship, so I stuck it out to see if I could handle that. I was (at one point) seeing multiple people, but things faded out with others and it was just this guy at points. As a result, I did start to develop feelings. Of course, in the back of my mind, I wanted him to say he wanted something more in response, but he didn’t.
I’m just tired of meeting people and having it not work out. I know I have personal things to work on of course, but sometimes it really does just feel like there’s something wrong with me and that I’m unlovable. It gets so exhausting meeting new people and being vulnerable just for it to go up in flames again. I know I’ll get over it, but each shitty experience is really disheartening.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1000237,public,self,I know it gets easier but when,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/plvirl/i_know_it_gets_easier_but_when/,all_ads,6,
