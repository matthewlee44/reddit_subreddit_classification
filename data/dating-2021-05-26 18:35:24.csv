0,nlukzy,1622072219,i need advice on this :(,"**i posted this on my last post so read this first:**

so since i was young (16ish) i would approach guys ""online"" that i like in real life and tell them who i was and they'd usually reject me but maybe bc i was not so pretty back then. now, 25, still single, still a virgin, still craving affection, i think im pretty, met a guy i am so interested in yet i am so scared of rejection. i do wear a headscarf (a hijab - im a muslim) so men tend to view me as someone who is not open to relationships or passion or sex.

i met him at a bookstore - he works there - i have been seeing him working there for awhile but never went into the store because id never be prepared, we usually eye each other out but yesterday i came in his bookstore and he asked me if i wanted help, i said yes and asked him if he could find me a ""robert greene"" book and he said he was going to the computer system to look it up so he asked me ""whats your name?"" i told him my name then he said ""no whats the authors name...?"" and i was fully convinced he asked for my name first...i dont know if i embarrassed myself though lol.

he came back and we spoke some more about books, then, i asked him where he was from (he looked middle eastern but it turns out hes from germany) and it was nice to for once just to ask a man where he is from...we then left it at that and now i am at the coffee shop above his book store (he comes up here sometimes) and as im typing this he is underneath the coffee shop and i want to approach and ask for his number so bad but i am so scared of rejection. i did look up his name and found his details but i dont want to invade his privacy and come off as a stalker or a weirdo, i genuinely want to approach him because i know once men see the headscarf, they think the woman wearing it is not open to sin lol.

but god yall have no idea i want to just do so many things with him, i am so attracted to him, and it hurts me so much that he MIGHT reject me. i used to it, but im sick of it. then again, why would he reject me? i am a pretty woman who dresses modestly and is genuinely interested in him, as far as social media, he doesnt seem to be in a relationship, but he has 3 masters degrees...in engineering, physics and maths. so hes definitely not a stupid man. thats why when i said he asked for my name he had this quick reflex thing where im pretty sure he asked for my name.

**UPDATE after 25 days:**

so yesterday, i had this sudden urge to go to the same place and i took my friend with me. i can see him in the corner working in the staff room and he never came around - so i told my friend let me write a little letter to him with my number and give it to a co worker. i wrote ""hi danny, i wanted to approach you today but i never saw you around. instead heres my number -----"" and we got up from the cafe, and i sensed that he saw me and came to THE PLACE I WAS AT and i gave my back to him because i got the worst cold feet. after he left i left and my friend - she gave the card to a co worker and the co worker told her that she would give it to him - so when my friend left she saw the co worker going to him. not sure if she gave it tho.

now, im just a nervous wreck because its been almost 24 hours and my phone didnt light up. let me just say that he looks like a major fuck boy because my friend said he always stares at me but when i look he looks away and rubs his hands and licks his lips acting like hes the shit (this is what i observed from the past month of just studying around that area) so now, half of me is saying hes playing the hard game and the other half is just saying that i did all this for no reason.

i will be avoiding that place from now until i get a responses or something, if i dont, ill wait it out for 3-6 months before i go back there and ask him to his face if he knew anything about this...so now idk. what do you guys think?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nlukzy/i_need_advice_on_this/

3,nlvho5,1622075132,Guy calling other girls hot?!,So I’ve noticed since starting dating a few months back that guys are just super open with saying that other girls are hot. So I’ve been out with three guys where when were together they’ll point out that they think some celebrity is hot and when I told my friend about how it bothers me she would point out that it’s normal for them to fantasize especially since they’re people that they have a small chance with. So I didn’t let it bother until I started seeing this new guy. He seems cool and it seems like he’s into me and I know for a fact that he’s attracted to me but one day when we were driving he started listing multiple celebrities that he thought were hot and kept saying that they were his dream girls. It really made me upset because I feel like when you’re with something who you like you shouldn’t bring that kinda stuff up. Especially since were so new into this too. I wanted to make sure that the intentions between us were clear in case maybe he wasn’t looking for anything serious and that’s why he said that but we’re looking for something more serious so idk.,dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nlvho5/guy_calling_other_girls_hot/
4,nlvhvk,1622075151,I messed up my chances to get her back,"About three months ago I ended things with my girlfriend at the time. In the moment I felt like she didn't care about me but I never really expressed these thoughts with her and kind of just ended it. Well over time I realized how stupid I was. This girl was fucking awesome, super smart, super cute, super caring. And it was me that ruined the relationship. I was too afraid to confront any arguments we had, and that led to me pushing her away to a point where I didn't know what was going on with her. And naturally this made me think she just didn't care so I dumped her. We had dated for about 3 months by the way.

Anyways, over the past month she's been contacting me about small things, which is a good sign she still has feelings. She asked me for my notes for an exam, and occasionally I'd get a notification she was typing something to me but never sent it. 

Well last night I finally contacted her and she responded. I wanted to know how she was doing, and she was responding, but she definitely wasn't enthusiastic with what she was saying. Well I cut the crap and today I sent her a pretty lengthy apology for how I had treated her over the past few months. I didn't talk about how I still had feelings for her, or that I was interested in seeing her again out of fear that I'd overwhelm her. I just wanted her to understand that I knew how I treated her was wrong. 

Well she responded with ""Oh thank you"" to everything I'd said. She saved what I said but still. :/ She's clearly not interested which just sucks.

I'm just wondering if there is anything I did wrong and I'm looking for some advice as to how I can fix this. 

I never mentioned with anything I said over these past couple of days that I want her back, I just kind of said I wanted to make her feel better, so maybe she still thinks I don't want her back? 

Did I fuck up by how I approached her? Because she had been reaching out to me. Do I still have a chance of getting her back?

Did apologizing to her make me seem desperate for love and that turned her off? I feel like she was interested with how she was reaching out, but now suddenly she doesn't seem to want me again. But I feel like if she did still like me she would've really loved what I said. Should I have tried to call her instead?

Is there anything I can do or is this over? I just really miss her. 

All responses are appreciated.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nlvhvk/i_messed_up_my_chances_to_get_her_back/

I’m very serious in a fun way. Like you can’t tell if I’m having fun or I’m being serious. But a lot of the time when I have to be serious I do become serious about my feelings and upfront and emotional.

Sometimes I like to be snarky and I like people to be snarky to me as long as it makes sense and is funny. If it doesn’t then I’ll just consider you a hater.

I want my future partner to be like “You’re pretty stupid sometimes but i find it funny. I like you”
Or
“Why aren’t you laughing with me you little shit?”

I’d often say stuff like.
“Why’re we taking so long to answer simple questions?”

37,nlzqfe,1622090629,Guy I was seeing asked if I still wanted to go on the trip we planned. Not sure what to do...,"I [27F] met a guy [30M] off a dating app about 3 months ago. Things were going pretty well between us and while we were talking he planned a trip with his friend and his friend’s fiancée and asked me to come along. It was going to be to the mountains and The Biltmore House for a weekend. 

Things kinda fell apart between us. I told him I felt like he didn’t have enough time for me (we are 4hrs away) and he got very busy with his family business because his father was going out of town. 

He said we needed to take a break and we stopped talking for a few days. I really liked him and had grown some very strong feelings for him over the course of those 3 months. We had spent 3 weekends together and they were probably some of the best weekends of my life in a very long time 

Anyways, we used to talk everyday and him wanting a break kinda ticked me off and we got into an argument. He said this was over and that if I wanted to remain friends then sure but that’s it at this point.

I backed off and we stopped talking for a few weeks. He texted me to wish me happy birthday 2 weeks ago and we had a small chat and that was about it. Tonight he texted me asking if I was still up for the trip...

I was speechless lol, and I still am. He said we didn’t end on bad terms and we do have mutual respect for each other. He said if we go then we’ll take things slow and see what happens. 

I’m not sure if it seems like he’s being genuine or just misses the attention",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nlzqfe/guy_i_was_seeing_asked_if_i_still_wanted_to_go_on/
38,nlztnb,1622090976,Don’t want to treat this dude as an option. But.,"I (32F) met this guy (34M) on Tinder while rebounding from a relationship. Honestly I was kinda bummed out about it because he was an awesome person and I wished I had met him when I was more healed, rather than basically just prowling for a rebound. The first date didn’t go super well because I thought he was great but I didn’t feel a spark and I realized shortly after that I didn’t actually feel attracted to anyone. So I told him the truth and basically said you know, not a good time for this and I just want to be up front that I’m not going to keep dating you because it’s not fair to you. He said that’s cool and thanks for telling me, I hope we can be friends. And then kept texting me. He asked if we could go play some games at the bar arcade nearby when we both get vaxxed and I said sure. 

Now that things are opening back up, he hit me up and was like hey, so, let’s hang out. I have been seeing people but I am also figuring out that I’m only interested in dating and keeping my options open because it doesn’t make sense to get serious with someone right now. I also haven’t fully bounced back— I can emotionally connect on some levels but I don’t think I can fall in love right now. And I get the feeling that we are not hanging out as friends. He brings a level of energy and effort to this that is definitely not platonic, whether he wants to admit it or not. So I explained to this guy exactly that— I’m basically not trying to commit to anyone and I’m going to be dating but keeping options open unless something extraordinary happens. I don’t want to treat him like an option because he deserves better. He said okay and it doesn’t bother him. But he’s also not seeing anybody else. He makes jokes about us living together. He thinks I am great and loves my dog. He wants to make plans. 

I don’t want to hurt him but I’ve been as honest as I could be and he still seems to want to hang around. Should I just keep going because he’s cool and fun and he has agency, or should I just like, “break up” with him to save us both a potentially crappy situation because I can feel one coming?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nlztnb/dont_want_to_treat_this_dude_as_an_option_but/

43,nlzyzy,1622091569,Girlfriend problems (gaslighting?),"Hi guys,

I hope all is well. I met this girl on bumble around thanksgiving 2020 (6 months ago). I asked her out for coffee and she said that she was being careful due to COVID and the numbers were going back up again in NY. I respected that and I continued to talk to her despite no set date to hang. The way we were talking, we were hitting it off really well and I saw something in her so I wanted to be patient. We did weekly video chat dates and texted most days until we met mid January.

She's been very nervous about COVID, primarily because she lives with her grandma who is 100yo so I totally understand. We had socially distanced dates for like 2months, walking around local parks, and dining out. I cut out going to the gym as I feared getting it there, then giving it to her, thus giving it to her grandma as well. I also tried to go out with my friends early in the week so that if I did get COVID at a bar, well then hopefully symptoms would've showed up before I saw her on the weekend.

The problems started after about 5 dates. The first date she offered to pay, I said no it's okay. I definitely like to pay for the first few dates as the guy. The 5th date, as I went in to get the food, in a nice way, she threw money at me as if to say no no I got this one and she refused to take it back when I said I'll pay. So I said to myself okay she's not a girl who expects a guy to pay all the time so I figured I'd casually bring it up one night saying hey lets just take turns or split the bill instead of us being unsure as to who is gonna pay every time we go out. Well, the next day after i suggested that, she texted me this long rant saying ""I'm at a loss for words, you're grouping me in with your friends talking about splitting checks"", etc. She was pissed and I talked to her on the phone just trying to explain how that's what I was used to in my dating past (I'm not very experienced, I'm 26 and was only in a 5 year relationship before her so that's all I've known) and she went on saying she's never heard of that before, that she's only known me a couple months and that we're already talking about money so it sounds like we're settling down. That's honestly the most ridiculous shit in the world to me. If we were settling down, I would be talking about how much we both make, how much debt we have, how much in savings, not discussing how we're gonna take turns paying at a damn restaurant. So the argument eventually died down and I just went along with what she was used to because I liked her enough to compensate with her on that.

But then the issue arose again in April. We were walking back from a nice time at the park when I just casually said to her how I was going to treat her to something nice today, and then I just said how it's nice to treat each other every once in a while, and that I enjoy being treated too. She thought that sounded weird that I said that. When we got in my car, we looked at food to order on her phone and then I joked pointing out some fast food restaurants on there (she doesn't like fast food but I laugh at her reaction to it whenever i talk about getting mcdonalds with her). Well when she called the order in for a burger restaurant on her phone, the guy asked for her card number to pay for the food. She looked very annoyed as she went to reach for her bag to get her card but she did. On the way to get the food, I asked her what was wrong and she went off saying that ""It's usually the men that treat the women, i don't know why you're talking about getting treated, I'm in for a rude awakening, I don't know whos wearing the pants in this relationship..."" Then she brought up the prior argument about money and that she said every time since, she's had that argument in the back of her mind when i go to pay for food for us. Again, eventually the argument settled down.

We've had a few other issues since, like how I told her I'm not really the type of guy to open car doors every time we go out but I wouldn't mind doing it on big fancy date nights for her or in front of her mom as her mom raised her like that. Well she blew that up into an argument and the last problem was a week ago when she took issue with the fact that I wasn't very engaging in our conversation when I asked her about her day. Admittedly, yes, I wasn't very engaging but I told her that I was just tired from work/all the interviews I've been doing as I'm trying to change jobs but I just enjoy laying there and listening to her voice while she talks about her day. She blew that up into an argument and we haven't really spoken since. This was last Thursday.

My point is, I feel like I've done so much for her but haven't gotten much in return. She's blowing things up and it's like she takes issue when I give my defense/side of the situtation and says that I don't care about how she feels and such.

45,nm01sm,1622091864,"Just got yelled at, twice","I've been seen this guy for a little less than 2 months. We had always met at my place because his apartment is almost empty and he just started to purchase furniture. Today is the second time we spend time at his place. We decided to cook and maybe go for a walk later. (F33, M36)

While he was cooking one of his neighbors was outside riding a motorcycle with an extremely loud exhaust, back and forth, round and round. At one point I couldn't stand it anymore, I almost shouted out loud, but quieted after one syllable. He told me to not yell. 

Then I got up to close the window, he told me not to. I said I had to or else I was going crazy, as I closed the window. When I sit back down I saw this annoyed face of him, disgusted even. I asked him if he was annoyed and if he wanted me to open the window again. He denied it, told me everything was good, that he just didn't want me to yell.

A minute later we were getting ready to eat. He told me to move his laptop on the desk to make room for my plate. (No furniture, no table.) So I closed his laptop and moved it away a bit. And he got mad again. Obviously by ""move the laptop"" he didn't mean I could close it up because he had unsaved work. 

I apologized and sat down to eat. He sat a few feet away behind me. I started crying because, A) PMS, B) it's hard to be yelled at by someone I just started to trust and open up to.

We didn't talk the entire time we were eating. 10 minutes later I stood up and told him I was going home. He asked if I was OK, I didn't answer. He said ""I'm talking to you."" and I opened the door and walked out. He just locked the door behind me.

After I got home I texted him to come and get his jacket that he left at my place a few days ago, otherwise let's not meet again. He texted back ""what happened, I'm confused.""

50,nm0lf6,1622094078,How to get over someone who doesn't know what they want?,"I (19F) have matched with this guy (19M) a month ago and we had an amazing first date, when I say amazing I mean the conversations got better and better, emotional at some parts, and we ended up spending time together deep into the night. After that, we've been meeting once or twice a week and we've spent the night 3 times together. The issue is, I have no idea what he wants.

In the beginning, he was very affectionate and he would compliment me often but now I feel like I am the affectionate one. When I try to do something nice for him or compliment him he refuses to take my kindness because of his low self-esteem and feeling like he doesn't deserve it. He was broken up with 2 months ago and I think he is still somewhat upset about it, he says he doesn't know what his identity is outside of a relationship since he's pretty much always been in relationships. 

On one hand, I feel like I should steer clear and look for other people. I am still on the apps since obviously the thing between us is not committed yet so I am on the lookout, but I am having a hard time letting go of this. I find him very attractive, I love our conversations, and I feel very comfortable spending time with him. If I don't text him he'll text me and he will randomly do something kind which keeps me on the hook but he never initiates meetings. I haven't initiated in a week at this point and he's leaving for his hometown soon for a long time so if he doesn't initiate we won't see each other. Does that mean he's not interested?   


TL;DR -- This guy doesn't know what he wants but I feel like I'm still on the hook, should I stick around? If not, how can I get over this?

51,nm0t40,1622095021,Had a serious talk with an ex that I had been anticipating...,"35f I just had a deep talk with an ex 32m. We finally how had ""the talk."" I knew it was coming for a while where we'd really get into things. I felt he wanted to discuss it too.

I basically told him how I felt he did me wrong &amp; how I felt he lost interest &amp; started liking another female. How he pushed me away &amp; hurt my feelings. 

He tried to deny it saying it was bc of his business &amp; that he wouldn't have been able to give me the time and attention I needed. 

I said that was partly true but I felt there were other factors too. I knew he was lying &amp; I knew there was another girl he fell for. It ended up not working out with them but by then I'd moved on.

I moved on pretty quickly actually. We didn't date long but we were friends before but the ending really destroyed our connection after that as he really betrayed my trust I felt. He told me he didn't want a relationship then even though he pushed for one initially. 

Now he seems like he wants one &amp; he even told me just now that he really likes me a lot &amp; likes spending time with me. I told him thanks &amp; that I liked (past tense) him a lot too but that after the way he treated me in the end forced me to walk away &amp; move on.

And I did. I met someone else &amp; quickly fell for that guy. He was the opposite of the other guy. Really sweet, gave me time &amp; attention, made the effort. Unfortunately it didn't last with that guy. I actually even saw myself setting down with this guy. Things felt simple &amp; uncomplicated but thats what I wanted.  I didn't want any drama &amp; the last guy was drama.

Unfortunately I realized this one wasn't ready for a relationship too despite how good &amp; calm our connection was, it ended too. 

When I reconnected with the first guy (mainly to get some sort of closure &amp; just to see how he's been doing) he apologized to me for the past but I knew it didn't make up enough for me to go back to him. We hung out a few times, but I knew deep down even if I gave him another chance it still wouldn't work out. I also realized that I couldn't get past our differences &amp; my heart just wasn't in it anymore. I cared but I just didn't want a relationship &amp; I told him that tonight.

That I didn't want a relationship with anybody, and that for once I'm ok with being single bc I'm not hurting &amp; I'm taking care of me. He liked the comment but he didn't respond after that. I knew he probably took it personal but I had to say it &amp; it felt good to say it bc I knew he wasn't being honest with me about the past &amp; was just hoping I'd forget &amp; take him back but I can't bc I saw a side to him I didn't like &amp; it was enough to not make me trust him again.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nm0t40/had_a_serious_talk_with_an_ex_that_i_had_been/
52,nm0x6n,1622095497,Stage Nine Clinger,"My (F20) bf (M20) and I are glued at the hip. We have been dating for almost 6 months and we are pretty inseparable. We see eachother at least 4 nights a week staying at eachothers places. This week we spent Thursday night- Wednesday morning with eachother. We have been very attached to eachother from day one as we have just clicked so well. We plan to move in together as soon as we can afford it. (Before anyone says anything he is just as clingy as me and I am well aware how this could potentially lead to codependency issues). 

This morning he left for a 10 day international vacation with his family and I'm not sure what to do with myself. He has been gone for just over 13 hours and just knowing he's not here is killing me. The nights we don't spend together we talk on the phone for at least an hour at night.I took a three day girls trip with some friends from hs about a two weeks ago and even then we would talk at night. Outside of him (and work) my social circle is pretty limited. My life consists of school, work, house chores, and him. I will be starting classes again on June 1st so hopefully I can try and meet people... With that being said after hs I've had trouble making friends. This past semester I thought I made a friend. We studied together every Sunday and she even spent the night. Now when she rarely answers my texts it's days after and I haven't seen her since the final for the class. I know making friends outside of him is important but don't know where to start??

I guess what I'm asking is how do I cope with his absence. My bed feels so empty without him and it's only night 1...

54,nm141r,1622096346,25 Can’t get a girlfriend,"Let me start off by saying I’m a pretty good looking guy and I don’t in any way mean that in a braggy way.  I’ve always had anxiety and in highschool this affected me as I definitely didn’t see myself as good looking and I was pretty shy around friends and girls. Flash forward to university and I started going out more. As I went out more I started to notice that a lot of girls were interested in me. I would have girls come up to me and start conversations and want to dance and get drinks etc. I found I didn’t have to do nearly as much work and conversation as my friends did to go home with girls and sleep with them. I found a lot of the girls I met and brought home were going home with me based on looks generally. My friends who I had met throughout university saw this and kept saying how I was great with the ladies and kept asking for advice on how to get ladies and I just kinda laughed them off and was thinking “ man I don’t even know how I do it !”.  Now some of the girls I take home I try to start conversations with the next days but it always fizzles out within a week. It just made me feel like although these guys and girls think I’m this ladies man who can get what he wants I still don’t really know how to talk to girls and build that relationship, Basically I’m a fraud. I keep having this feeling that when girls get with me and start talking to me they think that I’m going to be this guy whos going to sweep them off their feet , basing this on my looks,  and then when they see the personality doesn’t live up to the bar the good looks have set they leave. I feel like this empty hole I’m feeling I just fill up by sleeping with girls to get some type of connection however when I want more it always seems to never work out. Is there any way I can get past the initial meeting of looks and build a relationship with a girl ? Should I be meeting girls in different places? How should I approach the scenario in my head where I feel like my conversation has to live up to the high bar my looks set? Lastly should I set my standards lower ? I’ve had a couple girls I talked to that were nice however, and this will sound judgemental, I didn’t feel as attracted to them on their Looks as I thought I should be to form a strong relationship if that makes much sense. Any advice would be great . Sorry if that sounded cocky or douchey , I’m not trying to be at all it’s just what my experiences have been like. 

Side note: is there any book suggestions on how to express your sensitive side and communicate your feelings? Not many people know this about me but I’m a pretty sensitive guy and I keep my feelings in a lot of the time.

Tl;dr- I was shy in highschool and didn’t realize my good looks until university where I slept with lots of girls. I can’t find a relationship however and I feel like this Persona of being a ladies man is a fraud.

62,nm1qx9,1622099256,(TIPS for some of you for a happier future) If you're a guy stop wasting your time with online dating and their corresponding apps,"First I wish the best of those who used these platforms successfully. Congrats to you I hope you will be happy in the purest form. 

To the others: OLD is a waste of time that could be used better elswhere in your life. 

So you started online dating and the matches are or aren't there. First you feel good or bad from the start depending on success. Then if you've got matches you start dating and realize how many worthless women are out there. They literally add nothing to your life apart from physical aspects meanwhile you waste your time with them or on these apps instead of developing yourself, your skills or your health.

To the ones who barely got matches or no matches at all that's alread a good indicator to improve yourself in the first place. Go out there socialize, get fit, find a passion a hobby, learn something new every day instead of wasting your precious time or your money swiping away.

Most of the girls/women on these platforms are princesses. All they care about is to get attention for their fragile egos. If they're wasting their time on these apps that means they have nothing better to do, there isn't enough going on in their lives. And that's already a big red flag. They are there because no one wanted them or are socially inept.

I'm not saying the dudes are any better I just don't know the other side.

A man's worth for a woman exponentially grows as his hustle gets better. It is just biology they are instinctively looking for a man who can take care of himself. No need to be a leader type or the alpha of the pack just have your life together. 

Successful people aren't on these platforms because they don't have time for it. OLD gives them no value.

So go out there and live your best life. Be better than you were yesterday, live your dreams or work for them and relationships will find you in the most organic way. Also you'll have a much better story to tell later when they ask you ""How did you meet?"".",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nm1qx9/tips_for_some_of_you_for_a_happier_future_if/

I also sent her my message so it she’d know what I said. The morning later she hadn’t responded to my message and after some thought I realized what I did was out of line and something I should’ve just left to her so I sent her an apology, which she has yet to even acknowledge exists, and hoped for the best. I thought after thinking I knew her well for what feels like a long time 1 1/2 years she is just basically blocking me out of her life with zero explanation other than what I assume is because I spoke out of line to a kid she barely knows and will probably never speak to again. (also as a side note my messages stopped after my apology which was short and sincere so I know I wasn’t message spamming or anything) I feel like I at the very least deserve to hear why she doesn’t want to speak to me so I don’t have sit spend my work day wondering why the hell she’s so pissed off about something that seems so arbitrary. But anyways a few days into it I’ve heard from some mutual friends that she and her close friends are angry at me so now I guess I’m either really getting the short end of the stick or I really am supremely at fault for some stupid impulsive thing I said. I just hate how this whole situation is being handled and that I’m literally just grasping at straws and crying in my car trying to get myself ready to maybe move on.

71,nm2wzl,1622104446,Valid excuse for wanting me to leave after sex?,"So I have a bit of a situation here. I met this guy 7 months ago. He talked about exclusivity from the beginning. When we talked about relationships he said he wanted to go slowly but he seems to have little time. His job demands a lot of time and is studying on the side and has family in another city so we see each other once every month. He always says that we need to do things other than sex and get to know each other better but meeting once a month we need the sex so that's what we end up doing. For context, I already told him sometimes I feel unconfortable just having sex and leaving. 

So for this last date, he told me to go to his house and that we'd have dinner together after that. I planned for that and actually didn't even get something to cook for myself that night. We had sex like usual, spend quite a lot of time pillow talking and cuddling, had sex two more times and then fell a sleep for a bit and when I woke up he looked at his phone and it was almost 10 pm and he said I'm so sorry I have to get to work at 7 am the next morning so let's leave dinner for another day, I owe it to you. 

I don't know whether that is a legitimate excuse (it was still early?) or he just got tired of me being there given that we already had sex enough times and he needed me for nothing more. And I need some insight to see what to do because I have feelings for his man and after 7 months he called me 'my love' for the first time and I thought we were progressing... That date made me feel otherwise.

I feel horrible of how I made her feel. Afterwards during the car ride back I texted het to tell her there is no excuse and that I am genuinly sorry. Can someone advise me on how I can rectify this?

I met this girl on Tinder and we really hit it off. She also just got out of a relationship and we related on a lot of levels. We spent a week talking every night, had some videocalls and played videogames. We were flirting a lot and I was having a lot of fun.

Days later we had a date and it was actually amazing, best date I ever had. We kissed, held hands, and had a lot of fun. She told me she rarely connects with someone so quickly, and that it felt like she had known me for a long time. That made me smile because I felt the same way. Then suddenly things started going downhill and she became very distant. We had one more date, it was fun but less exciting than the one before, I felt a bit hesitant because she had been so distant.

After the second date she told me things were moving a bit too fast for her and she still had trouble leaving her ex behind and all that kinda stuff. Basically said she wanted to take a little pause. All of this was a month ago.

I was OK with that. Now this has all been weeks ago, so last night I decided to text her and check how she was doing. I was hoping that maybe she was willing to pick it up where we left off.  
Basically she told me she was doing better, but she also told me she had gone on a date with someone else and had a lot of fun. Obviously not what I wanted to hear but I know we weren't exclusive so she can do whatever she wants. However when I also tried to arrange a date she told me she doesn't think she can see more than just being friends.

That made me feel really sad because we had spent so much time talking, relating, and were having a lot of fun. I feel a bit lead on as things got frisky at some point as well but now she's sort of backing out? I understand she doesn't owe me anything at all and is her own person. But I don't understand at all how things have gone downhill so quickly while we were having so much fun. 

I hate myself for liking her so much and getting so attached to someone so quickly. I just really liked talking and connecting with her, and it frustrates me how I don't understand what I did wrong. Now I'm feeling sad and semi jealous about someone who isn't even my girlfriend.

Hoping if someone has advice for getting over rejection and stop myself from getting attached to quickly. Dating is more difficult than I thought.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nm6mv2/how_do_i_stop_getting_too_attached_and_dealing/

Im a University student(19Y/M) and me and this girl have been hanging out alot recently. I’ve never had a girl as a good friend before so I can’t tell the difference between what is flirting and what is not lol. All my life, my friends have been mainly dudes. For example, me and this girl had food together and she fed me some of the food from her fork and then I fed her back some of mine. (is this flirting or do guy and girl friends do this?) 
I could never imagine doing this with my guy friends lmao. We have been hanging out for about 1 month now and Im planning to ask her out on a date in a few days since I think she might like me aswell. Do I be upfront and say “Hey can I ask you something, do you wanna go on a date with me sometime?”, how do I go about asking her on a date? Any advice appreciated (I’ve gotten advice to ask her out but how do I imply its a date, do I be straightforward ?)

97,nm88gi,1622124383,How to really charm this guy,"I’ve (22f) been talking to this guy for a while. Like actually over a year but bc of pandemic, I live 4 hours away, and some other personal stuff, we haven’t managed to meet up. Honestly a big reason also is that I’ve been so nervous. I know he’s into me but I’ve been so nervous to meet up still bc every time I see him my mind goes blank. I could barely talk to him when we worked together bc I literally could not think of a single thing to say.

I just want to really blow him away when I do meet up with him. I need at least a few things to say initially when I greet him bc I know I’ll go blank and I don’t want to look lame or awkward. Maybe some ways to keep the convo going or tips for keeping cool.

I feel like in general I can be charming, fun, and cute even if I’m nervous but I have no idea how to do that around him. I want him to see me as smart, mature, relaxed, fun, and all around have him as enamored with me as I am with him. I really want to connect with him and not have that blocked or ruined by my nerves.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nm88gi/how_to_really_charm_this_guy/
98,nm8don,1622124811,DAE feel like they're just doing something obviously wrong and can't figure it out?,"I want to start off by saying I'm really not trying to make this a ""Oh, why don't women like me"" post. I'm positive that many women do, just not the women I'm attracted to. I also don't want to make it seem like I'm expecting anything from anyone; no woman owes me shit and vis versa. That said:

I constantly feel like I'm making some mistake that I just can't figure out and which drives women away from me. I can't figure it out anymore. Ever since my ex-fiance and I ended things four years ago, I've been working on myself and I've been comfortable and secure with who I am for at least two years, but haven't gotten a single positive response from anyone I've asked out lately. I'm not horribly unattractive, a little fat but tall, incredibly strong, and talented. I play guitar and sing pretty well. I make amazing food. I have a good job. I make furniture as a hobby. I'm incredibly kind and compassionate; the first to help anyone I see who needs it. I'm occasionally funny and witty. I'm well-read, have a great taste in music, and live a generally interesting life. I'm not timid or shy. I'm not absurdly confidant, but I have pretty good self-confidence. 

I just don't get why literally none of the women I'm attracted to ever say yes to me asking them out. I'm not trying to whine or complain, but I feel like maybe I'm not saying something right, or doing something I should be? I don't stink and take care of myself. If it were just like a few people saying no, I'd be ok with that. But it's not. It's like the last 20 women.

99,nm8gyj,1622125072,Should I call him out on his flakiness or just bow out quietly?," So! This past year a guy I knew in high school looked me up on facebook, said that he sees me walking past his place every day and said he would love to connect sometime. We have since texted pretty frequently, and gone on several walks. He always seems very interested and flirtatious, and we always have a nice time.

The thing is, he has a tendency of being flaky. He will make plans with me face to face, and then just not text. Several times this week we've made plans and then I do not hear from him until a few days later.

Here are the reasons I am tentatively reserving judgment: he has been diagnosed with ptsd this past year because of an incident, he is very busy (I've seen what he has going on, and he legitimately is), he has recently gotten out of a relationship, and... he has said that he hates social media and texting (hmm. ok)...

What I am wondering is... should I call him out on it and ask 'are you actually interested? cause there are other guys I could invest my time in right now.' (just in a friendlier tone)... or should I just bow out without saying anything?

I just know that if I leave it as is I will keep yoyo-ing back when he shows up.

Thanks everyone!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nm8gyj/should_i_call_him_out_on_his_flakiness_or_just/
