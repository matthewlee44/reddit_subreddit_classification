0,q7x0ml,1634207788,Which is better?,"Usually when I (28m) meet an attractive woman through my social circle (which is large- not tryna brag, just context), I try and ask her out after the first meeting by getting her number/insta/whatever. 99% of the time this leads to rejection. Possibly the woman's guard is up, possibly it comes off as if I'm in a hurry or desperate, and possibly my best personality features may take more than one interaction to shine. 

I'm thinking now what would be better would be befriending them for a bit until they get to know me/my personality better and vice versa. Many of the overtures I do get from women are those I am friends with. Unfortunately, I'm not attracted to them for one reason or another. 

My concerns are this:  
1) Coming off as inauthentic - Is the friendship real if I'm attracted to them?

2) Getting friend zoned - if we start off as friends that could be all they ever see me as.

24,q7zd4l,1634216877,Weird experience came up in my mind...,"It happened before I met my bf so it was years ago but it suddenly came up in my mind so I thought I'd share...

So I was talking to this guy I swiped right on Tinder and everything went well. We talked about sports, cars, favorite food etc, and decided to meet somewhere to grab a drink or something. 

The night before we met we were talking about how I hated my neighbor for having late parties blasting music till 3am and stuff, and I'd call non-emergency PD to have them knock on their door to lower the volume. After that convo he didn't say a word, till the next day he didn't reply my texts nor say a thing. 

The next day, couple hours before our meet-up I texted him and asked if he's upset or something wrong and did he still wanna go out etc, and he said something like ""I don't think we're a good match"" and that was about it. 

Part of me think that he probably likes to party till late too or he thinks I'm a Karen of calling cops (although it's non-emergency) on my neighbor etc. But the other part of me think that my neighborhood is not the nicest neighborhood in town and we have no men in my household so I don't wanna go over there and get in trouble and stuff(I also talked to the neighbor in person couple times but they still doing it). 

Also, it does hurt my feelings and self-esteem being rejected couple hours before our meet-up, and I'd rather he said so right after our convo than have me hanging till the next day to be disappointed. I didn't reply after that ans deleted all the messages and even his contact from my phone.

Couple days went by he texted me with a hi or how you doing, which I didn't reply. My mind at that time was like wtf dude, you rejected me and now it's a fresh start??The for the next couple days he'd constantly text and see if I reply, which I ignored. Finally I replied a single ""What"" sunce it had been a week of him texting me, and he said ""how you doing"" and I just blocked him.

Everybody I seem to come across is a huge adrenaline junkie or seems almost proud that they make bad life choices or aren't really a nice person. I don't think I've actually ever seen a person in my area who is happy being an introvert and focusing on hobbies instead of thrill seeking or clubbing. 

I'm not knocking that stuff, each to their own, but it just seems like softer introverted people do not exist anymore, or at very least do not use any sorts of dating platforms. I seem stuck in a cycle of dating or talking to totally unsuitable people who immediately try to get me drinking alcohol or turn me into an extrovert, and I just want somebody genuine and quiet.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q81rax/dating_as_an_introvert_is_tough/

The next thing this I how I feel personally and what I've witnessed first hand and the challenges of trying to date outside your race. I'm not saying that interracial dating is bad I love interracial dating I think it's amazing. I hope it continues to be a thing. I'm speaking from being a very dark skinned black man who lives in rural area in the midwest that doesn't have many black people. In which I am not originally from this area I moved here as a teenager. 

I feel like I'm at such a disadvantage when it comes to trying to get the attention and getting to white women im attracted to especially the ones who didn't grow up around many black people.  There's this were awkward feeling that they don't know what to say how to interact with me. I've seen many white women I have found attractive that they can go up to guys of their same race and have not a problem talking and starting conversation with them. Then when it comes to me it's like they're waiting for me to start conversations or ask a question. It's just an awkward feeling.

 I think maybe it's because they weren't raised around people outside their race and if they did interact with black people it was only through clubs at school such as sports. But when when it's just trying to get to know someone of a different race it's difficult to interact with them. So that's why I think it's tough for me to find success as a black man when it comes to dating outside my race.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q81ysd/i_feel_like_as_a_black_man_it_is_very_hard_to_try/

43,q825z2,1634225688,I hate being single,"I will be 26 in two weeks. Let me tell you a bit about my dating history. 

I didn‚Äôt have my first date until I was 22 and I only went on four more dates until I met a guy named ‚ÄúMark‚Äù last year. That was first real relationship and it only lasted for five months.  

A few days after I broke up with Mark, I met a recovering alcoholic on Hinge named ‚ÄúLuke‚Äù and we became fast friends. I fell so head over heels for Luke that if he had asked me to get him a diamond ring, I would have scoured the ends earth to find one for him!!! I would have done anything for this guy as long as it was legal and safe (and a part of me still would!). But he fell in love with someone else and I nearly had a breakdown over it. And despite everything‚Ä¶..I still keep in touch with him because he is still an amazing friend and an absolute angel.

In August, I formed a bit of an acquitanceship with a coworker named Steve. I took a bit of a shine to him and yesterday I gave him a note that pretty much said: ‚ÄúHey, you seem like a cool guy and I would like to get know you better so I was wondering if you would like to go on a date.‚Äù I even included my phone number in the note in case he wanted to reach out that way. Today is my day off and I still haven‚Äôt heard from him. So, I guess it‚Äôs safe to assume that he‚Äôs not interested. 

And also‚Ä¶‚Ä¶before anyone tells me that giving him a note was cringey‚Ä¶.please understand that asking somebody out in person is extremely anxiety inducing for me and that was the only way i felt comfortable with taking such a risky move.

I talked to Luke crying about it and asked what it is that I am lacking. He told that he doesn‚Äôt think I am lacking anything but i don‚Äôt buy it. After all, if that was the case then why did he chose someone else over me?

I am just at my wits end. I just want ti know what it‚Äôs like to love and be loved and feel wanted, needed, and whole. But maybe I should come to grips with the fact that maybe there‚Äôs no soul mate for me and that‚Äôs a bit soul crushing‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.üò•üò•üò•üò•üò•üò•üò• Being single really isn‚Äôt fun at all and I am just exhausted.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q825z2/i_hate_being_single/

It wasn't a mutual break up because it was all decided by him and even to the last minute I was still trying to convince him to come back. 

Throughout the 3 years, I wouldn't say our relationship is smooth. We would have little misunderstandings here and there. Its mostly caused by my anxiety, making me panicky and always resorting to him as a safe blanket. I was also clingy which would make him uncomfortable sometimes. Meanwhile for his side, he'd often get jealous when I hang out with someone and would punish me real hard verbally when I am in my anxious period.

Despite those things, i try to learn and make myself better everyday, for the last few months, i have been less clingy, more understanding and i didnt pour him with all of my problems. He said he can see me changing but one day I happen to nag about him because he cant accompany me to shop and there it is, the start of the break up.

Its hard for me to cope because i always care and have feelings about me. Heck i would even sacrifice my preference or my demands just to make him more comfortable in the relationship. 

He wanted space so I'm giving him space but how long should this go? Should i keep pursuing him or move on?
If we do get back together again, im willing to be a better person for myself and for him.

Oh another thing. Last night i asked him what are we now, cause we're still meeting and talking. And he said i can still talk and meet him without limits until i can forget him...i said i dont think i can because i love him and have been with him for quite some time. With this statement of his?

Second date was a week after and I payed $200 for this one. I went all out, left work early to get a haircut, bought her roses, picked her up and we dined at a nice Italian restaurant.. food was fire.

Initially she felt pushed into a corner, like she was given an ultimatum. I had to explain to her that it wasn't me trying to pressure her or stress her out. I just have immense feelings for her and couldn't not share. Also that we're both just existing as single people and are free to do whatever. 

Unfortunately, she isn't quite there (yet?). She affirmed her feelings for me and that she just needs more time, and moves slower. 

I can't help but scale back a little from where I stand with her, and am heavily considering opening back up to dating other people. No hard feelings and she can find me if she wants.

We hang up and I blame his absence on the personal issues. But I'm feeling confused because he says he wants to see me soon, arent doing anything the next day, but doesnt reply to my invitations about hanging out. So I confronted him about that, and if ""thinking about us"" meant that he meant we shouldn't see each other anymore. We talked on the phone again earlier and he confirmed that - he wasnt feeling chemistry/connection. Maybe it was because both of us aren't good at talking together...

So I'm left here, very very confused. Everything was fine up until 2 weeks ago! I just can't believe I'm SO bad at reading people? Or if hes a really good actor? Maybe it was something else but he wants to be nice so blaming chemistry?

59,q83x0f,1634230857,How often to talk in a relationship?,"I (24M) have been dating my girlfriend (19F) for a few months now.

Initially we started off with she having a crush on me and leading to us making out. We only spoke to make plans to meet (once a week maybe) but overtime we got emotionally attached and started talking a lot more.

A few goodmorning/goodnight texts and a few memes in between and calls every other day (for 1-2 hours minimum)

However, recently in the past few days, our talk seem a bit irregular. They seem a little bit dry (even though there's romance and flirting involved).

I call her every other day but I got the feeling there are moments of ""what should we talk"" after a while. I asked her ""Do you think the excitement of talking has died down a little?"". She said ""A little bit because we meet (twice a week) and we already share everything what's there to.

In the past I've been in relationships where we talk for hours on day (in the initial few months of honeymoon stage) so the feeling of excitement dying down made me a little worried.

However, whenever we do meet, the passion is definitely there. We can't keep us off each other.

My question is ""Does keeping the frequency of talking a little less healthy for our relationship in the long run?"" Or the fact that there's a slight feeling of excitement dying a sign for me.

One thing I'll mention is both me and my girlfriend are introvert. Even if she doesn't talk to me, it's not like she's talking to someone else. She mostly stays at home and prefers sleeping or working. She says not talking to anyone gives her mental peace.

How often do people talk in relationships? Am I contributing to the excitement dying due to excess contact?

It was a long distance two different countries relationship. It started out with just talking and casual keeping in touch, not much. Then after some months it felt like this could go somewhere. It got a bit serious. We got exclusive.

My mistake was when I kept asking him to come on video calls he refused saying that he was too shy and I kept feeling like nobody could be too shy. But I didn‚Äôt push hard for him to come on video. I completely agree it was very stupid of me to keep carrying on without knowing the pictures I saw was of the same guy. I trusted too easily and didn‚Äôt do background check because I felt why would someone stick around for 1 year and more and lie about who they are.

I finally came to US and when we were about to meet, he video called me and I saw him for the first time. Till now it was only on pictures. I was honest about everything. Hell broke lose when I saw him on video. He was some other dude. When I confronted him about it, he said he wanted to tell me if it got real. By the time it did, it was too late and he was scared to lose me. He mentioned that he only used some other dudes pics and shared when I insisted to send his pictures. Everything else was him. At one point his WhatsApp picture was also the other dudes pic who I thought was my boyfriend :( .

How do I believe anything he says. He didn‚Äôt tell me who that guy was in the picture when I asked. He feels guilty for doing this and said it was immature but I don‚Äôt honestly know what to do. Yes my fault I didn‚Äôt ask for video calls but I always thought he is an introvert and is shy. I personally am someone who isn‚Äôt a video call person either but I never lied about anything. üò¢

I have blocked him. I waited for 1.5 years to meet him and when it was about time this is what happened.

I wanted someone to know. I seriously don‚Äôt know if I should reach out to the other dude and tell him his personal pictures are being used. I found who that guy was with reverse image searches. But it turns out he is already married from a couple of years. Apparently my so called bf and this picture dude were friends. I don‚Äôt know the details but I‚Äôm not sure if I should reach out and tell him that it‚Äôs an identity theft as in using pictures of him. But now knowing that he is married I don‚Äôt want to disrupt anyone‚Äôs married life. On the other hand I feel if I don‚Äôt speak up it could happen to others too‚Ä¶

I feel stupid, broken and hopeless. Just want to say to everyone out there do video calls.

64,q8451e,1634231514,Reassuring yourself when your parents don't - my mum told me she is embarrassed by me because I'm single at 31," I've had a bad experience with relationships, mainly boyfriends treating me like I'm not good enough. My mum tells me people change and I should've given them chances. These are men who stood me up, cheated on me, told me I could surgically enhance myself to become prettier.

I'm 31 and single, and my mum acts so ashamed of me, she told me that she lies to her friends that I'm seeing someone but want to keep it quiet because it's embarrassing and keeps telling me ""younger ones"" are coming and soon no one will be interested in me.

What can I do in moments like these? She has never been a shoulder to cry on because she always makes it about her. 

One day I called her crying because I felt so lonely. She said how do you think I feel my only daughter isn't in a relationship. I can't articulate how hurtful it is to hear these things from my own mother. I would love to be settled with someone I love and who I feel loves me and we have a great relationship. It hasn't happened yet but I would love it to. 

I spent many years in counseling and finally have a strong sense of self after living for others (parents, siblings, friends) for 30 years. That I'm grateful for, an opportunity to genuinely think about what I want from life as an individual rather than catering to and being someone to help others feel more comfortable all my life.

65,q8455a,1634231523,Giving a gift on the second date?,"So I met this girl on a dating app a while back and we started chatting and getting to know one another, met her for coffee for an hour or so about 2 weeks ago and we hit it off rather well so I asked her out for a ‚Äòreal‚Äô date that weekend, to which she accepted.

On the second meeting I took her to a gallery and we went through it talking about the paintings and such, she accepted my request to take my arm and after we left the gallery we held hands and got an ice cream. After a short walk we sat on a bench and made out for a fair while, this was about halfway through the date. Then we walked around and kissed some more and I played her some music since we happened upon a guitar shop. Then I walked her back to her university campus, during the walk back she stopped to initiate a kiss many times so I assume she‚Äôs rather interested in me. We also both agreed that we‚Äôre not looking for casual sex or anything like that during the date. 

We‚Äôve got plans to meet again this weekend but I‚Äôm unsure if I should bring a gift at all? It turns out I missed her birthday by a bit over a month (it was in august) and I joked around saying I‚Äôd buy her something as a belated birthday present to which she said that‚Äôd make her feel quite shy. 

Anyway she‚Äôs a foreign student and may be returning home by early next year if she can‚Äôt find a job over in my country (that‚Äôs the worst case scenario), that paired with the fact that we both know what we‚Äôre looking for from each other and also the fact that I just missed her birthday tells me I should get her a gift. Nothing major I was thinking a cute pendant or something along those lines. 

Do you think it‚Äôs too early to do so? If she does end up leaving I‚Äôd like her to have something to remember me by but I don‚Äôt want to come across in a bad way at all. What are your thoughts?

69,q84eye,1634232313,My crush says it's obvious how he feels but he tells me he's not ready for a relationship with me.,"The guy I like basically is a friend of my ex. He tells me he wants to get his life together, a job, etc before he dives into a relationship. (Btw it's an online relationship) And I respect that. As we are in a situation where it would be hard to meet under the circumstances financially. But the fact is he tells me he likes me but pulls up rules he set for himself like to not date anyone under his age gap (as he prefers older women) and to not date people who have been his friends exes. But the reason I'm distraught is because of these rules it seems even if in the future I went and made the money financially to get to be with him he would reject me their. And even before I dated my ex bf my crush had gone out on a date with me before I even dated my ex bf. So I feel he's putting up these walls despite letting me know he said he liked me.but then says when I say well you like me ""oh yeah that's just for me to decide""  Now I just don't know anymore because he tells me things I don't know as jokes like visiting me or etc. But deep inside I just want to ask why are you playing around with my feelings if your not sure? Why would you say that if you don't want a relationship with me in the future. He tells me he doesn't want an online relationship and both me and him believe it won't be a proper one untill we meet up. I'm okay with being casual flirting and all that stuff but the messages just are always so unclear When he tells me I want a ""long term relationship"" and "" I doubt I'll find anything in irl anytime soon but I'm looking for an irl relationship"" Him saying this stuff just to me all seems like an automatic rejection. But he never tells me no he never tells me he doesn't like me. To me I just need to leave. Just be his friend and go. When I think of a future with this guy. I want it badly and I'm willing to go the extra mile but in the present I'm so stressed on something that isn't even a proper relationship it's just a friendship at the end of the day. I don't want to  throw my all into a guy who isn't trying and I feel like he's playing with me.

Am I overreacting? Do I just need to give it time? Sit down and talk to him although he tells me it's obvious and that I'm just not good at receiving the message he's putting out? I'm so confused.

70,q84nmn,1634233030,Totally got catfished on Hinge by a creepy old man. I give up all hope now.,"I'm a guy, and a I just spent the last two days getting catfished by a Hinge match. I normally don't worry as much about getting catfished on Hinge because unlike Tinder or Bumble, there aren't as many fake profiles, and the ones that are look really obvious. This person used pictures of a woman who was not overly attractive in the way that screamed ""FAKE PROFILE!"" but attractive enough to get a guy's attention, and their conversation skills were normal and fluid.

I was suspicious that something was off when the person wanted to text on one of those texting apps rather than exchange numbers, but I did so anyway giving them the benefit of the doubt. They shared a few more normal pictures throughout the day -- nothing weird, but also asked if I had any more, too. I sent two that barely even showed me due to distance or angle just to be safe. They then suggested we video call later on that evening on Google Hangouts. When I went to Hangouts, their Google profile picture was a picture of them, so I again didn't think much of it. However, then came the excuse: ""I need to setup my Macbook. It's been awhile since I did that."" ""Sorry, give me a few more moments. I'll call you."" And then they never did. 

At this point, I decided to screen grab their profile pictures and do a reverse image search. It led me to a single result off Pinterest, which then led to an Instagram account of a public profile that had enough followers, but wasn't like some sort of influencer. The name and location on the profile didn't match the Hinge profile, and at that point, I saw the person had unmatched me there. I'd been catfished.

Today, I went back to the text app to find the person, and lo and behold, they had edited their profile there to include what I am assuming was their real picture. She was actually a he, and by he, I mean an old creepy, non-smiling man who looked like some sort of sexual predator. I was disgusted and felt so violated. Luckily, I still had pictures they had sent me of the fake person, so I took all of that information and contacted Hinge to file a report with them.

I've had such bad experiences with dating late -- been stood up, had weird/bad match experiences, had people flake on me, had dates show up looking nothing like their pictures, and this just was the final straw for me.

But do men usually feel ready to date under such circumstances?,"I met him about 1.5 months ago. There has been some texting back and forth and he sounds extremely sweet and kind but he is sometimes a bit wishy-washy, he often takes days to write back.

From what I can tell, he is an extremely conscientious person and loves his career, so this period must be hard for him. I would also imagine that looking for a job and an apartment at the same time is a very time-consuming and unsettling experience.

It is possible that he doesn't like me at all. We don't know each other very well at this point. He told me he is looking for a new place, but he never told me he is unemployed as well - I found out from social media. It is possible that his lack of responsiveness stems from not liking me and has nothing to do at all with his current situation.

He seems like a wonderful person and I would love to date him, to be supportive and be there for him, but I'm not sure if men usually feel ready to date under such circumstances.

Don't sh** where you eat type of situation?,"tl,dr.: One of my future roommates seems to be just a tad ""too nice"" and I think she's sending me signals. Not sure if I should try to start something with her as the shared flat is rather small and I'm afraid it could get awkward quickly if it doesn't work out, being stuck in the same household.  

So I (M24) am about to move out from home for the first time in the first week of November. I found a room in a shared flat with three young women roughly my age.

One of them, let's call her S, however, seems to be particularly intrested in me. LIke, I've met this person two times this far for a couple of hours so obviously it's early to conclude everything, and she seems to be rather extroverted and talkative in general, but this still seems to be more than general curiosity or politeness.

We had a sort of roommate casting two weeks ago and due to various reasons, the two of us ended up alone in the kitchen while the others were all busy, and we just ended up talking for like four hours (although I originally planned to just drop by for a short little basic chitchat to introduce myself). Anyway, as the conversation carried on, she seemed to be inching closer all the time, we had some genuinly nice ""deep talk"" about rather personal stuff, and I noticed she kept slowly sliding her feet towards mine but jammed them back every time I accidentally looked down. Also seemed rather surprised but happy when I offered her a hug at the end of the night.

Fast forward to this week, I made a spontaneous visit to my future flat to discuss some stuff with my predecessor. As we were talking in the kitchen, S comes in and visibly flinches (with a shy smile) upon realising I'm there, and for some reason apologizes for not texting me in the past week.

I do have to admit that I also think she's kinda cute.

But I'm also rather inexperienced when it comes to dating, so maybe that's just wishful thinking on my part as I may be just glad that a woman is giving me her attenton. Do y'all think she's trying to signal she's intrested?

Assuming she is, I'm kinda torn between wanting to give it a shot and knowing better, as being stuck in a household with someone you just broke up with etc., in case things don't work out, doesn't sound like fun.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q85ap7/soontobe_roommate_f23_seems_to_be_into_me_dont_sh/

I really wanted to focus on getting myself right and I felt that it wasn‚Äôt fair for me to stay in a relationship with her, when I‚Äôm not giving her what she needs, she was an amazing gf but I decided to break things of with her bc she wasn‚Äôt going to leave but I explain to her why, and she understood. 

When I made that decision I was prepared to lose her, if she moves on however fast i wouldn‚Äôt regret it. A month has gone by without communication and I had time to reflect on all the things I was doing wrong and learned that my struggles wasn‚Äôt caused by being w her so I reached out and she was happy to talk to me. 

After some time we discussed if we wanted to retry things under the condition that we haven‚Äôt done anything with anyone else. If she has I wouldn‚Äôt want to get back together. She told me no and I haven‚Äôt either. Then a month has gone by and everything was so good and we love each other again. That‚Äôs when she told me that with the first week of our break up she slept with this one guy one time and I believed her and took time to process it then I find out from someone else that it was multiple times which socked me even more and her reason is bc she didn‚Äôt know if I was coming back and was feeling sad. 

I don‚Äôt blame her at all for what she did bc She didn‚Äôt do anything wrong and I was prepared for that at first, but after a month of spending time with her, rebuilding our relationship and then finding that out it shocked me not only did she kept that from me but she bent the truth about the story as well and idk what to do and what makes it harder for me is that it was one of my friend, I would‚Äôve been fine if she told me from the beginning bc I wouldn‚Äôt have tried to work things out and walked away but now I have all these emotions for her and idk if it‚Äôs better to move on or try to get over it and stay.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q85r4l/i_broke_up_with_my_gf_and_within_that_first_week/
86,q85rsj,1634236407,I‚Äôm scared my anxiety is ruining my current relationship,"I don‚Äôt know where else to put this. I just want to rant a little I guess. 

I have had two relationships before my current bf. We‚Äôve been dating for 3 months and we have never fought for anything. We get along really well, it‚Äôs just every now and again my anxiety creeps in due to my traumatic past of my exes of cheating, lying, using me, the whole 9 yard.

Every time I voiced my opinion with one of my exes I get shut down, yelled it, and get called names and ever since then I just take it. My second relationship woke up one day and just left. I asked what was wrong and if he‚Äôs had this thought for a while and such and he said nah I just never liked you‚Ä¶ I was down low and needed physical touch and it could have been anyone and I just happen to be there at that time. 

This has unfortunately leaked into my current relationship. I‚Äôm always scared my current partner is going to leave me out of nowhere and say he doesn‚Äôt love me even though he never hinted otherwise. He told me his end goal is marriage with me and other stuff but I can‚Äôt subdue my anxiety and it‚Äôs eating me alive. I try to rationalize it saying if he planned to leave why did he do ‚Äúxyz‚Äù. I know it in my heart but my brain is overthinking and I‚Äôm just scared.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q85rsj/im_scared_my_anxiety_is_ruining_my_current/

89,q8691m,1634237850,What happened?,"So I‚Äôm (m21) confused af. I met this girl (f20) through a friend and decided to give her a text and kinda have a blind date situation having my friend being the common ground.

To my surprise she accepted, we went out on a date, dinner, bars, few drinks and then started getting off in the bar, laughing all night, no phones, like it was a great date if I‚Äôm honest, I personally think nothing went wrong (maybe something did).

So we ended up going back to hers, we didn‚Äôt sleep together but make out and passed out ahah.

We woke up, spooned and cuddled for like 4/5 hours, chatting shit, messing with eachothers hands, playing with hair, her laying on top of me, few kisses here and there.

Like from this point it didn‚Äôt even feel like a date, felt like being with the gf and hanging out.

I then had to leave, as I‚Äôm walking out she hugs me from behind, quick goodbye kiss and I go.

Overall I think it went well ahah

We never discussed what happened at the cottage, we were both drunk but not too drunk to forget or not consent. I really like her, and I HOPE she likes me too but I‚Äôm too scared to ask her in a cool and casual way to go for drinks when she is here.

I guess I just need to but I‚Äôm scared that any sort of ‚Äúoh I can‚Äôt this time!‚Äù I‚Äôll take as a major rejection. 

How do I casually ask her in a way that‚Äôs not ‚Äútoo in your face‚Äù. I don‚Äôt want to come off as creepy or weird but from my understanding, she would be in to it‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs just weird that we never discussed what happened.

93,q86n1x,1634238964,My last date wanted to see me again even if there was no initial spark on her side. Can attraction build over time?,"I (38m) went to a first date with a nice woman (41f) a few days ago. We went for a nice hike and I thought we hit it off. The discussions were nice and I felt attracted. I texted her in the evening saying that I enjoyed our date and that it would be nice to meet again. She said she would get back to me with a date for our next meetup, she said it would be nice to meet again. All in all, she seemed genuinely interested.

She texted me again today, two days later, suggesting a new date for next friday. But she mentioned that she did not feel a spark with me when we met. She said she still wanted to see me to develop a friendship and to see where it would go and to see if things would develop over time. She mentioned that she always went for guys where there was a big spark at first but it never worked and that she wanted to try something new.

I replied to her that I believed primal/sexual attraction was there at first or it was not. I thanked her for her honesty, wished her good luck and unmatched.

I think that even if there is a small chance that some attraction can grow over time, the fact that there was no initial spark on her side is a telling sign. And guys with whom she has that spark initially would always have a edge over me If I can put it like that.

I wonder what you people think about this subject.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q86n1x/my_last_date_wanted_to_see_me_again_even_if_there/

96,q875xm,1634240535,3 stages of relationships,"I just wanted to talk to you about 3 stages every relationship goes through. I‚Äôve struggled for a long time thinking there was something wrong with my relationships as people were always telling me you don‚Äôt experience difficulties when you‚Äôre with THE ONE. 

- Puppy love stage or honeymoon phase: this is the first one and everything seems perfect here. We overlook each other‚Äôs imperfections, red flags and think there is no better person than this one. Couples tend to text all the time, hang out all the time and simply can‚Äôt get enough of each other. It lasts between 2 months and 2 years.

- Power struggle: we begin to notice our differences, annoying habits and finally red flags. Couples tend do drift away from each other if they don‚Äôt communicate their issues in this stage. Here‚Äôs where you decide if it‚Äôs worth fighting for or letting it go.

- Stable relationship: the final stage. You communicate, work on yourselves and are becoming a better partner. You can finally relax here and enjoy your relationship. It can occasionally feel like a honeymoon stage all over again.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q875xm/3_stages_of_relationships/

99,q87caj,1634241054,I (m25) thought I was over my coworker ex (f32) until a work trip with emotionally intense experiences and don‚Äôt know what to do?,"Backstory: I was in a relationship with a coworker for a couple months at the end of last year. She ended things primarily due to religious differences (she‚Äôs Christian, I was pretty agnostic leaning atheist). We‚Äôve stayed good friends since then, but it‚Äôs been extremely difficult to completely get rid of feelings for her. At one point a couple months ago, I drunkenly confessed that I was having a hard time moving on, and she said that she thought we were best as friends. We‚Äôve discussed the topic of our past couple times and have a healthy friendship.

The situation: We went on a work trip to help a refugee organization this week. I‚Äôd recently thought I‚Äôd finally moved on from her. But when I‚Äôd look over and see her playing with some of the children, feelings for her would start to leak back into me.

Then at one point I saw her with a child laying against her side as she talked with a young woman, with a look of true compassion on her face. It felt like a switch went off. I felt more for her in that moment and since then than I had before for her, or for any woman I‚Äôve ever had romantic feelings for. I thought to myself that she was the person I wanted to truly be with. We spent time playing with children together and I became even more sure of what I was feeling.

I haven‚Äôt been in a relationship that‚Äôs lasted long enough to get to the point of being in ‚Äúlove‚Äù, so I don‚Äôt know if I really know what being in love with someone means and feels like. But if what I feel isn‚Äôt that, it‚Äôs the closest thing to it. And now I don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôm obviously not just going to go up to her and say ‚Äúhey, I think I love you, do you want to get back together?‚Äù. I don‚Äôt know what to say, if anything at all. We‚Äôre still friends, and I value that first. We‚Äôre also coworkers in career job positions.

The work and week was extremely draining and I frankly felt emotionally spent and broken after I left. I‚Äôd imagine that‚Äôs playing into why I feel so strongly, as a reaction. But I don‚Äôt know. I just wish that her and I could get back together, or that I could feel nothing for her at all.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q87caj/i_m25_thought_i_was_over_my_coworker_ex_f32_until/
