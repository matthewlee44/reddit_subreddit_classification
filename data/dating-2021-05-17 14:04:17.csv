Hello, I am 22 years old and almost every time  the last few years I was into a guy I always wondered pretty early on if we would be together in the long run. I know I am still young to think about family but for some reason I often imagine potential fathers of my children. I am nowhere near ready for this commitment but those thoughts still come up. I am wondering if this is healthy thinking. I don’t want to rush stages in the relationship in my head when it’s too early..",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nepgr2/is_this_healthy/
3,neplm8,1621280179,Going on a date with a friend after initially turning them down but now they're coming on more strongly than I'm comfortable with and I wish I had left it alone,"I joined a local social group and made new friends who I've been able to meet up with recently. Me and one of the guys there get on well and have some banter, which led to us hanging out and then he asked me on a date. I told him I wasn't in the right place to dating and he was nice about it and we stayed friendly.

A couple of weeks later I regret turning him down and tell him I like to hang out again and he says agrees and we decide to go out at the weekend (this weekend coming up). 

Now he's coming on quite strong (for me), organising a fancy date and paying for things ahead of time and coming up with grand ideas when I would much rather just do normal things and get to know each other at an easy pace with no pressure or expectations. I regret telling him I'd be up for going on a date and I think I was right in the first place that I don't want to date at all right now. I know I've really fucked up here and that I'm going to end up causing him damage by flip-flopping and I truly hate myself for it. I also think it will make things awkward within the dynamic of the social group I joined.

I don't know what to do for the best here. I'm really anxious about the date he's already paid for this weekend and I can't back out now because he'll lose money but I just don't think I'll be able to handle his advances and I don't want to pretend because that will make this whole thing worse. I don't understand how I've gone from agonising over regretting rejecting him, and now regretting making a move (although I feel like my move was pretty chill and I wish he'd just followed that lead rather than get carried away with big gestures).

Any advice here would be appreciated. I do already know how much of a mess I've made of this.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/neplm8/going_on_a_date_with_a_friend_after_initially/

I've been seeing this guy for almost a month now and the sex is great and he's very generous/giving and he's wanted to go down on me before but I always found excuses and he asked how I felt in general about oral sex and I said I like it but I think I'd only do that with someone I was serious with.  He said he'd still be down to go down on me. 

He's really kind and receptive to how I feel/whatever and I like him a lot as a person. We have the same sense of humor and talk 24/7. However, he told me he wasn't looking for something serious when we first started talking on a dating app because he'd only just gotten out of a 2.5 year relationship a few months ago. But that was at the very beginning, before we knew how compatible we were, so I don't know if anything's really changed on that front. We're both 25.

13,neqbpc,1621281866,Trying online dating app for 7 months. Am I (33F) being too picky?,"I really can't tell if I'm being too picky. I'm just looking for a normal decent looking guy with decent manners and who's also looking for a serious relationship. I've actually met few guys and non of them worked out. They are the following:

Guy#1 - looked cute in pictures, texted for few days hit it off so we decided to meet. His car was super messy with cigarettes (new and smoked) lying everywhere including underneath passenger seat where I would be sitting and that was a major turn off. Not to mention he didn't wear seat belts until he went on the highway and his seat was super reclined it was nearly flattened while he was driving. Conversation was decent, but his teeth were very crooked (didn't see that on profile pics), didn't like the way he talked either so I kindly told him I'm not interested and he thought I was very judgmental and crazy for rejecting him because of these car manners (I told him because he asked).

Guy#2 - He wasn't my type but he was very kind and thoughtful during a week of exchanging texts and voice texts. We did video chat too. We decided to meet up. I'm not into rich guys so seeing him in Lexus didn't really do much for me but thinking further that his car wasn't my type too. Conversation with him was easy, although when I looked at him while driving I noticed his car seat was very close to the steering wheel which made me worried about his height. Got off the car, he mentioned in his profile he was 5'10, but he was nearly the same or a bit shorter than me (I'm 5'5). Got turned off. But decided to give him a chance. Throughout the conversation he made funny noises which I guess its supposed to make him sound cute, but to me it didn't and made me cringe a bit. Kissed goodbye but made me regret it right away so I told him I'm sorry.

Guy#3 - Very cute and hot in pics. Texting begins, learned he was kind of weird and aggressive. I asked him if he's interested in me enough for us to video chat. He somewhat lectured me asking why I would think he's not interested after texting back and forth. Alright... Weird but moving on. Video chat went on for 7hrs. It was difficult for me to decide even after 7hrs if we had any chemistry. So decided to meet up. We went for a long city walk, but still couldn't figure out if we had a chemistry. So asked him for a second date. He said let's, but never met him again. But we still text....

Guy#4 - little older (he was 42), has 3 daughters eldest in her early 20s. Divorced. Hot. Super hot. Instantly attracted to each other. We called, video chatted texting everyday...we hooked up. Sex was amazing. Lots of fun together but somehow became just physical. We learned we don't have much in common other than spiritually compatible. He told me he found someone else.

Guy#5 - looked hot in every picture. AMAZING connection while texting for 3 consecutive days. We both rather talked on the phone. 2 weeks of constantly texting and calling each other. We would talk for hrs. Laughed hard, and I was really starting to fall for him even before meeting this guy! He lived further away. We finally met. Omg, he looked like a street bum. He was limping on his left foot....it wasn't the way he dressed. It was his body language... Yeah you can't really see that on video calls. He was definitely the same person in the pics... But SO different when met in person. I don't think he photoshopped or modified his photos but made me think that he went through some sort of drug addiction or AA... Anyways, I had my high hopes for this guy so overall it really shattered me. It made me feel like I'm being very hard on every guy I meet. Made me feel discouraged of my inability to pick a right guy.

I just need to hear it from someone else. Anybody having similar issues? Am I being picky?

I avoid even going further matching or talking with guys: 
who's obsessed with their dogs...
Wearing sunglasses in all of his pictures
2/5 of his pics are with his mom
Asking for my number right away after we matched (I mean come on, there's so many other ways to do that. Why don't you give out your number first and ask me to text him if I'm interested!?)

17,ner75z,1621283923,Is it a good idea to snap cute/sexy photos to someone to reignite their interest?,"I (F) had a crush on this guy who moved away last year due to covid. We're both late 20s. We used to text occasionally and run into each other at mutual friends parties and always really hit it off but he never asked me out/we were always dating other people.

Since he moved, I tried texting him a couple times and got no response (friendly texts). I figured he probably just has moved on with his new life and forgot about me. 

I'm hoping he'll move back for his job but in the meantime, I got this idea of reigniting his interest in me via Snapchat. I know he still uses it and we're friends on it (but I've never used mine, I don't know how). I don't know if he sees my Facebook photos and he doesn't follow me on Instagram. Plus those things are very impersonal, like I don't think he'd see a hot instagram photo and DM me. 

What do you think if I take like a cute (but not explicit) selfie and send it to him directly? 

Will he assume I've sent it to a bunch of people so it's not like a ton of pressure? 

Can he see that I only sent it to him? 

Will I be able to see if he's opened it? 

The idea I have is to send him a few progressively sexier photos (and maybe throw in things I know we have in common, ie, watching a movie he loves, etc) and see if I can get him to respond and start talking to me again. I know he liked me at some point so I kind of want to be like, hey remember me? 

Would this reignite your interest in someone? How do I make sure it doesn't come off desperate and stays low pressure? The guy is very shy so I don't want to be super aggressive (which is why I'm not going to text him again or DM him).

What do y’all think? If you felt the potential for some crooked stuff, would you address it before it got deeper or would you just ghost all together?

So we did the deed and given that we were both virgins we just didn't really know what to do and basically I knew that I was doing a horrible job because this was all completely new and mainly everything hurt so I know that it's my fault that it didn't feel good. He did mention sex is disappointing in comparison to what he saw from porn but I knew it was because I just in general didn't know what to do and I know I'm being sensitive but I felt hurt from his remark but I knew it was factual so I brushed it off.

We pulled out and I let him finish off because I wasn't really sure as to what to do and took a shower after. Given that I'm traditional minded, I wanted to keep this secret and he promised me he would.

After the promise, I asked him if it was okay for me to ask advice from my more experienced super close best friend and he agreed it was fine since she'd help us both.

*****THE TLDR: ***********
However, he thought that that meant the promise no longer existed and it wasn't a big deal to 'promise' so he started to tell fellow acquaintances and random strangers I'm not aware of that doing the deed was disappointing.

32,nesr5i,1621287746,Benching - Don’t Do It.,"This is something that happens a lot with OLD, you can be a perpetrator of it, a victim of it - probably both, honestly. 

And it ends up making everyone miserable. Nearly every person I know who benches as a tactic - intentionally or not - ends up miserable and hating OLD.

Benching, what is it?

Let’s say you match with Sam. Sam seems awesome. You chat and talk and you dig the vibe. 

Buuuuuuuuut you then match with Alex and then with Taylor and then Jordan. 

What’s one to do? So you go and see Sam, have a great time, but you’re also kind of wondering if something might happen with Alex, or Taylor, so you’re not really that invested. I mean, you’re there, you’re actually having a fun time… but maybe Alex is better? Somehow? You’re not sure but maybe you’ll just get something extra with Taylor or Alex. 

So then you go on a date with Alex, who is also great… but Taylor did seem to have the same niche interest as you…
 And then with Taylor you wonder what adventures you’ll go on!

And so on and so on. 

Basically, benching means always comparing people or not *really* being fully invested because you always have a bench full on the side. 

I’m not advocating for settling, but it’s not ‘looking for the perfect one’ either. This is more like FOMO.

And you can drive yourself insane and end up alone because you played yourself and the bench runs empty. 

On the other hand, the other person wonders what they did wrong. Which was nothing. They did nothing wrong, but eventually they realize you’re benching. 

Try not to do it. It’s cray-cray making.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nesr5i/benching_dont_do_it/

However, just recently, his ex-wife sent me a message warning me about him. I'm not the first girlfriend she has contacted. According to my bf, she would contact his current dates/gf while they were separated, telling them that they were still married, working things out, and sleeping with each other (albeit his ex was seeing someone as well), and would drive these women away from him. I also learned that she has attempted to reach out to me when he and I started dating but failed to do so.... until now. And she has claimed that my bf has abused her in the past, physically and verbally, and also threatened to kill her. I was horrified to learn this. Of course I confronted my bf about the things she has alleged, to which he vehemently denies. I snooped on her Facebook to see if there's any truth to her allegations, looking for posts or pictures that would hint at some sort of abuse... instead I found their old pictures and wedding photos, and it looked like a very loving relationship. My bf did say it was an extremely toxic relationship, was miserable, that he tried to get away and divorce her, but she would threaten him to the point that he feared for his life, adding that she stated that she would ruin his life if he left her. 

If someone was physically and verbally abused by their spouse, why would they keep pictures of their abuser? Why sabotage/interfere with their abuser's potential relationships during separation, claiming that they are working things out? I also found out from a mutual friend that she would block and unblock me. My question is, is my bf's ex obsessed with him? Should I run for the hills because of what she told me?

I met this guy \[28, M\] who I'm starting to like, but I've been super mindful of not taking it too fast, because I always hear that friendship is the best foundation. This guy also has told me that he wants to be intentional about building a friendship with who ever he's dating first, without diving in too fast, and it fizzling out sooner than later.

Anyway we ""hung out"" twice before he asked me on an actual ""date"" and so far we've been on maybe 3 dates. We have great convo and have been getting to know one another well. On the 3rd date, before he dropped me off, we ended up kissing. It was kind of unexpected, but also seemed to just happen organically. 

My question is - is it kind of contradictory that we've now kissed even though we're supposed to be building a friendship first? Can you do both simultaneously (romantically date &amp; build a friendship)? I may be over-thinking due to me not wanting to repeat past mistakes and jumping in too fast, but has anyone been in a similar situation?

Thank you in advance!

She lives about 5 hours away so I'm hoping to go down and visit her somewhat soon though sadly there are some extenuating circumstance preventing that for at least another month, her story makes sense and I don't think she's just making up excuses. But this brings in the problem of when to become exclusive, I'm afraid to become too emotionally involved until we've met each other IRL but then again it already feels like she is so I don't really feel right talking to other people at the moment. I guess I'm looking for advice of how to know when you should commit at least partially to a person when you don't expect to meet for some time, but you both seem extremely compatible?

Basically all I want is a sadist who fantasizes about killing me. Otherwise it just doesn’t appeal to me at all. 

I’m a really bored and understimulated individual so I tend to seek out danger when ever possible.

This danger, being a guy who was full of red flags but I sought him out anyway because he captivated me in a way no other guy has. His verbal disrespect of me hurts but I put up with it because I feel like he has valid points and is just telling me what I need to hear. He’s a really honest person.

He’s choked me out to the point I passed out or hallucinated (both very terrifying), he’d choke me or slap me if I showed sass or stubbornness (part of it was a kink thing but it went too far at times).

Sometimes he’d just simply slap me whenever he wanted. Tell me to shut the fuck up if I said anything during sex. Slap or twist my nipples.

Hes concerned about what he wants 90% of the time. Which turns me on but it’s also scary.

I could just go to an “ethical” sadist who’s well versed on consent. But that isn’t the same to me at all. I need a guy who actively wants to hurt me or possibly kill me. Not someone who’s putting on an act.

He hasn’t contacted me since Thursday and I’m really upset about it because I miss him.

So I've been single for about 3 yrs, no dating or hook ups and at work I don't talk to girls with any romantic interest or anything. I've just been working and going to school, I'm changing my career path so I have somewhere between 2-4 yrs until I'm where I want to be. To make this possible, I'm fully taking advantage of my living situation which helps me save money by not paying as much as I would be if I lived alone. My living situation being, I live with my ex. She ended up buying a house last year and new I was between places so she offered her room for rent. It's two bedrooms. It's financially beneficial and I have no feeling at all towards her and she has her bf who spends the weekends here. I don't know if he knows but when she brought up having ppl over she said it's cool and she would just say we're friends/roommates. 
So fine whatever.
Only I've never dated since, because I wasn't comfortable with the idea of starting off a new relationship by lying. 
So this whole time with the pandemic and all it hasn't been an issue because, who's dating during a pandemic anyway? So I thought. And I've also gotten to a point where I haven't been lonely and depression free for the longest period in my life...maybe I've been happy. 2020 was a good year personally.
However, I've been feeling like I've created my own limitation by making something out of maybe nothing. Like it's only an issue because I'm making it. 
I haven't thought about it too much until recently when I've met and hit it off with someone. I haven't been leading this person on but I've been wanting to reach out, ask her to hang out or go on a date. I stop myself and wonder ""why can't I just call it what it is and say she's my roommate""

I have walked clear across America from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean with nothing but a backpack. While that may be the most interesting thing I can say I’ve done, I did it to prove my character.  
Yet no one bats an eye. 
In person, ones mind would be blown by someone taking a year long trip, walking 4,300 miles living on the side of the road, out of a backpack, completely unsupported, but online no one gives a shit.    

I’m constantly asked how I don’t have a girlfriend. No fucking clue, I respect potentials too much to become the next “me too” case.  

When I was in high school/graduated I had next to no problems meeting girls and getting dates. Probably because I had a real tax paying job at 14. The first one to get an apartment at 18 and did what I had to for survival.  

But after that, I moved around too much to form any meaningful long term relationships. Any attempt was bolstered by my traveling jobs, moving across the country multiple times and friendships dying out as a result of it, or just flat out stand no chance to comparable options.  

So here I am, 32 with no dating experience and no hope for online dating because I guess I’m not interesting or attractive enough. My beauty is definitely skin deep, and am often told how I am a “gift”, an “absolute unique individual which stands beyond most of societal comprehension”.  

Like I said though, this is all shit that has to be proven with actions, because I’m sure it just comes off as entitlement or arrogance in an online format. Besides, who else is supposed to back me up on this other than myself?

My biggest downfall is lack of understanding. That’s my gear grinder. So I try to make sense of it all, and learn everything that I can about a situation. If it makes rational sense and I can understand it, I will be open to the other perspective. 

Am I too intelligent, or actually too fucking stupid? 
Am I in the middle of an existential crisis or am I mad at the world? 
This swipe left swipe right is mentally taxing and exhausting when there is zero return on investment for weeks at a time, in which most cases I assume the blurred “likes” are actually pity likes and engineered to convince my sorry ass into dropping money to be brought to the top of the stack.

58,nev8tf,1621294370,How do you stay hopeful?,"Long post, but TLDR; I'm losing hope in finding someone to love and trust and this hopelessness is getting in the way when I actually meet someone I could potentially date. How do I regain hope?

I am a 25 year old woman who’s had her fair share of both short term and relatively long term relationships. They’ve mostly ended amicably but the most recent one ended in infidelity by my partner (about 8 months ago). We only dated for a few months, but the relationship was filled with intense infatuation. We quickly spoke about long term goals of marriage, as he just turned 30 and felt as if he was “behind” in that department. Since then, I’ve sort of lost hope in my future, and for some reason the idea of me ever finding someone I can truly and willingly love and trust seems to be impossible. Now, everything romantic reminds me about how hopeless and lonely I feel. I try my best to avoid triggers at all cost. I’ve stopped watching chick flicks or reading romantic novels, but those around me are all in committed relations (either married, engaged, or have been dating for more than 2 years), so I’m faced with the reality of my disappointment in my romantic life pretty much all of the time. I knew it was bad when I start avoiding visiting my parents, because their marriage and commitment to each other is starting to make me envious. 

I don’t thing it’s reasonable to “avoid” romance or avoid my family and friends, so I’m wondering how I should go about getting over this funk. How should I restore hope in my future? I used to idealize romance so much, engulfing in romantic novels and watching romantic movies. I’ve started to think that this is the problem because these depictions aren’t realistic and create room for devastating disappointment; however, those are what used to give me hope- something to look forward to. Now that I’ve been avoiding “all things romance” and sort of wallowing in how lonely I am, I think it has been getting in the way of dating in general. When a friend introduces me to a guy or if I meet someone who clearly seems interested in me, I find myself naturally reserved, sort of cold, and uninterested. There have been at least five instances where I look back and think about what “could have been” if I was just open or reciprocated interest.

59,nev8vx,1621294375,Dating vs. Serial Monogamy,"I read a lot of post on here today. There are some legitimate questions concerns. 

But dating is not a temporary monogamous relationship where you get laid until your next temporary monogamous relationship. Dating is not having one boyfriend or one girlfriend and being sad they are gone and you want some one to replace them.

Dating is talking to some one to get to know them and going out with them more than once. That is all there is to it.

Dating does not need to involve sex. Dating does not mean seeing one person. There is no reason you shouldn’t date 3 guys or, 3 girls or, 2 girls and 1 guy what ever your sexual preference (personal experience more than three is to many)

There is no reason to limit how many people you see or talk to until you find some one to Mary and have kids with.

Ladies fine to have sex while dating but it’s not a requirement but know every guy you date is trying to sleep with you.

Guys it’s fine to sleep with the girls you date but wear a condom don’t give girl A girl Bs STI.

Every one should be honest about seeing other people. They should be honest about how they feel.

If some one confesses there love to you or proposes and your not ready just tell them your not ready.

Dating apps - they work like social media so guys invest in photos that will interest the girls. Look interesting dress well and have good hygiene when you meet them.

Girls dating apps guys are thirsty most are probably masturbating to your pic as they swipe. Most probably are not interested. 

It doesn’t matter how pretty your snap chat filter makes you. If you show up and your 30 lbs over weight have 3 kids by 3 different baby daddies no career potential and no assets you have no chance.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nev8vx/dating_vs_serial_monogamy/

Or best case she could take it as a compliment and be like ""sorry I'm not dating right now"" or ""I'm seeing someone"" or she's gay and I'm barking up the wrong tree, no biggie.

61,nevcjs,1621294663,How to take a breath after a date that went TOO well?,"Yuh hi guys. I really need some advice. There's a tl;dr at the bottom.

Yesterday I went on a wonderful date. Let's call him Tom. Tom is wonderful. Met him on Bumble but had to let him know I was pursuing something else (that fell through, hehe. Guy turned out to be jerk). I later matched with him on Tinder and we hit it off.

He came across exactly the way I thought he would based on his profile and pics. Goofy, intelligent, patient and most of all respectful. He wasn't a prude, and turned out to be pretty sex positive. 

I went over to his place yesterday and we spent the majority of the evening talking on the couch. I paid for takeout. I wasn't shy in showing affection. Spent the majority of the evening in his lap and checking him out bahaha. He didn't mind, but was definitely....excited.

We felt each other out. During the duration of the night I didn't feel uncomfortable. I felt sexy. I loved peering into his mind and life. He complimented me from time to time, and from what I could read into there was a mutual attraction. I could tell he was of sound mind, because when we talked he conveyed that the only way to really get to know someone is to see them over a length time. See how they react to stresses and all that.

Towards the end of the evening we made out and things got really intimate. He let me set the pace. Afterwards he offered a shower together and told me he didn't mind if I spent the night. I thought this was sweet, but I didn't want to impose since he needed to wake up early in the morning. I asked him if he was free the following weekend, and he wasn't so he asked if I could come by in the middle of the week right after he got off work. I definitely plan on it.

My drive home was great, and then things got rocky for me. I couldn't sleep. I kept thinking about how great my evening went. I got more and more infatuated as the night went on. I knew I was getting a case of the crazy, and when I greeted him with a good morning and told him about how much fun I had.....I realized I was stressing more and more over how I came across. It's terrible.

I know he doesn't want to rush into anything, and neither do I. I just really like this guy and I want him to like me. We both got out of a LTR recently and we both want something organic.  I've been trying my best all day to pull myself together and clear my head, but it's been really hard. I'm worried that if I show I'm really interested I'll come across as needy and scare away this fantastic guy with a really big....heart. I know I want more, but I know that takes time especially since the both of us have some baggage.

Has anyone gone through this? Please help.

TL;DR

I had an amazing date and am having trouble staying grounded. I don't want to scare away a really nice guy with feelings I didn't expect to have at the end of the evening. He's expressed interest in meeting me again, but I'm getting to that weird place where I'm scared that me showing my eagerness and need for his attention will end up turning him off. It's affecting the way I text him now and everything feels so different. What do?

So I’m guy, 20 going on 21, very very sheltered and inexperienced when it comes to sex and dating. I was in catholic school, then a small DOD school in Japan, then boys military school and then 2 years of normal high school and now a normal college. I’ve really only gone to a normal school with normal people for about 4 years.

From ages 10 to 16 I had very little contact with girls and it’s really impacted me. I was also a late bloomer and I didn’t go through the change til I was 17 and I was not able to compete with all the other post puberty guys in my year. 

Now I’m in college and I have no experience with women. I’m nearly 21 and I’m still a virgin, I’ve never had my first kiss, I have as much experience with women as I had when I was 10 and it’s very embarrassing. I don’t know anyone that’s as far behind as I am, I actually don’t have any friends that are still virgins.

I really have been trying to meet girls but I’m just so awkward and bad at speaking to women it’s never once gone positively. I’m really afraid of one day graduating, and then  having to try to meet women just going through life.

I don’t know how to hook up or how to ask women out, which will all be things that are expected of me to know. Whats even scarier is how inexperienced I’ll be if something physical happens. I literally have no idea how to kiss. I know you put your lips on someone else’s but that’s really it. The whole concept is scary to me. And then sex would be another massive hurdle. And I doubt any woman would have the patience to teach a guy in his mid twenties something 90% of people learned in early high school and college.

I make that info very clear when I match with someone on Tinder/Bumble. Anyways. It’s happened about 6 times in a row almost like clockwork. I’ll match on a dating app, we have good conversations on the app, after about a day or two one of us will ask to exchange phone numbers or Snapchat’s, then we switch to talking on there. Every time, we talk almost nonstop for a few days until I ask if they want to meet up sometime. 

When planning a first date, I usually ask if they have something in mind, and if not I’ll suggest something that’s casual and not high pressure, like dinner/drinks. This last date, she told me she likes video games, so we went to an arcade bar where they serve drinks and you can play all sorts of classic arcade games and pinball.  

Like I said, this exact scenario has happened 6 times in a row now. I’ve gone on these dates, they go very well (good conversation, banter, flirting, etc.) Every single time, the dates have ended with a kiss or making out, then I ask if they would like to go out again sometime, and they all say “yes” or I’ve also gotten “hell yeah!” 

Then, it usually happens right away. I’ll text them when I get home and ask if they made it home ok, then I either get a one word reply or nothing at all. I’ll try to text back the next day, or wait a day or two to text, and just say “hey, what’s up” then, nothing. They do not text me back. I’m not the kind of guy that wants to seem desperate, so I don’t pester girls that don’t text me back, so I usually just leave it at that and we don’t talk ever again.

So we meet at the Restaurant and order our food. A few minutes after she gets her food she starts messing around on her phone and asks if she can take a phone call. It was from her ex-husbands gf and I said yeah, no problem. She walks outside and after 20 minutes the server comes up to me and asks if I wanna sneak out the back and leave her with the bill. I said no its fine and just keep sitting in my booth. She walks back in after 25 minutes and she's still on the phone and starts eating her food again. She looks up at me and tells the new gf well I'm on a date so I'm going to get off of here and hangs up the phone. 

I ask if everything was ok and my date says yeah, I figure I really probably should get along with her and it really wasn't that bad this morning I just overreacted.

89,nexyql,1621302344,Sucks to realize that this is probably one aspect of life that I'll never experience,"Even as young as my early teens, I always figured that I was kind of an ugly weird looking kid. I vaguely remember a couple of negative experiences growing up that led me to believe that I wasn't considered attractive, and while sometimes people might speak to me like I'm ok looking nowadays I'm almost 30 and have never even dated anyone.

I figure that at this point I'm too far behind to have a healthy and fulfilling relationship with a normal person. I wouldn't say that there's anything particularly wrong with me. I'm kind of broke, have a minimum wage job, but I have things that I'm passionate about and believe that I'm uniquely talented at and am still saving for my own home/future so I'm not a dead beat with no long-term focus.

I thought that I'd be less lonely working a new job, going from delivery to retail and realizing that I feel lonelier surrounded by co-workers who aren't particularly outgoing/trying to get to know you beyond basic pleasantries but have cliques in the break room and what not..

Seeing cute co-workers who I overhear talking about their boyfriends. Nothing ever changes when it comes to this sort of thing in my life. I just figure that even if I'm an 'average' looking guy, I'm just not able to connect with anyone or attract anyone into my life. I have a few guy friends, generally seem to be able to talk to strangers pretty easily when I'm in a good mood.. Just don't know how to make someone like me in a sexual/romantic way. I'm like an alien, or a child or something. I had a dream the other night that was somewhat related to my new job.. I'm at a new job, but looked like a warehouse job. A female co-worker/higher up just randomly wants to have a spontaneous passionate quickie.

I sort of just freeze for a moment as she asks me ""you don't want to?"" before just yoloing it and smacking her ass and saying ""where will we go?"" so we're hiding somewhere and about to have sex and I'm just panicking, thinking of what to say because if I actually try to just have sex with them it's going to be like a little kid sticking a square block into a circular hole.

Just a total awkward disaster and I'm going to trip weirdo flags.. So I'm pretty sure that I just tried to explain that I've lived the life of a loner and so I've never been in that situation or something like that. That's probably what I would say to someone. The reality was probably severe social anxiety/BDD for years that I sort of grew out of. So I say that, and I think that I started to panic, like I was trying to reassure them that it wasn't a big deal to me. Nearly pleading that I just needed a little bit of guidance. Maybe that's how I subconsciously feel, maybe I'm just lonely and want some intimacy and affection from someone other than family.

Actually, my own immediate family members are not particularly affectionate beyond my mother. On any given day, my father would sooner antagonistically punch me than give me a hug. My sister is like my father, not comfortable with showing emotion towards us. So I really don't experience any real affection or anything like that in my life to be honest. It would be nice. Just venting in general.

I’m afraid of a self-fulfilling prophecy",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ney200/in_between_dates_anxiety/
92,ney448,1621302792,How to spot a bot in a dating site?,"Are bots advanced enough to pass as ordinary people on a dating site?

I read somewhere that attractive female profiles are more likely to be bots or fakes since the site need them to convince men to Join and pay. But many beautiful women use dating sites to find love.

Since bots are Just AI software can I ask them things that are Impossible for a machine like for example ask a profile about their parents in order to spot a bot? If I am talking to someone and I ask about their family and they decline or do not know is that a bot? Does It work?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ney448/how_to_spot_a_bot_in_a_dating_site/
93,ney57q,1621302880,"Please, don’t mention anything sexual before even meeting the person...","Honestly you would think this is common sense. The amount of men who casually bring up sex, their boners, random facts like “I love tits” ok? Congratulations? Thanks for sharing? And then they expect you the engage in that kind of conversation when we haven’t even met! 

Every time I think I’ve found a good guy  he completely ruins it by insinuating sex on the first meet! It’s sooo discouraging. I try to steer the conversation away and I won’t engage, but then the guy will continue to steer the conversation back to anything sexual. We are two adults, we’re not teenagers. At this point I automatically send a “Sorry we’re not a great match” text and end it. 

The bar is literally so low, all you have to do is be decent!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ney57q/please_dont_mention_anything_sexual_before_even/

97,neyfqc,1621303751,"I (M26) sometimes wonder, why do I even bother with dating?","When it comes to dating, let’s just say I’ve got a better chance winning the next lottery. I took like a four year break and finally entered the dating pool. I don’t know how but every time I’m interested in someone I’m either someone they just want to just text with or I end up being the second or the third choice. I tried online dating but it never worked. I barely get any matches and if I tried sites like POF it will result in myself messaging tonnes of people snd maybe get one or two response. I mean thank god my anti depressant is working otherwise I would feel really depressed right now. I tried speed dating, I signed for a free speed dating and the only person who showed interest was a crazy anti vaxxer. The other people who I have spoken with just looking for friends or just disappear after one text. Like honestly I’m a glass half full guy but I honestly don’t think I can keep doing this.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/neyfqc/i_m26_sometimes_wonder_why_do_i_even_bother_with/
98,neyi3g,1621303947,He keeps blocking me when I only want closure.,"Hi. So, I had a long distance relationship with this guy for two years. We were happy (or so I thought) and out of nowhere, he blocked me from all of my social media accounts and phone number. I kept reaching him for the last 5 months to ask why he had done it. But every time I reach him, i can never get a second call since it would only tell me that I have been blocked. It really distraught and broke me inside. But the worst this is that i had not had someone to rant this shit out. I wish to move on but i cant since the thought why he ghosted me eats me up all night. 

So, idk, should i keep reaching him or just move on?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/neyi3g/he_keeps_blocking_me_when_i_only_want_closure/
