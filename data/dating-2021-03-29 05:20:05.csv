1,mfmikq,1617013717,Would it be reasonable of me (33m) to ask my friend and crush (25f) to be honest with me if there’s no chance?,"I have strong feelings for my friend. She’s painfully shy and introverted but I’m being gentle and she’s starting to let her guard down which is lovely.

When I asked her out a while ago she was very flattered but informed me that she’s never dated and is “not ready for a relationship with ANYONE right now.”

Normally I’d have taken that as a polite way of saying she wasn’t interested in ME, but knowing how long it takes her to warm up to people, I actually believe she was telling the truth. She never said “I think we’d be better off as friends” or “I don’t see you that way” or anything like that. So maybe dating is genuinely not on her radar at this point in time.

Since then I’ve taken care not to pressure her or make her feel awkward. The friendship itself is more precious to me than anything! But I’m really suffering!

So would it be reasonable of me to say to her, “I’m not trying to ask you out again - I know you’re not ready to date and I’m fine with that. BUT... if you already know for certain that we’ll only ever be friends, can you be honest with me so I can deal with it?”

**tl;dr**: My friend and crush gave me a soft no, but if there’s no chance of anything more than friendship I’d prefer her to be honest.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mfmikq/would_it_be_reasonable_of_me_33m_to_ask_my_friend/
2,mfmixq,1617013757,I rejected a girl and i regret it plz help,"I’m a 17 yo high school student. In my freshman year i was pretty social,meeting a lot of people,talking to girls and etc. and one day i met this girl wich im gonna code as apple and we starting talking. She quickly starting flirting with me and i suddenly got bored of her but she was really nice and pretty idk till this day why the f i felt like that. Anyways so i started acting in a way to push her away from me by cutting conversations short acting like she wasn’t there trying to avoid her basically. And so I succeeded but then we still talked to each other because of our mutual friends. So my first year is over and it’s the summer and we haven’t spoken to each other in months. One day im walking in the neighbourhood and i see this girl with a child next to her i knew I recognised her just wasn’t sure but then i saw her face and guess who it is...yep it’s her so I went to say a hi and she just acted like I didn’t even exist but keep in mind guys,we weren’t this bad the last time we spoke. And so i just walked away and thought about it for the next couple of days then it just faded away. Anyway so the second year of high school starts and the first week she came to me and apologised about what happened and i said the same about what i did so we started talking again. But now there’s a major problem...i started liking her :) I just wanted to wait a couple of weeks to guarantee things and that was a biiig mistake,because she started liking someone else. So the table turns like a fidget spinner all of the sudden and I didn’t know what to do. I just figured if i wait a bit more she’ll come back so that’s what i did. I stayed close to her but for months she never talked about anything but him and I couldn’t take it anymore. I started liking her realllyyyy bad and i just wanted to tell her and feel free...so i did. I told her that i liked her one day and she acted weird about it and said “well this has happened before and I don’t like it when a FRIEND of mine starts catching feelings towards me. We’ll talk later”.
Basically i got friend zoned and rejected at the same time wich trust me,does not feel good.
So that year ends too and now im in the third year of high school and cuz of the pandemic we couldn’t see each other for a whole year. I’ve just started seeing her for the last 3-4 weeks and that other guy is gone. And now she’s not telling her friends not to talk to me anymore,a bit more open to the fact that I’m alive,doesn’t necessarily hate me but still no connections.
So what i regret is not giving her a chance in the first place and then waiting afterwards. I don’t even use reddit i just logged in for this someone plz help i need to get her back :((",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mfmixq/i_rejected_a_girl_and_i_regret_it_plz_help/

Here's a bit of info. Him and I have opposite schedules. I only work 5 hrs though. I work at 2 pm he works at 4 am.

I didn't think much of it when he stopped replying at the time cause I had work and he knows that too. So then after work 7 pm he usually texts or calls me, but this time he didn't. Again I didn't think much of it cause I thought he fell asleep.

But now 3 am passed that's when he usually texts me to say good morning. And I know he's okay because I saw him online on Steam playing video games probably.

We usually talk to each other every day unless we tell each other we need our space. He hasn't told me he needs space. And he said he misses me a lot but avoiding me? Idk what's going on.

20,mfp4st,1617023063,Should I call it quits?,"I'm at the end of my rope. I'm exhausted, unmotivated and completely hopeless in my current scenario. My boyfriend (27) and I (M/25) have been growing apart since last August. Mainly due to his unfaithfulness and my overall lack of heart to continue to forgive and forget. That isn't without saying, however, that I've fought long and hard with myself to find and shred of this relationship worth holding on to.

Last August, I caught my boyfriend on Grindr. He had been acting strange, in more ways than one. He was turning away from me when he was on his phone, spending countless hours in the bathroom (I'm talking 8 to 12 at a time) and often times, abandoning me whilst we out and about on the town to go hang out with his ex. As much as I'm one to bring something to someone's attention, I didn't ask him, because part of me simply knew he'd lie about it. SO, I made the decision to check and see for myself. And there he was. After catching him, I immediately brought it to his attention and asked him why he felt the need to use a hookup app. When we first started dating, I told him I was fine with an open relationship, so long as we both agreed upon it and ultimately decided that was something we were both interested in. He told me that open relationships weren't his thing, and I told him that I was more of a one on one person myself.

He lied straight to my face, telling me it wasn't him and that someone was impersonating him. Taking note of one of the more explicit pictures on the profile, I noticed the date was around July, and we had been dating for a good few months around that time. So, I decided to go all in and corner him with all that I had to get the simple truth out of him. I simply told him that it could only be one of two things. He had been sending pictures to other guys the entire time, or it actually was him. He continued to defend himself relentlessly. So, I decided to leave and gather my thoughts.

Jump to October of last year, he finally admitted to it in the midst of a conversation about cheating and what have you. I wasn't shocked honestly, but the arguments he made to defend himself were a bit . . . odd, to say the least. He admitted to having residual feelings for his ex, whom he made out to be a monster, but is actually super kind and we've become decent friends. The second was that he thought I was too clingy and felt that if I caught him on Grindr, that it would cause me to push him away and give him space. And finally, he believes in some hidden desire for me to catch him.

Jump to the present, and he still frequently uses Grindr and I've all but given up. He gets upset with me for no longer fighting for the relationship, but I'm all worn out and simply want peace. What're your thoughts or opinions on the matter? If you have any questions, I'm happy to answer!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mfp4st/should_i_call_it_quits/

22,mfpfs7,1617024034,Thoughts on dating a successful woman,"I recently caught up with a friend of mine who is a Senior Lawyer in a large, global Firm. Though she loves her job and is proud of her position, she also feels it has had a truly negative impact on the romantic relationships she’s had with men.

She recently ended a four-month relationship with a guy, based on his insecurities towards her profession, and I feel there is value in sharing some of her biggest grievances towards him:

1. Constant self-deprecation

This was perhaps her biggest issue towards him. 

He would constantly make jokes about his perceived inferior intellect.

She thought it was funny and somewhat flattering the first couple of times, but the ‘joke’ quickly ran thin once he started doing it almost daily.

1. The belief that men should be the breadwinner in a relationship

Among the self-deprecating jokes around his intelligence, he would also constantly talk about the fact he earned less than her.

Though the variance in their salaries was fairly negligible, this didn’t stop him from continuing to verbalise his disdain towards it.

She felt this was patronising and sexist.

1. Petty reminders of his superiority in other areas.

To make up for his obvious insecurities around his lower salary and perceived inferior intellect, this guy would constantly remind her of ways he was superior.

Examples included: 

* He would berate her for drinking alcohol on the weekend, given he barely ever drank alcohol at all
* He would tell her about all the books he’s read and make fun of her for choosing to spend her spare time watching Netflix
* He would call her out on any unhealthy foods she ate because he treated his body ‘like a temple’

No matter how much she would commend him for his healthy lifestyle choices, he would always highlight how he felt they were ‘victories’ over her.

1. Believing everything she said based on personal pride was done so purely to make him feel lesser.

She was never able to say anything based on personal pride, as he would turn it into an argument. 

He believed any self-affirming comment she made was done so to remind him of how little he’s worth. 

1. Difficulty supporting her achievements

Whenever she had a favourable outcome on a case at work, she found it difficult to share her elation towards it with him, as she knew it would make him feel awkward and small.

On the off chance she did share something with him, he’d offer her a vague ‘well done’ in response, then quickly change the subject.

1. Inaccurate, preconceived notions towards her friendship circle

In the four months they dated, he never once met any of her friends, even though she met almost all of his.

Whenever the opportunity arose to meet hers, he’d always have a last-minute excuse and back out. 

If she ever discussed her friends with him in general conversation, he would make underhanded comments about them, suggesting they were shallow and that they likely had superiority complexes over others, given they were mostly all Lawyers as well.

The takeaway:

If you start dating a woman who earns more money than you, or, if you perceive her to have a superior intellect to you, you’d best have your self-esteem in order.

It’s time to stop being petty about it and start supporting her and relishing the fact that there’s a good chance she will buy you a PS5 for your Birthday.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mfpfs7/thoughts_on_dating_a_successful_woman/

I don’t mind meeting someone else on an app if they get more active once things are more normal but I would rather meet someone in person in a bar or nightclub, that won’t happen for a while as I doubt they’ll be open here till the end of the year if that. I just feel like I have no confidence and I’m not enough of a “bad boy” to get women’s attention. Any tips?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mfprx3/not_sure_how_to_get_back_into_dating/
27,mfptrw,1617025313,"Isn't it funny how the people who are open to hookups end up in relationships sooner than the ""not looking for hookups"" crew?","I'll preface this by saying that I've never explicitly pursued hookups and I can count the number of hookups I've had in life on less than one hand, but I would also never say I'm totally against them. There's a very negative perception about hookups, especially with dating apps, which i find can be a somewhat close-minded POV. I suppose if you've been misled by someone who said they were looking for something more but ended up ghosting after sex, you'd feel burnt, but if someone is transparent about just wanting a hookup from the start, then you can't really hold it against them either.

What I find to be an interesting irony about those who are open to hookups vs. those who draw a hard line against them is that the people who leave the door open to hookups usually end up being the people who find their way into relationships before the ""not looking for hookups"" crew, and I think the reason for this is because it's easier to turn a hookup into a relationship than it is turning a more formal, by-the-book dating scenario into one. So many of my friends, other people I know, and commenters throughout this space have found successful relationships out of hookup situations where as the people who think they're doing dating the ""right"" way keep swiping the apps and get ghosted before the first date even happens.

If I could take a stab at understanding why, I think when people get the sex out of the way early, realize they enjoyed it, and also realized they enjoy the person they shared the experience with as well, it's a lot easier to get the ball rolling in the right direction rather than playing dating like a chess game or second guessing every move being made.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mfptrw/isnt_it_funny_how_the_people_who_are_open_to/
28,mfpv3m,1617025435,Is this normal behavior?,"I (19M) have been dating this girl(24) for a month now, but she really confuses me, because sometimes she asks me questions that insult me, but I don't think she is doing it on purpose, because shes really flirty around me.

These are the texts when I confronted her:

Me: Well *Y*, even though I really wanted to tell you how beautiful you looked in that colorful blouse, I couldn't because I feel uncomfortable around you, because sometimes you make mean comments about how I act or look like

Her: Oh for example what comments r mean to u ?

Her: I do not think I would comment mean on somebody's look 😳

Me: ""Did you choose that hairstyle?"" ""What's that on your face?"" ""Why do you laugh?"" ""Are you always like this?"" ""Can you be more enthusiastic?"" ""Are you shy?"" ""Why do you eat like that?"" You also avoided the question ""What do you think of me?"" 3 times

Her: Oh those r really just my questions, I m not commenting on them

Me: Yeah but they are still hurtful

Her: I did not avoid the question on purpose

Her: And I only remember one time when u ask here

Me: I know you mean well, but I also needed you to know how I felt

Her: I tried to dunderstand why do u think those r hurtful? Sorry maybe sometimes I do not get some hidden things but I just really want to know why do u think if I ask u are u shy, it is hurtful? 😂😂😂I really want to understand

Her: If u r shy, ok not bad, if ur not shy not bad either. Because shy is not a bad thing 😯

Me: I don't like to be nervous around people and with almost all people I'm not nervous

Her: So does it mean with me ur nervous ?

Me: Yes a little bit

Her: I think it is not a good sign

Is this normal? Or am I in the wrong?

I'm in the process of getting help and working through my demons but it has become clear to me that I'm not the best at judging potential relationships.

In my past relationships there has been a pattern of seeing red flags early on and not doing anything about it, mostly out of fear that I'm overreacting, but also because of my fear of conflict. Also, I struggle to understand at what point the ""line"" has been crossed, so-to-speak. I deal with commitment issues and I've learned that that fear spills over to ending the relationship, since that is also a commitment. 

I won't go into specifics because I believe that they can be subjective, but at what point is enough, enough (when dating)? I understand that no one is perfect but how do you know what is a dealbreaker and how do you mentally understand that you're no longer interested in seeing this person? Also how do you know when what you might consider a red flag is just you being insecure?

----

Something I've been thinking about recently. There is a lot of discussion about a person who jumps quickly from relationship to relationship without ever taking a major break in between.

I would think that logically, there are people who have that same kind of desire/drive but are unable to find a partner in that same time-span.

So basically this person would be a serial monogamist but their relationships don't last long enough to find a next one to jump to.  When the first relationship ends they have an extended period of time looking for a new one which they try to jump into immediately, with poor results.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mfrce8/is_there_a_term_for_someone_who_would_be_a_serial/

In the last few weeks we talked openly about those feelings (i.e. I told him I was in love with him and he told me the same), and it kinda grew into a relationship (still a secret one, mind you). Now, the problem is, as we are currently in different cities, we mostly see each other on weekends, and so when friday comes, I am the happiest person ever. But then, on the week days, I get so anxious, lonely, scared and depressed on the smallest trigger (we don't hear from each other, or he's out, or I just think that I'm not enough for him). Not that I'm jealous or anything, I just worry that he is getting boref with me. Then, if he tells me something nice, like he misses me, I'm on cloud nice once again. 
Now let me tell you, I am a serial monogamist, I've been in long, serious relationships before and I've been in love before, but I have never once felt this way, scared and dependent on his attention, and I don't like it. It's not like he gave me a reason to be insecure as the secrecy thing is basically my idea (before anybody asks), and I always had a lot of confidence in my previous relationship.

It was bad timing for the both of us. When she ended it, it was very sudden and she deleted me off all social media immediately and I never heard from her again. She seemed cold when she did it which was out of character and I felt discarded.

This was 6 months ago. Nothing from either of us. I reached out 2 days ago.

Me: Hey, how are you?

Her: Hi, I'm good. You?

Me: I have been wanting to contact you for a while but I was waiting to see if you would contact me first. I'm not sure if you felt the same way. Probably not as I know you don't like to dwell on the past.

Her: Yeah, I try not to dwell on the past.

Me: I am pleasantly surprised you replieed.

Her: what is replieed? you okay? (she was obviously joking about my typo but not acknowledging what I said)

I then changed the subject and we got to talking about movies and she was replying within 10-20 minutes of each message. She wasn't the same as before but she wasn't cold or rude. I couldn't read how she was feeling. I was asking questions and she was replying but she didn't ask any back. Though she said enough to keep the conversation going.

I told her it was my birthday in a few days and she didn't acknowledge that part of the message but made a comment about me being an Aries. I found this weird because we talked about this a lot when we were seeing each other but she said it in a way as if it was new information. We got to talking about astrology and she said I should check my rising sign. This is something she had done for me in the past and we had conversations about.

51,mfsrnc,1617033740,Being told you are ugly is better than being told you are not ugly.,"**-- You really have to try and understand the reasons why I am saying this so you can understand the roots and the process of this line of thinking.  --**

All my life since I was around 4 years old entering pre school, it was pretty clear kids around me saw me as an outsider. I was born with an invisible **genetical condition** which affected me slightly; in terms of hearing issues, speech issues, which related to my hearing, looks, and slight deformities about me that affected my childhood, teenage years, and thus fully developing into adulthood.

On a side note; I had a severe **pornography addiction** throughout secondary school to relax me before I went to school; and to fall asleep because of severe anxiety; somebody found out the levels of videos I ended up resorting to get me to release; and the entire year and worse found out through my search history.

Other students throughout school mocked me for: My buck teeth, which took four years adjusting; in primary school I wore glasses, and secondary school which destroyed my confidence because I wore the ugliest type of glasses a man can wear. I was mocked for my severe acne; before being put onto **accutane** which really fixed a lot of the issues and prevented much more spots like the clusters I had in school from re developing. The redness and **Rosacea**, back in my college days (in the UK) allowed me to develop severe social anxiety. Because I was red like with blushing; except I was never blushing.

Once I hit 15. And left school, with a delusional view of a new world; I really took it upon myself to put in work in self development. This was 7 years ago. This is where I begun my accutane treatment, started a new life of work, and college, started wearing contact lenses, and begun training. HEAVILY.

There is a post of me on facebook of how I was in one of the top ten gym goers at my local favourite gym at the time. I went something like 115 times across 5 months. This means, I went at least 23 times a month, with only resting when my body told me to. This is how committed I was too making change. My body began to change, I was hooked. I tried extremely hard to think about the food that was going into my mouth, I was obsessed with developing leaner and sexier looking muscular frame. Which I eventually did. It was like a mission; thinking this was one of the clear reasons I was failing in confidence and approachability when it came to attracting women.

Later on in my college years, I begun to develop severe depression. A lot of my family, myself included at times believe this to be more reactive rather than clinical. This was more for my social anxiety they tried to tackle with me in therapy. Believing my lack of social connection was the reason for most of my depression.

Bare in mind, that during these days at school, I was rejected socially, by society. There were groups of people all hanging out with each other at all times of the day through school and college. I would just walk around aimlessly with max 1-2 friends if that if they were with their people. I might get lucky once in a while; but people would pretend I'm not there and eventually either force me to leave or they would leave me themselves.

The world of work really changed my life. I developed peoples skills, and approachability when speaking, speaking clearly, not caring about what others thought when I spoke. These were CRUCIAL to fixing a lot of my social anxiety and self development and confidence.

\*\*

My point with a lot of this is. This is how my life was and how it impacted my dating life. No one wants to date me, despite the clear amount of effort of trying EVERYTHING to become more attractive and appreciate myself more.

Deluding people that looks do not matter, and all that matters is 'personality' and 'confidence' is what gets women; is pushing a false reality that makes sufferers believe that it is their fault that they cannot obtain any kind of relationship experiences.

If you've lived a life that I have; then you will figure out very quickly that it doesn't matter what you do to change or improve; you just feel ignored and rejected by the world.

\*\*

By telling someone, yes, you are not conventionally attractive; helps to put the mind at rest for the souls of people who feel like dating is like trying to communicate with a brick wall. It helps them put their mind to other positive things in life that will be life changing; and MAYBE even push a better dating life, because they are no longer living inside a FALSE REALITY which has been unjustly put onto them by the rest of society. Im not suggesting anyone is owed anything. I'm not saying anyone doesn't have the right to be attracted to who they want. I'm JUST POINTING OUT, that saying someone is not ugly, is further harming their results and confidence in attracting and meeting women; because most get TOLD OUTRIGHT they are ugly, disgusting to look at; undatable. ETC All the things I have been called.

You don't realise the impact of your words have on people who are going through a really hard time of it. This proves it's not the relationships single frustrated men especially care about. It's wanting to feel validated in a world where you look odd if you are just walking around alone all the time.

Please don't go around calling people ugly, but also, don't go around telling ugly people they are good looking. Tell them that society is cruel, and that it will be hard, but you have to put in the effort and the changes to allow you to be happy and free from a cruel society of which we are all living in today.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mfsrnc/being_told_you_are_ugly_is_better_than_being_told/

54,mft8cz,1617034973,Argument &amp; Dilemma with Girlfriend. Advice be much appreciated.,"Hi,

Hope everyone is keeping well.

I'm looking for some advice on what to do with my current situation. Sorry if this is long.

Been in relationship for 1.5 year, with a 31 year old (me 28) of which I have lots fun times with but also always followed by unnecessary drama and stress, and feeling like going around in circles/rollercoaster. walking on eggshells half the time. I have started to realise she checks all the boxes of BPD. She also refers to herself as a ""Strong, independent woman"" which I've heard from other is a red flag. And is very needed with wanting attention from me via texts throughout the week (only see her on weekends) and it's all I have right now due to lockdown here (UK).

COVID has got me down a lot, not being able to do the things I want do, and have feared the loss of my relationship due this and having reliable sex, company.

Last night we went to bed after good fun weekend, I go lay down in bed after using the bathroom while she goes, and turn the light off, waiting for her to join me. She then comes in and rudely says ""You're in a rush, and why turned the light off?"" I was like wtf, so kept calm and said it's not a problem, and turn it back on. She then gets into bed with her back turned to me, passive aggressively, and I ask why, to which she is silent and I thought was best not to cuddle up after her acting rudely towards me (showing her it's not okay and so she won't do again - right?).

She then goes into my living room after 10 min, so I get up and ask her what's wrong, and she flips at me saying I also ""Ignored"" her after finishing the movie (it was already 2:30 am on Sun eve), to which I was so confused. And told her had no idea I did such a thing and that I was confused/mind blown. I admittedly did probably argue more than I should've, and said that she was creating unnecessary drama over such a trivial thing.

She then kept blabbing on about how 'rude' I was and 'how dare I speak to her like that' so just kept quiet, and she got her things and left. I then text her saying I'm sorry a nice weekend had to come to that (a bit beta I know) if you could let me know when you get home.

I've since heard nothing back from her now 4 pm here, and not sure how to proceed, feeling pretty depressed by it want not be in this grey area, but not wanting to be weak and passive either.

The weird thing is this had been one of the best weekends in a long time, and she was talking about going on holiday later in the year etc.

If people could advise on how I should proceed from here, and wether I should reach out. The last time this happened 6 months ago I went 3 days No Contact and she took 4 days to get back to me, not sure that's the way to go with this now. Head says I need to end it (has for a while) but heart says not to, and know how much I'd miss the good times with her.

56,mftcyj,1617035328,Should sexual priorities be a deal-breaker?,"Ttl;dr: Different priorities on STI testing before sex; I think it is important, partner doesn't care but is willing to get it done.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm in a bit of a quandary. My boyfriend (30) is several years older than me (F, 21). He has been in a few relationships before, while he is my first relationship.

I happen to know he's never discussed STIs with his previous girlfriends. He has only been with two or three people, but still, the lack of concern on his part is worrying me. I told him I wasn't sure how to feel about it, and he said he can't change his past and he's not going to lie about it. He's right, he can't change the choices he's made in the past, and I am glad he is being honest about it. On one hand, I'm baffled by his lack of concern in this area, when he usually takes reasonable precautions in other areas. On the other hand, he can't change his past and is fine with getting tested now. Still, I think STIs should be taken seriously.

&amp;#x200B;

1st Girl:  

We matched texted on a dating app and then spoke on the phone for like an hour or two. After we stopped talking, I told her I was gonna head to bed soon, she texts me saying wait I want to talk more. I message her and she doesn't respond so I go to sleep. She messages a few hours later. That same night we spoke about setting plans for 2 days in the future. We text but she takes hours and hours to respond. The next day she sets plans to meet up the next day so I ask her something and she doesn't respond. I wait a few hours and send a follow-up ""?"". She messages saying yeah let's do this time.  The day of she messages me and says hey let's do a bit later. I go cool no worries.  I ask her if 7 pm works for her. Like 5 hours pass by and I message asking her so whats going on. She says like 620, Hey I actually have a class from like 6 - 8. I message her saying I find it rude that you would make plans and not really communicate and cancel on me last moment like this. She blocks me on the dating app and doesn't respond. GG

&amp;#x200B;

2nd Girl: 

We match on an app again. We talk for a bit and she seems really enthusiastic about the conversation. So we get to talking and again set plans to hang out. She tells me she is gonna see some friends the next day so she doesn't know if we can chill during the day or the night. I got no worries I guess just to keep me posted with like the plans. She keeps talking and were joking having a good time.  Anyways the day of Im just texting asking whats going on. She tells me shes waiting on friends and seeing what they are saying and stuff. She sends me a screenshot saying see I'm not lying. In my head im like don't really need to convince me I give you the benefit of the doubt. Her last message was Ill let you know asap whats going on. I wait like 4 hours and respond, hey so whats going on. Again radio silence. L number 2. 

&amp;#x200B;

3rd Girl:

&amp;#x200B;

We start texting back and forth for like a week. Set up a date to facetime cause she says she wants to do that first. I go no worries im cool with that. We facetime for like 30 mins. Talk and joke around. This was during the weekday during work hours. So she is like sending emails for work, but saying sorry I need to do this etc. I didn't think she was being rude she was being respectful and stuff. Anyways. Shes like I gotta go and respond back to this. I'm like no worries we can talk later. She goes Okay ill message you later. Anyways few hours go by and she texts me saying see I told you I would message you. Im like lol no worries I get you got work. Anyways we talk about stuff. Then I eventually text her saying so now that we have facetimed a bit would you be interested in like going out on a date. And again She must have passed into the afterlife cause this was ghost number 3.

We've seen each other once during the week for like an hour  and once on the weekend for a good couple of hours, despite her living in a house that is 1 minute footwalk from mine.
I asked her if we could meet more often, like 3 or 4 times per 7 days week, or longer per time that we saw each other because I found that we were seeing each other really little given that we were supposed to be dating. 
Her reaction was that that is too much.

Dude was nice, almost too nice. Whenever I told him something he would be completely amazed and lift me up with comments and it was all very over the top. He was intensely eager and earnest and complimented me all the time. He even complimented me for what I know are my mediocre abilities at certain things. Like spinning a top—it was a below average attempt, but he praised me like I was the goddess of top-spinning. At one point he was staring into my eyes with his eyes kind of bugged-out with his intensity, and i had the thought that flashed through my mind: THIS GUY IS A CREEP. Despite his physically attractive and put together appearance, he creeped me out on some deep animal level. 

I know that some people are going to say that I am not giving nice guys a chance, or something, but I have met plenty of *genuinely* nice guys, and they did not leave me with this unsettled feeling. My gut told me not to go on a second date so I definitely won’t. 

Maybe it was because his niceness felt almost like a performance? He is an actor..... a rather successful one at that. (Nobody you would know though) Maybe he’s just one of those very extroverted over the top people, but idk

So I'm a college student and I met this guy through work last summer and we really hit off. We stopped speaking after the fall semester started, but reconnected coincidentally around January. We've been chatting and hanging out more, watching movies together, getting food and I've just been liking him more and more. I sent him a risky text saying ""I find myself missing your company"" or something like that (at like 2 in the morning, when I was tired as hell not fully knowing what I was doing or how it sounded). The next day we spoke, where he was apologizing saying he had a boyfriend but he doesn't think they'd last long and left that hanging in the air, HOWEVER admitting that the day before where we were hanging out, he had wanted to kiss me three times, so instead of saying why the bloody hell didn't you just do it, I just said ""wow"". After some talking about where to go from here and to wait it out, we practically started FaceTiming every day, getting lunch together, doing homework together, etc. So of course, already having feelings there in the first place, naturally, they gigantified and I told him I can't just see him as a friend and that I think I need to distance myself or stop being friends, out of respect for his relationship. His boyfriend saw the message, conflict ensued, his boyfriend wanted him to drop me, he told me he didn't want to lose me (thinking he could potentially lose something where the grass can be greener), we have a natural connection that he hasn't felt with someone in a long time blah, blah. So I said sure, let's see what happens (can you foreshadow where  this is going?)  


So the next week we watch a movie together, Zack Snyder's cut was bloody amazing btw, and one thing led to *many* others. After that happened and I'm walking around with an inflated ego the size of Jimmy Neutrons' head, I begin to think to myself ""wow he must feel the same way or something"". *Let the distancing begin.* A week has gone by where I initiate the texts, we've only spoken twice where he says he's busy (though posting on socials) and  I'm just wondering if I'm being ghosted. I've experienced this many times, where a potential partner has just talked less and less, and finally Casper  The Friendly Ghost's me. Is it time to move on, am I being the bad person (because I feel like it), am I overreacting, etc? I'm just trying to see why it started to fall off or if I'm the issue here...",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mfu2hq/stuck_on_whether_or_not_its_over/

Im learning Spanish so that I can actually have conversations with them on my own in the future, but I’m obviously not going to pick it up in a few weeks time. My bf keeps telling me not to worry about it, but I’m very nervous for this trip. 

We’re going to be staying with them for a week, and I won’t be able to speak to them unless my bf is constantly there to translate.

71,mfuprx,1617038965,Ghosted a guy for almost 8 months and he still wants to see me,"I (20f) have been ghosting a ex-coworker (30m) we'll call him L for 8 months after moving away for college and I feel guilty.

Well we met at my old job and we ended up being pretty good friends for about a year and a half. I had a ldr with my now ex at the time so obviously nothing happened plus there was an age gap. I think there was a little attraction between me and L that we knew we could do nothing about so things got a little weird for a bit but overall things were left on good terms. He never made a move or even touched me till my last day in town when he gave me a hug. Well he seemed really sad on my last day in town. Like really sad. I think he actually liked me a lot more than he admitted. 

So we kept in touch a little bit but then I got busy and we talked less. The last text I sent L I said I was coming back to visit soon and then dropped contact. The catalyst was really me going through a bad breakup with my ex and just not having the energy to talk to anyone after that. So yea L still texts me sometimes. It's probably less than 8 months since I stopped talking to him and I did text him on Xmas to just say merry xmas but we haven't actually had a convo for 8 months. He doesn't blow me up or anything just wishes me well on exams sometimes and wishes me happy holidays and checks on me because I have medical conditions. Well now idk how to reinitiate contact without looking like an asshole. He last texted me he was visiting my town soon like a week ago and asked to see me. I have been ghosting him for so long that idk why he still tries. It's also been a couple months since my breakup and I think I'm ready to move on. L is also a student so even with the age gap we aren't in completely different stages of life. I feel bad though. This guy should have gave up by now. How could he still want to see me?

72,mfv77b,1617040250,I’m scared that my next relationships are gonna be as huge failure as the previous ones,"Hey, there is this guy (17 - highschool) whom I (19F - college) met on Omegle. We started to talk and now we’re on the phone every evening for more than 2 weeks. He’s really sweet and I feel like I really like him. But only in 2 weeks we found out a huuuge amout of things about each other and we’ve had many luscious conversations as well. And we literally talk about everything and I feel like I have feelings for him. And he confessed he fell in love with me.
But I’m extremely scared of how fast things happened and from my previous experience I know that it might be a bad sign. All of my relationships started after a really short amout of time since I met the person. I know that I’m definitely not gonna make the same mistake. And we made things pretty clear between each other (he mentioned that It’s a huge turn on that I can think rationally) and explained everything. And we agreed on taking things very very slow. But still I’m so scared that it’s gonna be a fail again once we start dating (if so). And I’m scared of that stereotype: you meet someone who seems like your soulmate, you think about them every day and night, you talk a lot, you tell everything about yourselves to each other, you start dating, having sex, you meet their family and do stuff together. And then you hurt each other and break up.
I really don’t want to hurt him or myself. And I’m afraid (and maybe also tired?) of investing my time, emotions, love, energy and money into someone, whom it’s not gonna work out again with.
Anyone some thoughts? Thank you very much.

P.S. All of my previous relationships were long distance. I’ve never dated anyone from my town ever. And this guy is 2.5 hours away from my hometown and 45 minutes from the city I study at.

P.P.S. It really turns me on that he’s 2 years younger than me.

73,mfv9g2,1617040405,Dating at 24 During COVID,"My girlfriend and I broke up after two years in June. For most of my life, I didn’t really think about relationships too much. That’s because I didn’t know how good they could be. We broke up amicably which I thought would make it easier but, in reality, it made it so much worse.  

The upside of the break up is that I now have a deep, honest appreciation of how productive, life affirming, and comforting having an SO can be. Also, I am much more appreciative of just how much work goes into maintaining and growing a relationship. Before, it was all just theoretical, something I heard people talk about but never understood. 

It’s been nine months, and I feel better. I’ve been working to improve myself and I’ve taken a serious inventory about what was good and bad in my last relationship. For the first time in my life, I am genuinely interested in getting out there with the intent to create a meaningful relationship with someone. 

But with the lack of socializing that comes from COVID and working from home, I have next to no avenues to meet new people. This has been especially hard to deal with because in college I used to go to my frat house, study with classmates, or just be around people in public spaces. I wasn’t the biggest social butterfly, but I had plenty of friends and ways to meet new people if I wanted to.

It’s just frustrating. That NOW I have to have this piece of critical personal development. That NOW I have to grow as a person and appreciate the deeper aspects of the human experience.

I’m mostly joking. I’m grateful to my ex for everything she did. I’m especially grateful for her being such a wonderful partner that she completely flipped my idea of relationships around. 

But it’s frustrating right? That now is the time I’m supposed to meeting people, developing, and moving on with my life. But every day, all I have is this little space in my life someone used to occupy. I see a funny meme or a picture of an exceptionally cute dog and all I think is “You don’t have anyone to share this with anymore.” That there’s this almighty nothing where the best part of my day used to be. 

For awhile I thought I missed my ex, but I realized I just missed the option of connecting with someone. Of meeting someone new and being so entranced, so caught up with how fascinating a person can be. Even if it doesn’t work out, just the attempt at connection is fulfilling. It feels productive, like you’re doing what you’re supposed to be doing in order to find a person. It feels like you’re connecting with humanity as a whole, like this person is an ambassador to all the good in the world. 

I know it’s good to stand on your own two feet. That you shouldn’t hand the reins to your emotional well-being off to someone else and expect them to take care of it. But it’s like I finally learned how to read then someone came along and plucked out my eyes. 

I’m not trying to dramatize or idealize relationships and dating in general. I know it’s 99% rough to 1% diamond. But I feel like I’d give my right hand for a bad date right now. Just to give it the ole college try. Not even having the option to try is what’s killing me. 

I’m sorry for the long post. I just needed to scream into the void a lil bit.

74,mfvavy,1617040514,Guy I was talking to thought my situation was “too much” and couldn’t wait,"Hey there, I [24F] was talking to a guy [29M] for a period of a little over two weeks through online dating. It was the first time in a long time I had felt this way toward another individual. I really liked him.

Unfortunately, I currently live about 4 1/2 hours away from him. I will be moving in August for grad school so I will be about an hour and a half instead. We have a lot in common and our conversations are great, but the other day he dropped the bombshell saying that my situation is too much for him and August is too far away for him to wait. 

It was disappointing but ultimately understandable. I didn’t want to throw our relationship away so I asked him to be friends instead so we can keep in touch. He agreed that he didn’t mind at all, so that is where we are now.

I’m curious what everyone’s perspective is on the “not being able to wait” part. I felt like four months wasn’t that long, but I guess he just rather preferred to date in person right away? The thing is, the whole time we have been talking he hadn’t really flirted with me. I just assumed it was because everything was so fresh and we just needed time to get comfortable. He also is the type that is never much on his phone, so I’d get just one text a day from him. Which is fine, you can tell he was really genuine and took the time to respond meaningfully.

I guess since it just happened I’m still overthinking it, and just wanted someone’s perspective on this. I felt a little insecure when it happened and disappointed of course. It slightly made me feel like I wasn’t good enough. I also don’t know if this was the right choice I pulled staying friends cause I feel like I might have a chance in the future with him, but dont know how he feels about that cause I was too much of a chicken to ask and didn’t want to make him feel uncomfortable in any way. 

We still talk daily, and I may be going up in the area to look for my new place in May and figured I can ask him to hangout. I just don’t know if I’m living in the clouds and giving myself false hope.

75,mfvaw8,1617040514,Why Am I Like This?,"My (f26)and probably my soon to be bf (m25) have been seeing one another since last December. We both are pretty busy. Although he might be the more occupied one right now due to working 2 jobs and completing a sterile processing externship and I am in nursing school and work 1 job. 

Basically, since we don’t spend much in-person time with one another we call, text, and sometimes FaceTime. However, due to not being able to spend much time with him, I do catch myself getting super frustrated with him and at times we can bicker over the smallest things and when we do finally get to spend some time together, I want to bring it up, but once we are together none of that stuff even matters anymore. We genuinely end up enjoying each others company &amp; conversation.

The most recent time we spent with one another we were talking about “future” aspects of life and accidentally told him “I would still love him regardless.” &amp;he pretty much took that phrase serious since we haven’t told one another that we love each other yet and wanted me to repeat just to make sure heard correctly. 

Later that night as we were saying bye to one another, he flat out said the “I love you” to me. He covered his face and was embarrassed. I didn’t say it back but I did pry his hands off of his face to kiss him lol

I think it’s safe to say that we both have highly mutual feelings for one another, but theres still some skepticism I feel about “us” due to still not being official and barely seeing one another.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mfvaw8/why_am_i_like_this/

86,mfwnz8,1617044166,Is it possible he may still like me?,"Met a guy online, last year... i was really mean and disrespectful. racist too... i found out i have BPD. he broke things off with me. and i was in a relationship before seeing him which impacted into getting it. anyways, we still hang out and make out the usual we did when we were in the process of dating. he forgave me and i told him i’m going to therapy. i know he is hurt, and i’m really trying my best to be better. i really like him and i would love a chance. but i understand it may take a while, what do you guys think? i texted him last night thanking him for dinner and that i had a good time. we got into a little argument, i’m really sensitive atm during this healing process. but other than that, it was great. he also said he enjoyed it and said he was sorry for being rude.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mfwnz8/is_it_possible_he_may_still_like_me/
87,mfwqaw,1617044347,"Feelings suddendly gone after third date, wanted him so much before?","I recently met a really nice guy and luckily he asked me out right away. He is quiet inexperienced (never had a girlfriend or anything, he is 20) and but I like that. 
I fell in love with him the first time we talked, just been thinking about him all the time and hoping that he feels the same. 
But it slowed down again, this infatuation, and after the third date now, he is the one that is in love with me suddendly and my feelings are now low again.
It's because I suddenly recognized some things he said or does, that just made me rethink what I expect from a relationship. He has so many similar traits and I think a relationship with him would be great, and I also have feelings and sexual attraction to him, but something, feeling like ""fear of commitment"" is stopping me and telling me he is not the right one for me and also, that I don't want a relationship. 

I have fear of missing out on a potentially really nice relationship and this guy, but on the other hand I have this picture of my dream-guy (who would for example be more empathic or better with feelings)  in my mind with who I don't have to ask this question. 

I could do with lots of different thoughts and perspectives on this so please write youe heart out if you feel like it. Thanks!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mfwqaw/feelings_suddendly_gone_after_third_date_wanted/

I really despise social media (where its actually tied to my name) and am happy not to have had one. I also like to keep my digital footprint as low as possible and just don't like having to maintain a profile.

Do I need to admit defeat and just make one?  It really sucks that I feel like I'm being penalized for valuing my privacy.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mfx5wg/first_time_dating_since_2007_is_it_really_that/
90,mfxc5p,1617045918,"I slept with him on the first date, how do I not ruin it?",I really like this guy and we connected really well and talked for hours. We went to three different places during our date then back to his apartment. I’ve genuinely never felt a connection with someone like that before. But I’ve also never slept with someone on the first date before. I just felt really comfortable and didn’t hesitate at all. I would like to text him and express that I wanna see him again but I’m not sure how long to wait. Should I see if he texts me first? I know that sometimes guys change their opinions on girls after they sleep with them so I’m just not sure what to do.

91,mfxcee,1617045936,"[30 year old male] never been in a relationship or had sex before, always wanted to get married and have kids but it just never happened. Is it too late for me?","So i am a 30 year old guy with basically zero dating experience (im also still a virgin) but over the past year ive just been feeling like i'll never find someone. 

As for what i do for a living i work as an engineer and i do make good money, ive also nearly brought my own house so you can say that im finacially stable (i'll probaly be making more money in the future). Money just isnt a worry for me

In terms of my appearance im 6ft tall, blue eyes, thick redhair, im athletic but thats because im big into my fitness, good skin and i dress nice. Im not the best looking in the world but i do think im decent looking

its literally impossible to find a single childfree woman my age, ive tried online dating and although i do get plenty of likes but im just not into those types of women (no offense). Although im not that picky when it comes to women but most of the women that show interest in me are either overweight or are single mothers, im just not into those two demographics.

Im also on the aspergers spectrum and i am a bit of an introvert , i do go out to bars/clubs by myself but i just dont have any luck there. I dont exactly know how to talk or flirt with women.

i can never find single women that are around my age. I do go to the gym 3-5 days a week and its very rare to come across a woman my age, even then they are 99 percent likely to be taken.

As for my job i mostly work on my own so i cant meet women there either and when im at hospitals fixing equipment/carrying out maintenance i pretty much have no time to talk to women because im super busy.

But for years i was told that ""it will come"" and to just focus on myself (which i did) but unfortinatly for me it never did.

Now im 30 years old who is finacially well off and nearly a house brought but if i died tomorrow i dont have a wife or kids to pass that on to.

And i dont look like your typical ""loner"" either. If you seen me you wouldnt think that im some 30 year old who has never even hugged a woman but i am.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mfxcee/30_year_old_male_never_been_in_a_relationship_or/

97,mfyvzn,1617050173,Confused,"Hi, so long story short, women (20y/o) I was pursuing for 2 weeks rejected me via text &amp; stopped pursuing. I attempted one more time but I had added I was interested in other women as well but felt there was potential between us &amp; if she just wants to be friends as she previously told me I accept her decision. She rejected me more harshly than the first time and I didn’t say anything. She then texts me back few days later saying it was her friends who sent that rude text and she’s now seeing the guy she was initially interested in hoping everything’s cool and we can still be friends... I just told her I’d appreciate she give me some space &amp; left it there. Why did she come back to tell me she was seeing someone ? Was it to put it in my face or did she take disrespect of me telling her I’ve been talking with other women?

99,mfyxh9,1617050287,I want to know if he's lying about the other girl because it will give me peace of mind,"I was seeing a guy I met on hinge for 2 months and it's been 2 dates because we live far from each other. On date 2 we had sex and he didn't call afterwards. I called him out on it and he said it was not his intention for me to feel used. He said to him sex was not the end goal and it was another building block towards a relationship. He also said he didn't feel good about the tension he was sensing from me and that we should just keep our communication to texting instead of seeing each other.  I then softened and told him I understand and that I didn't want there to be tension. He ghosted me for three days and I sent him a final message saying I misjudged his character then blocked him. 

About a month later I went on a date with another guy but I didn't feel the connection. I messaged the first guy telling him how I felt, that I had probably acted in the heat of the moment and wanted to reconnect. He then got back to me and said he had been getting serious with someone for a week or two. I feel so sad about this because I really thought there was a chance we would work out and I didn't think I would be replaced this easily.yeah I would be too.  I also kind of feel like he is using the seeing someone as a cop-out because I am looking for something serious and he just wants to play around. I want to find out that there really isnt a girl or if there is a girl, she is just there as a casual hook up. Knowing that he is just a jerk and is using ridiculous excuses because he knew he played a shitty card but doesn't want to do the work to fix the relationship cause he broke it will make me feel better. 

His hinge is still there on my matches list but there haven't been updates on his profile. FYI I matched with him twice due to app lagging in the span of 4 months. I still want to know if there's a way to find out if he's still using it. 

Would appreciate any thoughts on the situation, any hinge tricks or both.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mfyxh9/i_want_to_know_if_hes_lying_about_the_other_girl/
