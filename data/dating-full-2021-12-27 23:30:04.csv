With dating apps and social media do you think its made dating easier or harder? 

My take on it is its made hooking up 10x easier but harder when it comes to finding love and something long term. 

Even if you find someone and begin a relationship, there's no guarantee that they're not online eyeing what else is out there. There's really no way to know. I know it boils down to trust but how can we really know what our partner is doing behind our backs?

Also, I recently had a friend message me on Instagram. She asked if I was interested in girls. (She's lesbian) I said no but that I was flattered. I guessed she was drunk one night when she messaged me this. I was cool with it and didn't take it the wrong way, but I did ask her, ""Aren't you engaged?"" She laughed and said, ""Yeah! But that doesn't mean we're not open to others. You're so 1950s!"" 

She did apolgize for the advances but again I didn't take any of it personal. What did stand out to me was the 1950s comment, and thats something that I feel I'm coming up against a lot in dating lately. 

A few guys I've met recently over the past year whenever they asked me what I was looking for, I told them something along the lines of, ""I want to take things slow, I'm not looking to rush into anything, but I'm also more of a relationship/monogamous type of girl."" 

After that I usually never saw them again. If they wanted to hook up that's one thing but these guys didn't come off that way. They came off like they were looking for love BUT they did (one in particular) say something along the lines of, ""I like a lot of freedom in a relationship, you can hang out with whoever you want to hang out with (male friends included), I'm not a huge texter, I like a girl that knows what she wants, and most girls fall for me too fast.""

Hmmmm it did alarm bells for me. It sounded like he wanted a casual relationship or a relationship with a lot of ""freedom"" in it. 

It seems more and more that polyamorous relationships are becoming popular. I'm also seeing a lot of couples online that state on their profile ""in an open relationship/open to threescore, voyeurism."" 

I have nothing against any of this, and in fact I did consider what if this lifestyle could work for me? But then I came to the conclusion it wouldn't at least not initially. Its just something I'm still getting use to the concept of, being ok with sharing my partner. I would just be afraid jealousy would come into play, and the risk of my partner leaving me for another person. The possibility is there. 

Also, I know this lifestyle works for some people, but I've heard it's also destroyed a lot of relationships too.

I’ve recently started seeing this new guy and he stays over mine often.

One of my prompts is, “Let’s make sure we’re on the same page about…” and (among other, more light-hearted things) my answer includes “wanting a relationship.” 

When I get a match, or go on the first date, I’ll usually ask what they’re looking for if it’s not stated on their profile (I know Hinge’s terms include wanting a meaningful relationship, but that hasn’t helped anything, IMO). I’ve gotten a mix of “I don’t know,” “Casual dating,” “A relationship maybe, but I don’t want to rush into anything” etc. My most recent encounter was a guy who said he was “emotionally available,” we had a great first date, then the second date ended with him saying “we’re already doing couple-y things (meaning holding hands in public kinda things, which honestly he initiated most of) and I’m not ready, so please let me initiate that kind of stuff on my terms” so then I got insecure and anxious about everything because I realized I would be afraid to ask for a date or anything out of fear of scaring him off. That led to this post. 

I never expect anyone to rush into anything. Ever. I completely respect that it takes time to get to a point of saying no to everyone else to say yes to one person (assuming monogamy, which my relationships include, no shame otherwise, though!). 

That said, I, personally, do see value in just saying yes or no when it comes to the question of, “Are you ideally, if all goes well, looking for a relationship?” 

I view stating &amp; asking about intentions as choosing which set of lenses to look through as you date; when I was into casual dating, for example, the lenses I looked through were questions of do we have fun together, is he nice, do we get along, etc. As I’ve moved into wanting to date towards a relationship, the lenses have changed to deeper things like do I see myself trusting this person’s words and actions, what’s his dating history like (and is he willing to hear mine, judgment free?), how are his friendships, relationships with family, etc.

I also don’t have sex outside of a relationship, which is another reason I ask about what they’re looking for - I don’t want to waste their time if that’s not okay with them/they expect sex during the dating-multiple-people-phase. 

Maybe I’m shooting myself in the foot here, though. Maybe being too blunt is pushing potentially good matches away because they feel like it’s a RIGHT NOW kinda thing, when it’s not. It just gives direction to the whole thing, which I like. Maybe I could/should communicate that better.

I’m upfront on Hinge since I have kids and state it on the drop-down menu. I’ve been casually dating a woman (41F) for almost 3 months and found out she has a child last night. I find it a little unsettling she didn’t admit to having kids when it was clear that I do. 

Context: I do not introduce dates to my kids and think it’s better for everyone, most importantly the kids. If it’s a LTR then I’d consider it when we have a deep connection. She knows the above from conversations early on. We are both successful in our fields and also spiritual so have developed a bond in those realms. I respect her greatly and believe she’s helped me become a better version of myself in a short period of time. After dating 10+ women this year I can say she is a rare combo of confidence, class and beauty with traditional values. Hard to find in the Bay Area where poly/ENM is seemingly ubiquitous and ghosting is a way of life. We are both North Bay folks so lifestyle and location is a great fit too. 

What do both F and M think about telling someone you have kids ? How long would you wait ? How should I broach this when we talk again this week ?

We are planning NYE in the city (SF) so not making any quick decisions this week.

Hey 👋 
Recently I (f,24) have broken up with with my bf of 4 years. After that I had a so-called **e phase where I hooked up with people (in particular 6 in total, and prior to that I only slept with 2 people, two exes). 

2 of the guys who I slept with became something closer to me. We didn’t discuss relationships yet but it’s definitely going towards that direction, not just sex. From one prospective I like them both, but from another this phase made me realize I’m very capable of letting them go for a very minor type of dislike. And that my interest in them is weird, it’s not as intense as something I’ve felt to guys I liked before. Has sleeping with so many people changed me? Is it my breakup? Why am I so cold-hearted and can let people go easily (even the ones with whom we developed something, not a huge thing yet, but definitely some romance )?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1141622,public,self,I’m not as affectionate anymore after a phase,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rq2omx/im_not_as_affectionate_anymore_after_a_phase/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,

She is pretty keen on said activity so I don't know if she likes me at all or just the sport. She's a bit more of a beginner than me so it would be beneficial for her to practice with me. She hasn't mentioned a boyfriend so I assume she is single. She also hasn't made a point of saying or hinting at being single which you think she might if she was interested.

I want to ask her out but not sure the best way to do it. I did ask her for a drink after one session and she said yes, but then as we were saying our goodbyes after the drink it felt a bit abrupt, but she texted me later to say it was a good evening so it feels 50/50 which way it would go. That kind of drink after is a pretty regular thing with those types of clubs so don't know if I can read much into it. Text wise it's been pretty much just talking about the sport and because I'm not sure if that's the only reason I see her I don't want to hassle her asking her about other stuff in her life in case it's weird.

So I want to ask her out or at least sus out whether she is interested but I want it not to be awkward for her and easy for her if she wants to say no so I was thinking maybe doing it via text would be the best way so I don't put her on the spot? Most of my dating experience has been through online dating so then you already kind of know they are interested or at least know the context of your interactions but I rarely meet people I'm interested in irl so this is kind of new to me.

I (28M) started seeing this girl (26F) roughly 7 weeks ago. We went on a first date and it was great, chatted all night. We text frequently enough but not constantly throughout the day. Since that first date, we have basically hung out every weekend for one to two days straight. The sex is amazing and I have a great time just bullshitting and drinking with this girl. three weeks in I tell her ""I kinda like you,"" which I feel like is an appropriate emotion to have after seeing someone for three weeks, sleeping with them, and chatting every day. She doesn't really reciprocate, but tells me she has a hard time being vulnerable because she just got out of a 4 year relationship 8 months ago. We continue hanging out but I feel as though she pulled away a bit since revealing this to her; She doesn't text me as frequently and she doesn't seem as eager to make plans with me. A few weekends ago we're hanging out and I ask why its hard for her to be vulnerable with me. She reiterates what she stated previously and says she doesn't know if she wants to actually date someone right now, even though in the past she has told me she is looking for something long term. She does however admit that she likes me. Since then, she has basically bailed on me twice; one weekend she was going to come over after drinking with her friends, but said she was too hungover so she said we should hangout next Sunday after Christmas. Next Sunday comes and I text her in the morning asking what we are going to do that day. She takes hours to respond and tells me that she's hanging with her family again. I'm just torn between continuing to try with this girl, or giving up and telling her that we should stop seeing eachother because I feel like I'm not getting much reciprocation from her.

 I’m very successful in life, I had a great job, now go to an Ivy League law school, have a great job lined up post school, am financially secure, mesh really well with all of my colleagues/classmates/mentors.  I can work a room and network really well.  I’ve given speeches in front of 1000 people. And in friend relationships women generally have told me I’m very funny.

But when it comes to dating or pursuing woman for relationships, all of that confidence is reversed.  Instead of focusing on my qualities, I think about my drawbacks.  I’m short - 5’5” - nothing I can do about that.  I’m also not fat, but definitely not a slim guy, I have a little extra, nor noticeably muscular.  

I’ve matched with like 10 girls on Hinge in a span of a few days.  A couple convos are going well but I’m deathly afraid to set up a date.  I’m so worried she won’t like my physically, especially if we make it to the bedroom.

Or who should? 

I study in an expensive city. I see someone who treats me well otherwise and acts very committed to me. He works but is in a junior position at work. 

He hardly ever pays for any dating expenses, and if he does, it’s usually something very minor and happens rarely. 

From day one every drink and meal has been split very evenly. 

Because he has a roommate and I mostly host, so that adds to my bill but i usually don’t mind because I prefer my place. 

But I’m wondering if this guy I’m seeing is not a good fit for me financially… that we may be financially incompatible? 

Don’t get me wrong. It’s not about living off a man. I’ve always paid for my own housing and living expenses with a man. Even a guy paying for dating expenses all the time isn’t great because I saw in my previous relationship that can create resentment even when the guy is earning significantly more. 

But I grew up in a culture where this is also more so the norm too and I’d always considered gifts to be a love language of mine because it’s also how I was raised as a child (a little materialistic I know, but I also can’t help my conditioning and nothing wrong with having a preference)… 

Anyway, it’d be nice to be dating someone who was a little bit more generous. Because I am used to that culture. 

I’m not sure what his mindset is but he doesn’t necessarily come from a culture where women expect to contribute half. I know in Europe it can be more that way.  

Also one thing that I think guys don’t realize is that women send a lot of money on things that are really for the date .  Sexy shoes, clothes, lingerie, perfume.  

He generally requests that I wear these things because it pleases him. I don’t think he realizes these expenses all add up quickly. 
And they are all my personal expenses 

He has some personal issues he’s trying to overcome sex wise so since they help him, I generally oblige.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1141628,public,self,Gender Roles/Money/ Dating/ Millennial Issues,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rq3en1/gender_rolesmoney_dating_millennial_issues/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,

He has severe anxiety but I get that and so do all my friends and family. He might be ND but my father has Autism so I really enjoy the way his mind works.

But he also has chronic pain in his arms and hands due to his labor intensive job. The pain also makes it hard for him to sleep. So he is often physically drained and fatigued.

He started working the steps in al anon during his relationship with his ex wife and is very aware of his codependency. He has worked hard to learn how to love himself and set boundaries. He has never used any substances beside alcohol and has been sober a couple years. (I’m in recovery too btw)

He worked ten hours on Christmas Eve. He was totally exhausted at his family gathering but he pushed through and was physically present for it. But he was dissociated which he often is.

We stayed at his parents house and went over to my house the next morning around 11am. But he was still tired. 

He was too tired and in too much pain to participate in anything on Christmas. My family is concerned. My mother has nerve pain and nerve damage too. It seems like there are lots of options to help ease his pain. And I would like him to explore treatment options.

I told him Sunday night that I would like him to consider talking to his doctor about Gabapentin. He googled it and said he won’t take pain killers. But It’s not a pain killer nor a narcotic.

I asked him to seek treatment for his sleep and pain problems. They compound on one another and make it difficult to plan anything or enjoy time together on his days off. He has been trying to “live in the moment” but as a result I can’t have expectations on any future events especially if they are social events.

But, He says he is setting a boundary and won’t take medication. He will live in pain until his hands don’t function and I should respect and accept his choice. He feels like my request violates his bodily autonomy and that I am being manipulative. But he is unwilling to talk to a sleep specialist, chiropractor, or acupuncturist either. I don’t care what his treatment is, I just want him to try things and get better!

I want someone who is willing to be a lifelong partner. And if he is adamantly refusing to get help I’m not sure if we will be able to build a life together. 

I don’t know what I can do. Any ideas? How can I address this issue?

She got dropped off by said acquaintance and he kissed her. She said she didn't want to kiss him or have feelings for him.


And she said she felt wrong for being kissed by him. I reassured her many times that it wasn't her fault and that I'm not angry or disappointed that it happened but rather than she kept it from me. Even then I reassured her it's all ok because WE ARENT OFFICIAL 

after some processing we called each other for the first time this week. She explained that she never knew him in person and only online and that was why she accepted dinner from him.

She also said that she doesn't deserved me and that she doesn't think she'll be ready for a relationship. But I still wanted to try cause I thought maybe it's another tough time in her life. And we reached a compromise of ill be un-exclusive again but still talk to her (as apparently she tells me things even her best friends dont)

I need advice. What should I do? I feel like she needs a lot of support right now due to some family problems.

I'm 35M and live in Melbourne Australia. I'm at that stage in life after a terrible divorce and taking time to pick myself up and sort myself out, I'm ready to jump back into the dating game. This time round I want a girl with some core hobbies and interests of mine. While I know I will never get someone exactly into everything I am, getting at least in the same ballpark is a must. 

I love things like a few computer games at night, watching cartoons, a game of D&amp;D and other similar things. While there is way more to me then the above mentioned hobbies. I'd like a woman who has one foot in such a world.

So far I've got a few dating apps I'm regular using. Attending a few D&amp;D games, and trying to find groups that have above kind of hobbies. But I don't really see meetup groups for these hobbies or if there is online dating for nerds/computer game fans I'd love to know what they are.

I'm fresh out of ideas or new approaches to try. Figured some of you out there in Reddit land might know.

We hit it off. We were talking about our future careers, mutual friends, he offered to get me water, he was rubbing my leg lol, and he even walked me home. We’ve talked every hour of the day via Snapchat for week straight. He’d also respond to me in like a minute, even if I left him on delivered for hours bc I was busy. He’d make me laugh, I’d make him laugh. It was great and I was SO excited that someone I was interested in was interested in me as well. 

Not to mention, he asked me to meet him at a bar twice in one week. The first time was at 2am so I told him I couldn’t. He told me that he was coming to get me (since he knew where i lived after walking me home). I told him no (in a funny way, not mean/stern) and then later he asked me to go over his house (it was 3am and that’s when I wondered if he was just trying to get me in bed with him). He also said he’d pick me up and take me home in time for Christmas Eve morning. He said he wanted me to sleep over so we could watch our fav show and sleep…idk if those were really his intentions though. I still told him no. 

Then on Christmas night, he went to a bar after spending time with family, and he asked me to go but I couldn’t. And then last night he was at his friend’s house (who I know a little), and his friend—let’s say “Jay” randomly snapchatted me, saying “I have to unadd you but it’s nothing you did”… and then right after said “I think I’m in love with you”. I’ve only hung out with Jay once with a whole bunch of other people at a party but always suspected he liked me…. But to top it off, when the guy I like (we’ll call him Matt) snapchatted me, I saw that he was at the friend Jay’s house. Which made me think that Matt was telling them that we’ve been “talking” and that he likes me… and even last night Matt was snapchatting me nonstop and asking me to hang out with them. 

But today, Matt has been super distant and has been leaving me on on delivered for super long periods of time which is so unlike him. I finally got him to talk to me kind of—he even showed me his Christmas gifts lol. But then I asked him if we could hang out before he leaves to go back to the military. It took so much courage for me to ask him because I’ve never asked a guy out before or have even been on a date, and all he said was “Are you going out on New Years”, I responded and have been left on delivered for 40 minutes when he’d answer me in one minute days ago.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1141644,public,self,He seemed interested me for a week and out of nowhere he is basically ignoring me today?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rq5fqg/he_seemed_interested_me_for_a_week_and_out_of/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,

I'm sorry for my generation and feel dejected by them at the same time. We're so hopelessly depraved. Our parents all got divorced. What we learned about dating through tv and the internet was probably not super great. Selective hearing is giving people daily affirmations for their unhealthy ideals. Nearly 1 in 3 millenials haven't had any sexual activity in a year, gen z is even worse. There's a reason for this.

Over the pandemic I've turned my diet around and quit drinking. I've lost 60 pounds with  &lt;20g carbs a day. I've naturally rested into my self confidence and security with my believing that am a valuable person for a prospective relationship. I've gone through 3 relationships in the past year, which I've learned is actually much more fortunate than a lot of men in my generation.

Each of these relationships I was approached by them, they each lasted about 3-4 months, and ended with me getting blocked on social media. 

This time last year I was going with an autistic girl who was getting her masters degree. She was super intelligent, but it was funny when she wouldn't pick up on sarcasm. We got along really well until one day I said something cross about her. Something really simple too, I just said she was bad at a certain video game, after literally weeks of me trying to be genuinely supportive. She was really bad too. It was like something switched in her brain and from then on whenever she started feeling uncomfortable she would just end up leaving and going home or hanging up the phone. A lot of the time it felt like protest behavior, not the paranoia she was selling me. So, after attempts at comforting her didn't work, I would tell her hey what you're doing is a lot like protest behavior and I don't appreciate that very much. 

And over the course of a few months, there was some back and forth of this and she blocked me and unblocked me on discord and instagram a number of times. I eventually put my foot down and told her, after me having to make amends at every crossroads in the past, it was her turn. She owes me an apology. And she still owes it. She was just physically incapable of acknowledging that she had done anything wrong at any point.

Other girl I'm dating she had just gotten out of a 2 year long relationship but I had already known her for a long time and we already had a sort of flirty relationship. She was very up front with me that she just wanted to be single, so we did our little friends with benefits dance. See I had ignored the red flags on the approach. I knew her mother, and I knew that she had been abused by her mother. She would tell stories all the time about it, but always in a good way as though they were idealizing their parent. Stories like her mother regularly forgot to pick her up at school and so she had to walk home. Or she just got left in another state altogether. Always to the effect that it made her ""stronger"". She was so adamant about this that she told me that if she ever had a child she would insist on raising them the same way, and she knows full well that her partners would have a problem with it.

After a while we started developing attachments for each other and she did not like that. It got to the point that I would drive to her house for her to sit in the room with me without even looking up from her phone at me. She would dismiss my advances. And then when I would go to leave for home, she would get up and grab my arm and kiss my neck ask me to stay. Then she goes on this work trip for a couple weeks, tells me about how she's sleeping with these guys in this other state. When she gets back from the long trip I go over to see her, but she just avoids me, calls me clingy, tells me not to come back for a couple days. I learned that what she was doing to me was something called dismissive avoidant attachment style. It's a cruel disposition to have. 

So I take this realization to her I show her look what you're doing look at what this is. I was excited, I thought a light was going off in her head, that's how I would react if I learned some insightful information about myself. But no, she completely shutdown, drove 4 states away overnight to be with her ex, and I didn't hear from her for weeks. When I finally got her attention, I was just like ""you don't have anything to say at all!?"" and no, she didn't , she continued to blame me and then proceeded to block me on messenger and on her phone. She left her childhood stuffed animal on my bed that I guess I'm either going to keep in my closet or throw away. Guess I could UPS it to her.

Anyways, third and last girl this year that I dated. Approached me telling me she thought I was hot and although she wasn't especially attractive, I was happy with the simplicity of a warm body after the nightmare I had just gotten over. I reciprocated appropriately. First day out she tells me, she gets all serious, tells me she hasn't dated anyone in 2 years and that it was a bad relationship. I tell her ""Oh sorry you didn't have anyone over the pandemic that must've been hard"". She laughed, telling me how much she enjoyed being single. I suspected she was inflating her recent sexual activity and the success she was getting on tinder.

She was clearly very insecure about her weight and her frizzy hair, and her messy car/room. Definitely a pack rat (and I'm a minimalist) but I didn't say anything to her, I was content with trying to make her feel more secure. She did something I still hate where she would pretend to not get your text until the next day or she would hold it over your head if you texted more then 3 times in a row. People really have to stop doing this. I'm considering refusing texting in the future. And I hate phone calls, but if that's what it takes. I even tried to relieve her of the stress by telling her that I won't judge her for how often or how quickly she responded to a text.

In her own weird delusional labyrinth she's created for herself, she became uncomfortable with anything less then complete submission or she wouldn't feel secure. Once it got to the point where she was just unnecessarily wasting my time, I again, confronted her for the first time about these issues and tried to offer her help, and again, blocked, disconnected, no response.

I can't continue to live with lie where we can't admit that there are a significant quantity of people out there that believe that they can do no wrong, and that excommunicating people on a whim is a justifiable and rational course of action.

Furthermore I believe these insecurity issues seem closely intertwined with single-fetishization and polyamory. Healthy relationships aren't indefinite, but they are secure. Don't try to sub/dom your partner in a relationship by creating win-lose scenarios where one person benefits at the other persons expense. Power and domination is a sexual fantasy. Aim to make win-win's in a relationship.

Just moved cities, which has helped in the healing process immensely. However, am largely starting from scratch in terms of friends (have a couple old ones in new city, but nothing close to the rich social circle I enjoyed with my ex). With recent Covid spike here, plus winter, my preferred ways of meeting new people are pretty much shot.

Here’s my dilemma. In my past, I had a tendency to make the woman in my life the center of everything. This time around, I’m vowing to live a more balanced life, sustaining friendships outside my relationship (rather than letting them fall by the wayside). This balanced way will be new to me and challenging, but I see it as essential, and vital for the health of the LTR I want. But I don’t have my “new” life in place yet, or even close. The thought of having to get there before I can be with someone makes me really discouraged. And I am losing my freaking mind not having intimacy in my life (the whole gamut, including sex but also all that other good stuff). I am 42 and find myself thinking about sex 11,000 times per day, probably more than I did at 16. Externally I think I’d be appealing as a partner, but my life isn’t as together as maybe it should be?

My close friends are split on this. One says: build friendships first, before you go off dating. She says that it would be weird if I start dating someone seriously without other relationships in this city in my life. The other is like, YOLO, you just got out of the prison of your last relationship, it’s time to celebrate. I am torn on where/how I should invest my energy.

So I sent one last snap (only snapped 3 times in a 24 hour span) asking if he was still interested and if he wasn’t that it was okay I just need to know. Am I crazy for doing that?

Totally fine, I knew it was the day after Christmas and I apologized if I had come off as inconsiderate by asking. He said it was totally fine, he would love to talk to me if he wasn’t busy. It gets pretty late so we send our good nights. 
Today he doesn’t say a thing to me until 4:30 p.m., and said he was out with family and took a nap afterwards. Also totally fine, but a little unusual compared to the past few days because he usually texts me earlier in the day/more frequently. Says he’s with family again. No problem. 
He didn’t respond to my last message until pretty late and said he’s tired, goodnight he’s going to bed, and didn’t mention a word about the phone call we were supposed to have?? but said we should meet soon. 

He keeps saying he likes talking to me, so maybe I’m just reading too much into it. I am overreacting by thinking he should’ve at least addressed the phone call? Is he just having a har time being direct so he’s letting me off easy? What do you guys think? Would you stop taking to this person?

I needed some heavy cream because I planned on making Alfredo sauce. I was standing at the grocery store in front of the big fridge with all the different types of cream and the cooking cream was all the way at the top. 

I’m 5’5, so not tall enough to reach the cream by myself. Next to me there was a very attractive woman who was probably 5’8. And on my other side there was an employee who was stacking shelves. 

 I turned to her, said hello and asked her if she could please reach up there and grab me the cream and there was a “moment”. She looked at me intently with her big green eyes and I gave her a big smile that said “yep, we both know I could’ve asked the dude next to me stacking the shelves but I asked you because I want to talk to you”. 

Not that she saw my smile because we were both wearing masks, but it’s crazy how much eyes convey vibes and feelings and we just had this moment where we looked each other in the eyes and we somehow understood each other. 

She knew I was interested and now it was up to her to either give me an indication she was interested as well or that she just wanted to be left alone and go on her way. 

Long story short we ended up chatting for five or 10 minutes, we exchanged phone numbers and agreed to hang out the following day.

The point of the story isn’t to tell you about me getting laid but to say that I’m comfortable with my height and I like being me and how I look. 
I’m confident and very comfortable in my own skin, and that plus having good social skills has allowed me to enjoy a good dating/sex life but also great friendships with women, whether those friendships had “benefits“ or were completely platonic.

I like to lurk on this sub and on the purple pill sub, mostly because I find it interesting and entertaining to read some of the wacky stuff certain people write, and something I’m seeing a lot of is dudes blaming their lack of success with women on their height, as if being short condemns men to inceldom. 

So I wanted to say that it’s just not true, and that there’s  plenty of shorter guys like me out there who aren’t necessarily rich or with model-tier good looks that are successful with women. 

If you’re confident and you feel good about yourself, women who aren’t shallow or superficial generally won’t care unless you’re an actual midget Who said he was 6 foot tall on his tinder profile.

Of course my game is on point. I work out, I have a good posture, good social skills, I’m very good at reading body language and nonverbal cues, I make sure I look and smell good every time I walk out of my door and I’m very comfortable talking to people in general. 

But the main thing is, height isn’t some thing that gets in the way of me being successful with women.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1141694,public,self,Had an awesome date with a tall girl,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rq8wwl/had_an_awesome_date_with_a_tall_girl/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,

I (18 M) have been getting to know a woman (19 soon to be 20.) Nothing serious yet, but we’ve gotten well acquainted since November. We’re semi long distance because she goes yo school two hours from me, but we decided something fun we could do “together” would be to watch a show in sync, an episode a day. She recommended an anime called “Devil Man Crybaby.” Literally within the first few seconds of the show, there are high school girls bending over and flashing their bare asses at the screen. It’s not established at all anywhere how old these characters are, but I’m assuming only 16 because that’s how old the protagonist is. I was mortified to see this. 

I asked her “how old are these characters?” out of concern, to which she responded “idk..16, 17?” Something I should have mentioned earlier is that she’s pansexual and comments on how how these characters are and talks about their anatomy and how much she likes it. When I tried to bring up that these characters are pretty young she just shrugged it off.

So my question is, am I vastly overthinking this? Or am I rightly concerned? I’m horrified that Netflix would green light a show like this in the first place, but I’m even more horrified at the idea that I may be getting involved with a bad person.
