He reply basically said that she’s in a really dark place right now and her feelings for me made her scared.

But on pandemic Ive dating people in and out, had a couple of ""gfs"" . At some point I didn't want to try to find someone else because I feel like its too much effort with little return.

So I just went into tinder global to see how I would do abroad. I matched with a girl from Russia. It was smooth and we just got along instantly. The next 3 months we spent videocalling (this involved ""sex"") talking and basically she treated me like her bf. Always talking to me 24/7... and this illusioned me so much because she has already been in my country before we started talking so she was planning on come back again.


At some point she mentioned she had bipolar and that she tends to isolate from everyone and feel bad. At some point, she went cold and stopped talking to me. It played on my insecurity and kept asking her if she was ok and if she still liked me but all she said was ""im depressed""

At some point she stopped talking to me all together. Didn't block me or anything. Then I tried talking to her and she just said ""I dont wanna talk to you"" but I was angry so I wrote ""I wish we could've met in real life"" and blocked her when she was replying back. After she saw I blocked her , she also blocked me.

Two months passed and I couldn't stand it anymore. I unblocked her but didn't talk to her at all. She also unblocked me soon after but didn't say a word either. 

Last time I was stalking her ig profile and find a story of someone else taking a pic of her, she was in mexico … my country is in south America.

I couldn't hold it and talked to her "" Hello, are you dating someone?"" - She inmediatly called me, said she was having a panic attack, she was in mexico and told me that she couldn't stand being away from her family. That she was going back to Russia next week. I told her I didn't stop thinking about her and she said that she was sorry, that she wa depressive and treated me bad, and I said I sorry for not understanding. She also said that she had a ticket for my country but her friends here advised her not to come because of political situation (which is true and impresses me that shes being honest about this)

Then we laughed, we had a good conversation, she said ""stay with me please until my friend comes to take me to the store"" and she clearly noted my reaction so she said ""don't be jealous, hes a nerd"" 

Then I went to sleep and next day I found her a message that said"" Hey I just wanted to tell you that im very glad to hear you again and im happy youre doing  great"" 

After that I asked how she was but she didn't respond. I tried the next day and she said ""sorry im on very busy mood"" … well yes, her flight was in a couple of days so that might be true..

Now she arrived to Russia, but she hasn't talk to me. I cant wait and I wanna talk to her but im guessing its out of my reach. I just cant stop overthinking and overanalyzing our last interaction, word by word, trying to see if there might be a clue about how she feels about me... Im going crazy please help me

But at the same time I want to move on. Because our relationship fucked me over. Because I wasn’t doing good when we first started dating. We met at the wrong time it hurts to see him hurting and him not doing well is affecting me. I just need to work on myself :( Me and him struggle with mental health issues. During the two years we dated I was in and out of mental hospitals. And that fucked him over. I wish he never met me :/ I’m no good for him. It’s hard to date when both of us are severely depressed. I just want to thrive. I wish I could make life worth living for him.

Sometimes, there will be a great conversation and personalities will gel, yet a spark of sexual tension fails to ignite, because the dynamic of the interaction skews more towards friendship.

A key component of ensuring that things progress in a manner that promotes a sexual tension and playfulness is touch.

This can be tricky, because if you are unsure of yourself, or become too eager and rushed, it will backfire and appear creepy or needy. You need to pay attention to how she is interacting with you, and the context of the situation.

For instance, if you immediately try to touch her hands as you sit down on your first date, it will appear desperate and unnatural. Or if she is displaying a low level of attraction or interest, it will likely repel her even further.

A good way to establish a natural, yet subtle touch is hugging when you initially greet each other. The initially hug is light anyway, never a full bear hug or embrace. If you place your hand LIGHTLY on the side of her hip or lower back as you hug, it will subtly reinforce that you are comfortable and confident being close to her without being a creep. Don’t make it a big deal.

As the night (nighttime dates are always better for first initial dates to establish a romantic dynamic) progresses, if you have good chemistry and have a playful vibe, continue with light hand touching. Authentically compliment her on her nails or jewelry, as you lightly put your hands under hers.

There a several other examples. If you are crossing the street, you can gently lead by placing your hand on her lower back. If things progress and the chemistry is there, hand holding, more intimate or playful hugging, and kissing. Paying attention to her body language and mannerisms are key. If she is maintaining eye contact, is talkative, or orienting her body in a manner to get closer, these are typical indicators that you are on the right path

The key is to be natural, light and subtle initially, and of course respectful. You also want her to feel comfortable and safe around you. If done correctly, along with a fun, flirtatious attitude, touch will help establish her perception of you as a potential romantic partner, not a buddy who is fun to talk to.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,870061,public,self,"Subtle, light, playful touch is crucial in building attraction and reinforcing the idea that you are more than a platonic friend",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ob1lo9/subtle_light_playful_touch_is_crucial_in_building/,all_ads,6,,

I've never had short dates - regardless of the time of evening we meet they always seem to last late into the night. The person I'm on a date with usually talks to me a lot and opens up and we often leave thinking there's a real bond, but they never last super long. My friends say it's because I'm easy to talk to and have a calm and non-judgemental aura.

Last night specifically, we met around 5 and I got home from the bar past midnight. I heard about so many of his life experiences and most traumatic events, family tree, regrets, hopes for the future, values. To say it got deep would be an understatement. 

Does this happen to anyone else? Do you take it as a good sign or a red flag? I like honesty and value openness and confidence so it's hard for me to read how appropriate it is.

Why do I feel so alone! I shouldn’t! I have such a loving family around me, I have a lot of friend who would drop everything if I called them, but I just can’t shake this feeling! It’s the worst!

Out of all my friend groups I’m literally the only single one left… everyone from my high school crew… married with kids. Everyone from college crew… married or engaged. Everyone one from my family friend crew… married and in LTR about to be engaged. Everywhere I go, if it’s not a boys night it’s all couples… and I can’t even complain because whether it was a boy or girl that married into the friend group I got along with them great and see them as family!

Dating is so hard… why?! I’m on the apps and I’ve made it known, please swipe of serious… I’m in my mid-30s now… why the text games? I would think females that I match with who are close to my age might be over games too…. So many dates/flings just fizzle out… I try to put myself out there, and never super aggressively… go with the flow, communicate, etc… my biggest question... when we're reaching our mid-30s, why are we running into people of similar age who still like playing games/ghosting etc.

I just want to feel that happiness again… that happiness you get from a simple “good morning 😊” text from a significant other… the happiness you get after the first kiss with someone you’re really connected and vibing with… the happiness you get when you’re being hugged…. I don’t even know when’s the last time I was just hugged, like really hugged!

It’s so dumb but the three happiest moments that have stuck out in my life…. When I was 18 and I asked my crush out to prom and the way her face lit up and how she hugged me…. I still rmbr that feeling of happiness i had. The second moment was when I had my first kiss with the first love of my life and best friend, where we then got into a 6 year relationship…. Third was, when my entire extended family came to my town for my brothers wedding, not even mine, but just having everyone there at the same time… was so happy… just wished I had that special someone with me too.

Am I ever going to feel that happiness again? The butterflies in my stomach when I find that one.

I have a great family, great extended family and awesome sets of friends… yet I feel so lonely.

I hate this feeling! Why do I feel like I’m always getting this feeling… if I find a girl I’m remotely interested in, I feel like I’m always the one initiating. Am I just not likable? I’ve always been very respectful, kind, positive and outgoing… give off good vibes... i know I'm not bad-looking by any means either.  just shit luck I guess!

Anytime I run into elders (grandparents or aunts/uncles) of my family they all say, out of all our grandchildren we are waiting for your wedding the most and have the best wishes in our heart for you! It brings tears to my eyes everytime I think of it!

I’ve been hurt so many time yet every date I’m like, nah, let’s go in to this positively… there’s at least one person out there for everyone… I’m starting to think that’s not true.

Recently its just been hard to even get out of bed, and when I do, I just go about my day with no excitement.. i work, eat, try and go for a walk all to pass the time so I can get back into bed.

I'm just waiting for the day where I can go on a walk around the neighborhood or town, just holding that specials someone's hand and just know everything will be alright... maybe ill be waiting for that feeling forever... who knows.

Man… I don’t even know anymore.

We just had a small talk there. We live in two different countries and the university is in a third one. Our lectures were all in distance learning for the whole year and being in first year, there wasn't much interaction between students.
 We started talking via text messages, like for a few days every 3-4 weeks and it mostly revolved around classed. After a few months, we talked more about personal stuff and I started to really like her since I felt we could be a good match. I was moving to the country where our university is and told her that I would love to take her to dinner or a drink when she arrived in the same city. She responded enthusiastically and we kept on texting as before, regularly but not daily but this time on varied topics. This continued for a few months, I started the conversations a little bit more often than her ( something like 60/40) and I probably showed a bit more attention than before. I was in the city of our university and she was supposed to move there in a few monthes
But recently, I brought back the topic of the dinner invitation and called it a date without much thought and she then told me she had a boyfriend.
I felt surprised, as I thought I made my intentions pretty clear, even though I never asked her directly if she was single, and she never mentioned him to me.
I complimented only once or twice and never mentioned my feelings towards her, I didn't want to be too invasive and it seemed absurd since we almost never saw each other in person yet ( but we were supposed to in the next monthes ).

It seems like every girl I start talking to or dating ends up ghosting me because there is always a guy they like better and it seems like I’m just the placeholder for a date or 2 until he arrives. And before I get the “work on myself and it’ll happen” comments, I have been doing that for years. I’m very driven with my career, I have been working out and dieting for a long time now (went from very frail and skinny to muscular), I’m very confident in my appearance and I like the way I look, and I put myself out there and socialize a lot. I know I’m not ugly either, I’m 6’3 and able to get hundreds of matches on dating apps and I often have girls approach me when I go out to bars/clubs. 

But even with all that I’m always the guy they fizzle out after a couple of dates. I’m starting to think with the rise of online dating and with how many guys compared to girls there are on those apps (considering men swipe on almost everything and are much less picky than women on there), I’m never going to be anyone’s #1 option, so I feel like this is always going to keep happening. I’ve also never been in a relationship or had sex, so obviously at 21 I’m really feeling the anxiety right now.

Like is the only solution to this, is to date someone I’m not attracted to so I can finally be someone’s #1 option? I’ve had mixed feelings about this bc some people say you can fall in love with someone’s personality and physical attraction can build over time, but I also hear that if you’re not physically attracted it will never happen. So I’m just unsure of what to do.

It’s just unfortunate because I’m dating a girl right now where everything seems great. We have so much in common and many of the same interests, and I’m very physically attracted to her, but I just fear that the same thing will happen with her.

I am of East Indian descent; however, I grew up in California. I have been told numerous times that I am a good-looking guy, and some people are even shocked to find that I have never had a girlfriend before. Throughout much of my adult life, I have been overlooked by girls. I have seen Indian guys score girls, yet I would be left with nothing and it often makes me think just ""What exactly is it about these guys that make them particularly appealing?"" ""What exactly do these guys have that I do not?"" I have a fair complexion for an Indian so I am quite often told that I do not ""look Indian"" but rather Hispanic or middle eastern, which irritates me. I am very insecure about my figure, as I believe that it is the sole reason that people have never respected me- I am 5'8"" with a slender build, which makes me look a lot younger than my actual age; I could very easily pass for 22. Many of these Indian guys may be taller than me-6'1"", however, they are not exactly the most refined of people- they are very callous and rude. Many times, where girls have expressed interest in me, there has always been some jealous male that has ruined it for me. I have tried using dating sites, such as Tinder, and much to my chagrin, I have never matched even once in the past two years that I have been using the app. For a while, I stopped caring by reassuring myself that I can live without a girlfriend, but unfortunately, I am reaching an age where I need to find someone. 

I ought to mention that I would prefer to date a girl outside of my ethnicity. I must profess that anytime I see a brown guy with a white girl, I become infuriated with jealousy because I often think that if that brown guy can score a white girl, why can't I? What exactly does that brown guy have that I don't? I wouldn't feel the same way if the guy were White, Yellow, or Black, but only Brown. 

One could contend that there may be something about myself that I could change, and I completely agree; however, one attribute about the physique that I have not been able to change is my height, and I know that women do care about that- they are lying if they tell you that it is not important. Consequently, I am strongly considering undergoing cosmetic limb lengthening surgery, which would essentially make me 5 inches taller, and put me at 6'1"", and not to mention people wouldn't bully me and women would be more likely to express interest in me. 

If I were a brown guy standing at 6'1"" and not 5'8"", I would be respected and not bullied as much as I have throughout my life. I am constantly told by women that I look like a little boy and not like a grown man simply because of my small build. 

It is my misfortune to have been dealt with a very bad genetic hand at birth; however, I do plan to redeem by making myself taller to improve the quality of my life and ultimately ensure my happiness.

I made the rookie mistake of falling for 1 chick, and I have a hard time focusing on other girls because she’s all I really think about now. 

To preface:
I’m in the military and In an area where there’s not a lot of women in general, so I feel women out here have inflated sense of egos from being hit on. She is also in the military, so that amplifies that (we’re both officers). 

I dm’d her on IG, just commenting on a story , she responded and I left it at that. Fast forward, and we meet at a house party. Pretended not to remember her (forgot her name honesty), she was Iike you remember me. We go out in a group that night, and I tell her I’m not sorry for DM’ing her because I thought she was attractive. She takes her friend home, and we leave it at that. 

We start snapping more, and she agrees to get tacos after work. But the day of she flakes because she gets off work and is tired and wants to go to bed. I try to reschedule for lunch at work, she says yes but she needs to work thru lunch and can’t come. 

I stop responding to all her continued thirst trap snaps, or send Random things back to her unrelated to her snaps. One day I comment on her IG story and ask her to do a 5k the next day, she agrees. Next day it starts pouring and she says she doesn’t wanna do it. 

She invites me to a concert, but stays at the beach too long with her friends so I go out somewhere else. I reschedule to get sushi the next day, she flakes before saying she needs to get a confirmation slide done. 

This weekend we meet up in a group sending at some bars. We flirt the whole night and dance/grind together. I go for the make out and she smiles/blushes and dodges it. The end of the night, the group is outside and she starts asking for random dudes for rides home because we were just talking and I guess she wanted to get home for her field op monday. Of course we’re like wtf, I go to get her back and she says “I’m not going home with you tonight” I talk to her alone and tell her that if she’s not interested in me I’ll leave her alone. I joke and say I know you’re not into brown dudes and she laughs. 

She then asks some other drunk dude who she rejected earlier for a ride and gets in. My whole group is like go get her. I stop the car and basically threatened the two dudes if they did anything to her, called one ugly and a POG lol. She says it’s okay and leaves. 

Next morning I apologize over text and she says “you’re good”. I say we should get coffee and she says another day because she’s busy packing. While she’s in the field her friend dies, I text her the next day if she’s doing okay and no response. 

She always views my stories and is one of the first ones to see them.

The kind that makes you question what’s wrong with you that you can’t close when you know they already think you’re attractive, have texted with you for a week, seen your Instagram, etc. 

It was the fifth dud in a row. 

I’ve had dozens of “successes” with dating apps over the years, plenty of FWB’s and (unfortunately) ONS’s. Lots of times I’ve felt a budding romance that could be special, only to get “you’re handsome and charming, but the spark isn’t there…” or “I’m looking for a certain kind of connection and I’m not feeling it with you.”

The worst part is knowing that I do have a vibrant personality because it’s all that got me through my ugly duckling phase in my teens. But maybe it isn’t a sexy personality, maybe it’s too quirky. I think this because I ended up becoming handsome by almost any standard and a good bit over six feet tall—yet I went on 6 dates last week and 5 of them made me hate myself after. I started to wonder how it’s possible that I used to succeed on 80-90% of my dates only to now suddenly flatline almost completely for weeks on end. 

I’m super depressed about my recent streak. Self-hatred is pouring in. My best friend, confidant and former wingman (who now lives 3000 miles away) told me last night that it’s obvious I need to be meeting friends of friends and going to house parties and whatever, but… I don’t have social friends anymore. They’re married or moved away. I’m not sure I believe in a dating world outside of apps. My worldview is fucked. Who doesn’t use apps these days?

As the title suggests i kind of need some advice for dating and even meeting people.

I have unfortunately found it hard to date and meet people at all in the past few years since i met a woman by pure chance in my teens, as such my confidence has been non existent in terms of social ability and self confidence.

I have found being on the spectrum and dating really hard, especially on dating apps, as sadly people i have met see ""autism"" and nope out of there, however i have tried speaking to few people who didnt mind the autism but i found conversations went stale rather quick.

I struggle with socialisation due to ostracism as a child to young adult meaning i had no chance to develop socially, but on top of that reading body language and understanding tone is hard, i saw a post about approaching women, but sometimes i find it hard to as i feel i may come across as creepy, especially since its hard to pick up body language.

Does anyone have any advice or experience they can share which can help me take a right turn.

Dating is hard in the beginning anyway but when you are dating within specifications I feel the process becomes 2X harder. The Christian Dating apps I've used are generally sketchy. I can't accurately pinpoint the percentage of how many Men who say they are Christian for the sake of getting those ""types of women"" 

I will join a site, get some really odd messages and I leave the sites usually within a week.

My question is would it be better for me to take more of a direct approach to asking them out, or should I try to get to know them first? The reason why I ask is that while I could just rip the proverbial bandaid off, strike up a conversation, and ask them out, I’m not sure if this will put them off since I’ve never really had a conversation with them before. Yes, I’ve heard a lot of people talking about “cold approaches” and talking to people in public, but something about that has always seemed odd to me, I feel it would be a bit weird to be asked out by someone you didn’t even know existed beforehand.

Recently me and my friends met some tourist girls in the beach, we made really good company and proceeded later that night with couple of drinks and we walked around the city until 4am. The girls was very cultivated and smart people with humor. Honestly it was the best company I had for a year or more. I really loved their vibes and I have on my mind only one girl. We had some great conversations and shared ideas, goals and we all exchanged instagram's. The problem is she lives in France while I live in south Europe. They are travel addicts and I like travelling as well (my friends aren't). So I want to visit France (for her) and when I go there, you think I should let her know that I am in France or she could see an instagram post.. and maybe she could show me around, hang out together etc. that would be natural or weird? I know I could replace her by getting to know other girls but I loved this vibe and I don't want to erase it by forgetting her and moving forward.  I am the type of person that can travel hundred of miles if I value the other person huh..

For context,
He (M22) is the oldest child in his family, 3 siblings and a single mother. He’s basically the financial supporter of the home. I said I couldn’t go on vacation w them bc I spent too much money this month (I do what I can to help my family financially too). My family grew up very poor and it took them a long time for them to be financially stable like they are now. His family had wealth and went homeless and are working their way up again this time he is the main one providing, so he says. I understand what it’s like to be poor and I tried to console by sharing our story. We ended up arguing bc he assumed I was trying to one up him. That I always want to be better or have something better to say.

Tbh I wouldn’t brag about being poor and then say I have x amount of money now. I also wouldn’t share the things my family had to go through just to anyone. Some of those things are just hard to share with just anybody. 

Anyways the whole point of me saying all that was to demonstrate how much time it took them to be able to have what we currently do. (My parents are in their late 50s btw)

He always makes me sound privileged. I hate being seen that way bc there was times I had nothing too and I work hard for what I have. 

I don’t know I feel like all the weird animosity he thinks he sense from me is really his inner thoughts about me. There’s a lot of other things he said and I wish I could put screenshots for better context. 

Also when I said it took my parents x amount of years to even make x amount of money he said “I’m not trying to be your parents I wanna be better than them” I understood his feelings but did feel disrespected about everything he was saying  and how he reacted.
