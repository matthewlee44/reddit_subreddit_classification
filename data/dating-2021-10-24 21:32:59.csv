4,qf7eh8,1635130233,Does replying “hahaha” mean you’re not interested?,"Forgive me if this question or topic is like beating a dead horse on here, I’m new to this sub and recently re-entered the online dating world. 

I’ve (29F) been single for about 4 years now and hate using dating apps so I just stayed single after my last bf (plus you know what has made socializing very difficult the last 2 years). As a result of being single so long (I’ve had past relationships but never anything long term) I tend to be closed off and stubborn about dating, so I’d love some feedback from people who are more experienced in the online dating world.

I started talking to a guy on bumble and it’s fine, obviously nothing wild as we only just started chatting. I spoke about my weekend and of course asked about his, and then I was met with the dreaded “hahaha” in response to something I said (something about how accident prone I am when talking about hiking). He’s been quick to respond to my messages and generally pleasant, so this reply (if you can even consider it that), kind of surprised me!

So my question to you all…is this response code for “please stop talking to me now”. Or does the guy just not know what to say? I have a habit of being overly critical, as my initial reaction was “oh ok guess that’s that”, but I also know some people just have trouble finding what to say next.

I’m by no means invested in this person specifically, before anyone judges me, but I just want to know whether you consider this reply a universal sign for “I’m over it”, or is this a case of me being overly critical? I obviously don’t have any intention of being desperate by continuing to talk to someone not interested in me, but I also don’t want to prematurely give up on every guy who isn’t “chasing” me.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qf7eh8/does_replying_hahaha_mean_youre_not_interested/

10,qf7wjd,1635132032,"I looked at him in the eyes and I felt like I could see the future, our future.","I began dating this guy a few weeks ago. We met through friends, and it was undeniable from the beginning that he had taken a deep interest in me. So far, we’ve seen each other in group settings, and it's been nice. There is chemistry, and we have a lot in common.

Here is where all my self-created troubles begin. I acknowledge that I am incredibly insecure and fear the unknown, even though I am constantly trying to change that and better myself. I had not met a guy with whom I could see a future in the past few years. Either the guys I liked were not interested in me, or the ones that did like me I ended up not liking. 

Here comes the guy I met a few weeks ago; physically, I see that I can get past my prejudices; I enjoy him. He’s a genuine guy with great intentions and incredibly well-mannered. However, yesterday while we were at a music festival, I experienced all of my fears in real flesh — a.k.a icks regarding him. Yesterday was a combination of things that annoyed me. I will attribute that some of these icks are mine to blame; however, there were things he did that I found unacceptable. Simply not to my taste, not who I am — turn-offs. 

However, at some point during the night, I decided to communicate what I was feeling, and as we were having a fair discussion about it, I noticed that while he spoke sense into me, all I could do was stare into his eyes in the most profound most strange way. I had never felt this before. As I looked him in the eyes and  I saw the future, I saw our future. I had this moment of clarity where I saw my future feelings, my feelings for him in the near future, and those were feelings of love. The ones you get when you are deeply in love, you see the person with loving eyes and not with critical ones. It amazed me that even at that moment, I was relieved from the terrible energy I had.  

I now know those feelings and emotions of ickness were fleeting. I just needed to allow myself to go through them and be open to giving us a fair chance. Still, it’s early to know about what will take place, but I think that now I am open to seeing him with different eyes—Gotta flow.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qf7wjd/i_looked_at_him_in_the_eyes_and_i_felt_like_i/

Since I have met her, I never had much problem being friends with her for the first 4 years, but when she broke off with her first ex, I started liking her a lot. At some point she tried to make a move on me but back then I was too much of a wuss to ask her out and she moved on to dating and banging bunch of guys. I was hurt and I moved on, but she broke up with her second ex and she came back to me telling me a lot of stories and started wanting to hangout with me a lot. However, this time she went back to to her second ex. Past few weeks I have been not feeling well, dealing with dark emotions and I just told her that I wanted to not talk to her for awhile. I did not tell her but I felt that she was just emotionally draining me and emotionally manipulating me. It's been 5 days but I broke my own vow and called her because I felt so sad. She texted me that I was the one to tell her I did not want to talk to her for awhile. I just brushed it off by texting thanks for not picking up my call and kept it that way.  


I just am feeling so unsure about myself. since about 3 months ago, I was sick of myself not having anyone, I started to make improvements in my life. I have been working out a whole lot more than maybe I should be, lost much body fat and gained muscle to look nicer, and have been going out to social groups to see people. However I just can't seem to shake the feeling to talk to her because I feel that I miss her too much. Am I doing the right thing? I should not see or talk to my friend (28F) right? I just feel like the relationship between her and I were toxic because I only support and not getting anything back where as she just gets all she wants.

I realized that I haven't been the best at giving her space to tell me what she wants and being sure she feels heard, so I told her that our date day will be totally up to her and we'll go wherever she wants (with absolutely zero pushback and the ability to change plans at any time).

We went for sushi (I knew it was her favorite food, but today I learned that she greatly over-estimates her spice-handling ability), watched a Hallmark Christmas movie, complete with hot chocolate (""I hate watch these because I know they're predictable and cheesy but they give me a little bit of Christmas when I watch them randomly through the year, and it cheers me up"" - my date), thrift store shopping, and to a brewery she's been wanting to go to, but hasn't made time for, even though she's been craving one of their sours for weeks. 

Today was the best date I've had in a long time because I stopped waiting and wishing to be with someone else to go out/do things with, and instead decided to take myself out. I sat alone in a sushi restaurant and I swear my mouth is blistered from the spicy roll I ordered, watched a cheesy Hallmark Christmas movie with hot chocolate, got some neat stuff from local thrift stores, and found a new sour from a brewery I love because they didn't have my old favorite. 

Today reminded me that I don't need a partner to go out and do fun things, and \*\*neither do you!\*\* You are your own whole, with or without someone else. You can take yourself out to new places, old places, weird places, wherever, and I promise you it'll be more fun than it initially sounds. Dating is hard enough without the added pressure of feeling like you can't go out/try things/be 100% happy without having someone else there with you.  

I thought someone else on the sub might benefit from the idea of taking a day to focus on themselves, especially as we start moving into the holiday season and all of the ""couple things"" to do will be everywhere.

The first guy is this guy that I sat next to in my physics class. We ended up making conversations and jokes a few times. He was attractive so I developed a little crush on him.

The second guy, I met at a party. I was sitting on a couch at the party and this guy sat down next to me. He looked out of air so I asked if he was alright, and he said he was, asked my name, and we ended up talking. He talked for most of it and asked for my social media. We were also sitting kind of close and rubbing shoulders/legs together but I guess it didn’t mean anything much. Afterwards, I looked him up on Facebook (that I didn’t have him added), and his cover picture is of him with another girl and the comments are calling them a couple, so I’m pretty sure he has a girlfriend already… I guess he just talked to me because he found me interesting, but I was kind of let down, and I don’t think I’ll message him again on social media because it looks kind of sketchy.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qf89fp/two_weird_encounters_of_crushing_on_guys_that_end/
16,qf8a3h,1635133425,Struggling with my desire for a relationship but then also sleeping around.,"This will slightly be all over the place i'm sorry in advanced

I'm 24F and i've been single for the last 5 years by choice. I was cheated on but honestly didn't effect me that much and don't have much hard feelings for the guy, he was kinda obsessive and over protective though. But i'm at a point in my life where I want a relationship but i'm pretty aromantic and sill have so much I want to experience. I'm introverted but I also have a personality that everyone likes and i'm usually described as the kindest and most loyal and genuine person they know, and because of that I have the knack for getting guys attracted to me. I want to hook up with people and be causal and sleep around on apps but I know that I have the personality that the guy might catch feels, it has happened way to often and then I ghost (which i'm terrible for)

I also want experiences of meeting people in person, but covid hasn’t really helped that situation....though that could be an excuse. I always have an excuse, when I was in college it was *I gotta focus on my grades and projects* and then after it was *I gotta focus on getting my career started* but now i'm in a position where my job situation is good and i'm happy and my financial situation is also great. My mom is always nagging me that I need a boyfriend and I should get serious with that but i'm always making excuses. My excuse right now is i'm not super happy with my body (5'5 at 145 pounds). I'm actively working out and going to the gym to work on that because I notice when I feel good about myself I almost develop a...god complex maybe? I just dress better and I leave my apartment more, even just walking around the city doing errands I will be shocked at how many guys flirt with me and cat call me and it makes me feel amazing. Then I get into the phase where I want to hook up with as many guys as I can because I think this body deserves to be shared and I want to feel validation. Its funny I hate myself and have major body dysmorphia but keep having situations that enforce that i'm attractive but my brain doesn't let me think that and i'm scared every guy will be disappointed when I get naked.

But once i'm at that phase I don't know where to go. Sadly my small group of friends here are all in relationships and some are even getting married and generally are older than me. So I don't have any friends to go to bars or clubs or live shows with and I don't know how to go on my own since i'm shy. I can drink get get super bubbly with people but i'm still nervous. I love the feeling of going to these places and being hit on but I feel like its been such a long time that I forget how to act. I wanna meet guys on apps but I also find my self swiping on people I find attractive because i'm scared (because I don't know how to act, and also scared they will wanna date me seriously). I also have certain guys i'm into, I hate basic dudes so it's hard to find the right place to find the right guys. I'll be honest I haven't had sex or kissed anyone in like 2 years and i'm so scared that I have completely forgotten everything I have reversed back into being a virgin (lol). And yet there are lots kinky things I wanna try ~~some are kinda messed up and intense but still and I don't know how to safely find people.~~ I know there are too many things I want to explore before getting into a serious relationship since i've been cheated on and i know how that feels. I want to get everything out of my system before I commit, but I keep pushing off my exploration and don't know how to start.

I met this guy off a dating app a few weeks ago for a first date. I thought he was attractive in his own way, I was very nervous during our meeting. During this date, in the middle of it he flat out actually said he liked me and he wanted to see me again. So I said what about we do x together, he was agreeable. He mentioned he couldn’t do next next weekend bc he was on vacation. It was originally planned for the following weekend after we met but I ended up getting horribly sick so I had to cancel it. So we had to reschedule it for 3 weeks out basically.

I was super bummed out and texted him in between how he’s doing had asked if he was going anywhere for his vacation - he actually told me no he’s just staying home and resting. 

I really can’t tell if he’s interested bc if I had a free weekend like him or just resting I’d totally be down with meeting… 

He did text me every single day on the days he was resting at home. Some of them content were super detailed too like what he tried to cook…like if he’s not interested why would you text this kind of things?

21,qf8q8n,1635135126,Is it ethical to go to a foreign country for the sole purpose of dating?,"That is something that I have recently seen quite a bit on the internet. Some people get obsess with a country or region and some find people from a certain country or region particularly attractive.

I have particularly seen this with weebs/otakus (mainly young men) that want a Japanese girlfriend. And with young women that go down the rabbit hole of K-pop and K-dramas.

While dose are the main ones that I have seen, I have also heard of people that are super into the stereotypical American cowgirl or into Russians, Australians, Spaniards, French etc.

I think that there's nothing wrong with finding people with a certain accent attractive, Or that you tend to be more into certain races or people from some countries/regions. As in not everyone from a country but, from the people that you find attractive a good portion of them have certain physical traits, basically having a ""type"".

I have heard of people saying that they find all Asian women attractive, really, all of them. This guy said that to an Asian girl and obviously she wasn't flattered, because that sentence implies that he finds her attractive only because of her race and not by who she is. 

This has also cultivated a plethora of videos and articles on the internet about ""dating \*insert country or region\* \*Women/Men\*"". While I find that there are general things to know about the dating culture of another country and understanding the general culture of the place, I find a little bit insulting to mush every woman/Man of a country (typically millions of them) and say what they like or not, or what they find attractive, etc. While there are certain similarities because of the culture, it's asinine to think that everyone in that country thinks the same.

29,qf99s5,1635137331,First date vs. text from my ex,"So I went on a date today. Met the dude on Hinge, everything went well. We had coffee for 2 hours and the conversation was great the whole time. There are a few things he mentioned about himself that I'm slightly hesitant about, but for the most part it was good. He texted me afterwards and we will likely go on another date. Something about it felt slightly off.

A couple hours later I get a text from my sorta kinda ex. The short version of our story is we worked together, then I left the company, then he asked me out, then it went amazingly well, then I moved away very soon after, then we continued a texting relationship, then that died off and now we text each other maybe once every 3 months. But today we talked for the entire afternoon and evening. It finally felt like we were so much more open with each other about the way we are feeling. He and I just have this incredibly undeniable chemistry that pulls us to each other. It's been almost 2 years since we've seen each other in person and we still want to be together so bad. Like not just in a physical way (but damn that's there too) but in every way. Unfortunately, jobs and money get in the way. He's also now in another relationship but its open. Which makes it all feel even more hopeless because I'm pretty monogamous. Since we never really had a real dating relationship and never really broke up the feelings are all still hanging there.

I guess my question is would writing the first guy off because I still have such a strong emotional relationship with my sorta ex be dumb? I want to be over him so bad but I just feel like I'm never going to meet anyone I feel such strong harmonious chemistry with. Maybe I just need more time with the other guy.

About a few weeks ago I was on tinder (shoutout to Tinder for making this possible!) and found this girl who goes to school in the same city as me. She’s gorgeous, and had a pretty clever bio and left her Instagram there. So I requested to follow her, and I sent a message to her just saying something along the lines of “hey just wanted to say hi, I saw you on tinder and just wanted to say you’re gorgeous and I’d love the chance to get to know you”. Shortly after she accepts the follow request but there’s no response to the message. I wait a few days and she puts something on her Instagram story that I found was cool, and I sent a nice polite message in response to her story, and once again no response from her. 

Within the last week, I was pretty stressed out with school and other stuff happening around me. I think it all got to my head, and I foolishly messaged her best friend asking for advice, which she said she’d give. I’m not blaming her at all for this, but her friend backtracked and didn’t message me back. I sent a few more messages to both and was ignored yet again. At this point, I was slowly realizing that I had dug myself to big of a hole. This really sucks, and I know you’re probably thinking that I’m a huge weirdo and loser for doing all of this but I had to get it off my chest. Nobody around me rlly understands and deep down, it does feel like a little heartbreak because my confidence that I gathered over the past year and half is absolutely shot, and idk where to go from here. 

This wasn’t made to expose this girl either btw, I’m sure she’s an amazing person and that’s what made me so interesting. Even without knowing much about her, there was a little part of me that was rlly hoping that this would’ve been the perfect time. What should I do now? I still want to be kind to her and I definitely hope she does message back at this point but I’d appreciate your advice or feedback.

We had really good time together, but we never were “sexually” mind blown. It’s her first relationship and she’s taking it slow, while it’s not for me and I would have wanted more “spark”. 

We click really well, became good friends, talk for hours every day, but I might be starting to fall out of love. I just can’t trust - even though she hasn’t done anything bad.

Before her, I could trust girls and had no problems doing so, but her - I can’t. She’s the most trustworthy girlfriend I’ve had. 

The lack of trust is starting to get to me. Every time she goes out I’m worried. I don’t know what to do, since this issue is affecting my feelings towards her. I don’t want to break up cause we both talked and see a future together, but might be the only option for me to stay sane.

I think this has skewed my outlook on relationships a little bit. 

I was dating someone for a a couple months then I ended it. Then we tried a second time and I ended it again. I was focusing on what he was doing wrong, but not looking at what I could have done better.

Well he reached out for a third time. At first I wasn’t going to give him the time of day, but we got along really well and I couldn’t ignore that. I was thinking I would even enjoy having him as a friend. But he was vulnerable and said he would do what it took to really date each other this time. I asked him is there anything I did to prevent him from being “all in” the previous times we dated. He said I could be emotionless and intimating, etc. I did some self reflection and I realized that I actually do this with men I really respect. I think I test them to see if we can take things to the next step. I don’t mean to I think it is a defense mechanism I learned from past relationships.

I’ve came to a realization recently that I tried denying my whole life. Until about 21, I was so worried about rejection in every facet of my life, you can imagine how that was with dating too. I think when you have a highly competitive field of study and everything is always expected of you, this is kind of common. When it came to dating, I didn’t want to put myself out there. I had confidence in my academic talents but hell, a human woman who’s ideas on me would be subjective and not objective... it was a terrifying thought that I didn’t confront. Wow, don’t I sound crazy, or maybe I sound incredibly relatable, who knows, lol. 

So over the past 2 years, even during covid times, I forced myself to put myself out there more and more. I learned that I could be great at flirting, that women actually did find my success attractive, and that I deserved more than I thought I did. It was wild. The only problem is that I’m still not afraid of being headstrong in a relationship instead of laying back and playing it cool, but that makes me, well, me and I don’t think I’d change who I am to try to come off as someone I’m not. But through all of this, you know what the overarching point was? The point that played in my head over and over and that has made me feel so comfortable with every woman I’ve met on here? “The worst thing they can say is no.” My dad first said that to me when, shit, I think I was in junior high. I didn’t believe him until I got rejected for the second time. It was like “this isn’t horrible... why worry about what could happen before you even stick your foot out there?” Now I just be 99.9% of myself and if they like it, great, if not it’s just not meant to be. I don’t know how many younger guys need to hear this but it’s so true. Also, I’m completely average looking.

I live with roommates but I come over to his house on my off days to spend time with him even when he’s at work. I feel bad when I’m at his house and not doing much and even tho I’m considered a guest I still do things for him like laundry and keeping the place tidy so he doesn’t have to. 

I was cleaning the other day and spotted a notebook that had a lot of writing in it. I flipped through it fast just to but when I saw pages of writing I started to read some things l didn’t particularly mean to read.
My boyfriend calls me Pretty Bird. I always thought it was a cute nickname that he must’ve randomly thought to call me. Every time he called me that I’d get butterflies, it made me feel so good and loved. 

One is the pages I saw in the notebook was made out to Pretty Bird, I read it and immediately cried happy tears. What he said was sweet, I couldn’t believe he actually wrote about me in secret. I read it over and over I was that obsessed. But then I come across another page that was placed inside the notebook, he didn’t write it.. it was a female’s handwriting. It was a nice, sweet note a woman had wrote to him and that wasn’t the worst thing to me. I mean of course it made me sad he kept a lovey dovey sappy note from another woman but that’s not why I’m typing this right now. She signed the note as Love, Pretty Bird. 

When I saw that it broke my heart. Not even the fact that he used to call someone else that but carried that nickname on to me. Then I realized the note I thought he wrote for me wasn’t even about me, it was for her. I did bring it up to him and she’s someone from his past that he was friends with and helped him through a very hard time in his life. He said they were never anything more than that cause she moved away. This is still fresh in my mind considering it happened the other day. We talked it out but I’m still sad whenever I think about it. I felt like an idiot thinking that cute note was for me and I had gotten all giddy inside. 

I felt insanely bad for reading his thoughts and I told him that, he didn’t mind. He’s very open and honest with me, if I have questions he will answer. And he was very open about all of this which did make me feel better but I’m still a woman with feelings who keeps thinking about it. I’m not trying to ruin the best thing I ever had.

So I (23M) have never done something like this before. My first relationship just naturally grew from a friendship so i never really experienced asking a girl out before.

So theres a girl (18F) I have an interest in at a small restaurant where i work and we've interacted a bit.

I've asked the business owners for permission as to whether I could do i before/during/after their business hours and they told me to do it during off-peak hours such as after lunch. They even told me that they will let her know for me that i have something to ask her (which is real nice of them). It seems that they are supportive of it so i don't have a worry about that.

Anyways, I have never asked a girl out who've i had limited interactions with. What the hell do i do?

I've been planning a lot of scenarios in my head, thinking about what to say, what to do, how to dress, what to bring etc. The only thing i know is how to handle the rejection. I absolutely have no idea at all.

So this is crystal clear she did not want to come along and chat with me and quickly thought a way out to avoid me for any reasons which is valid and no hard feelings.

I noticed she gave me a full scan a few times and I knew what was going on.
Well, that was literally it, how it started, I happened to bump into this situation, talked to her, hooked up and this turned into a second, third, fourth time and so on. 

The result? Now we're in a relationship. I know so many people say is cliché to say to just be the better version of yourself everyday and eventually something will come, well it's true even if it's cliché.
I haven't had sex or any hookup in TWO YEARS up until that point, I gave up on seeking relationships and focused on my own well being after getting destroyed dedicating myself to toxic relationships that ended up nowhere.

By pure accident I found someone with a reality really close to mine in terms of mental health (empathy on this sector is a big point for me), almost identical personality, likes a lot of stuff that I like and even if she doesn't, she understands why I like it and incetivizes me, and of course I feel relaxed to do the same knowing it comes both ways. Compromising is not a problem, communication is not a problem, it's a sincere, kind, loving and empathic relationship and I for once in my 22 years of age feel completely safe on a relationship, after 5 of them.

I feel like a dumbass for not focusing on my issues and trying to be the better version of myself for so long, but now, I'm never going back to the cycle of trying to fulfill my emptiness with ""loving someone"".

If there's anything I would like to say to anyone out there is: Work on yourself, your life, your goals, be at places you want to be and eventually someone that share the same values and goals will come along and hopefully it works, it's hard, after all we only find so many people we love that can actually work on a relationship level, but on some rare ocasions, it works and it feels like fireworks.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qfd17h/sometimes_not_actively_seeking_someone_out_there/

Here's why this is a problem: It's hard enough for me to find people I deem interesting who are also interested in me. Dates aren't easy to come by, and I don't really want to just quit on something so early

https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qf4593/why_do_girls_i_ask_out_treat_me_bad_after_they/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

Many comments say that she felt used because he only saw her as a potential partner and once she wasn't available, he dropped her. This may be true in some situations but I, when I see a girl, I don't immediately see a potential partner. However most of the time I start being friends with a girl, I develop a crush. And even though I didn't see her as a potential girlfriend, I now want her. 

So my question is, how are you supposed to show your intentions when they aren't there at the start? How should I prevent the girl feeling used when I no longer want to be friends with her?

94,qffrrg,1635165435,"In any irl conversation you know when it ends, but when your texting...","When texting, vast majority of people think it's ok to just put down your phone in the middle of conversation and replay a day after like nothing or not at all if they're bored.

Every girl that was able to just end the convo with simple ""gotta go 4 now bye"" or ""till later"" or just whatever... I really loved the texting with them. It was simple, easy and transparent.

Imagine irl you talk to someone on the street, or in restaurant you ask a question or say something and the person just turns away and leaves.

Sure, texting and conversation aren't the same thing and you can't be intrusive or clingy. No one owes anyone explaining themselves, but when your talking your talking - it's nice to just say when you are finishing the ongoing conversation. I do it always and expect it in return.

Texting and social media normalized lots of unpleasent beahviours.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qffrrg/in_any_irl_conversation_you_know_when_it_ends_but/

96,qfg3r2,1635166524,I’m a dude and I hate hookups,"I’m a freshman at college and I got out of a 1+ year relationship a couple of months ago. Since I’ve been at school I’ve been meeting girls and hooking up with a few of them. All the dudes I know love having sex with random hot girls and they congratulate me and hype me up when I tell them. Thing is, I hate it. It makes me feel so shitty afterwards and during. It’s not fulfilling whatsoever. I lost my virginity to the girl I was dating up until a couple months ago so I never had any experience before. I thought I was crazy at first because what dude doesn’t love meaningless sex right? The thought of having sex with people I just met disgusts me. I feel like a chick saying this, but to me sex is way more of an intimate thing. I only wanna be fucking a girl that I’m really in love with. Are there any other dudes that feel the same or am I alone.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qfg3r2/im_a_dude_and_i_hate_hookups/

I totally get it though, a foot (or more) difference in height is too dang much.  I will never understand strict “height requirements” for dating, but a comfortable range is totally fine.  I know what height range I’m most comfortable with, but I’ve never let height stop me from dating anyone I just make sure a guy is good with my height and leave it at that.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qfg8pa/for_the_short_kings/
99,qfg92f,1635166964,Is something wrong w/ me?,"Hello everyone, I am a 25 years old guy from the Philippines. I have been single for 2 years now and I don't even know why no one takes me seriously. Like I have dated a girl and two guys, but they ended up dumping me for unknown reasons and because of that, I'm now afraid to enter another relationship with a fellow filipino, I'm not even a toxic partner, I don't control them etc. I'm very open - minded and I rarely get angry. 

I always wonder what it's like to date people from other countries. 

If you are a guy looking for a guy partner, boyfriend etc. Hit me up lol. Doesn't matter where you are right now, if it works, we'll find a way to be together lol.
