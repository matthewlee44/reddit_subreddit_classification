I completely understand a guy should approach a girl first. We’ve made eye contact before and I’ve understood she finds me attractive. I plan on going back tomorrow to see if she’s working and make a move. I’m going to get a drink in her section, and say, “hey I see you here every week and wanted to introduce myself.” Then have a conversation and see what’s up. Any tips? Should I wait until next week? Should I give her my number or ask for hers?

1,p3drvx,1628819025,"Have this feeling I'm being catfished, would like some second opinions","I posted on r/r4r on my main account last week, just said I was moving to a new state for school and would like to meet some people from around there. Someone reached out to me, said she's studying something similar to me at another school in the area and would like to get to know me and maybe show me around once I'm there

So we talk for a bit first on reddit, then exchange numbers and text each other. It's all perfectly normal stuff - what we're studying, plans for after school, interests, etc. At one point we trade pics and I was surprised because she was more attractive than I was expecting. They're all clearly pics from social media (as opposed to a selfie), but I try not to think too much of it

So we keep talking over the next several days. Again, it's all normal ""getting to know you"" stuff, nothing that raises any concerns. We talk more about meeting up and we trade more pics, except now they're selfies someone took in the moment (including a pic where she's mocking a face I'm making), not just something someone got from social media. Throw in the fact that her area code matches up to where she claims to be from, and the fact that her reddit account is legit (post history, comments that match up to things she's mentioned to me), and I'm starting to accept that she might actually be real

But I'm not totally relaxed. I mentioned to her last weekend that I'd love to call/video chat sometime to break the ice, and she said we definitely should. I brought it up again on Tuesday and she said we could video call on Thursday (today); I asked last night if she was still on for our video call, and she told me that she can't anymore because she'd just found out she's going to a baseball game for her favorite team and forgot to tell me. I tell her no problem, let's find another time, she thanks me for not getting upset at her ""like other guys"" and promises to send pics from the game. Cool. We keep texting for a couple more hours, then say good night and we'll talk again tomorrow (meaning today)

Texted her early this afternoon, just said ""Hope you enjoy the game"", but never heard back from her, which is strange, because she's usually pretty good about replying. Obviously never got any pics from her at the game either. I figured she just might not be paying attention to her phone if she's at the game with friends, but I just never heard from her again

This is what's getting me. All of our interactions have been genuine, but her flakiness towards calling/video chat is raising a couple of red flags (the fact that she apparently doesn't have social media doesn't help either), and the radio silence today is only adding to it. To be honest, I don't think this is anything malicious if it is catfishing, i.e. I think it's a real person, and everything they're saying about themselves is true, but they're using someone else's pics

I haven't been catfished before - it's usually extremely obvious - unless you want to count girls who use old pics of themselves when they clearly don't look like that anymore and make it awkward when they show up to the date. I'd like for this person to be real, but if she isn't, I'm not going to lose any sleep over it. It's just that something feels a little off, you know?

Alternatively, she could just be ""testing"" me, or something. I only bring that up because she's mentioned guys getting upset at her in the past and said she was ""impressed"" by how I ""handled her"" when she told me she had to cancel our video call and that she appreciated it, but who knows

3,p3dzeb,1628819829,"I've been single all my life and there's a lot of reasons why, any solutions?"," Let me clarify a few things.

1. Im in my 22 from Sweden and im not ugly, i'm like a 7 according to the internet and friends.
2. I am very social, and I have a life.

Ok now that the important stuff it's clarified, let's move on.

* I've tried approaching girls in the city, but it's not like I go out there every day and spot attractive girls. And even if I did, 50% of the time, they are either taken or just not available. So it's like a coin flip.
* I've tried Tinder and other dating apps, all shit, had a date or 2, but it's all superficial. The only way you can stand out is by being a 10 or very funny. Fuck that im no clown
* My friends have no female friends that I'm attracted to.
* I am studying online, so no school relationships, and most of the time I'm cooped up in my room working on my personal projects.
* I'm very picky, but it's not my fault, I got severe ADD, so I'm easily bored. If a person isn't interesting enough, I'm unable to keep my interest and lose all attraction, unable to get to know them further and build any further connection.
* I'm also very different from the ‘’typical guy’’, i don't care about **physical contact,** nor romance. I think it has to do with my ADD and my emotional intelligence, it's too logical. 
* Flirting is like a game, it's easy but it's not genuine when I do it, so I feel like I'm lying or manipulating girls. So I don't flirt, I feel too guilty doing it, for my flirting isn't genuine.

So what's the solution? I'm open for pretty much any suggestions you might have. I'm tired of being single, in no way am I lonely but man. Who doesn't want a relationship, you know?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p3dzeb/ive_been_single_all_my_life_and_theres_a_lot_of/

I'm attracted to a very specific type of person, and I'm always careful who I connect with as I try not to sleep with people who easily give away their bodies. The two of us had an incredible amount of extremely rare shared interests/views and the dates, conversations and sex were some of the most intense experiences i've ever had. In terms of laying the foundation for a true connection I really did everything perfectly, and it was apparent in her mannerisms. Im 28 and she was 20.

Today after a full day of outdoor activities, and staying up until 5 am ""making love"", she admits to me she has just started meeting older men and making $250-$350 for sex, and asks my opinion on it. Her first time doing it was the day before we had sex for the first time, and her second time was tonight after leaving our 24 hour hangout. Internally my heart dropped, but outwardly I didn't offer too much or show any emotion. I mainly just said ""You're gonna do you"" with a slight smirk, went for a swim in the ocean and then came back and called her a taxi.

$300 is such a meager sum, but I would never tell her that. I have a pretty significant net worth through investing in crypto 5 years ago.

If it were anyone else id have definitely moved on but I know this girl really well, and before we went long distance, it was very overwhelmingly apparent that she genuinely liked me alot. 

But now I'm sensing that she's getting cold because of the way she has been responding. I don't expect a daily text or weekly call or anything, but every once in a while I also enjoy a little reassurance which I've never recieved from her since we've been LD. I have been very patient, understanding and supportive of her through out alot and never asked for anything in return except for her honesty, but now because of what she's been like I feel like I'm losing interest too. I still love her because we've been friends long before we were dating but as a girlfriend it just feels like she either doesn't know how to communicate or she hardly cares about me anymore. 

I tried to talk to her about it but she often passes it off as a result of her difficult situation at home rn due to her state being extremely covid infected.

Me siento como Prometeus solo que envez del hígado es el corazón, el dolor es continuo sin poder habituarse a el, sin poder viciarae de el un dolor único que no te se desprende acie do que el vacío aumente, dejandome cada vez más sin sentimiento, dejando solo el dolor.

27,p3gbo1,1628828975,[serious] How/Where can you meet girls that are attracted to Shy guys,"So this post is for me and the people that might be asking the same question

In our age of covid, opportunities to meet people IRL have lowered and dating APPS are overflowing with all kinds of personalities. I find it hard to believe that shy guys are having an easy time in the dating world (well its hard for everyone but shy guys seems to have it a bit harder.).

Since shy guys are usually introverted we tend to keep to ourselves and barely make any moves on people so we are hard to find. So with this post im trying to see if there's a patern that increase the odds of people meeting each other..

So here are my questions,

Dominant girl (take the lead, ask the guy out) and shy girls (probably ask a friend to get your crush number for you) Where do you think you can find your shy guy? Library, bumble, bars, group sharing same hobbies, networking, forums(like reddit)? What is your success rate in finding them?

Shy guys, how and where do you expose yourselves the most? (Bars, libraries,convention, anime club, forum). What is your sucess to meet someone you are interested in and goes to a first date.


Basically just wanted to start a thread for shy people and people looking to date shy people. Maybe this will help some lonely souls out there.

For example, recently he insinuated to her that he cannot rely on her financially, because of her spending habits. He said she needs to be more responsible b/c he pays most of the time when they go out. Thinking further out in the future, like buying a house, he will be funding most of the big stuff (he also has a well paying$$ software job). But after all that, he said she should just keep doing what she is doing. She brought this up to me and when I pressed her on it because it sounded pretty mean of him to say, she said he didn't mean anything by it. I don't buy it. 

She does like to eat out and buy clothes like any woman (maybe a bit more than her means but nothing crazy), but she pays for everything herself - it's just when they go out to eat or drink, he tends to pay more often. She even just returned this dress she bought because of what he said. I pushed back and told her it seemed a bit passive aggressive of him to say all that, and then end by saying ""oh don't change what you're doing though."" What do you guys think? I'm already not a big fan of him personally to be objective. Long story short: they used to live together in a house he bought and then he broke up with her. She moved out, and only a couple days later he told her he actually just wanted to work things out and stay together. Also he has this weird thing about not being ready to propose until age 30 b/c ""something clicks in men's minds when they hit that age"" and other dumbsh\*t like that.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p3ge7w/need_advice_my_best_friend_is_in_a_longterm/

With that in mind. It may sound vain but I will basically never agree to a second date unless there is some sort of physical attraction to the person, even if it goes well conversation wise.

So yeah, any facial deformity. Anything from mild to severe deformities. Especially if I had to do with her lips, like cleft lip. Would it really matter to you? Even if you buddies teased you about it that you could find someone more attractive. Would it turn you off? Or would it really just not matter to you?

I ask because I’ve heard guys are visual creatures, and even if a girl has an amazing personality and all that, she doesn’t have to be gorgeous, but she has to be somewhat attractive.

32,p3gv2g,1628831230,Question.,"Hi. I am a freshmen In Hs and I got a few questions. So basically this girl started snapping me a few days ago called me cute first snap, snapped me all at for the past few days, and then asked me out a few hours ago. I told her I would think about it. I just need to figure out if it’s worth doing it and realistically how it would work.
1. We both can’t drive 
2. We live 5 KM away from each other, so biking would be annoying.
3. We don’t go to the same school. 
4. I have never actually met her IRL, only seen. 

Ok so to start off my social anxiety is pretty bad which kinda is clear since I am writing this in the first place, but I have never had a GF and infact have been made fun of by my friends (in a joke way lol) scared of girls due to how little I talk to them. 
So my questions
1. How do I tell my parents I am hanging out with her? I dont wanna just be like “hanging out with a girl” it would be sooo awkward.
2. I told myself the second she snapped me I am not interested but now I don’t wanna miss out. Is it worth it for the experience?
3. I know both her brothers pretty well and my brother is like best friends with her brother. How do I avoid the awakenedness of her brothers finding out I am hanging out with their own sister.

Now that I'm in the ""adult world,"" dating has been a lot more difficult. No one just stumbling into my arms by chance anymore. Not as many interactions with people around my age or type throughout the day. With the people I do interact with IRL that are closer to my age, they are already in relationships or only interested in hooking up (no judgement, just not my thing.) Also doesn't help that I tend to be more introverted and try to avoid crowded places like bars and clubs where it seems like a lot of people my age prefer to spend their time. The pandemic has not helped with feelings of isolation either. Meanwhile online people just give 1 word responses or just ghost you after a few days even if it feels like it's going well. And it's already rare enough just to get matches. It just seems like you can't form a solid connection from the dating sites.

44,p3i5am,1628837193,Red flags??,"
I (23 F) started talking to a guy (23 M) that I matched with on a dating app. it's been a few weeks and we've had about 5 calls and it's been great. he's initiating the calls and most texts which is a good sign. we vibe and connect really well, and there's great communication between us. it feels like we've been friends forever, and all of our calls have been around 5 hours long and we'll stay up talking til the morning. i don't see any major red flags but there are some things that slightly concern me, so please help me identify if these are red flags and something worth bringing up to him.

once we matched on the app, he messaged me first on instagram since i put that on the app. we've been texting on there for a few weeks now. but he hasn't requested to follow me still, and i'm a private account.

he also hasn't given me his number or asked for mine, i see this as a red flag i think. even though texting through social media is working for us, i feel like the goal is to get into exchanging numbers, right?

this is an odd one, but he seems to agree with me on quite literally everythinggg. every opinion i have, he seems like he genuinely agrees and doesn't ever have anything opposing to say to me. he even has real life examples of how he applies that opinion in his life. i find it a little strange that he doesn't disagree with me on anything. we're both Christians of the same denomination so i mean, it's great that we seem to have a lot of similar values and goals, but again, weird. especially since he just became a Christian last year (way before we met).

he also has not brought up the subject of dating one time. not even the potential of us dating or seeing what that might even look like. we've talked for a collective of about 24 hours so this worries me.

 he also has not brought up meeting in person at all either. we live in different states and I tell him how much i love his state and would love to visit again.

i feel like men really can't be that oblivious and miss the hints i'm giving him. either that or he's just not that into me romantically? i appreciate everyone's feedback!

if you consider them to be red flags, how do i bring it up to him? i'm looking for a man who will pursue me, and he isn't doing that too much (please no sexist comments, this is what i prefer).",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p3i5am/red_flags/

47,p3iss4,1628840463,Quit online dating if you want to maintain your mental health,"It's taken me a long time to learn, as I've struggled with mental health issues, but one of the biggest benefits my health has had occurred when I quit Tinder. Online dating has several issues that can negatively contribute to your sense of self, sense of purpose, and self-satisfaction. 

1. Dating apps often encourage constant usage, meaning they will rarely match you with people who are an actually good match for YOU. If they give you a great match, then you'll stop using the app. I know this sounds slightly conspiratorial, and maybe it is, but it helps me explain how after dozens and dozens of conversations I still ended up with no actual results. 
2. Dating apps work via algorithms. Swiping left or right on someone only makes a difference if the other person actually sees you, which is not necessarily their choice. While, yes, sometimes people just don't use the app or whatever, typically the algorithm is actually working against you because it's providing a ton of people's profiles to the person you're interested in, before they actually see you. This can lead to thinking that it's your fault, when in reality it's the app's fault entirely.
3. Brain chemistry and relationships work in such a way that when you do actually get rejected on a dating app, or don't get decent matches, don't get replies, etc., you associate it with a rejection of who you are. This is pretty consistently never true. Instead, all the person on the other side has to go off of is roughly 3-6 pictures of you, about 500 characters that describe you, and \*that's it\*. It's a lot more difficult to establish deep connections with a few pictures of someone and a text conversation.
4. It can sometimes seem like everything is lost when someone doesn't respond to you. This is also not true. Many times, it is simply \*\*not your fault\*\* that someone hasn't responded back. They could be busy, they could have notifications off, they could simply be interfacing with the many other people also on the app, etc. With so many things demanding attention, it's easy to let a dating app fall to the wayside. However, you're still left with radio silence, and so it's easy to assume that it's your fault. See point #3. 

Quitting Tinder was one of the best decisions I've made. Even as someone who managed decent success on the platform in terms of matches (about 200 over the last 6-9 months) it's such a collosal waste of time and emotional energy. Instead, find other ways to meet people! Go to events, parties, bars, you could even ask your friends to set you up with someone. Just don't use dating apps for it - it's more harm than good.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p3iss4/quit_online_dating_if_you_want_to_maintain_your/

So I’m feeling a little hurt and I can feel it physically, 
then I noticed whenever my feelings are hurt, I write off the person in my brain and then the pain is transferred to my heart and once that happens, it doesn’t matter what happens after but me and the said person can never have a romantic relationship again. It’s like every emotion around that person dies with that feeling. 

But I don’t hate them or anything just the romantic aspect of the relationship dies.

60,p3klus,1628849961,Is he playing with my feelings?,"&amp;#x200B;

**Hello guys!**

So, I've met this guy, we've been talking for 3 months, and in the beginning we were just friends, but i developed a crush.... I told him I like him, and he told me he didn't feel the same way, but my best friend, who's also his friend, talked to him, and on their conversation he said I would be the perfect girlfriend but just doesn't... Feel it, never felt the spark! (his words, not mine), and he ended the conversation with: ""let's see where this goes"", i think that's super weird, but he was pretty straightforward, he said he didn't like me, so I just ignored it and I'm just trying to move on.

We text and play games together a lot, i would say we do it everyday, and in one of our conversations he said that he never talked so much to someone before, we just ""understand each other"", he had a whole monologue about how he likes our conversations and in the end he said: ""our compatibly shouldn't go to waste"" i asked what he meant by that but he brushed it off and said he needed to sleep.

Well, moving on, we hanged our today, like we usually do, and everything started when i thought he would call more friends, because he is very extroverted and he usually does that, but he didn't.

It was very fun and friendly, it didn't felt like a date at all, but on the end of the ""date"", i held his hand because there was a car coming, and he just...kept holding my hand! Since I knew he didn't like me I told him to let go (i don't know if he heard it, i said it quietly), so he let go of it but then he said we should hold arms so he doesn't fall(he's clumsy) and we did it, we held arms for the rest of the date. I also patted his head and he smiled, i don't know what's going on.

The thing is, he is not a physical person, he doesn't hug, he doesn't hold hands(we're opposites, i do that a lot), so i thought that was really weird!

**What's going on? Is he just playing with my feelings or is he serious? Is he confused? Is there a chance that he will start to like me? He asked me out again! I'm really confused, please help!**

Background: So I matched with a girl on Tinder and had a first date with her about 3 days after. It went pretty well and she was pleasant. I texted her after the date to ask if she would be down to get together sometime in the weekend to which she said we definitely should meet again but not this week bc she’s busy with work and will go out of town for a bit. I reached out to her say every 2-3 days to check in on her. She responded well to that and would ask me questions about my health (i have a broken wrist) and such. she was showing genuine  concern. Fast forward to 2 days ago, during our texts, i asked her if she wants to meetup sometime this weekend. No reply 😅. It’s so weird bc we were having an active conversation but she hasn’t replied to that question yet. Also, she schools abroad and will be leaving in about 3 weeks time.

My question is should i send a witty follow up like “ hey i think you forgot to press the send button” bc she is a pretty girl and has a lot guys messaging her or just let it slide and move on bc sometimes things just don’t work out, which i am totally cool with?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p3l0kf/to_follow_up_or_not/

65,p3l5lk,1628852559,"Recently realised the only women who are actually into me are women who are too young for me to date, and it makes dating impossible for me","
In school I was a bit of an ugly duckling. Really short, bad haircut, really skinny, bad glasses, bad clothes, I was way too shy with girls I liked, etc. I never had any romantic attention whatsoever all through high school. The thought of any girl being interested in me was, and still is to some extent, crazy to me. Since then I’ve changed what I can, done a lot of work on myself and I feel better about myself. I’ve had a couple of drunken make outs here and there, had some kind of ‘flirtationships’, etc., but nothing that goes remotely anywhere. I’m 23 and still a virgin, but in a much better place.

So here’s what I’ve noticed. On Tinder and stuff I noticed I don’t really ever match with girls my age; as I’ve gotten better looking over time I’ve noticed I match more with girls younger than me. When I was 20/21, I was consistently matching with 18 year olds. Now it’s usually like 19-20 year olds; girls my own age don’t seem to be as interested. I noticed it in real life too; up till I was around 20 I still got zero attention, but on certain nights out I’d have the odd little spark with a stranger I met. They’d always be younger than me. It still wasn’t overwhelming; no girl has ever actually pursued me, but I could just always tell that in general girls younger than me are a little more interested. I still have a baby face to this day, and I’m short, and I think girls my age are me as this little puppy like guy that needs to be protected. Only girls younger than me can kind of see me as more mature and like eligible to date I suppose. I’m so baby faced that I kind of look like I’m their age, and it bypasses the way most girls my age just don’t see me as a prospect. At least, that’s my theory.

The problem is dating girls that young creeps me out. I feel like a 23 year old dating a 19 year old is just a little weird. People tend to think that if you can’t attract girls your own age and have to go for girls younger that there must be something wrong with you, or that you’re just preying on their vulnerability. In a lot of cases I think that probably holds up. I know there are plenty of perfectly happy couples that make the gap work, but I just think around this age when your brain doesn’t fully mature until 25 age gaps can lead to weird power imbalances that can make things an emotional shitstorm.

But recently something really weird happened, at least weird for me. I started a new job and for probably the first time ever, I’m completely sure a girl there is into me. I usually am terrible at picking up signals but it’s just way too damn obvious. I can just tell.  She laughs way too hard at everything I say, makes excuses to get me to help her even though she’s been there way longer than me, she keeps adding me on every social media, she teases me all the time and flirts with me, if we’re on a shift together she’ll make sure we’re doing the same tasks so we can talk, she (not so subtly) asked if I was single right now, and beyond all that I can just tell that that’s what’s going on. The problem is, she’s only just turned 19. We get along great and she is really attractive, and I’d be lying if I said I didn’t kind of look forward to having a laugh and flirting with her a little, but I make sure not to let it go beyond being just kind of playful fun.

But fuck it annoys me. I go my whole life with girls having zero interest in me, and when I do eventually get a little attention it’s from girls who are off limits, at least in my eyes and those of a lot of people I know. Like this is the first time I’ve been able to look at a girl and be like ‘yeah she’s definitely into me’, and it’s such a great feeling knowing someone’s attracted to you like that. But I’ve waited all my life for that and when it finally starts happening, I’m too old for the people who actually like me. I noticed it as a kind of general trend for quite a while through tinder that younger women like me more, but this kind of blatant case of someone being into me made me realise just how much it probably dominates my dating life. Maybe in a couple of years when an age gap isn’t such a massive deal things might settle a little and dating might be more of an option for me, but it really does suck having gone your whole life with nobody interested in you, and then when it does start to happen it’s not even people your age. It just feels like missed opportunity after missed opportunity for me, I just wish I looked a little more like a fucking man rather than some little boy, cause as it stands in the dating pool my choices are either be completely overlooked, or get accused of being a complete creep.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p3l5lk/recently_realised_the_only_women_who_are_actually/

71,p3m4lm,1628856759,Should dating be path of least resistance socially? 28m,"There seems to two different types of people I fall for. One is drop dead gorgeous and really sweet, but I sometimes struggle to socially know how to interact. Then those that I was not immediately blown away by. When I get to know them I find that I start liking them because I find them easy to talk to.  


Sometimes I think its almost easier to start liking people overtime then be blown away at first. I met someone recently who was insanely pretty and I've had a few decent conversations with them, but a couple of my jokes fell flat which was awkward. I sometimes say dumb stuff I dont even think is funny though.. At least they know what is funny and what isnt LOL.   


A friend told me that dating should be fun and if I feel stress then its probably the wrong person. Im not sure if that is all true or not. Relationships are different. Some easily start and then things come up later down the road, others are harder at first but develop into something really great.   


Should things be super easy at first or is it normal to have to figure people out?  Should I be able to have an endless conversation with someone the first time I meet them??  


Also, just because a girl is giving me more attention and laughing at every joke I make, does not mean that they are actually a good fit. So I could see how going the path of lease resistance could lead to relationships that were ""easy"" to start, but are not full-filling.   


This also might be a confidence issue. I've been working on it, but sometimes I get thoughts like ""she is too pretty to like me"". Which I honestly dont believe much in ""leagues"", but if there was dating leagues I got no idea where I'd fit.   


Overall, I am not sure about the idea that things should just be easy and fun. Maybe its because I deal with some social anxiety.   


I think sometimes things are worth pursuing arent easy. Ofcourse if they say no, then I move on, but I think path of least resistance could lead to an happy longterm relationship?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p3m4lm/should_dating_be_path_of_least_resistance/

81,p3msoa,1628867620,Friend of 7 years confessed her feelings to me," Hi everyone, never thought that I would end up posting something but here it goes. I (42M) have known my friend Cindy (34F) for over 7 years. Just last night she confessed to me that she has feelings for me and it started around a week ago. 

Story: I used to play online mobile games and met a few nice people. I met this girl Cindy who was really cool. she was super sweet and when ever we chatted it was like we were just best friends. We were just purely platonic friends because she knew that I was in a long distance relationship with someone at that time. Through out the 7 years we would message each other on facebook being that I'm in California and she is in Canada we never met. Well, just this year I finally broke off with my LDR girlfriend due to her cheating and moved on. Cindy showed up every now and then and we just talked about food and adventure and daily life. I really enjoyed having her around but in my heart I was not ready for anything and we were just purely platonic so I never gave it a 2nd thought.

Then last night, she just admitted to me that she has feelings for me and it has been lingering in her for a week. She told me she doesn't know why and was sorry because she just woke up one morning and had these feelings (weird right?). I guess she told me because I had an inkling feeling with how her behavior changed slightly. The problem is I don't know how to feel. I love being around her, she is a great friend, it's just that I don't know if I am ready for her and I don't want to string her along because I might end up hurting her. She has been great to me and I don't want to lose her as a friend. After being in a LDR I am a bit paranoid, I fear that it will not work. In truth, I panic and I start overthinking everything. I have been through so much and I am really worried and scared of LDR. 

She told me that I should go visit her and if things click, then we can take the next steps. I have my family here, and she has her family there but she told me she would be willing to drop everything on a dime and make the leap to move out here with me. I am just scared that if things do not work out, I would have wasted her time. I would be wasting her time loving me and she deserves the best.

I can't get women interested enough to consider going on a date. I have no experience with women, and never been on/had a date/relationship/kiss.

I have friends (both male and female), but all of them are married (and most of their friends too). I have been trying dating apps, yet to get matches. I do follow the guides of online dating from this sub, like having my photos taken professionally, decent bio and resetting account.

I'm trying to makeup for my unattractiveness by better style and gym. I try going to social activities and clubs to better my chances, is there anything more I can do ? I don't know what to do, my friends say that I should leave dating now and try in 50's since women would be more mature by then and wouldn't mind dating someone unattractive (I don't think that would help in anyway).",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p3myo4/as_an_unattractive_and_belowaverage_height5_feet/

He texts me after the 3rd date and things are going swimmingly, until I text him later that week and he gives me some bullshit excuse about him wanting to move to another state lol and can’t see me anymore. Which is the most ridiculous excuse because he just bought a house and told me he didnt want to leave his job like 2 days earlier.

So I ask him if he would be willing to let me know why he was really ending things so I could have some closure and if there was anything I couldve done differently just for my own self development.

Finally, he admits that he thinks I’m pretty and a good communicator but that he hated my dyed hair, naturally tanned skin, makeup, nails, and clothes lmaooo. So why’d he even date me when I look like that in all my photos? Keep in my mind I work in finance and although I’m done up it’s not like I wear clown makeup….

Seriously just seems so shallow because I could literally just wash my face and the makeup would be gone. I guess for me I care more about a guys values and character, and I would never judge him for his style, clothes, or appearance but that’s just me. Or maybe he just met someone he likes more and this was his excuse.…anyway it hurt not gonna lie and having a hard time picking myself up.

86,p3ncpx,1628868870,"I don't want to be the ""settle-down, safe option guy"".","**Note: Please read the entire post before commenting, because nothing pisses me off more than someone reading and focusing only one part of a post without getting the full context.** 

I know this might come off as an irrational fear. But I'm almost 28, with no dating experience. I feel like I missed out on the youthful dating experiences, and it makes me angry. And I refuse to be the ""settle-down, safe option"" guy. You know the guy women don't pay attention to during their ""wild years"", but now that they are ""ready to settle down"" they're finally interested. Granted, I'm not exactly a high earner. In fact, I'm only now finally close to getting what people consider a ""real job"" (I graduated college late, so yeah.). And I'm still working a little over minimum wage. 

I know I have to resolve this before anything else. I'm not even bothering with dating right now, because my job search is my main priority. But I want to make it clear, I am doing it for myself. I want to make a comfortable living. But I am not interested in being a corporate slave, and I'm definitely not interested in being some ""provider-type"" to some woman who's ""looking to settle down"". I want to experience the fun, youthful side of dating, where there are no ""end-goals"". Just sort of let things happen naturally (which is how dating should be anyway), without having the end in mind. And if it works out, great. And if it doesn't, hey at least I gained experience.

 I am against the idea of marrying the first girl I date. Heck I don't even know if I want to get married ever (maybe I'll change my mind someday, but maybe I won't). And before anyone says ""What if she's the perfect match?"" or ""What if she's inexperienced too?"". You are talking about a less than 1% possibility at best. Like seriously, both instances are exceptionally rare. 

So I refuse to be the ""safe option"" or ""end game"" for women who have the ""fun out of their system"" and are looking to ""land a husband"". I especially refuse to date women who are concerned about salaries. Cause chances are, they are looking for a ""husband/provider"" type too.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p3ncpx/i_dont_want_to_be_the_settledown_safe_option_guy/

Since then I have had zero interest in dating. I have taken up a lot of new activities that enrich my life, playing guitar, doing Jiu Jitsu, playing a new MMO with my college friends.

We really care for each other so the timing sucks big time but we think this is the best decision for now. 

I work for a nonprofit and they have a gala in NYC every year and he goes to school up north, so I mentioned that I’d be about 30 minutes from his school while I’m staying up there with a family friend. He said that he’d love to come to the gala with me (bc it would be my first time visiting New York and I don’t want to go alone obviously), that he could give me a tour of his school and I could stay with him for a few days. So very soon, I’ll be booking a flight for November. 

Right now, I’m not sure that I want a relationship just because of the distance. I wanted one at first but realized that it probably wasn’t a good idea given how long we’ve known each other, etc. I’m cool with going with the flow and so is he.

96,p3ocsf,1628871460,Beating myself up for oversharing,"Hi everyone
I'm a 26 years old dude and as a professional overthinker and ruminator, when a girl I'm seeing decides to no longer see me, I get extermely hurt and automatically enter overthinking mode and try to figure out what the hell I might have done wrong.
A few months ago I asked out a girl I knew pretty well, at first she told me she has to think about it since there are some things that are going on in her life. 2 days later, she comes up to me and says that she'd also like to go out with me but I should know that she has an ex she hasn't entirely gotten over but if I'm willing to give it a shot, she'd like so too so I said yes. She was the third girl I ever dated. The first date went quite well and we made plans to meet up again. The second date also went very well and we kissed, the problem comes from what I said after we kissed. For some reason the first thing after the aftermath was to ask how did I do and she said: 'Fine, why?' And I said: 'No particular reason, it's just this is my second kiss"" and she asked how and I proceeded to tell her a bit about the first girl I dated(the second one lasted only one date so it's not relevant), what I said was: 'We went on a our first date, it went pretty well and we kissed, the day after she called me and asked me to take things slow, and there was quarantine and we didn't see each other for a month, and then we went out again and it wasn't all that great and then she ended it. I don't wanna go too much in depth into it but I learned from the whole thing and I wanna bring everything I've learned to this thing here."" As you can see, I overshared but despite this the date continued pretty well and she even shared some personal stuff. After some more talking I brought up a plan for our next date and since we live a 2 hour drive away from each other I offered to pick her up, she asked if it was okay with me and I said: ""yeah, if I did that for her(the first girl I dated), then of course I'll do that for you too(The first girl I dated also lived a 2 hour drive from where I live)"". Again oversharing. The day after date, she calls and asks to meet up(We work at the same place) and tells me that she realized that she hasn't gotten over her ex and she can't see herself going into another relationship right now. She told me that he dumped her because he wasn't looking for anything serious and she tried to get back together with him, even as a non-serious thing but he still declined.
It's been a 5 months since then and only recently I've realized I've overshared and I keep beating myself up for it, blaming myself for this whole thing ending even though she gave me a reason that sounds real and not just some excuse. I'm just afraid that perhaps the fact that I didn't have so much dating experience at the time or the fact that I mentioned that I was willing to make a 2 hour drive also for the first girl I dated turned her off or made her feel jealous, which wasn't my intention at all. I just wanted to be honest with her but I guess I was too honest too soon.
Any advice/different perspective on the whole situation?
