I’ve only just started going on dates with new people and seeing how I feel about dating again. Originally, I kind of just wanted to hook up with a few people, maybe a few times each, and then move onto the next. I’ve been clear about my intentions with everyone. 

So, I met this guy a few weeks ago and we really had sparks. He’s super cute and we have tons of things to talk about. On our very first date I told him I was open to a relationship, but only with the right person. I also expressed that I wasn’t looking for anything too serious because of my semi-recent breakup, but that I am down for monogamy if I’m getting what I need out of the situation. He said he wasn’t “good boyfriend material” from the start, again because he recently had a breakup of a much shorter and less serious relationship. Cool! Seems like what I want. 

We’ve hung out several times. The sex is fucking great. He is hilarious and I feel like he listens to me. I... really think I like him. It seems like dangerous territory to be feeling for someone who told you they “weren’t good boyfriend material”. Should I bolt? I’ve told him before that I like him. I mean, at the end of the day I suppose I don’t really care much if he wants to see other people as long as I don’t have to hear about it, but I’d definitely rather have him all to myself if he wanted that. I don’t want to get my feelings hurt or make him feel like I’m too attached. I’ve never been in such a casual situation where I spontaneously developed feelings! This isn’t like me. Haha. This is not the hookup I was expecting to have!

Perhaps a bit peculiar question. I am a male, 30 and have noticed a pattern in the dating world. It is that physically 'strong' women seem to have statistically higher preference for me, in fact they constitute as the majority of my relationships while there have also been exceptions but clearly less than average.

With 'strong' I mean that these have been taller than the general female population, being the same size or slightly taller than I (5'11 - very average in my country). All are normal weight and a degree more athletic than people on average. However, they have been traditionally feminine in other physical traits, such as having long hair and in body shape. Case in point, I complimented my last girlfriend that she has the physique of an attractive Wrestlemania-type female athlete (a compliment I knew she would appreciate, given her sense of humor and putting the effort to maintain a sporty physique). Typically, the women have approached me first, because I am socially pretty shy and awkward at first.

I leaned in for a hug and there was a moment I noticed he leaned in but I pulled back and got out of the car, I also laughed saying goodbye like “I’m so awkward at goodbyes on first dates” and he laughed saying it was okay. 

Where I ran into a little bit of what ill call troubled waters, is when we started discussing attachment styles. He seemed to resonate with the avoidant and said he’s never lived with a girlfriend but has had a c couple long term girlfriends.  Me being 30F (or maybe less to do with age?), I’ve had long term relationships but also have been engaged and lived with my fiancé of 5 years. I’m not sure if I’m judging too soon, but do you think our difference in attachment styles should be taken as a sign this is not the right person for me? I’ve been burned before by falling for an avoidant and it sucks. :( What came off as a red flag to me was when he mentioned something around the “3 month mark” being when he starts to really take the person and the relationship seriously. The last avoidant I got burned by had this “3-6 month rule of it being considered dating” and there were a lot of mixed signals in between so I had to end it before he even approached that time frame. I appreciate any advice. I also see our age gap as an issue if it has to do with where he’s at commitment-ready wise (say 6 months to a year if I want to move in... I know, getting way ahead of myself) and he’s just never ready for that because he’s avoidant... he told me he’s had trouble with that in the past... am I just wasting my time? - He did mention that he doesn’t like to date around but he’s very selective on who he chooses to focus in on.

I'm not saying I think I'm some great catch or anything but I'm cute. I'm short and redheaded and guys seem to like that. What I don't get is quality guys wanting to date me. 

Back to this guy... he is VERY convinced that he will be my boyfriend and it kinda turns me off. I don't do anything fast really and he seems to immediately want a relationship with me after one time chilling with me. Telling me he wants me to spend the weekend at his place already and I barely know him. He's constantly freaking out in me like telling me I'm so gorgeous and stuff and like way better looking than anyone he's ever dated. A girl likes compliments and stuff but why is it freaking me out that he's so so into me? I don't think I will be able to date this guy.

 I've told him I need space and I kinda like being alone. He told me he doesn't think I should be alone at my house. Like, WHAT? Why not? What's wrong with having my own space? Am I broken because I want to date and want a guy who wants to spend time with me, but NOT every second of the day? 

Like, aren't there some decent guys who want a girl who values her own space too? Maybe I just don't understand dating at all. I have pretty limited experience dating and have pretty much just dated the same guy on and off forever and hung out with guy friends between that time.

So about a month ago me and my girlfriend of 1.5 years broke up because I was away from home at college and the distance was just really hard to overcome.  Well recently I decided to get back into the game and since I’m 19 and can’t go to bars I decided to download Tinder.  Well that just makes me feel even worse because I can’t get matches.  Well the other day I ended up getting a match for the first time in a while.  The exchanges went well, I got her Snapchat and we’d been talking on there.  We agreed to see each other next week but now feel like I did something to fuck up because she leaves me on open and takes a long time to respond.  I’m so tempted to just say fuck it and go back to my ex, and even though I still love her I just don’t think the long distance would work so I’d be back at square one.

I don’t even follow her I was simply just doing some snooping.

We went on a first date as strangers (I had asked her out while I was working snd she was a customer) and I had asked her out that week and she said yes. At the time I was seeing another girl so I had to cancel the date but like a month later I hit her up snd she said yes to going out, so we had our first date then.

We had a picnic at the beach, I brought wine, we talked for like 3-4hours, I wasn’t expecting anything since I had literally just met her, but  as I was dropping her off she said “aren’t you gonna come in.”

Long story short, she pours us some shots, we watch a movie, make out snd then have sex. 

Assuming that she’s talking about me, I just can’t believe she thinks of me as hot when I don’t really think that of myself at all. We had sex on the first date, we were basically strangers, but again assuming she’s talking about me like im absolutely mind blown that she thinks of me as a “hot guy.”

I could also be totally foolish and she could’ve hooked up with someone else in these two weeks, but she seemed to not go out a lot snd she told me all she does is work and school, so I’m assuming all she wanted was some quick sex.

I (27/m) need to just vent cause I'm honestly feelin pretty sad about this one. I matched with a guy about a week and a half ago and we had great convo for the first week. I thought he was cute and he actually seemed mature/serious about looking for someone to date, so I was pretty excited. Anyway, he asked to generally meet up, to which I agreed, then he began replying less frequently. It took about 3 days just to arrange the day and time that we'd meet because of his infrequent replies.

I spent Monday - Wednesday trying to arrange the logistics, getting about one short reply per day. Then, he gave me a one word response on Wednesday, which really rubbed me the wrong way. He'd proposed we meet, but I'd done all of the organizing up till this point with zero effort from him and now he's giving me one word responses? The old me would've looked past it and just clung to the hope that the date would actually happen. I think I've matured slightly, though, as I decided he was being disrespectful. So I stood up for myself and told him that a one word reply wasn't doing anything for me and if he wasn't interested, he could just let me know and we could be on our ways. I didn't want to waste his time if he wasn't about it.

I was sad because I had genuinely thought that he was a good guy, but I was proud of myself for having some self-respect. Alas, he responded super quickly being very apologetic and explaining that it's been a very hectic week and that he still really wanted to meet up. Seemed genuine enough! So knowing that he's busy, I look up some bars we can go to and send them over Wednesday evening, asking him to pick one since we're meeting on Friday evening and need to solidify the plan. Crickets.

It's now Thursday night--haven't heard from him. I got played. Normally I'd just be like okay, whatever, but I think this one was esp painful and confusing because I confronted him and he reaffirmed that he wanted to make it happen. Like......why?

We talked and shared a lot of interests so I decided to ask her out. She said yes and we made plans.

First date went pretty great, we continued talking about our shared interests, and what initially was meant to be a quick meetup ended up spanning the entire night. The initial awkward ""interviewy"" conversation turned into a much more in-depth and engaging one very quickly, we had drinks, she got a lot more physical throughout the night and even ended up reaching for my hand a few times when we went for a walk after drinks. We ended the night simply because where we live there's a curfew. I dropped her off, we hugged and she mentioned wanting to do it again sometime soon, completely unprompted by me.

At this time, I figured all the signs were there that it was a good first date and there would almost certainly be a second one.

Since then, it's been pretty much the same. I initiate a conversation, ask her out, she says yes, even says a day when she could, and then the day comes and something comes up that forces her to cancel. Hell, even the first time we went out, it was meant to be a Saturday but she canceled and moved it up to Friday because she got busy. Nothing like that since, however. 

It's frustrating because there was a connection, and I feel like if I insist too much it'll kill any attraction that may even exist at this point despite us not being able to set up date in two weeks. When I text she responds, and she writes quite a bit, she seems happy to talk to me and responds positively to the idea of dates, it just doesn't happen.

I dislike it and at this point I'd rather just hear a straight no or just be ghosted because trying to make an outing work with this woman is driving me insane.

There was a post this morning about “why do men not take dating advice from women?” Attracted about 250~ish comments. And while some people were making cogent points, a huge amount of hurtful, even hateful comments on there are making me question whether you guys even like women at all?

Because I suspect this bitterness is connected to your inability to hook up with a bunch of attractive women, NOT because you can’t find relationship with a woman.

Comparing us to children for wanting “the spark”/attraction to a partner? Saying we all want to be treated like trash and that’s what we find attractive? Calling us by numbers like “we don’t wanna settle for a 6/10?” And shit like that? I mean, you know we have worth outside of our looks right? Or are we meant to settle for you, even though you deserve a super hottie?

I don’t know, man. Y’all clearly want to have sex with us, but you don’t actually seem to like us as people. And we can sense that...we’re not half as stupid as you seem to think...I went on a date with the oh-so-clever RedPiller type and clocked him almost immediately. Negging &amp; manipulative tactics are quite easy to spot for any person with a semblance of self-respect.

Maybe the crowd on this sub is off, but if I met men in real life and heard a fraction of such things, they’d be ghosted with a quickness.

I’m going to get flamed for this, but before you go off, ask yourself this question: Is it possible that your overwhelming bitterness and frustration with the opposite sex has anything to do with your lack of success in dating?

I mean I get it. It’s a pandemic and we’re all lonely and horny and miserable. But JFC...a lot of hostility toward women you purport to want to attract.

We met online, grew to be into each other and it eventually developed into some sexting here and there. We met twice (I drove both times in the bast year) and he was supposed to come over, but because of C19 restrictions this has been halted. Important part: we’ve never had sex, but it was supposed to happen this time. 

Now I was in an unhealthy relationship (my first real relationship) for 6 months. He (M25) was my first consensual partner (full intercourse) and while dating him, I made it a point to cut any NSFW ties with the fwb. Towards the end of my relationship, my ex made me fee extremely unsexy and undesirable (he had an emotional affair with his ex). We split and shortly after, I contacted my fwb. 

Everything seemed nice up until the energy felt different. He knew I was in a relationship and he had said a few kind/sexy things, but they were never reciprocated until I broke up with my ex. I had a hard time getting back onto the flirtatious pony and sometimes I feel like I might be overstepping when I say something inappropriate that would otherwise lead to hours of “virtual fun” and the desire to link up again. 

I had my finals recently and I disappeared from social media, allowing only my immediate family and best friends to contact me. I know that dipping in and out of conversations isn’t ideal, but I want to make sure the interest isn’t fully gone because I quite like this guy. I enjoy being physical with him, but he’s cool af as well and he’s like a hotter &amp; much nicer version of my ex. I know inconsistency isn’t fun, but I’m trying to communicate better and hopefully it’s fruitful with him. 

I want to know how I can get him to be interested again (without just exposing myself and using my body to entice him) and figure out if it’s worth investing more energy.

I have two bad dates that are pretty much tied, so I’ll just tell *one* of them:

I had a great first dinner date with a guy. Total sweetheart, great conversation, and a ton of laughter. But at the end, when he was in the bathroom, I put my credit card down and paid for us both. (Bold gender bending move.) When he came back he was shocked and upset that I paid the bill. He insisted on taking me to a fancy steak restaurant immediately. 

Like...literally immediately. After we’d just finished our first dinner. I laughed and playfully said, “Don’t worry...I only got the check *this* time, you’re getting it on our second date.” I was being genuine. I was looking forward to another date. 

We got into a cab and I tried to give the driver directions to drop me off at home,  but my date interrupted and told the cab driver the name of the steak restaurant instead. I enthusiastically protested, but he wouldn’t take no for an answer, and I was too young and naive at the time to stand up for myself as I would now. 

So there I was, totally full from the first dinner, pushing my steak around my plate for an hour, trying to humor the situation. 

At the end, when the check came, he immediately handed his card to the server, then smirked at me and said “Now let’s go back to my place.” 

I politely laughed and joked, “This is only the first date! What kinda girl do you think I am? Hah, how bout we wait a little while for that.”

He pushed it. “It’s technically the second date now. We’re having our *second* dinner of the night.” 

I stayed firm on my answer. “Sorry, but I’m just gonna call it a night.” 

That’s when his face totally changed. The smile melted into a scowl of disgust, and he says in a downright menacing voice, “You women are alllllll the same. Just take and take and take, and no give.”

My jaw drops in shocked amusement. I didn’t know what to say and I just sort of nervously laughed. 

He continues, “I just paid for you to have a really expensive steak dinner, and you still won’t put out. So fucking typical. Fucking prude.” 

That’s when I just started laughing at him wildly. He continues to berate me and the server walks by and overhears it. He starts laughing at him too and points at him and says, “She’s laughing at you because you’re a pathetic prick.” (‘Twas a great moment of solidarity.) 

I walk out of the restaurant and the dude follows me. I tell him to stay back, and I start trying to hail a cab. He starts yelling. Going on and on about I-don’t-know-what because I stopped listening. 

Just then a group of bros walk out of the bar next door, and witness what’s going on, so they they yell at him “Leave her alone, you fucking psycho!” So, my lovey date turns to them and starts shouting obscenities at them instead, and they all burst out laughing. (This guy was giving everyone in his path a serious case of the giggles.) “Get therapy, dude!” 

While he was distracted by them I hopped into a cab, and figured I’d seen the last of him. Years later I started to see his picture online. A bunch of people who work in his industry came forward about his misogyny and sexual assault. 👏🏼

i downloaded bumble and tinder hoping something would come out of it, but i find myself ghosting people bc i feel like i can’t give them what they want. i’m also terrible at flirting and initiating anything (you can blame my anxiety for that one lol). i’m to the point where i’m practically scared of intimacy but also crave it bc i’m still a hormonal young adult.

I've never gone cheap on a date where I'll choose the cheapest spot to go or try and spend as little as possible but I don't throw my money around trying to show off either. 


Now I haven't been on a date in almost a year and most of the girls I've met since high school has been through tinder (I never had much of a social life while studying and my dating options were limited to say the least). So recently I met a waitress and we seemed to hit it off pretty well to the point she even agreed to go on a date with me. So obviously my over excited dumbass of a brain wanted to make sure I at least make a good impression with this as I don't know when I'll get this sort of opportunity again. So I planned this whole thing of dinner, a movie and stocked up my card to play around in the arcade (I know this sounds pretty atypical but there was a lot more to it that I'm not getting into). The amount I spent wasn't to a point that I blew my bank account, but the effort I put in to make sure everything would go flawlessly was more than I ever put into any other date.


Finally the time arrives for us to meet....and she doesn't show up 


She doesn't respond to my messages, ended up turning her phone off so I can't call her, and I'm left there feeling like a complete and total idiot.

My SB works professionally as a Class Action Settlement Project Manager in Minneapolis and even has her own private office.  She sugars, I believe, to make up the gap in the luxury lifestyle she has cultivated for herself.

We have picked up the steam in our dates since late winter of this year and, thanks to the pandemic and working from home, she has been going on plenty of walks with her dogs in the city and has lost weight and looks pretty damn hot now compared to when we started our SR.  On our last two dates, my SB has actually shown up with her long blonde hair fully coiffed and primped (as opposed to in an up-do) and as she drove into my community for our last PPM date (I live in a distant suburb that has a small town feel), she told me she had numerous men waving at her and honking at her at the local intersections.  Score one for her (and me). 😍

Early in 2019, my SB asked me for an advance on her allowance when her Jeep Wrangler went TU (back before she sold it and switched to borrowing cars when needed from her neighbor and her sister).  After which, she decided that she didn’t have to really deliver a date for the advance I paid her and it almost ended our SR... we didn’t talk for a good long while.  So now we get to our trying to have our latest date.  We meet at my place on Thursday mornings.  We had to cancel twice due to this or that.  Then my SB puts the squeeze on me again for her allowance in advance.  Like a fool, I fell for it.  She promised to use part of it to buy some new lingerie from Soma to model for me and now she has gone largely opossum on me.... again!  I am just going to see how long she will keep up her routine before she finally figures out that she has to deliver on our date before she can withdraw more $$$ from her Sugar Daddy (SD) ATM. 🤣  What I find amazing is how my SB’s mom and sister have not figured out that she must be doing something to make up for an obvious financial gap in her lifestyle, unless they believe her when she low balls the rent figure she pays and/or she inflates the salary she makes at her Class Action Lawsuit Project Manager job.

Lately when we are together and we are talking in a general way about our lives or politics (we are both progressives)... it feels to me that what we have is a true SR.  But outside of our dates, Joanna is distant and even goes opossum on me when it suits her and I find myself questioning if we are really just transactional.  As an example, I will send her two or three line texts that are admiring of her and funny and up beat... only to receive one word answer from her hours or sometimes days later that simply say... “Same”. 🤕

I talked to him about it and told that she’s cute and all but I’m not sure since she would like me. I mean, she literally had a small crush on my friend from the start. Around 2 weeks later, he told us that they both started dating out of no where. This obviously shocked our entire friend group because of how he had tried to set us up with her. It just didn’t make sense why he got together with her after all that. Now, he’s just posting lovey dovey shit on Instagram.

&amp;#x200B;

1) People don't care about strangers.

Back in my  teens, I put on some weight and went to the gym for the first time, but I was so nervous about people watching me in my ""Unfit"" state, I couldn't get myself to do anything. I opened up to one of the personal trainers, and he simply pointed at some random guy, and asked me what I thought about them. I told him, nothing. He pointed at a fat man, and I repeated the same thing, and then a woman, and mostly the same thing.

""If you don't care about them, why do you assume it's any different for them?""

People do not care about strangers. That feeling of fear you experience when you want to go up to hit on someone, or simply to talk to them, that you'll humiliate yourself so much that the earth will swallow you up? Fake. Just think of it like this. Picture something funny, amusing or humiliating you've ever seen or heard from a stranger. How much of their appearance or identity can you actually remember, outside of the situation?

Sure, you go up to someone, you fuck up. They laugh, walk off. Now that's a story they'll tell their friends when they get drunk, but you? They've forgotten you, only what you said / did. Don't worry about making a fool out of yourself, because as far as you need to be concerned, only you think that way.

&amp;#x200B;

2) Pickup lines / Greeting.

Whether it's online dating or meeting people in person, how to open the conversation has always been the point of contention. One of my usual pieces of advice, is simply to say the first thing that came to mind. The first thing that comes to mind is usually based on who you are as a person, how you think, what you like, your sense of humour. 

Granted, you should still think before you speak to avoid saying anything rude. In cases where you expect they'll receive that comment or intro a lot, you can alternatively say the same thing, all the while asking if they've already been told that a lot. The point here is, if they don't like the comment, maybe they aren't the one for you?

The overall point of this tip is to stop trying to come up with the ""Perfect"" witty pickup line, and focus more on something that's actually from you, and not something you read online. If you aren't the person who has that wit, don't pretend you do or it'll fall flat. If they like a band, and you quote a line from one of their songs, without knowing anything about their music, you will run out of them quickly.

&amp;#x200B;

3) Settling

This one is a more personal decision. Fundamentally, you're making a ""Quality"" over ""Quantity"" decision. Would you rather have one perfect thing, or many imperfect things? If you are able to function single and be happy, then don't hesitate to be picky and have standards when dating. If you don't want to be alone, and aren't willing to risk it, then take the risk of dating people you aren't particularly as keen on, just because being with ""Someone"" makes you happy in and of itself, but you pay the price if you don't.

&amp;#x200B;

4) Emotional Baggage.

You know when someone says ""Hey, How've you been?"" and the correct answer is, ""Fine, yourself?"" Yes, keep it that way. You only answer honestly to that question with someone you know, and you know is fine accepting some ranting / baggage. Don't dump your problems on someone you've only just started seeing, unless they actually want to know.

&amp;#x200B;

5) Honesty.

In almost every situation, honesty is always the best policy. I've always lived with the motto, ""Any secret I have, has to be a secret I can live with being revealed, because no secret lasts forever.""

I don't keep secrets that would destroy my life if they got out, rather, I'd prefer to be the one to reveal them early and do damage control myself, because chances are, there are other people / things that can out such a secret.

&amp;#x200B;

6) Communication.

Talk. It'll solve so many of your personal problems. Don't bottle it up, don't delay it, be upfront about it. Don't be afraid to say or hear ""We need to talk.""

If you want to kiss someone at the end of the date, and haven't had that perfect moment to lean in, just ask ""Can I kiss you?"" The worst they can say is No.

&amp;#x200B;

7) Be yourself.

Stop thinking you aren't good enough, stop thinking they wont like what you have to say, stop thinking you have to keep getting things to say from the internet. This doesn't build a stable relationship, it makes a relationship with the mask you've put on, and is most likely deemed to fail when the mask comes off. Yes, be your more charming version, as they get to know you, put on your best side, but don't be fake.

If you're really into something, then use that enthusiasm and drive to put yourself forward, find someone who finds it endearing, whether it be a mutual love of that thing, or just an appreciative look at how driven you are by it.

Be confident, be yourself. Better you find someone that appreciates you being you, than the alternative.

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, what you want to get out of life and a relationship is up to you. You need to decide what is Mandatory, and what is not. Don't hold yourself back with insecurities, find something you can do or say to convince yourself to take that leap forward. And if you decide that what you want is something you're not likely to get, and you are fine with that.

So I want to tell you a story from my dating life when I was in my 20’ies. I don’t know why but I have been in some super strange situations dating wise and this is just one of the stories. Might share others later! 

(I am now 31, have a child and live with my partner, all good)

Here goes...

I was young (20f) and out partying with some friends in a big city in Europe where i lived at the time. This very cute middle eastern looking guy started flirting with me. Lets call him Yus. His eyes were very intense and he was very good at keeping eye contact. Yus was kind and gentle and I ended up giving him my number. He called the next day and asked me out on a date. I said alright. We texted some in the days before the date and during these days he started calling me “yellow” instead of my real name because he thought my personality was yellow. A bit odd but okay. We agreed to meet up around 14.00 and enjoy a walk in a public park. Sounds good and casual for a first date right? Yeah...

So i show up by one of the entrances of this big public park at 14.00 and text him i am there. Yus shows up from one of the bushes (??) and says i need to put this blindfold on because he has a surprise for me. It was daylight, a lot of families in the park so i wasnt afraid or anything, just thought “oh no whats this”. He guided me through the park and at one point he stopped me, turned me and took off the blindfold. 

The first thing i saw was this blanket on the grass with a picnic basket and i was very relieved lol. Then he asked me to turn around. I did and was very surprised. He had set up a full dinner table with beautiful cutlery, 3 different wine glasses, candles, flowers (yellow of course) and he had prepared a 3 course meal which included caviar and what not. He even had a waiter serving everything for us. Apparently it was his cousin and he just stood there. I tried to be like “hi how you doing” but he didnt respond. So awkward. There were cushions and blankets and it was all very extravagant and strange. On my side of the table there was a wrapped gift. I was very humbled and thanke Yus so much for everything. During the whole meal he called me “yellow” and spent a lot of time just looking into my eyes. Cousin still standing there. To be fair i was a little uncomfortable lol but we were outdoors and there were people around so i was not unsafe. 

After this crazy lunch and wine and everything he asked me to open up the gift. It was seriously crayons in 10 different shades of yellow and a colouring book with all sorts of things he wanted me to colour. There was also a small roll of paper that i rolled out. It was very narrow but extremely long like tose rolls of paper for card receipts if it makes sense. He had written a HUGE text on this crazy long piece of paper about me and the sun and yellow flowers and how i was in harmony with it all etc etc. It was SUPER weird!!

I said goodbye around 17.00 i think. Cousin packed everything while Yus followed me to the train station. I gave him a quick hug and thanked him before hurrying onto a train.

I went home to my parents after this date and explained them everything and they advised me not to see him again lol. And i never did. He tried to call a few times but i was young and very uncomfortable so i just sent him a text thanking him and saying i felt it was best not to meet up again.

On our first date, there was something very yucky about being with him. He was super kind, but lacked boundaries of all kinds. I thought this feels familiar. 

I had to have surgery and he let me stay with him while I recovered in January for three days. While I was with him, he would disappear at random times during the night. He later claimed a female was texting him and could not get the message that he was just not that into her. 

His excuse for continuing the conversation was, I dont want to hurt her. 
I finally said, ""I thought we were dating exclusively!"" ""We are, I just dont cut people out!"" 

In retrospect several times, felt like this person was not honest. 

He blew me off, after we made plans twice. He stated, ""I have crippling anxiety."" So, crippling that you cant say, ""Im sorry something else came up, like I dont feel well?"" This speaks volumes about being a player. 

At one point before he admitted to speaking with this other female. I stated, ""Your talking to someone."" ""Yeah, I dated her for six months last year.""

We tried to step back and just be friends 

Every single moment became about him. I couldnt make a statement that he didnt personalize it. 

He represents my IMAGO. Anotherwards, my Dad was incapable of being faithful, until he met my stepmom. 

Please, if you dont have self respect, dont bother dating until you find it.. 

We have been broken off for six weeks and he is claming he has a urinary tract infection and I stated, have you seen a Doctor. He states ""No!"" I said, you might want to before it makes you terribly sick. Then I said ""Have you been sexually active?"" ""Yeah!"" I stated, you would definitely want to wear protection, and if you didnt, you need to be checked..

Although,  I respect complete honesty, this is not a road I wish to travel with anyone ever.

In his defense, I have male friends. They are like brothers to me, they guide me alot 
 on conscious dating. 

I understand the need for human connection and I have been single for 8 years. Ive dated briefly a few times,  but now I know why I steer clear of players..
