0,oodqyy,1626823492,I can't get something serious going on with girls I like,"Hello fellas,

I'm a 26 years old man from South America and moved to Scandinavia one and a half year ago with the purpose of expanding my career internationally. After this change, the girlfriend I had at the time, since I was 19, broke up with me because she couldn't handler the distance relationship that we would need to have for one year before she could move in here, for personal reasons - this breakup was really harsh on me, made me really depressed and I decided not to date again till May this year, because I couldn't simply handle my emotions properly. I seemed to always be in the verge of an emotional breakdown.

As anyone in Scandinavia who doesn't want to scare the autistic locals by randomly starting conversations I decided to download Tinder. I don't consider myself a pretty man, but I've been able to match and go on dates with girls I who are very gorgeous, and this is is where the problem starts. When in a date I normally have no problems interacting with the girls, I think. We normally keep the conversation going, we talk about interesting stuff, we normally kiss or have sex, but no matter what I hardly can get on a second date.

For instance, the first girl I met was a local blonde, adorable! We went for a coffee, talked for hours and had a great and warm goodbye kiss before I took the train back to my place. On that day we agreed we would see each other again, I get into the train, she send me songs and we get the conversation going during the week with one or two messages a day. She bailed on the date e initially agreed, and then I rescheduled, but she bailed again. She was always super nice, and we were always respectful for each other, but we ended up being just friends, even tho it had an initial spark.

Time goes by, I go on more dates, always being able to ""score"", till last week. I've met this girl from Latvia, and she was absolutely gorgeous. We went on a date, all goes as normal and we do have sex, she says all kinds of nice things to me, like ""we should spend a weekend together"", ""we have a really matching energy"", ""you are cute"", hear emojis, etc, etc. I keep talking to her, ask her out again, she agree on going out, but then she bails out, reschedule, bails out again, and I end being pushed alway as a friend again.

On the other hand, girls which I don't like that much and don't get emotional with normally want to keep hanging out with me and propose more serious stuff. Normally when I go on a first date, I've not yet been emotional available for the person, but if I like the girl, I make myself available. I will text during the week, try to get into fun conversations and so on. When I'm just for sex, I will text just in order to schedule the next hangout and talk only when out.

**I fall in love too easily**, from Chet Baker, is a song that basically sums up in a few words the kinda man I consider myself to be, and I think that being passionate and very upfront with feelings is scaring off the fellow Northern European chicks - but I'm unsure. The problem is, I tried to be different and to hide what I feel but it doesn't work, my desire to act like that and built something I consider to be special is simply overwhelming. I tried to read a few books, and the message I always get is basically ""don't be too nice"", ""define boundaries"", ""you won't be respected if you act like this"", and so on.

What do you guys think I should be doing? Apparently the South American way works better when Europeans visit us rather than when we go to Europe haha.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oodqyy/i_cant_get_something_serious_going_on_with_girls/

2,oodur5,1626823847,Dating a girl after 5 years of being lonely/single,"Hey guys, today I went on a date with a real cute girl from my gym. Normally shes kind and everything but sometimes she just weird to me, like idk not giving me attention and then suddenly she gives me all of her attention again. No i dont need the attention, im wondering. Now we went on a date, had a big conversation about almost everything laughed very often and its wasnt weird or cringe or anything else. For me it was just nice. I'd thought she felt the same since she didnt say anything. I texted her: ""I really enjoyed our evening together😊"" and she replied: ""me too🙃"". This emoji makes me insecure idk. Did she like the date? Is she just saying she liked it too to not make me feel bad? I dont get it.

&amp;#x200B;

Prestory to everything: We know each other for a good time, not friends, but just seen on friends party and whatsoever. 3 Weeks ago, she started texting me FIRST and she asked a lot of times if I wanna go on a date with her. I always said yes and she cancelled everytime last minute. So I talked to her IRL saying i dont like this bullshit and either she wanna do something or not(not the same words, i hope you get it anyways what i mean). Then she said shes free today so we did went on a date like described.

4,ooe00e,1626824334,Attracting someone who doesn't seem interested,"I (gay male) was talking with a guy on Tinder a few months ago. We moved to WhatsApp and chatted for about a week. Then I suggested meeting up that weekend. He said he couldn't as was visiting parents, but was free the following weekend. I text the Thursday of the week after to double check if he was free, and he said something came up. 2 weeks later I again suggested meeting that weekend, he said yes. When I text to confirm a couple of days before, lo and behold, something unexpected had arisen. I said no problem, life happens kinda thing but left it there, and he hasn't been in contact since. 

I've chatted to loads more people since then, but I keep thinking about Mr. Unavailable. We had a lot in common, seemed to get on well and have a similar sense of humour. Even if it doesn't turn into a relationship, I'd be up for being mates.

Usually, we would go and hangout (she would come with a friend), but that’s understandable since I wouldn’t want to take the subway home by myself, due to the creeps out there. Last friday, me and her went to hangout by ourselves (without the friend). It was really fun, we went on a walk, got sushi, and then went to a bench together later that night. It was kinda awkward but eventually we got to the point that I asked her what she would consider that day to be, and she considered it to be a date. Obviously, I was surprised but happy at the same time. Now, this is where I need some advice. How do I make moves without being awkward (I asked her if I could put my arm around her, and when I left, I asked if I could get a hug, to which she both said yes to). How do we make it official? Where should I take it from here? Also one quick thing, me and her both have summer school, so she doesn’t text as much as before cuz she says she’s not on her phone, which is the truth because her snap score hasn’t changed.

I honestly get complimented almost everyday by strangers on my looks and how I dress and act. I don’t see it but, I’ve been scouted for modeling before. I have a ton of close friendships but it seems like dating is my worst part of my social life. Either I don’t get a second date or I attract pervs whom I don’t talk to after the first date. I’m modest in the way I dress and kind of dress more mature for my age. I’m in my early 20s. When I go out with friends, I usually get a ton of attention from men way older than me.

So eventually I get tired of waiting for a response and I decided to delete her number and I unfollowed her and got her off of my Instagram and I unmatched her I figured it didn’t workout.

When we started dating, he would reply to all my texts almost instantly, never taking more than 5 minutes. Slowly he started taking longer and longer to reply, and at this point he takes 2-4 hours to give me a response to each text. I would be understanding if he couldn’t reply quickly because he’s at work or hanging out with friends, but he’s not. He takes hours and hours to reply when he’s at home with nothing to do. As of yesterday, he also started leaving me on read, which he had never done before. At the beginning, we used to talk for hours on end and I miss having those conversations with him.

The anxiety has been eating me alive for the past few days, and I don’t know how to proceed from here. Since I already know that he’s no longer interested in me, should I stop talking to him and let the relationship die out? Or should I confront him about it and see where this takes us?

But later I found out he sleeps all day until 3/4pm because he stays up playing videogames all night long. He's unemployed because of this and because his truck doesn't run but he's not doing anything to fix it. He's also extremely picky about what job he wants. I only went to his place one time. Laziness is unattractive to me.

On the other hand I was working 2 jobs and being up at 7am to go to work at 8am until the afternoon. Idk I'm the kind of person where after work I want to go home, I'm done socializing you know? Maybe I'm old (24F). So no I'm not coming over today.

Anyway, I found a much more compatible guy my age and its on Facebook that we're official. Problem is Danny will still not stop SPAMMING me ""Hey"" all the time. For days he will text ""Hey, wrud, what are you doing, hello? Hey."" He has been doing this even when I made it obvious I was backing away from him. Yes I still had to be nice when he came in the store. Eventually I would break down after the 10th Hey or whatever and say something in response. After it went on Facebook Danny texts asking to go on a date.

How do I say nicely to the dude: ""Hey. Im sorry I am in a committed relationship now so I only go on dates with him and don't text other guys now."" (I have guy friends but I'm lying because this dude is annoying the fuck out of me). Should I just ignore him? I don't work at that store anymore.

He never was able to take accountability for how he treated me instead he would tell me how terrible of a person he is and that I deserve better. Whenever I had problems with my mental health he wasn’t there for me emotionally, he would get irritated that im depressed and then say to me “he’s lost and depressed and that he hasn’t cried in years ever since he met me” he also had a huge problem with ❄️and alcohol and would constantly bring it around me knowing I’m bipolar :/ so I don’t understand how I was toxic when all I did was be loyal, loving and affectionate and supportive towards him. I did everything I could to make him happy even though I wasn’t mentally well.

26,oofjeb,1626829642,My friend is having unprotected sex with a known STD,"Let me start by saying, idk if this is the right forum for this, and also; I’m not in the “dating” world. I’m married.

So I have a friend who I have been close friends with since high school, (we are in our late 20s now. Her and I have very different ideas when it comes to dating and relationships, ever since she left the state we grew up in and moved to California, she’s been more about “hookups” than monogamous relationships. Which is absolutely her prerogative. 

However, she recently mentioned that she has been having unprotected sex with this new guy she has been seeing. She is on birth control, but that doesn’t help against stds. The problem is, they are not in a monogamous relationship, and I know for a fact she has previously tested positive for HPV. She has not told him this, and said it would be weird for him to tell him now, since she’s already let him not use a condom. 

Now I know HPV is the most common std, and some people don’t ever experience symptoms, but some people can have major health issues because of it.

I couldn’t believe what I was hearing.. it’s seems so selfish and irresponsible. It’s stupid IMO in general to have unprotected casual sex, but especially when there is a known STD.

He used always call me while at work and we talked for hours everyday and we FaceTime. The only time he doesn’t call is on the weekend I just because he works five days a week and he got things to do on the weekend. But now his off work for two weeks because of lockdown and he doesn’t call at all. I have opened up about this but he always makes excuses like I have work around the house or I have to help my parents. Now his making excuses around lockdown saying he  prefers to see me face to face rather then calling. His behaviour is making me question if he is still interested in me. I confronted him and he says that he loves me and still interested in me. I don’t know what to think anymore his behaviour is frustrating me. I’m thinking of leaving him because of this.

The first date was amazing and second date was even better. He seems like he’s looking for something serious minus the fact he got a new job and will be moving to a new city in 2022.. but I haven’t asked what he’s looking for. He hasn’t tried to hook up but we also both live at home right now lol. During our dates, he’s mentioned how much we have in common, how alike we are, he listed of the pros of dating him, he asked me to go to Europe with him, etc. We are supposed to hang out this weekend with his friends for a birthday celebration. He’s perfect but the only downside is his texting. He only texts me once a day which is usually late at night and sometimes it’s 2-3 days later.. I’m not a huge texter myself but I think 1-2 texts a day is good. I get nervous when he doesn’t text back for a couple days. He has a really busy job so I understand but I also feel like if you’re into someone you make time to respond. On our date, he said he only uses his phone for logistics during the day and then checks his texts at night. Should I bring up his texting or is it too soon? Is it also too soon to ask him what his intentions are? 

I usually don’t fall this easily but I am head over heels for him and I am a very straight forward person but I don’t know if it’s too soon to say something ?

36,oogfw6,1626832930,Dating opinions,"I'm curious about something and wanted to hear some other opinions. I have had absolutely no luck when it comes to romance. I used to be quite forward with men by asking them out, planning dates, planning second dates, and I have continually only gotten the interest of problematic men. These being manipulative assholes, men who are too depressed and detached to really give to a relationship, or men who act super interested and excited only to ghost me.

I got out of a relationship last year and started to really do some internal work on myself. I started working out regularly and building muscle, meditating, being more organized, and got into therapy. I really thought dating this time around would be a lot more successful because in the past I was super desperate and came on waay too strong at first. Lately I have been letting men make the first move and making sure that I don't come on too strong. Despite this, I just keep getting ghosted or meeting men who only want to talk to me for sex or to fill some void (and I know they will just end up telling me that they aren't ready for a relationship later).

I am a black woman, I live in the midwest so it is mostly conservative around me (I am not), I'm not religious, I don't want kids, I like nerdy things, and I can be socially awkward so I come across as a bit quite at first. I'm starting to wonder if all of these traits combined is what is causing so much of the struggle. It is hard to find people who want to date black women, don't want children, and aren't religious (at least in Nebraska). I'm just starting to wonder if these qualities are what is making dating hard for me? I'm getting burned out from it and taking a break. I believe I am a catch and would make someone happy but for some reason people just don't take the time to really see the great person I am.

&amp;#x200B;

38,oogjeo,1626833284,differentiating between FWB and NSA Hookups,"I've been doing the solo/poly thing for a while. For the most part, the people I was meeting and seeing for the past few years were pretty ok. Most had decent manners, and everyone was respecting each other's time.   
Since sometime last year, things have really gone sideways. I'd say probably 8 out 10 either ghost or don't show. For the ones who do, whether they agree to a FWB and make arrangements; they constantly defer to a more NSA style of handling things.   


I think most of us out there in the dating scene probably obviously understand FWB vs NSA-H. However, based on behavior of people I've met even since the year started; I think there needs to be clarification.   


If you agree to be a FWB  with someone, this is not a NSA arrangement. The NSA's are for if you just wanna have a contact for that random once a month... every few weeks bootycalls.   


The FWB arrangement is intended for people who like to have some form of connection, and they are going to be more than just a bootycall. This doesn't give them a right or grounds to demand any form of commitment,monogamy, or anything like that. However, you should be making an effort to get to know them. It's fair for them to want to hang out sometimes. The frequency of how often you're talking and meeting can vary by a lot, but this should be accompanied by very honest and open communication. It's important to be clear about  your boundaries. I think it's important that this agreement gets revisited sometimes as situations can evolve over time.   


If you find yourself in a FWB situation where you want to see how things can develop, there's also the option of trying a poly situation where it can have more romantic notes to it, but it's still open, and everyone can still see other people.   


The point of this post is because I've met lots of people who agree to FWB situations, but they never bother to either chat and get to know. They won't go out and do anything except pop by for bootycalls. Most messages from them are WYD. If you're only hitting someone up for a WYD, that's not being a FWB. That's nsa-hookups. They are not the same thing. There is a difference. Don't agree to a FWB just because you wanna  hook up with someone. That's so rude, and you're wasting people's time.   


There are people out there who want  more out of a situation than just nsa's with strangers.   


not terribly related: but if you ghost someone you're supposed to be fwb with. they have every right to block you or not want to talk to you anymore if you don't communicate within a certain time frame following that. it's not ok to just waste people's times and make plans.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oogjeo/differentiating_between_fwb_and_nsa_hookups/

Anyways this guy seems really great. He has admitted that he does not have a lot of dating experience. He says that he has never really been on a date. I am assuming that he is also a virgin but I am not sure since we haven’t talked about sex yet.

Like I said before, he seems really great and I wanted to get to know him better so I asked him if he wanted to FaceTime sometime. He replied saying that he would rather go on a date. I told him that I find it a bit scary to immediately meet in person since we are virtually strangers. He understood my reasoning. It has been a couple of weeks since that conversation. 
Last week I asked if he wanted to FaceTime. He replied saying that he probably wouldn’t have time because he was going to work out but that he did want to FaceTime in the near future. I agreed but since then we have not really spoken about it. It kinda bothers me that I am constantly the one who has to bring up FaceTime and maybe going on a date after that. He is never the one to bring up the topic. Could it be that he expects me to bring it up because I was also the one who brought it up in the first place or could it be that he is simply shy?

No awkwardness so far, she seems interested.   


So I went to her today and asked about the time and place, and she got shy and started smiling, and said she's nervous, then said she has a doctor's appointment (true, she was a bit sick last week), and then she will do homework because she's going out of town tomorrow. She'll be back Friday and can move the date that day. All the time she was a bit of shy, insisting on her nervousness.   
On reply, I said, I might go out of town this Friday unfortunately and it's gonna be a big tour, might take 10 days, and implied that 30mins won't do much harm, lets see how it goes. She did ask about Friday again, and I said that then I guess i have to delay my tour. 

Then I asked her, when does she finish her homework, and she said 9pm. And then I said that I will be at the coffeeshop near her home at 9am, I hope you will show up. 

She did say that she doesn't wanna be someone to say she'd come but later doesn't show up, and I said, it doesn't matter, I am taking the chance of maybe, then I went out of the store with a See Ya!

Now I am at the coffeeshop, and she hasn't showed up yet, which makes me a stood out, i guess. 

**At this point, I need to know, what should I do next?**

**Do I go to her on Friday?**  
**If I go, what do I say? Ask for the date again? Will that make me a bit obsessive?**

62,ooi4zj,1626839327,Dating feels hopeless,"Im a guy and i havent been intimate with a woman since covid began. Initially, I intentionally stopped dating because my entire family was home during covid and we didnt really leave the house much. 
I have now moved back to college in the US and have been trying to get back into the dating pool. I thought that im at college and dating would be easy since everyone is young and single. I joined Tinder/ Bumble and all of my matches seem to either not respond/ stop responding after a while. 
The thing is im a colored international student with an accent, so I probably dont fit what most American women are looking for. Everyone has their own dating preferences and thats fine but its surprising that I feel like I cant find anyone to want to date me. Back in my home country I was considered an attractive guy and it wasnt uncommon for girls to approach me. I definitely never felt like I had to try very hard to seduce women. I guess most American women have different preferences, but Its surprising to me how big the difference is. 
I even began cold approaching women sometimes. I cant say im the best at it but I feel like im not bad (and getting better). Those usually fell through as well. 
I feel like im starting to feel a bit depressed because of the lack of intimacy. Its probably been nearly 2 years now since ive last been with a woman. Its starting to feel hopeless ans im losing the motivation to keep using Tinder/cold approaching since i just end up being constantly let down.
I also feel like im a weel put together guy and while im not perfect i think i have likeable qualities.
Anyone have any advice on what to do?

66,ooin7b,1626841246,Guy (23M) says that he cares about me (22F) but his actions say otherwise.,"So there’s this guy (23M) that I’ve (22F) been friends with benefits for the past year &amp; a half. Due to covid restrictions, insanely busy schedules, &amp; distance I was alright with being friends with benefits. We talk every single day &amp; see each other when we can. When we see each other we always hook up but also go out to eat, drink, hang with friends, have fun. I even met his family once. Now that things have opened up more &amp; calmed down &amp; I actually ended up moving closer to him because of work (he’s still 2 hours away), I started to think about our relationship more &amp; realize I have feelings for him. I thought that maybe he had feelings for me too because of things he would say. He compliments me all the time (not just on my looks, but on my personality &amp; character) &amp; tells me how much he misses me &amp; wishes I could live with him, &amp; also tells me that he cares about me. One time there was some confusion &amp; he got upset because he thought I was seeing another guy. Once I explained the situation, he apologized &amp; said that he gets jealous because he cares about me. He also told me that he started calling me his girlfriend to his coworkers because it was easier than explaining the whole friends with benefits thing to them.
However, when it comes to his actions, I see a different side of him. We seem to hang out on his terms &amp; not mine. I thought that now that I was closer I would see him more but he only initiated one hangout so far where I went to his house. He implied that he really wanted me to come back again but hasn’t asked me back yet. His family had a party last weekend &amp; he told me about it but didn’t invite me. He then said his family asked if I was coming &amp; he said I told him I couldn’t. I told him that while he told me about the party, he never invited me. He then gaslit me &amp; told me that he had &amp; I just forgot. I’m now trying to make plans for this weekend &amp; he complained about what I had planned so we are doing what he wants instead. But he doesn’t even seem that interested in coming &amp; when I asked him which day worked best for him he told me he hadn’t decided if he was actually coming or not yet. 
I’m just so confused how last month he introduced me to his family, invited me up for a romantic weekend at his house, &amp; told me how much he cares for me. Now he’s acting like he doesn’t even want to see me at all. I would say that this hot &amp; cold behavior is pretty typical for him though. I’m just so confused &amp; could really use some advice. Thanks!

68,ooit3n,1626841876,Ideas for 2nd date...,"Hey guys,

After being a part of this subreddit for so long, I kind of thought that you guys would be brilliant at some ideas. I have some of my own,, but I know reddit is always full of amazing and memorable ideas. As mentioned, this is a 2nd date. The first date was 3 hours over happy hour, we both had a great time, lots of subtle flirting and chemistry. Tomorrow night, Wednesday, is 2nd date time. We live in NYC so there are plenty of things we can do. Tomorrow is supposed to be another humid day, but the general idea is meet around 6pm, do something and then have dinner around 8pm. All signs point to things going well between us and there is definitely excitement for this 2nd date. 

I really want to try and make it really fun and a date that she will want to think about often. Unfortunately money is a slight issue, I am not wealthy, so I am a little conscious about expenditure. Being a gentleman though, I would like to cover the costs. I'm really excited and of course very nervous. It's been a long time since I've sincerely wanted to both impress someone and be myself at the same time. I'm hoping some of you wonderful peeps out there might have any suggestions. Essentially, meet at 6pm, do some activity without sweating to much in the humidity, and then eat dinner at 8pm. Anywhere in NYC is good, but primary focus is around the high line park, flatiron, or Williamsburg area. Thank you so much for reading this and any tips or ideas you might have.

73,ooj6s9,1626843502,Can this be considered predatory behavior?,"One of my friends started dating a 23 year old when she was 16. I have to say that the guy looks young for his age so she came to know the truth after the 3rd date probably. Thing is, in my country sex before marriage, especially among teenagers is low. There is barely any teenager having sex in a suburb like ours (unless they are married as legal age to marry for women is 18). Now I am an year younger than her so I was even more naive than her when she started dating. I was kinda uncomfortable with the age gap, but I never knew that this was the sign of a predator.

Fast forward to 2020-2021, she is 19 now. They have been in an on and off relationship for a long time. She told me a long time ago, she has broken up but never told me they got back together. She doesn't even talk about her relationshipsto me anymore. The boy's ""best female friend"" hates my friend and tries her best to spread rumors about her. I came to know that the boy has dated a 14 year old before dating my friend. The thing is, I now know that this kind of behavior is predatory. I tried to tell my friend about this as soon as I came to know that they are back together, and she lied that they have already broken up. I came to know later that she lied, or maybe she got back together again because everyone else around my friend convinced her that the boy is in Love with my friend. I also told her straightforward that your bf is dating young girls because women of his age can see right through him. Now, no matter how much I try to convince my friend, she keeps on lying to me saying that they have broken up but I know that's not the truth. She also refuses to talk to me about him but talks to her other friends about this.

“Whenever someone says to me looks don’t matter and personality does…I honestly feel like they’re a liar. I was in a QPR, one where the person who wanted a relationship messaged me first, asked to be in a relationship, backed up and said they don’t want that and wants a qpr, exchanged pics i think before they asked for a qpr or after (I can’t remember the exact order) and talked, ask if it’s ok to date other people, constantly talked about other people’s looks (while saying looks don’t matter to them) and how cute or “aesthetically pleasing” they are. But when I mentioned hey why did you ignore the part where I feel too ugly for something, gave a lame response to me. I felt very ugly and no longer trust people who say that after ending that qpr. Hell, looks what got us into an argument and ended the relationship (wasn’t about me, something else)

75,ooj9i2,1626843803,How do I stop giving so much attention to my boyfriend?,"I’m not saying that I shouldn’t be giving attention to my mans, but I feel as if i’m giving way too much. It’s a constant cycle of always checking on him, asking him how he is, asking what’s he’s doing, asking if we could call for a little, always sending memes, always messaging him, etc. I’m hurting my own heart when he doesn’t respond all the time like I am. 

He’s the type to not respond immediately. I wouldn’t say like hours on end, but when he’s doing stuff, it’s more of hours on end. I guess i’m ranting cause i’m a little frustrated that he doesn’t text me as much. He’s currently on vacay with his friend and i thought maybe he could text me every now and then throughout the day. But it’s more of like text in the morning, one text in the day, and then barely anything at night. I’m concerned why he’s doing this because his friend is sending me pictures throughout the day of what they are doing. If his friend can be on his phone, i feel like that’s the perfect time to text me just a little of how it’s going, just to talk for a little. 

And while he’s not texting, I constantly am. I’m waiting and waiting and waiting for him to text me while i’m busy doing the things I am. We had a little convo about it today and he just told me he can’t always text me the way i want him to. He said that he won’t always be there to text me, which made me upset, but i guess I understand what he means. 

I tried today to not answer him. It’s been 5 hours and he hasn’t texted me asking why it’s been so long since i’ve responded. :( I thought maybe he would notice, but no. My mom tells me i need to stop giving so much of myself to him. That i need to make him want me, because currently, i bet he believes he has me wrapped around his fingers. Sometimes he’s never available and here I am, texting him wanting to talk and asking, “why aren’t you answering mannnn.” I’ve never seen him text me like that, but i guess that’s due to me always being available even when i’m busy doing my things. :(",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ooj9i2/how_do_i_stop_giving_so_much_attention_to_my/

We started talking more and more and a couple of weeks later we were talking on the phone and a couple weeks after that we would ft most days and he would even ft me while he was working and try to teach me a little about cars. So everything is going great and he asks me to go out and I was leaving town that weekend so I told him no and some time later he asked again and again I was busy so I said no once more and he jokingly said that I would need to ask him out cause he didn’t wanna be rejected a third time and I agreed. So some time passes by and he asks me when am I gonna ask him out and at the moment I went to Apple Music and made a playlist that had songs these song titles, 1) Do you… 2) Want To 3) Hangout 4) With Me 5) ? ,and I sent it to him and he messaged back saying “you’re such a dork! HELL YEAH I DO!!” and we were planning the date right away and figured everything out and had it set for Friday. I was really excited cause I honestly caught feelings for him so I just wanted to see if the feelings were in person. So a few days before Friday we were texting like normal and suddenly he stops and at first I just assumed he was working late and couldn’t be on his phone so I go the whole day without worrying but the next day when I texted him it went unanswered and when I went to see if he still followed me on IG, it showed he didn’t anymore. At that point I knew I had been ghosted and honestly it still hurts because 1) he wanted me first 2) I asked him out in a way I’ve never asked a guy (even he said that was the best way a girl has every asked him out.)

85,ook8qs,1626848111,How to bridge the gap from friends to dating,"Background:

I joined a friend group 4 years ago and met this guy, I'll call him F. I thought F was cute the second I met him, but he wound up in a 2-year relationship and I watched it turn sour and eventually break. Now that it's over and he's had time to heal a bit, F says he's looking for a girlfriend.

Recently I've been hanging out a lot with F in group settings and my feelings have significantly grown for him. We've been staying up late watching movies, playing board games, listening to music, going on car rides, dancing, going on walks, etc. and it's crushing me that I don't know what to do with my feelings. F and I have a lot in common and I love spending time with him.

In short:

I really want to ask my friend, F, on a date but I'm avoidant of making things awkward if he turns me down. He's a good enough person that we would remain friends, at least. I talked to a close mutual friend and he encouraged me to speak up about it.

How do I approach F? We're always hanging out in groups. I don't want to come across as too serious if I pull him aside. I don't really want to text him because it's less personal and I can't see his reaction - good or bad. However, I learned that he has started past relationships via DM. In fact, I nearly have as well.

Should I just ask him to hang out, the two of us? Or be more direct and ask to go out together? What method should I use to communicate with him?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ook8qs/how_to_bridge_the_gap_from_friends_to_dating/

So the thing is that she’s seems like a really caring person, even remembered my birthday and texted said happy birthday. I also am very caring and I definitely want to show that side of me but I just don’t want to overdo it in person, and from my understanding you can friend zone yourself that way.

88,ookm1m,1626849905,Help! Did I get ghosted?,"Hi 30F dating again after ending a LTR about a few months ago. I’m totally new to dating, specifically OLD. I’m using bumble exclusively and have only been on the dating section for two weeks. I have received a lot of interest and over the past two weeks been on five dates and will keep it at this for a bit since they all asked for second dates which will proceed this weekend.

All of the guys asked for a second date during our first. There is one guy who I like more so far. I allowed him to peck me a kiss goodnight after our date and we’ve been in steady communication up until last Thursday. We’ve been having challenges scheduling our second date as we are both really busy and have been transparent with what’s been making us busy. Last Monday he asked for Wednesday but I wasn’t free so I said Tuesday or Thursday? He said that both those days would be hard but he’ll try. Tuesday comes and I didn’t hear from him so at 5pm I ask if I’ll be seeing him that night. He apologizes for not messaging me earlier and says that he can’t. Asks if there’s another day I would be free. I said Thursday I’m still available and Friday might work but I wasn’t sure at that time. Thursday comes and he messaged me a huge paragraph in the morning that he won’t be able to make it for today but essentially wants me to know he’s still interested and that we should aim for Friday or the weekend if I have the time. I said “I hope Friday will work!” And he hearted the message and told me he hopes I have a good day and I hearted that message. Friday comes and nothing. I felt I reached out already and this time he should. Or perhaps he was thinking the weekend instead since he said Friday or the weekend. It just wasn’t clear but I made other plans and let it go. The weekend comes and again nothing from him. 

While dating is new to me, I see the difference in communication between him and the others. The others are consistent with messaging and firmly arranged our second date. OLD to me is new age, meeting people this way is new age. I have no idea if this lack of communication indeed shows his lack of interest and I should take it for what it is or if I also didn’t do that great in communicating and perhaps should reach out? It’ll be one week of no communication if this continues to Thursday.

On our first date he said he doesn’t ghost as he thinks it’s rude and will tell his date that he is no longer interested… I know actions vs words. But I’m thinking of reaching out and just asking if he’s still interested? Or should I just leave it? 

If it matters, he’s also 30.

90,ookrym,1626850716,Question about guys and their car's,This question is not about honda vs bentley. But Kind of more about first date impressions but Not saying physically first date impressions. I know this sounds kind of Dumb and a childish question but I been thinking about this for quite a while now. You know when a guy is about to go on a date or even a hookup with a woman on a dating app or a social media app Like Instagram or even tinder. And when the guy shows up in his car to meet the woman. Is it a turnoff or a plus for the woman if the guy shows up in an expensive Looking sport's car for an example Like a Corvette or a Porsche 911 or even a fancy Luxary car Like a Bentley... Will this be a turn on or a turn off for the women if this happens? Or they simply just don't mind or care what car does the guy drive. I was just very curious about it. Let me know your Honest thoughts please.,dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ookrym/question_about_guys_and_their_cars/
91,ookx9u,1626851540,Would you give a ghost a 2nd chance?,"Met someone on Tinder in March and talked/dated for a few months until he ghosted me in May. I text him at the time to say if he wasn't interested or wanted to stop talking, he could just let me know but didn't hear anything from him so carried on with life. He's still always one of the first to watch my insta stories and regularly still likes my posts but I've never thought much of it because that ship had sailed.

He recently rematched me on Tinder, would you give someone a 2nd chance? I sent a  ""look who it is 👀"" message and he replied with a GIF. Just interested in people's thoughts on whether they would pursue it again before I get myself set up for another fall. Part of me thinks ""fool me one, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me"" so interested to hear others opinions.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ookx9u/would_you_give_a_ghost_a_2nd_chance/

96,ooliy9,1626855637,Dating my best friend after finally telling her how I feel,"This is definitely the best thing that's happened to me in recent years, ever since my ex called off our wedding I had be struggling with self-esteem issues and anxiety as this was all totally out of the blue,

As I got back out there dating again I found myself more and more attracted to my best friends and not just her personality but I had put up boundaries as we both work together in senior management roles and I am a bit older M(28) F(22) not to mention her previous boyfriends have all been much better looking and younger than me

Long story short I had feelings for her for almost 2 months until I finally decided I had to tell her the only problem was she beat me to the punch and told me she had the same feelings for over 3 months now, 

We've been together officially for 2 months and by far the best thing about dating your best friend is you automatically skip the first few steps of a relationship, I already know everything about her and she knows everything about me this is also the EASIEST relationship I've ever been in.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ooliy9/dating_my_best_friend_after_finally_telling_her/
97,oolqpm,1626856651,How can I tell a guy things might not be going anywhere,"Yesterday I had a thing with someone I've been into for the past few weeks. Someone who is close to me and I love. It was perfect, we couldn't stop kissing and touching the whole time and I couldn't stop smiling. So yeah, it was pretty good. He might be coming over later again. 

I was hanging out with a guy I met on a dating app. From the beginning I had told him that I only wanted to be friends (he doesn't seem to care tho, still tries something with me). He is really fun and flirty, and I have fun with him of we hang out but outside of that, I'm way more into my friend. 

It's too soon for me and my close friend to discuss exclusivity but he is someone I would never want to lose, specially for someone I don't actually see a future with. I know the guy from the dating doesn't seem as a friend, even when we've only seen each other once so hanging out with him again feels like a date. 

My question is, should I talk to my friend about it first to see if he feels like it's ok for me to hang out with him? Or should I just tell the other guy all of this and be done with it? I want to keep my options open just because I'm scared, I actually want to spend my time kissing my friend lol.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oolqpm/how_can_i_tell_a_guy_things_might_not_be_going/
98,oolraj,1626856723,I spontaneously removed the guy I’m dating on Snapchat last night and I am not sure if I regret it or not.,"Background Context: I am (20year old gay male/ out) he is (21year old bi male/not out) We started dating a month ago. We went on three dates and we both admitted we really liked each-other. 

Each date was a car ride around the coast at sunset, a lot of sarcasm, a good laugh, politics and A lot of deep conversations on his behalf. 

However he then becomes really distant and we stop snapping every hour. I then send him a snap saying how I do have feelings for him but I can’t be with someone whose not out (we could only meet at nighttime in his car) 

We stopped talking as he said he doesn’t want anything. 4 days later he messages and says how he misses me but how we can be friends. I agree. 20 mins later into our new profound friendship he starts saying how he wants to make out with me, starts sending topless pics etc (despite me telling him that I have feelings for him)

This theme continues until last night where he added me on his real Snapchat (for you straights out there - people who are not out as gay usually use fake Snapchat’s for Grindr) I then accidentally snap his old account during a nice conversation. He stops replying to me. 20 mins later I see he is back on his Grindr Snapchat so I remove him.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oolraj/i_spontaneously_removed_the_guy_im_dating_on/
99,oolt4l,1626856953,"Foot, meet mouth.","Y'all ever just fail to words properly?

After like 2-3 years of being single, I decided to give dating a shot again. Jumped onto an app, matched with a few girls, and seemed to be hitting it off with one.

Anyway... One unintentional innuendo later and the conversation comes crashing to a halt, and here I am feeling like the biggest idiot in the world.

I've never been 'that guy'. Never understood why anyone would send a dick pick. Never asked for nudes. Nothing of the sort. It's just not who I am.

But one idiot brained choice of words and that's exactly how I look, and were the roles reversed, I'd probably be thinking the same thing.

Anyway, thanks for letting me spew this into the void. I'm the type of person who fixates on mistakes, probably to an unhealthy level, and this helps. I think.

Anyway, welcome back to the dating world me. And here's a reminder to read, and re read, every message I send in future. Lol",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oolt4l/foot_meet_mouth/
