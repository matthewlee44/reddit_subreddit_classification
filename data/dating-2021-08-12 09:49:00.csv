0,p31knr,1628780385,"Anyone else tired of chasing love, but glad they feel this way?","For the first time in quite a while I feel so tired. I've been on and off dating apps for almost 2 years, and love is something that I always think about. But in a way I'm kind of glad and relieved that I feel slightly indifferent if love finds me rather than vice versa because when you're chasing love, your expectations aren't met and you're always in a mindset of ""why don't I have a partner that everyone else?"" and ""when am I going to find someone again?"". 

It sure is nice to have a relaxed approach and not be concerned about finding love, and maybe through this process of genuinely not looking for love, it'll surprise us in the future when someone special appears ❤️",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p31knr/anyone_else_tired_of_chasing_love_but_glad_they/
1,p31mzr,1628780559,"My boyfriend and I are each other's first boyfriend/girlfriend. We're 26 and 23. If we can do it, you can too!","I see a lot of people in their 20s on here upset that they haven't dated before. Obviously, I can't speak for everyone or people who are older than us because I don't have everyone's experience or the experience of dating in my 30s or up. But... I think that in general, the average person in their 20s who hasn't dated before has nothing to be worried about. I think that all of us have this perspective, that's probably media and dating app based, that like 99% of people our age have already dated around and had tons of partners before. In reality, I would say probably around 60-70% of the girls I knew in college had never dated before. The ones that had dated before were usually split into three camps. The super outgoing and friendly girls that talked to everyone and went out a lot, the girls that were still dating their high school boyfriend, or the girls that started dating a guy that joined their college friend group. But seriously, any time that a group of us girls would hang out, over half of us would agree (jokingly) that we would just die alone and be dog moms or something because we were in college and had still never dated. 


I can't speak for guys on this, but honestly just based off of interactions I've had with guys in college (the time when it's supposed to be easiest to date and hookup), it seems like most guys in their early 20s have either very little or zero experience dating. I think a lot of people probably aren't honest about this in social settings because there's this belief that there's something wrong with you if you haven't dated before at this age or that being a late bloomer makes you weird and lame. My boyfriend and I didn't meet and start dating until I was 23 and he was 26, and we're (I don't think lol) not too weird. I was scared that dating someone at 23 for the first time would be weird because I'd never even kissed or held hands with someone before. It actually wasn't though, and it all comes very naturally.


Also, I think it's becoming a lot more normal to be a late bloomer now more than ever. If you've ever looked at those age demographic graphs of the US, we're slowly becoming more like Japan and Italy in that we have a large rising older generation and not enough young kids to replace them. I'm not going to go in to reasons behind this, because I'm not an expert and I'm sure there's tons of reasons we don't know about, but basically that means that people our age just aren't having kids like our parents did. In general, we're having kids a lot later in life (30s and 40s) and we're not all getting married at 18 straight out of high-school like some of our grandparents and great-grandparents did. In fact, it's a little weird now if you do get married at 18 straight out of high-school. Again, no scientific proof of this, but I bet because people are getting married and having kids way later, we also start dating much later now too. 


Anyway, I hope this helps all you 20yos feel better about your prospects and life and stuff. There's no need to rush things. Even though things are going great between me and my bf, I'm aware that we could potentially break up in the distant future and I'd have to start all over again, so I hope this doesn't sound too preachy and like I know everything already just because I've got my first bf. I'm honestly just as clueless as everyone else, but thinking about things like this and the feeling of how naturally my first relationship fell in to place gives me hope for the future if things end up not working out.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p31mzr/my_boyfriend_and_i_are_each_others_first/

So far so good, but it's already Thursday evening and we last messaged each other on Sunday and I'm getting a little bit disappointed.

Does her not texting me when she's free exactly mean that she is no longer interested and that I should cease all contact?

4,p322ly,1628781851,I have no idea why I'm feeling frustrated and disappointed. Anyone else experience this?,"I've (24 F) been talking to this guy (28 M) for four months now. Initially everything seemed golden - equal effort, communication, honesty, respect. We had chemistry too. He's responsible, takes care of himself and his issues, clever, intelligent, creative, goal-oriented, great sense of humor - all good things.

As time's gone on though I'm coming to find that we're just not compatible. Different lifestyles, being together would be overcomplicated, and because of that overcomplication our goals don't line up very well. I won't get into specifics, but I would have to give up my entire career trajectory if we were to pursue something more serious. Additionally, he exhausts me if I'm honest. I prefer time by myself to spending time with him and granted I'm more introverted and he's extroverted, but I have to actively think about interacting with him instead of just having that flow of back and forth?? it's very strange and really tiring. I feel I have to be ""on"" all the time if that makes sense, and don't feel able to just relax.

Things have tapered off significantly since we started talking though (as a result of our individual circumstances and priorities). I can sense this coming to an end and I don't want to fight it because tbh my gut's been screaming at me to end it for over a month now. But I still feel weirdly disappointed and frustrated? Even though I know he doesn't line up with what I want in a partner anymore (effort and communication has fallen off on his end, I don't really want to be around him more than I want to be by myself, our goals/values ultimately don't seem to line up and it's all combined lessened my interest in him by a long shot) I still feel I've let myself down. 

Has anyone else experienced this?

It took her weeks to find someone new whereas I spent time improving and sorting the aftermath. 
The worst feeling now is that I miss what I had. I miss being able to talk to somebody, to spend time with somebody, to go on dates with someone, to give affection etc. 
I have tried online dating apps recently but haven’t seen any success. Despite being told I’m a great guy by all my friends and the few dates I’ve had online, no one really seems that interested. I have good conversations but they last about a week before disappearing. It seems like being genuine and having a good heart really doesn’t get you anywhere nowadays. 
A lot of my mates are now in relationships which didn’t exist when I was single. A lot of them are planning on moving out together, having kids, getting engaged etc. 
I’m spending my time improving my career further, preparing to compete in pro sports and planning to travel alone. I’m content with this but it just doesn’t feel right? 
Is it too much to ask for somebody? 
It’d be nice to have someone who wanted to go places together and explore the world. Someone who could train with me. Someone who would game with me. Someone to take along to social events instead of being the single one. Someone to cook for and watch films with. Just somebody who cared.

I got tangled with a narcissistic man. At first it began as the victim half lie story of how his wife left him because she cheated ( also he told me that he got a restraining order from her, and me too naive and blinded by the love bombing by passed it 🤦‍♀️). And then, proceeded to tell me that he is seeing another girl at the same time as me ( we met on a dating app and I supposed that it was normal for some people). 

Some time passed and I got obviously discarded for the other girl... although, a twist to the story - she decided to stay with her boyfriend and have no relationship with the narc. 

He came back to me, at this point I had moved on somehow. He came back to his happy self, which was a surprise to me as the discard phase was pretty traumatizing. 
But I couldn't handle it as he was still entertaining the girl he discarded me for, and also another girl that he met at the same time that we were dating. 

I left him at that point because my anxiety was too high and I disliked his constant entertainement of other girls. 

Anyways, 2 months later I saw him again (shared activity) and he tells me that he has good news. The good news are that he got with girl he was talking to and that he is moving with her to another city... AND yet, he was still telling me how much he loved me and missed me (and wants to keep contact with me as friends/lovers). They're in a polyarmorist relationship on his request. 
 I told him that it was the last time he would ever interact with me. And he cried.

Some background: my past two relationships have been abusive and toxic. I (F25) have re-entered the dating scene and I’ve been casually seeing someone for two months.

He (M30) doesn’t quite know what he wants and I am open to casual or working towards something. But we decided we’ll label this as casual for the time being. 

That being said, prior to this conversation there was an incident (which actually triggered the dtr conversation). I sent him a ~spicy~ picture with a caption asking him to do something. His response was “it looks like someone already did but I’m happy to oblige”. Mind you it was a pimple and I haven’t been sleeping with anyone else.

I was taken back and also kinda pissed. I felt like he was trying to get information without actually asking. He explained that he felt insecure and handled it wrongly. We talked about it and he apologized and I believe his apology was genuine. 

I tend to over analyze things like this. Is this a red flag? Could this be an indication that he’s possessive?

I know it has been said many times before, but today I went through the city I live in and I was conscious about my surroundings. I had just been on instagram to check out stuff due to boredom and felt a bit sad because I do not look like these people. Then it daunted on me as I went outside, nobody I pass on the street looks like these people, literally nobody. Today I saw a bunch of average looking people and you know what? I was one of them.

I do not look different than 95% of the world, yes I may have my physical flaws, but so does a lot of other people. The prettiest girl I saw, she would have been way below average if she was on Instagram. And that made me realize that the only reason I get sad about my appearance, is because I live in a fantasy world of social medias and movies (where the like top 5% of good looking people are concentrated into one pile). The best looking guy I saw was a pretty ordinary guy, but you know why I thought he looked good? He looked like he worked out a bit (normal size, not steroid size) and wore a fitting white t-shirt.

I hope this help you guys remembering that what you see on the internet is usually a concentrated pool of the 5% - which usually has been enhanced with makeup, plastic surgery and filters.

I'm also fortunate enough that I've got a good bullshit factor to steer clear of the guys just seeking hookups.

Do you know what's probably worse in the discouragement department than rude interactions, getting ghosted after a few dates, or having guys disappear on the app hours before you were supposed to meet, though? It's when you DO meet someone who you actually do genuinely connect with and makes you feel relieved you found each other, only for something to happen that causes them to need to take a step away from dating for their own personal reasons, and so everything gets put on hold there, and you end up back at square one on the app (and all your new matches just don't compare to that one person who needed a dating break.)

I can't blame anyone for taking care of their health over getting into a relationship, but lately I can't help but feel like my options are either the discouragement of the worst aspects of dating or experiencing great options slip from my hands.

I’m not sure what to do. I care for this girl very much and I’ve told her that to her face before. I tried to explain that what happened was my fault, and it had nothing to do with her. We’ve been texting throughout the day, but I feel as if she has lost some respect/attraction for me.

Has she lost respect for me? I also just need to vent somewhere. If anyone has some advice or honest feedback on the situation that would be awesome to hear.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p34xcb/couldnt_get_erection_with_my_new_girlfriend/
30,p34zah,1628790505,How to ask him if he’s seeing anyone else without making it a big deal?,"So this has more to do with sex than the actual relationship because the guy I’ve been seeing these past 2 months is going back to school in September, and we aren’t labeling anything right now because we’ll be 800 miles apart. We don’t want too many expectations and have either one of us get hurt. I’m going up to see him in November for like 10 days and we’ll be together over winter break, so that’s something to look forward to. 

We’re getting an Airbnb this weekend and it’ll be my first time. I’ve sort of taken the initiative on this whole thing because I want it to be with him and he hasn’t pressured me at all, it’s been 100% my decision just because of my hesitancy to have sex going in. I’m very comfortable with him, I trust him, and we communicate really well. 

I just want to ask him if he’s seeing anyone else from a safety standpoint. I guess I don’t know how to ask because we’ll be alone Saturday-Sunday. But part of me doesn’t really want to know because I really like him lmao, you know how that goes. 

My gut feeling says he isn’t seeing anyone but obviously I won’t know for sure unless I ask. I just don’t want to make a big deal out of it, you know? Advice on how to frame the question without putting pressure on things?

We kicked it off really well at a 3 day concert at the beach, we talked all night for 3 days. Once I was back in my home town, we kept on talking, and eventually I asked her out.

Before we went out, my best friend’s girlfriend told me she really liked you (apparently she had told her) and tbh I really had my hopes up. We had drinks, grabbed some food an she invited me over to her place. We didn’t have anything sexual, just a lot of kissing and touching. I tried to ask her out again afterwards, but apparently she kept finding excuses not to go out. When I finally asked her why she didn’t want to go out, she said that “you’re to far away. If I’ll send a you up text, do you expect to catch the first flight to come to my place?”

I’m gonna be honest. I had really high hopes, the connection we had when we were at the beach, really had me excited and I thought she was cool and my type. I’m really hurt. I know it’s my fault that I got caught up into thinking into having something in such a short time, but it sucks. I don’t want to be treated as a toy.

# Met a girl at the psych ward CHAPTER 2

**Intro below. If it bores you then just skip straight to the story.**

This is a pretty unusual story about life, death and of course a little about love.  
Reddit original movie coming soon.. Stay tuned.

After 10s of requests I decided to make a follow up story to ""Met a girl at the psych ward"" So here goes everything..  


A wise man once said that if not you, who? If not now, when? -Zen master Rinzai.   


Love is all around. Dont search for it where you first lost it and you will eventually find it somewhere. Maybe even in the most unexpected of places, like in for example the psych ward.  


So lets buckle up and try to make this story decent enough so that at least one person wants to read it.  


I also would love some feedback on the part where I add some backstory and if it is truly necessary.  


If you read the original post, you can feel free to skip chapter 1. I have changed it a little but not a lot.

**CHAPTER 1**

Not going to go into too much detail about how I ended up there but I was hospitalized for about 9 months after a proper mental breakdown. It was a place where we were focused on recovery so it was after the emergency stuff.

So we were about 10 patients and probably around 40 staff. At first I was just too ill to really socialize. One of the staff asked me if I had met this girl yet. I said ""no"". She then said that it was the pretty one. I had no idea until a few days later when I met her. She was pretty and seemed quite healthy.

She seemed somewhat cold at first and I didn't really try to get to know her. Just assumed she wasn't interested in talking. But at the hospital we had a lot of activities so eventually most of the patients were talking to each others.

I think she started talking to me out of boredom after a couple weeks. I realized we had a lot to talk about and we actually got quite a lot in common. She was 23 at the time and I was 25. So we often just sat around in the living room talking for hours every day.

I started crushing on her a few weeks after that. So I tried to find ways of flirting with her without making it too obvious. So in the beginning we often sat together when going on a road trip etc. She flirted back eventually and we were basically together but I never kissed her. It wasn't really socially accepted.

The staff often told me that what we had was special and that I needed to stay in touch with her after I left the hospital. I thought I had found a girl that I could stay with indefinitely.

She eventually left the hospital after staying there for 4 years. The time we got together wasn't too much. 2-3 months maybe. I stayed for 6 more months after that and I lost contact with her completely.

I never forgot about her although my crush for her gradually dissipated. So when I finally got out of the hospital I realized I still got her number and wanted to check in on her. I called her. I told her my sister just bought an apartment in her city and that I was in town for the weekend if she wanted to meet.

So we met up and things went pretty well. We met several times a week for a few weeks and seemed to never run out of things to talk about.

I eventually asked her if we could be together and she rejected me at first. She told me she wasn't ready and to be honest I wasn't really ready myself. So we stayed friends for the next 3 years. The spark between us was always there and we met around 10 hours a week almost every week during that time.

We were basically in a relationship even though we never took any serious steps. And it was long distance so we couldn't meet every day. It was just during weekends mostly. And we both had abandonment issues so we had a somewhat dysfunctional relationship. It was nice despite all of that. None of us were ready for a sexual relationship. We were somewhat intimate but it were mostly an emotional connection.

So we watched each others grow over those several years. We both got better and better for each passing month. She eventually got a dog and two birds. I got myself a cat. She bought an apartment next to my sisters apartment so they became neighbors.

Eventually she started referring to our meetings as dates instead of just hanging out. We started sharing drinks and food. We started holding hands and talked about future plans. She invited me to sleep over once her apartment is ready.

I am meeting her again tomorrow. I haven't kissed her yet despite knowing her for 4 years.

But I feel ready.

**Chapter 1, Extra:**

I didn't meet up with her last weekend as planned. She turned ill and didn't answer my calls for 8 days. I got confused and hurt but my worries was just that.

I met her again today and she told me she haven't slept since last time we met. We went for a 2 hours late night walk along the river.

I asked her why she wasn't sleeping and she wouldn't tell.

I asked her if I was stressing her out and she teared up.

I didn't speak a word for the next 10 minutes or so, just trying to figure out where she was at. She broke the silence by asking me how I was doing. I told her I was doing alright. I joked a bit and she started to lighten up a little.

I decided not to flirt with her today since she seemed to be in a quite low mood. She also seemed ashamed of telling me everything about what was really going on. I continued by digging a little to get to the bottom of it.

She gave it away eventually. I barely touched her shoulder as some sort of emotional support and she put her arm around me. Then she starting flirting quite a lot but she seemed sad.

So I know what she is thinking now. She is very much into me and that freaks her out. She is unaware of how pretty she is. She is actually hiding her personality from the world sometimes.

I followed her home.

I wished her good night, gave her the longest hug I have ever given her, held her hands and looked her into her eyes while telling her not to freak out tonight. I also sent her a message afterwards wishing her a good night but by then she was already out.

I am meeting her again tomorrow. Hopefully she is able to rest a little so that we can have a proper date tomorrow.

**Backstory (please post feedback on this section. Not sure if this is necessary). May remove it.**

A couple of weeks ago I posted a story in this sub which got up voted into the stratosphere. A lot of people have asked me to do a follow up. So here we go back on the roller coaster.  
A while after a couple terrible events that shook me to the core, I withdrew from society altogether and moved into a tent in the middle of a dark forest in Northern Norway. I needed an escape from everything.

It was named the dark woods natural reserve. It was very silent out there and it was freezing cold during winter. And it was dark as hell. No light whatsoever. I lived on whatever food I could catch. A lot of fish, some small animals and sometimes I walked for 12 miles to the nearest store to buy some extra meat to survive.

I started sitting at an old abandoned graveyard at night deep into the woods, communicating with the dead. It was comforting. Felt like I was closer to all my departed friends and family members. My best friend committed suicide after his girlfriend was shot dead in cold blood. Several more suicides after that. I never knew who was next. Some even committed suicide and I didn't find out until years later. After a while I started hallucinating. I guess it was all the time alone in a dark forest in the middle of nowhere. I started seeing twisted faces in the dark. In the beginning I thought it was just being afraid of the dark for some in explainable reason.

But after a while I couldn’t get it to stop. I saw twisted faces and dead people everywhere I went. It was my demons haunting me and for me it was as real as it gets. I went in a constant state of anxiety and fear. I thought I was really loosing it once and for all when I was bitten by an imaginary snake and bugs crawled out of the wound while several more snakes were all over me. Then a corpse started talking to me and told me to take my life basically so I could join my friends.

So one evening when I was on the last page of my hand made leather diary, I decided to end it. It was the end of my diary so I spend the two last pages on writing a suicide note, saying sorry to everyone for what i was about to do. I said goodbye to all my Facebook friends. I thought why not make this book the story of my life?

So I mixed all the pills I got with alcohol. It was a deadly dose by far. This was at school late at night. For some reason the universe wasn’t done with me yet though. I had managed to get some friends despite spending most of my time in a dark forest. So my friend, Amanda had noticed that I didn’t seem like myself and had called the police to do a welfare check on me. She also called me and I picked up the phone for once. She was the first to arrive at the scene where I was sitting with knifes and a rope trying to decide how to pop off. She was crying her heart out and told me I needed help. Shortly after I got picked up by the ambulance.

I wasn’t dead yet. So the next day I was at the hospital and stayed in the emergency psych ward for around 2 weeks before I got transferred for a 9 month stay at a center for treatment of complex trauma disorders. Amanda visited me at the emergency psych ward and told me that everything would be alright and that she would always be around if I needed her. We are still friends several years later. She saved my life basically.

My life was in scrambles. I wasn’t suicidal anymore after the emergency psych ward, but I didn’t really care if I was hit by a train or whatever. During the first few weeks at this new place, I was too ill to socialize a lot.

What happened there changed my life I would say.

**CHAPTER 2**

I dont usually believe in destiny but during my life I haven't met many soul mates. The girl I met at the psych ward is one of very few I have ever met that I believe is a soul mate destined to stay with me trough rebirth and death until the end of times as a friend, lover, sibling. If anything like that exists anyways.

Even if we dont end up together I consider us friends for life and beyond. I put this friendship above a relationship but I wont look elsewhere until we have both decided where we will go from here.

We have had a couple really good dates recently. We have met up for at least 4 very long dates of 8+ hours. We went paddle boarding one day and she paid for it. I have never tried it before but she thought it was fun.

We went bowling the next day. They had turned down the lightning that day and the music was relaxing and quite romantic. We didn't focus too much on the bowling really. We ordered a few drinks and it was nice. We just glared at each others and had some really deep conversations. I touched her face and her lips and she had her hands on my shoulders while looking me into my eyes.

On our way back we ordered some bubble tea. We shared and held hands a few times. The next day we went out to eat breakfast together. We walked around for a long time. She usually walks pretty fast so I have figured out that in order to communicate properly with her, I have to suggest that we sit down every now and then.

I showed her some of my martial art skills. One of them included grabbing her head and almost kissing her. She did the same thing back just to check if it actually worked. She showed me some bailey moves and that was honestly quite a turn on. I didn't realize she was a bailey dancer before but even know she can surprise me.

I touched her neck and she asked me if I could give her a neck massage. I did. We walked around for a little while longer until we were almost home. We sat down below a large tree and lied on the grass. I asked her to listen to a new song I had found on Spotify. A new version of Begging. So we lied on the grass for a few minutes listening to the song.

I then took a personality test on her to figure out which character she was in the Netflix series Lucifer. We both took the test. Turned out she was Lucifer's mom, the Goddess of all creation and an ENFP. I was Mazikeen, Lucifer's bartender and an INFJ.

After that I walked her home and asked her how her apartment is going. She invited me in. We were both quite tired and sat down on her couch. After she showed me around of course. It was looking nice and quite girly.

Her kitchen was painted in pink. She got stylish roof lamps and the floor was made of some fancy wood. She showed me around in her bedroom and told me she was going to toss out her bed and buy a larger one. When I left, I thought that was it for the day but she said she just needed a few hours to rest then she wanted to meet up again.

So we met up again around 9 pm and went for a walk again. It was still hot outside despite it being late. We walked for around an hour until we arrived at a quiet lake. We were all alone. We took off our shoes and tested the temperature. We sat there for maybe 20 minutes. She asked me if I wanted to go for a swim.

None of us were properly dressed for a swim. I told her to go first. After contemplating for around 10 minutes she stripped off her clothes and started swimming. I did the same thing. The full moon was shining bright.

It was the perfect moment to kiss her. It was our most romantic moment yet. It was perfect.

Its been almost 2 weeks since last time I met her and it will be at least 4 weeks by the time we meet again.

I have started studying at university again and started working out and doing martial arts again. I started getting in touch with my friends again. I found new friends at university. I play Fortnite from time to time with a friend. One time I talked with my girlfriend (she is my girlfriend at this point although we have only kissed) about gaming. She didn't do it a lot but she said that she liked Skyrim. I told her I played Fortnite and she told me she wanted to play some day.

So last week, me, my friend and one of her friends joined me to play a game of Fortnite. We won the first two games easily. It was a pretty awesome session where we played squads with my girfriend, her best friend and me and my friend. I am not sure if she actually wanted to play Fortnite but she wanted to stay in touch and it was a nice way to socialize.

She told me I should try playing Fortnite professionally since I seemed to win every game. Maybe not the worst idea but I am working on many things right now. Building a social circle, getting in shape, taking a Bachelors. She is going to go back to art school and try to make a career in making art. She is incredible. It is fascinating seeing how easily she can make a masterwork in 5 minutes.

We have agreed to start working out together. She is quite slim but workout is good for anyone so we will try to find a way to work out together soon.

We are planning on spending a week together in September. I look forward to it and I hope we can pull it off.

If romance or relationships  weren't portrayed as something so amazing by different media (movies, tv shows, novels etc.) Not saying the fact that those existing is bad, just pointing out it might give someone an unrealistic view of that the man of your dreams will show up on horseback and sweep you off your feet. Or that the girl you like in school will like you back if you woo her enough or something. 

Or take theoretically somebody who is passionate about what they do for a living, and they would do it for the rest of their life is they could. Say this person's career is something that requires a lot of practice and skill to succeed at, would said person be more happy if they had a romantic relationship and a person to come home to? Or would that be a distraction and cause their life's work to fall behind.

43,p363qv,1628793926,I’m done.,"I 26(M) matched with a girl(23F)I used to work with on Tinder on Monday. When we worked together I had a little crush on her, but I never said anything because I figured she didn’t feel the same and I didn’t want to make things awkward.

After we matched I was pleasantly surprised that she felt the same way. Our chemistry was immediate, we quickly set up a date for today at 1pm and she gave me her number. I did something I usually don’t do and let myself get excited for the date.

When we moved off of Tinder I noticed that she took a lot longer to reply. Tuesday through today we didn’t talk much at all. I didn’t think much of it as she told me she changed shifts since I left and now works overnights, because of that I didn’t really know the best time to text her. I did not want to seem like a bother and I know her job is physically taxing, so she’d be very tired after work.

So today, the day of our date roles around and the plan was for me to pick her up, I still didn’t have her address. After two days of almost complete radio silence I wasn’t feeling very hopeful. The time for our date came and went, still I heard nothing from her.

Usually the tell tale sign that someone isn’t interested anymore is that they will unmatch me on Tinder, she hasn’t done that. 

I don’t know what I did. I didn’t blow up her phone, maybe it was the opposite and I didn’t communicate enough? I’d expect this from a random Tinder match, but we know each other in real life and this one hurts a lot..",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p363qv/im_done/

46,p36ils,1628795184,Falling in love with my best friend,"Back when I was in school I was in love with my best friend. Her name was Sara. I had known her for the past two years. For me, She was the nicest person I had ever known. We were almost like a couple. Every one in our class said that it was obvious we both liked each other. Some of my friends encouraged me to propose her. But, i was afraid that she would say no and it would ruin our friendship.

In grade 9 we had prom. I asked her to be my partner and she accepted. That day was the closest we had ever been romantically. I was very very happy dancing with her. I thought things could finally go ahead between us. But nothing happened between us.

In grade 10 she had got herself a boyfriend. But, she was having problems in her relationship. I wasn't happy with the fact that she had a boyfriend but as her best friend, with a heavy decided to help her in her relationship. I listened to her, gave her advice, said not to give up on her relationship.

One day, i heard from one of my friends that sara was having an affair with one of my classmate. Every morning they would make out in the school store room. I thought it was just a rumor but the next day i saw them making out in the store room and When the class started she came and sat next to me like nothing happened.
After that day i felt disgusted with her. The kind, nicest sara i knew was all a lie. I knew i had nl right to feel that way, but i did. Since then i slowly went distant from her.
It's been 4 years but i still cannot forget her. I feel like what i did was right but, leaving her is one of my biggest regrets. Even today i have feelings for her. when i go on a date with another girl i start to have this feeling that I'm cheating on her.

48,p36wyz,1628796390,Question about “social circle” definition,"I’ve read a lot that when dating, we tend to prefer to date people that have a social circle. From a man’s perspective, I’ve read this is especially true for women when they are deciding whether to date a guy because it’s like implied vouching for the dude that they’re cool and safe.

I’m 27 and an introvert for the most part and I think realistically, I only have like 2 or 3 people that I would consider closer friends who I talk to more regularly who don’t feel like a chore to keep in touch with because we naturally vibe well and communication isn’t difficult. The rest of my friendships are more surface level acquaintances that I hang out with once in a while randomly for a night out, dinner, or a bbq or something. 

I base a lot of my friendships on communication, and those that don’t communicate much, or do their own things without thinking about me (when I frequently think of them) usually I don’t pursue deeper friendships with. I have a lot of people in my life that when we talk, it’s so difficult to have deeper or more personal conversations to the point that I actually find it difficult to picture them talking about anything serious, so these tend to stay as acquaintances.

So my question is this: when girls (and guys) say they want someone who has a social circle, what do they define as a social circle? Does my situation count where I have a few close friends and quite a few acquaintances? Or do they expect you to be close to the whole circle (which I find to be difficult and maybe impossible to sustain at most five close friendships at once)?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p36wyz/question_about_social_circle_definition/

55,p388j1,1628800418,I’m not allowed to see my girl anymore.,"about 3 weeks ago, a girl that i used to go to school with back in middle school that moved away recently moved back into town. We used to be good friends and we reconnected when she got back so we can make plans to hang out. We hung out one night and immediately hit it off. I really grew interested in her quick, and keep in mind we are both only 17. A few days after we first hung out, her mom kicked her out of the house because of a fight they got into about her not cleaning up around the house. She didn’t have anywhere to go so i picked her up and had her stay with me until the next day where i took her to her grandmas house. Her mom filed her as a runaway, and she had to get an ankle monitor and has to have it for a few weeks. She’s living with her grandma now and i’ve met her and her grandpa a few times since she’s been there. Today though, she texted me saying she didn’t know i helped her “runaway” and that it’s not best for
me to see her anymore and to not tell her she was texting me. I really don’t know what to do in this situation, as i really like this girl and wanted things to work out between us.

I know some guys complain about the fact that women need to make the first move as well. Unfortunately, this does not align with biology or reality. Women want to be chased. They want to be pursued. That is their natural inclination, as they want to be led by the guy. 

The only time women will ever make the first move is if the guy is a 10/10 greek god. Unless you look like Ryan Gosling or Jason Mamoa, the prospects for this are low.

65,p39l5k,1628804484,Bi (21M) Asking a girl out for the first time,"So, I recently came to realize that I am indeed bi, not gay as I had originally thought. I came out to friends as a senior in high school. I just assumed, or convinced myself I guess, that all the crushes I had on girls prior were just me convincing myself I wasn’t gay. 

Anyways, after exploring my sexuality at college I now realize that that’s indeed not the case. 

So that brings me to the topic at hand:

There’s this girl who works the desk at the gym I go to who I find incredibly attractive. She’s more “cute” than like drop dead super model level gorgeous if that makes sense? But cute is what I like haha. 

Anyways, I want to ask her out or at least get to know her but I have no experience with girls. With guys I just use dating apps for sex, dates, or whatever else so that makes it easy. I’ve never tried my luck with asking a girl out though. I’ve done various sexual things with a few different girls at college, but we were usually at parties and they tended to initiate everything. 

My question is, where the fuck do I begin? I’ve got a bit of social anxiety as it is so that doesn’t help. I don’t think I’m too terrible looking, average body (though improving, hence the gym lol). She seems a bit quite at first herself, and the gym is pretty small and I go like 4 times a week so I’m worried about embarrassing the shit out of myself. 

Anybody with a similar predicament/experience? Any advice is greatly appreciated!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p39l5k/bi_21m_asking_a_girl_out_for_the_first_time/

74,p3ax88,1628808759,Was this just a friendship?,"
Met a girl at my retail job about a year ago. Started talking to her and she started joining me on my breaks at work just about everyday we worked together. She immediately caught my interest as in my experience girls who are not interested do not go out of their way to talk to me or take breaks with me

Over the next 6 months i started to get to know her better in time we spent talking on our breaks. These talks would usually end up going 5-15 minutes over our scheduled break time once we got to know each other better. 

She started asking me more personal questions about my life, interests, and school. Alot more personal questions than ive ever had with any other co workers. She would ask about my family and follow up on the things I told her. 

She told me a lot about herself as well and always seemed excited to sit down and talk with me. She always wanted to know what I was up to on the weekends and told me she wanted to go to some museum once the pandemic was over. 

She even mensioned to me that she was single on valentines day and asked if i gad any plans. Then proceeded to randomly tell me that a few coworkers hit on her but she wasn’t interested. I changed the topic as i was un comfortable. 

 After about 6 months i finally got up the nerve to ask for her number. She gave it to me with no hesitation.  Texted her the next day and we texted back and forth about 6 times until i got distracted and didn’t get back to her until the next day. Texted her the next day and had to go to bed early and left the convo. 

The next day I texted her but got no response… thought i was ghosted but then texted her a day or two after and she texted back  I then asked her if she wanted to go out on a date to which she said she didn’t think she could because she had a brother with health issues and may me vulnerable to the pandemic. I thought this was her way of rejecting me. 

I told her i understood and I wouldn’t talk to her anymore. I understand how awkward it can be to be asked out and I didn’t want her to be un comfterbal. She said I didn’t need to do that as she really enjoyed our relationship. She told me to treat her the same and said a few other things that confirmed she understood I asked her out. 

Didn’t talk to her or hear from her until I saw her at work next. I tried to avoid her but that was impossible once she sat down with my on my break. We talked for an hour and the topic of that never came up. I didn’t know where I stood or how she felt about the whole thing. I decided i just needed to get over her

I texted her a few days later and asked her if it was ok if she could not talk to me at work because I needed to get over my feelings for her. I also told her I thought she was a cool person and was my friend, but I just needed some time but id like to remain friends. 

She told me that she was into someone else and I tried to convince her to shoot her shot because i thought we were just friends at this point. She agreed to being friends and I thought everything was fine until the next time i saw her she seemed very upset. 

It was not my intention to hurt her in any way, i just didn’t want her to feel uncomfterbal or anything like that. I texted her that afternoon and said it was ok if she wanted to talk to me at work again but i got no response

She seems to be aware and knows when people are hitting on her. She seemed used to it so idk why she wouldn’t just tell me she wasn’t interested. 

I went up and tried to apologize to her the next time i saw her but she wouldn’t even face me and said she just wanted to be vague. 

Today I was sitting in the break room alone minding my own business then she sat down across the room. My friend called me and after 30 seconds of talking to her on the phone, she gets up and hurries out of the break room. Just kinda weird.

TL;DR: met a girl and thought we clicked. Asked her out and she told me she couldnt at the time because of a vulnerable family member(before vaccines) and I assumed she was lying.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p3ax88/was_this_just_a_friendship/

77,p3b2w6,1628809302,Was curious and went through really old text messages on my phone. I stumbled upon a lot of the messages I had from women I met when I was casually dating over the years. I think I now know why I never been able to get a girlfriend. I am really sorry. I cringe reading the stuff I said.,"Some of the stuff I said was really mean and rude. I was in my mid 20s, then, I am now in my late 20s. My life was in really bad shape a during that time (I actually began to develop serious suicidal ideation towards during that time and sought therapy). Looking back now, it was definitely one of the lowest points in my life. I am a veteran and got had a delayed reaction with being able to adapt and transition into civilian life. 

When I got out I moved in with my best friend from the military. It was felt like I was still back in. We eventually departed our own ways on good terms and then thats when really hit me. I truly felt like I was out. I lived in a bad place and alot of the shady stuff scared me and reminded me of Afghanistan. This made it very hard for me to sleep and always kept me alert. I couldn't truly relax and feel safe. When I tried to date I was super obsessive, and took events way too personal. There was no sense of redemption. I was offended easily and would lash out. It only lasted for so long before it got to a point my mind began to brake down. I had nightmares on occasion, waking up in the middle of the night like I had just ran a marathon. It was just bad. 

With therapy I began to improve a little, but I didnt really get better until I moved. The biggest thing I learned was that I take personal blame and ignore extenuating situations. Once I moved things felt so much better, I could walk the street without feeling like someone was going to stab me. I feel like I have a good mindset now, I have recently gone through my recent plunge into dating with no success but I wasn't so hyper-aggressive and mean. I didn't take personal offense, I didnt send any nasty replies, I wasn't such a douche.

 Ironically, in COVID my mental health has dramatically improved. Because it really wasn't up untill months before COVID hit that I began to feel much better. I have been living in this weird all online world and have been the happiest I've been. I can only imagine how it'll be when things can return to normalcy.

For the ladies, I am sorry I was a mega douche. Honestly I wouldn't be surprised if some girl posted it on a subreddit. I was that type of guy and I am sorry. At least one of those guys was able to change and better himself.

88,p3btpm,1628811919,Covid screwed it up?,"So I matched on tinder with this girl.  We shared a small playful banter/foreplay at first, shared our hobbies and interests, and after 4-5 days she wanted my number since we had a lot of similar interests!  This had never happened before in my years of using Tinder.  Everything was clicking and yes, she is real.

I gave her my number, we text for a few days and I was going to ask her that I want to meet up with her, **but then I caught covid**...  This really put a damper on me to escalate to a date. 

So after telling her I caught it, we just continued texting about ourselves, but because I've been so worked up and feeling drained due to covid, I notice my texting isn't flirty, and mainly talking about my symptoms and normal friend texting... I just don't know what to do because I feel so drained.  

After another week of just chatting to know a bit more of each other, she now hasn't responded in the past 4 days now because I think I'm not making it interesting.  I did write last night asking how's her week has been going (which I think might not be a good text/sounding needy) since she hasn't responded to my last message.  

We've both learned a ton about each other in these past 2-3 weeks of just texting that I'd had to lose this one.  

Any advice on what I should do to keep the flame going until I can finally meet her?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p3btpm/covid_screwed_it_up/
89,p3bx1e,1628812240,Is there a non-creepy way to message someone you don't know on Instagram who you saw on a dating app?,"The answer to this question might be a simple ""no"" and that's fine, but I figured it was still worth asking.

On Bumble, there are a lot of people I see who put their Instagram handle and never check the app, and I realize that most of it is to grow their follower count, but if I were to message them there, is there a way to do it without seeming like a creep? Just to basically start the same type of conversation I'd have if we matched.

90,p3c0b3,1628812545,What do you think?,I had a break up with someone a while back. I thought he was just using me at the time. I addressed it to him when we were broken up he told me it wasn't about using me it was just because he was lonely. We stop talking for a while. I start trying to date someone else and he contacts me I didn't have a problem with it as I wouldn't mind still having him as a friend. He starts telling me he misses me and wants to start dating again. I told him I'm already dating someone but we could be friends. He was ok with it but would still try to get to be with him again. Fast forward I ended things with the other guy I was supposed to be dating because it wasn't going anywhere. We start talking more and start hanging out again. He told me he loved me and asked me to be with him again I told him I'd think about it. A month later I asked if he wanted to be my bf he said he didn't know yet because he was trying to go to college which I understood. He told me he was happy we started talking again and that we would either end up together or be friends with benefits or stay as friends. He told me if he ever meets someone new like a girlfriend he might still mess with me but not if it's serious like if they were to get married.,dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p3c0b3/what_do_you_think/
91,p3cgr4,1628814146,Was this a “ sign “ from this girl at the gym ?,"I went to the gym today like a hour or so earlier than I usually do so a lot of people I never see.
I worked out around this girl a decent amount. 
I was using the rope pull down area. I saw her eyeing the area so when I finished I said are you trying to use that? She said yeah I need the rope and giggles a bit, I just said go for it I’m done. Walked to treadmill and I started doing cardio.
Like 10 min later she walked by to the lockers. And like 2 min later I felt a poke on my lower back when I was walking on treadmill lol. She said hey thanks again for earlier. ( I think ) I took my AirPod off and she told me again I said no worries I saw u looking at it haha. She walked out and left I kept doing cardio.

Was this a sign that she wanted me to talk more or something ? Haha I usually don’t talk to girls at gym cus it’s the gym. Just curious because I’m not good at reading girls “ hints “.
Didn’t expect her to do that since she said thanks when I told her i was done with it.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p3cgr4/was_this_a_sign_from_this_girl_at_the_gym/

Im 29 and I mostly just work and work from home. Haven’t t really gotten back into the social thing post Covid and meeting people I’m interested is pretty much relegated to online dating.

96,p3dcmk,1628817432,Am I (23 M) on a good path to moving on?,"
My ex (21 F) and I broke up almost a month ago, mainly because she is permanently leaving the country. It’s been kinda tough, and we tried to be friends, but she kept giving me mixed signals and unjustly victimizing herself, and I ultimately cut her off. She just left today, and I haven’t seen her in a few weeks. We lived in the same building, and apparently she went to my old room to say goodbye, but I wasn’t there to answer. 

I recently connected with one of my classmates (21 F) as we have been sit next to each other in lab the past month. We talk every period and even grabbed lunch together the other day and had a really good conversation. She laughed at all my jokes, regardless of how stupid they were. It’s just the beginning of a friendship, but I have some hope it could go further at some point. She did hear me talking about my recent break up as she asked me about my ex while we were walking to lunch (I didn’t even think she overheard me talking about her as I tried to be as discrete as possible; perhaps she was eavesdropping). I just brushed it off and didn’t get into it.

I am definitely over my ex, so this girl is not some rebound. But I do want to take things slow and just be friends for sure. 

Are things looking up/do I have a shot? At the very least I have a new friend. Why did she ask about my ex tho?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p3dcmk/am_i_23_m_on_a_good_path_to_moving_on/

Even my female coworkers flirt with me, and I am dreading having to tell them no too if they are actually like that.
