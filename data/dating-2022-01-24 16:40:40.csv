I'm picky so I won't go out with anyone, I live in Spain where there's mostly people only visiting and not much people to date and there's alot of old people, but my problem is I don't get out much because it cost money to go out all the time.

I've been talking to a girl for months now and really enjoy spending time with her and talking to her. Last week we went out to play golf then drinks after and it all went well. I planned to say how I felt in person but folded. Later that evening I went out with my mates and got drunk and they convinced me to just tell her how I felt. 

I said ""I'm drunk right now but I enjoy spending time with you. I like you and want to be more than friends, its fine if you just want to stay as friends"". She responded with something along the lines of ""I like spending time with you too, and yes I agree"". She said I should've said in person and shouldn't rely on alcohol to give me confidence which I agree with.

Since that evening I've brought it up and she hasn't said much about it. Her friends know about me and I got told I should've come out with her one night to see her friends. Also, our conversations have gotten deeper and more intimate.

Since then we've been out one more time but I don't know what we are. Are we dating? or in a relationship as boyfriend and girlfriend?

Hi guys. 

Just going to let you know a bit about the back story,

Me and my boyfriend have been together for a year. I know he loves me deeply and I do too.

Recently we have had a very big fight (it started as a disagreement but he ignored me constantly, had my anxiety take over and I kept saying why am I getting ignored when you know I don‚Äôt like this) and then him stonewalling me and saying he is done.


This has happened twice before, when he sees me in person he comes to me and works with me but over text I don‚Äôt know what the hell is going on. He completely shuts down. 

I let him know I know he has last trauma which causes him to shut down and I love him and respect him. 

The problem is, it was my birthday last week and we have a trip planned this Thursday. (Something he planned) my friends are going to be joining us two nights later. It‚Äôs about a 4.5 hr drive and I didn‚Äôt want to bring this up in the last message to him cause I don‚Äôt want him to feel overwhelmed‚Ä¶but at the same time this fight isn‚Äôt that serious. He knows I haven‚Äôt done anything for my birthday in years and how much this meant to me. 

I can‚Äôt even get my deposit back and I payed 1350 dollars. 

Honestly he‚Äôs shut down and I know he‚Äôll come around with space, but I don‚Äôt know what to do. I hope to hear back!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sbzbzl/stonewalling/

16,sbzflg,1643065960,3 months of talking and 2 great dates led to a feeling of emptiness,"Hey strangers!

I (24m) recently got rejected by this great girl (23f) :(.

We met through mutual friends in september and maybe a month after that started talking. We have been talking alot these past months, and went out on two different occasions and I enjoyed spending time with her and she atleast told me she had a great time both dates. The problem is that during this past half a year I've been really busy with work and have been away from home alot. 

Now I'm having a month time off and we talked about what we are looking for in this ''thing'' we have going on. I told her I like her alot and she is a great person in my eyes. Then she hits me with the: I do really like you, but I am currently not looking for anything really with anyone and do not want to try to progress this ''thing'' further at the moment atleast. Then she said that nothing is impossible in the future when she gets her own head cleared out and knows what she wants.

I have quite alot of experience in dating, and I have had some good relationships that ended due to us growing apart or maybe just losing interest over time. I have experienced a fair share of rejections earlier and I know myself really well, these things normally don't affect me like this one did. I have the best friends I could ask for, I'm overall really content with my life. How is it possible for this one specific girl to make me feel so empty inside, over just one normal conversation one day :(

I respect what she said ofcourse, we haven't talked since as I need to back off atleast for a while if we are going to be friends in the future or I will just end up hurting more.

Okay at first I wrote soemthing that was way too detailed, so let me try again with a shorter explanation. We had a class together and we‚Äôre in a club together.

I've talked to this girl for a while, but we've never met in person. We're from different countries. We had a "" thing "" going on, at least if you believe long distance relationships are real in any way. It felt very much real to me, and definitely to her as well. 

I broke up with her a few months ago, for a bunch of reasons, but i thought i still had feelings for her. I'm sure she felt the same way, she kept telling me how she loved me and i was actually hoping we could meet and get together at some point. We fell out a few times. Fought about this whole thing, blocked each other on all social media, but somehow we always ended up back in touch. 

Now it all feels weird. I've dated other people, and i've been quite open about it. She has too, but definitely hasn't been as open, and never clearly lets me know what's going on ( i only knew she got with someone after we broke up a few weeks after their relationship ended, and we were talking and even discussing getting back together while she was with this guy ).

If this all sounds pretty toxic to you, it's because it is. So let's get to the title of the post. 

I just can't seem to let go. I'm talking to other girls, i have a date this weekend. But when i catch hints of her seeing someone else i can't help but feeling like shit, and this anger and jealousy rushes over me. The problem is, i don't want her anymore. I don't wanna be with her, i don't feel the same way i used to ( although i still care about her very much ). And yet, i don't want her to be with anyone else. I hate knowing that she has a new boyfriend, or that she's been sleeping with someone, but i don't want to get back together either, and after all i'm doing the same. She gets upset when she knows i've been seeing other people too. 

So now you're thinking "" dude, just cut this off you complete moron "". I tried. I don't know why, i just can't fully let her go. I know she feels the same. I'd like to delete her contacts and just get her completely out of my life, but i can't seem to do it. 

I don't know what the point of this post really is, i guess i'm looking for advice, or comfort, or just a space to vent.

Hi there!

For a bit of Context: 17 year old male, rising senior on summer break, hs friend group but not ""popular""

So, in october, we just formed this random ass friendgroup made by people who aren¬¥t really popular in highschool. we are the kind that don¬¥t party and stuff. We are approximately 10 in the friend group, guys and girls equally distributed. There is this one girl who I think is beautiful and has a great personality. I really have only one close friend in the group, and he tells me that although she has a nice personality she isn¬¥t so good looking, but I find her gorgeous.

The puzzle is that she is nice to everyone and will sure carry on conversations as friends with many people. And I am pretty shy, I don¬¥t talk to any of the girls in the friend group at all. Just to her every few days. We have some pretty long conversations and she actually initiated twice or three times out of like 10 times total.

BUT, I really don¬¥t know if she just appreciates me as a friend, because the whole group doesn¬¥t have many friends. I think I made it pretty obvious I like her. But I¬¥m not really getting any signal from her. Rather than texting back. So last time we texted, she initiatied and after some texts left me on delivered. Since then I¬¥m waiting on her to text but it¬¥s been 10 days. We are going to see each other soon because of group gatherings.

Any advice? From possible signals I can think off the top of my head is that she told me that she wants a bf but we were talking at a gathering, not alone. Should I text her? Should I wait?

Also, the obvious thing to do, tell her! Won¬¥t work, she is in my friend group and I don¬¥t want to screw it up.

I¬¥m obsessed with her, I can¬¥t stop thinking about her. HELP!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sc0ute/advice_dating_someone_in_your_friend_group/

I was open to the idea but impartial because he is only 21 ( I'm 26) and we live very different lifestyles ( he is a single man who likes to travel and stuff) ( I am a single mom of 2 who really just likes the simple things). Not to mention our families are close to the point we are like family and I have known him for 19 years. Reluctant I still started hanging out more. Spending weekends I don't have my kids at my moms friends place. I havent done anything to lead him on other than saying that I am open to the idea. He also hasn't flat out talked to me about it himself just threw his mom and liking my stuff on my socials. Now present day. The guy I was seeing reached out to me over the phone. He called me last night to apologize and said he wanted to prove to me that this was a mistake and that he never should've been dumb and left to begin with. Now I am conflicted because I still get twin flame vibes from this guy and my heart is screaming to give him another chance but I really don't want to hurt or upset my moms friend and her son. Plus my mom really isn't on board with me giving this guy another chance because she is afraid he is just going to leave again. Help!

33,sc1cgn,1643073928,A story for you that think you‚Äôll never find the one. TLDR: YOU WILL!!,"I‚Äôve been in your shoes before. To the people that feel like you aren‚Äôt good enough for anyone, to the people that think that they are ugly, to the people that think dating is hard/dumb, and to the people that are battling demons that making dating hard for you. This is my story and how I was in your shoes

This story is going to be long, so there will be a TL;DR at the end for those that don‚Äôt want to read through

I (21M) started dating at 15 like most people. I dated a few girls but I wasn‚Äôt sure what I wanted. I only dated 2 girls then and nothing got serious since we were young and wasn‚Äôt sure what we wanted at all. One did cheat on me but I‚Äôm not gonna be mad or blame her. I wasn‚Äôt quite sure what I wanted and while I didn‚Äôt cheat (ever. Let‚Äôs keep that as a note), I felt like I wasted her time so I had it coming. 

It wasn‚Äôt until I had my girlfriend at age 16 that I knew then what I was looking for in a relationship. Ex #1 (let‚Äôs call her Margret) was my first serious relationship. She showed me what love was, she was my first time I ever did anything, and she was the first to break me out of my shell. But I wasn‚Äôt always easy to be with. A car accident that broke my collar bone and back left me not being able to do much and my dad passing away in the next month after that accident (me and him had a very bad relationship but like all, I still loved my father, even if things were rough), it left me with a lot of demons. And it showed in my relationship. Everything seemed to trigger it and it would break me out in anxiety attacks. Whether it felt like she was trying to leave me, I broke down because I felt I wasn‚Äôt doing enough even when I was doing a lot, and not being very understanding and over protective. Eventually, Margret cheated on me with her ex while I was on a trip with some friends as they were trying to help me with some of my problems. It broke me. I didn‚Äôt date for 2 years after her. 

In between, I did what I felt was necessary to help myself. I went to therapy, I got on anxiety and depression medication, the whole 9 yards. I focused on trying to better myself

It was when I started dating ex #2 (we shall call her Julie) when I was 19. We had met at work, I thought she was cute and I asked her out. Julie hid me from her family for 3 months before she told them because of how over protective they were and she ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt allowed to date‚Äù (she was 18 but under her moms‚Äô house. They play a roll in this part). We fought a lot about it until she did. And while it relieved some of the strain and stress, during the time I was under hiding from her family, I could feel those demons come back. Even with the medicine, I could feel that they had returned. And they played a big part in this relationship as well. When her parents found out about me, of course they weren‚Äôt as mad about it as she set out to be. And that broke some of my trust. Until later in the relationship. They kept telling me how terrible I was to her (I never did anything nor started any fights. It was always her that was physically abusive to me, hitting me to the point of bleeding and bruising, and started fights over the tiniest of things whether it was I chose to not come over one night or I said the wrong thing to her at the wrong time). I felt that they were right about it all. I stayed in that relationship for a year until she cheated on me with one of my best friends. It broke me. And by the time she broke up with me, the pandemic began. 

Soon as it started, I had lost my job and my girlfriend, my usually activities outside of work were cancelled, and I was forced to move home with my mom. No where would hire me for the longest time and I wasn‚Äôt able to leave the house due to COVID. I spent most of my days for the first few months of the pandemic in my room alone and playing games by myself. That‚Äôs when I was at my worst. Eventually, my uncle who played the same games as me and a few friends from my old job reached out to me. They helped me through some rough times in quarantine and in the pandemic. They helped me get back on my feet with a fantastic new job that I am still with and going up in the company latter, help rebuild my confidence, and helped me rediscover a me that I am happy with

Fast forward to today, I met a girl last year. She‚Äôs done nothing but be happy and accepting of me. She and I never fight and we‚Äôre always happy around each other. She is beautiful, smart, talented, and has such a big heart for everyone she meets. She‚Äôs been nothing but a blessing and I am excited to spend every day with her. So much so, we‚Äôre both moving in together and unexpectedly but exciting, we found out we are pregnant with our first baby boy and he will join us in July. 

So here‚Äôs my advice: don‚Äôt rush. Don‚Äôt be in a hurry. Some people just suck, but you don‚Äôt. You are awesome, you are beautiful, and you deserve nothing but the best. If you are struggling, have some friends help you. The ones that care about the most want to see you the happiest. I wouldn‚Äôt have been ready for this relationship without my friends being at my side when I needed them most. I always found from an old movie called ‚ÄúSnow Day‚Äù a quote that is also helpful, ‚Äúlove is if you can stand to be around them for more than 5 minutes‚Äù. Find that person, you will find love within them

TL;DR: I went through a lot of lousy relationships and had some personal demons going on that made dating rough. During the pandemic, friends help me through a bunch and it helped me build up the confidence at strength to ask out my current Gf. Now I am happy and know what real love feels like",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sc1cgn/a_story_for_you_that_think_youll_never_find_the/

Should I end things?","I‚Äôve (32F) been dating my boyfriend (35M) for over six months. Most of our relationship has been great, but I noticed that he recently liked a series of selfies of a woman who lives in the city he just moved from. I mentioned this to him and asked him how he knows her, and he replied that she is a friend of a friend. I dug deeper and asked, ‚Äúare you sure this isn‚Äôt someone you used to date?‚Äù He said they never dated but that he often meets people ‚Äúaround‚Äù. What I gathered from this comment is that they are not just friends. 

I told him that I‚Äôm uncomfortable with him showing interest in other women on IG while we‚Äôre in a relationship. To me, a ‚Äúlike‚Äù on a picture feels like he‚Äôs giving her an OK to reach out and say hello (assuming they‚Äôre not speaking already). In my opinion, it‚Äôs unnecessary flirtation and a great way to keep a woman on the back burner.

After a day or so, he apologized, told me that he regretted liking the photos and that the interaction meant nothing to him. He also told me that he wouldn‚Äôt do any of this ‚Äúliking‚Äù in the future.

Me (guy in his 30s) and this girl have been chatting on a dating app for several weeks and were finally able to meet up for a fancy dinner. We ended up having sex on our first date and we spent a ton of time together in the following days. I've been in long-term and short-term relationships before, and the chemistry I have with this girl is unmatched to my previous experiences.

Our conversations range from very trivial to very deep topics, and we are consistently having a blast, flirting, etc. Our backgrounds (upbringing, ethnicity, and even our professions) are very, very similar, so we relate on many levels. Perhaps best of all, we communicate very clearly with one another.

I know it's still very early on, but so far, so (very) good. Before we even met in-person, I was fairly confident that we'd be compatible (based on our very similar backgrounds). I don't really think I'm ""infatuated"" but rather I think I could see myself really caring (and one day loving) this girl. At this point, I have no expectations but would be very happy to pursue something more with this girl.

So, I'm curious what others' experiences have been like.

52,sc2kyf,1643077393,Dating With Trauma!,"So a few months ago I posted here talking about dating with relationship trauma. There were some mixed responses so I thought I‚Äôd share an update/story on how it‚Äôs worked out for me. 

I met a guy on hinge in May 2021. We both early on established we‚Äôve previously been in long term relationships (7-8yrs) that ended very poorly. We both have relationship trauma to some degree. 

We quickly (1.5months in after seeing each other a few times a week consistently and spending 2 days away together) agreed that we wanted to be exclusive but we weren‚Äôt ready to ‚Äòlabel‚Äô it. We agreed we would delete our apps and only date/sleep with each other. 

3 months in, we traveled for 5 days out of state and after that trip a lot of my trauma kind of came bubbling to the surface. I decided to seek out a new therapist (after firing my previous one in April 2021). It was a shock to me to date someone whose actions matched their words and I felt like he didn‚Äôt deserve to be with someone who questioned him all the time. 

Then I came here and made that post about how to navigate dating when both parties have trauma. 

Through my own therapy and open communication with him, I‚Äôve grown a lot and I‚Äôve grown very comfortable in our little relationship. We‚Äôre still dating (about 8months now) and recently had a conversation about what this is. We‚Äôve agreed we‚Äôre together, and like each other (not at the point where we love each other anything) and can label it if we want. I don‚Äôt necessarily need a ‚Äòboyfriend‚Äô title but I do refer to him as my partner (that‚Äôs just my own preference). 

He‚Äôs met some of my friends and family. I‚Äôve met some of his friends. We have really got into a comfortable groove of dating and being together and just communicating very well. 

I had been feeling a lot of outside pressure from friends/family saying it‚Äôs be 3/5/7 months how haven‚Äôt you defined the relationship? Or why haven‚Äôt you met X and Y in his life. It started to become overwhelming for me and worked with my therapist on how best to navigate. 

So I guess just coming back here to say, do not hold yourself and your relationship to other peoples relationship timelines! Navigating dating when one or both parties have trauma is difficult and not everyone wants to jump into a defined relationship within 3 months of dating. We‚Äôre still learning each other and that‚Äôs OK!

Women who like to keep certain values for their future husband/So? Is this mindset dead?

I was talking to a friend about this and he said all those women are now married and my generation (I'm 18) have to accept what we have left. No disrespect to women who like to have their own morals it's your life, this is just my question really.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sc2yfr/does_old_fashioned_woman_still_exist_will_they/
57,sc2ymw,1643078497,Boyfriend back to his marijuana habits,[removed],dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sc2ymw/boyfriend_back_to_his_marijuana_habits/
58,sc2zov,1643078583,A girl from work was openly into me and I backed away from her. It made me realise my biggest problem; I‚Äôm terrified of being vulnerable with anyone,"
For as long as I can remember I‚Äôve been so insecure that I thought people just didn‚Äôt want me in my life. Friends always feel at arm‚Äôs length, with my family I always feel like the odd one out, in work I always feel like I‚Äôm on the outside looking in, and my romantic life has been non-existent; at 23 I‚Äôm a virgin who‚Äôs made a grand total of one real friend since high school. Even in college I talked to nobody. All I‚Äôve had is my old friends from school and nobody else really.

I thought that other people were the issue until recently when it smacked me in the face that I‚Äôm the problem. Specifically, I started a new job a few months back and I‚Äôve been kind of into a girl I work with. If I had to write what my ‚Äòtype‚Äô is on a piece of paper it would probably be her. She‚Äôs stunning, insanely kind but calls me out on my bullshit, she‚Äôs smart, she‚Äôs fun, we have similar interests and ways of viewing things, and for a while I could feel something kind of building up between us. We‚Äôd relentlessly tease each other all day in work and be dying laughing at things, while she‚Äôd occasionally open up about deeper stuff going on. At the very least it felt like a real friendship growing. I was definitely crushing on her, but I just thought it must be all in my head. She‚Äôs so my type that it genuinely just didn‚Äôt seem like she‚Äôd be into me in return.

A few weeks ago though the kind of flirty vibe between us was kind of getting more and more obvious. She messaged me outside of work and we were texting back and forward pretty intensely. We both had time off and she kept dropping repeated suggestions that we should grab a drink while we‚Äôre off, one day I said I had a shitty sleep the night before and she offered to drop coffees off at my place for me, stuff like that. I‚Äôve never really had someone be so obvious with wanting to spend time with me like that.

How did I respond to it? I shut off. I would pass over her comments about us doing things together like it was a joke and kind of started replying really slowly, sometimes a day or more at a time. I realised I was terrified. And it made me have an epiphany. This exact scenario, some girl I‚Äôm really into feeling the same and having a romance build up like that, is something I‚Äôve thought about over and over and over. I‚Äôve felt lonely quite a lot and I‚Äôve always craved that. But when it actually happens, when someone wants to get to really know me and spend time with me and actually be around me? I shut the fuck down, I refuse to accept it, I treat it like a joke and in all honesty probably really hurt her feelings even though I‚Äôm definitely into her too.

I feel like a fucking clown. I‚Äôve been going to therapy finally for anxiety and stuff and my therapist said it sounds like I‚Äôve just spent my whole life terrified of being vulnerable with anyone in even the slightest way and that‚Äôs where the issues come with my relationships with other people. All along it was me. I don‚Äôt let anyone in. Nobody breaks behind my emotional barrier and while some part of me wants them to, I shut anyone who tries off and hide behind jokes and humour and refuse to engage with it.

I‚Äôm so lonely but so fucking scared of anyone truly knowing me. And it‚Äôs fucked up everything. My family, my friends, they barely know anything about me. I can barely even hold a conversation with friends I‚Äôve had for years without alcohol being involved. I wasted my college years making zero friends. I‚Äôve spent years getting down because no girls are into me when the reality is people probably have liked me and like with this girl, I‚Äôve shut them down without realising. This time it was too obvious for me to hide from it thought and I‚Äôve had to face facts, and the fact is I‚Äôm a coward. I couldn‚Äôt even do the most basic human thing and openly reciprocate someone‚Äôs feelings who cares about me and who I genuinely want to get to know too, for no other reason than it scares me.

It‚Äôs just so fucking dumb and irrational and yet I can‚Äôt stop myself, and I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôll be like this forever. I‚Äôm such an anxious, overthinking, emotionally closed off mess. I just want to let people know I care, I want to be a positive impact on the people in my life, and instead I‚Äôm like a background character in my own fucking life because I‚Äôm too scared to let anyone know me, and if I keep this up I‚Äôll grow old and alone knowing I was never anything to anyone. What hurts the most is recently seeing that girl from work stop replying to me as much in return and backing away from me, knowing I probably hurt her quite a bit when she‚Äôs herself quite an emotionally vulnerable person, and knowing I done it for no other reason than fear.

62,sc3bta,1643079577,GF of 4 months says her phone was hacked.,"Yesterday afternoon I noticed her whatsapp profile picture dissappeared. Later that evening, after no contact during the day, except for a selfie before she started work, I decided to send her a text asking how her day went.  


Single ticks, messages were not going through.  


I went to send a facebook message, and noticed I was unable to send messages. Clicked the FB profile - user not found.  


I went to instagram, asked if she was okay, I could see her profile, go back to the message - 'seen', then the profile not found - blocked on IG.  


I went to call her, straight to voice mail.  


I then sent a snapchat message, saying I tried to message her but it appears her accounts went missing. No response.  


I managed to Instagram message her best friend, introduced myself has her BF, asked if she knew if my gf was okay, as I noticed her accounts had disappeared. No response to that.

I left it at that. I was worried something had happened to her, or perhaps she has having doubts about the relationship and this was her cruel way of running away.

&amp;#x200B;

I woke up in the morning to a Instagram message from her saying morning, and that her account was hacked. a snapchat selfie and nothing until about midday, to which she replied to my snapchat message of me saying Im blocked on whatsapp and facebook, that she has been busy all day, doesn't have time to look into it right now, but she is certain she has been hacked, and that some of friends were unfriended.  


  
I get the accounts being hacked, all the apps I was blocked on were facebook owned apps - so if someone got into that, and blocked me and her friends, that would make sense. But then, my number was blocked on her phone - is it possible for a hacker to get into her phone and block me on socials, phone number, but not snapchat?  


It also doesn't make sense that she wouldn't have reached out via sms or call that her accounts are down.

Tonight, we set boundaries for our break, which i'm unsure if it was right or not recovering with rules.

This is basically them: Staying faithful, following each other's boundaries (in this case it's him slowing down on his porn addiction and myself straying from drug/alcohol usage), and goals to work towards during our time apart.

I don‚Äôt really know what to do. If anyone with more dating &amp; life experience offer some advise please :)

I (26F) have been seeing this guy (25M) I met whilst doing some voluntary work. Initially we started hanging out to celebrate work milestones/completed projects. We then started hanging one on one, I didn‚Äôt think much of it because we were doing things we both liked and were just having fun.

Over a few months, I could sense he really liked me. We both got new jobs at different companies and I moved 1hr away. Previously I shut guys down out of my own insecurities, had never been with a guy before this and thought I would give this situation a chance. I wasn‚Äôt initially attracted to him physically and 3 months &amp; 10 dates+ later I still feel absolutely nothing. 
He‚Äôs not ugly or anything, he just doesn‚Äôt appeal to me. Not to sound shallow but bad teeth is one thing that dislike about him. 
In the past we‚Äôve talked about how we want to improve ourselves and he is happy with them - fair play to him I guess.

I like him as a person, we talk 24/7 but the lack of physical attraction is starting to bug me. I feel like a b!tch because he‚Äôs vocal about his attraction towards me. 
He is everything I want in a man, I just wish I could return the attraction. At the same time I don‚Äôt want to lose him because he genuinely makes me a better person and vice versa, always tells me how much I‚Äôve bettered his life. Physically, we‚Äôve only held hands, cuddled and kissed a number of times. I felt nothing when we kissed. I‚Äôve dodged the last few kisses and the thought of it kind of repulses me. On the other hand I love our cuddles and hugs.

87,sc520q,1643084859,"Asked a girl out today (failed, but takeaways)","I'm a fairly confident guy (24) who's been single for the majority of my young life. However, I try to live my life with a ""don't live in fear"" mentality and that's allowed me to be willing to put myself out there and ask people out in public. Today was the first time I asked someone out since covid started and while I was rejected, I realized a really important thing for the first time.

Asking her out was not a big deal. I understand that putting yourself out there is HARD. It can be so hard. I've done it a bunch of times and literally every time, I need to muster up the drive. But try to remember that a rejection does not change a thing. You were single yesterday, you're still single now. **Nothing has changed!** If you get rejected, and you feel bad about it, just know that it's normal. But that rejection does not change you, your situation. So don't let rejection, or the fear of rejection define your self-worth and stop you from trying to get what you want. You have nothing to lose by asking him or her out. **You're not a bigger loser or more ugly or whatever if they say no.**

But if they say yes? Congrats. Something HAS changed. You have a date. Everyone says that going for it is a Win-Win situation. This is absolutely true. You either get a date, or you get a little better as asking the next person. You lose nothing.

95,sc5dwg,1643085943,Partner doesn‚Äôt care about my feelings,"
So me(18f) and my bf(20m) have been in a ldr for half a year. He has anger issues and is super mean when he is annoyed or pissed off. He don‚Äôt even care if Im hurt when he is pissed off and that‚Äôs actually so fucking horrible.

If he is pissed, he will say mean things even if I tell him that Im hurt. I told him many times to try to not be mean coz it‚Äôs really hurtful but it never seemed to end and I guessed he wouldn‚Äôt change so easily and I tried many ways like being nice and calm when he is mean but he never stopped so I decided to be mean, when he is mean so that way I wouldn‚Äôt get hurt. But when Im mean, I just say a few curse words and that‚Äôs when Im angry but when he is mean, he says mean things about me or my feelings. So, last night we argued. My periods are due anytime soon and I tend to have problems with PMS moodiness coz it always happens and I have times when Im irritated at the slightest things and I can‚Äôt help it. Like it‚Äôs always been that way and I feel like beating someone up if they say something and Im irritated. 

Last night we were watching anime and I was already so annoyed and felt irritated then something happened in the show and I got even more annoyed and I felt so worked up. So I texted my bf and cursed the show. Then I told him Im annoyed and he was like nah the show is good but I knew I was annoyed in general so I told him again ‚ÄúIm annoyed‚Äù then he goes to talk about the show and asks if I wanna watch the next episode and I lost my cool completely and I got sooo mad and I blew off. I was like Im saying Im annoyed and he wants to watch the show. (I told my bf Im annoyed coz I always express my feelings to him and that Id feel better knowing he is there for me) so I got mad and told him he don‚Äôt care and wants to watch the show and this and that then he was like ‚Äúwhy are u annoyed‚Äù then I just had lost it and I cursed him and started saying things like he doesn‚Äôt care. (I mean I exaggerated it coz I was super pissed and annoyed so my fault) then I was like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so annoyed coz it‚Äôs period moodiness‚Äù then he said ‚ÄúI do care. I misunderstood‚Äù so before we could come to say how he misunderstood. He says ‚Äúyou are someone who gets annoyed at small things and at random shit so if u are annoyed, Idk what to do. Deal with it yourself‚Äù 


Then I just got hurt. And he just was done too. And I tried to explain my feelings and say that what he said is hurtful but he wouldn‚Äôt even read and say ‚Äúokay‚Äù so I just was so angry. I let him be. It was our 6 month anniversary so he wished me two hours after that but I was still hurt coz of what he said. It was a ‚ÄúI apologise and happy anniversary‚Äù then he was trying being nice and I didn‚Äôt wish him back. I brought up what he said earlier and he got annoyed and was like Ion wanna talk. I kept saying what he did was hurtful and he would like ‚Äúokay‚Äù like Im
Expressing my feelings and this man doesn‚Äôt care. I even told him that the cursing I did was exaggerated and not okay to do so but I‚Äôm hurt by the words be said then he goes ‚Äúu don‚Äôt even hurt me anymore. U just make me mad. Im used to it‚Äù (he has never told me that something I did hurt him. NEVER. He never expresses his emotions in a calm way. He gets annoyed and says mean things and takes time off)Then I asked him if what he said was hurtful then he goes ‚Äúmight be but that‚Äôs the truth‚Äù then I go on explaining myself and he goes ‚Äúokay‚Äù and that‚Äôs all he says. He isn‚Äôt even sorry or cares to explain it. Then I told him I will just stop expressing myself and my feelings. I told him that ‚Äúrn Im calmly expressing myself and saying what hurt me but u don‚Äôt even care‚Äù then he said ‚Äúthen stop it‚Äù then I got 10x more hurt. So I stopped texting him. He clearly didn‚Äôt even care.

96,sc5g7z,1643086164,I think we're venturing into boyfriend/girlfriend territory.,"Before I start, I'm not talking about either of the girls I've mentioned throughout my Reddit history that I gained interest in. The girl I'm talking about here is a new one. Not only that, but the chemistry between us is powerful, to say the least.

At my college, this girl in one of my classes advertised her yoga club and asked me specifically to join when I was introducing myself to the rest of the class. I assumed that she was excited about the club and wanted to get as many people to join as possible. But she asked me specifically. Later on, at a college club fair, she was there at the yoga club table. Not only did she recognize me, but her body language and word choice were screaming ""I love you!"" I could feel it in her presence and it was enjoyable. I even got her Instagram and we started DMing from there. I also joined her yoga club so she reacted insanely positively to that.

Let me just say, she is insanely beautiful, has an angelic personality, and we have great chemistry together. She really grew on me. I'm falling in love with her now.

Throughout the conversation, she made it clear that me talking to her made her feel so happy inside. I even asked her for a one-on-one yoga session with her. She was so excited that I asked her that and we talked about where it would be and when it would happen. The reason it hasn't happened yet is that she has COVID right now and has to quarantine for a while. But once it's over, we can safely do yoga with just the two of us. I think it will be an incredible bonding experience. If we really love it, we will do them more often.

Also, when I asked her if she was feeling okay after not texting her for a few days, she said that me checking up on her warmed her soul. 

When I asked her on Instagram if I could hug her as a greeting in person, things got really interesting. She told me that she's a major hugger and that I was too. We started getting really into us hugging each other by the time she goes back on campus, how amazing they feel, the benefits that come with them, and how we should take this golden opportunity to long hug each other regularly. She loved the idea, saying, ""Our hugs are going to be so powerful!!!"" I could feel myself bonding with her already.

I think we're getting real close to calling ourselves, boyfriend and girlfriend. But I'm going to wait till we had at least a few more interactions before I can safely say that.

TLDR: we had ran into each other while out and hit it off really well. Since then we talked for almost 2 months the holidays got in the way bc he left early for them and I came back way later so we were both finally in town this past week. we talked about hanging out and ended up running into each other again while out and discussed our plans for sunday then. The next day he told he‚Äôd let me know sunday (the next day the plan) and then never reached out. 


if you want the back story message me but didn‚Äôt feel like putting it all on here. I want to send something casual to just feel him out bc I felt like there was mutual interest for so long so his actions on sunday seemed out of left field. 

option A: hey, just wanted to see if you are okay? I know how covid is rn and I didn‚Äôt hear from you on sunday so just wanted to check in
