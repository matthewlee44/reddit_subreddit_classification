20 yr old male, my generation‚Äôs dating culture is trash. I‚Äôm tired of the bar dates leading to nothing, the getting-her-snap on Tinder/Bumble just for her to never want to go out, etc, and the women I‚Äôve talked to who‚Äôve actually made me feel like a million bucks have for whatever reason always been slightly older (maybe it‚Äôs the mental maturity, idk. I‚Äôve been told by many that I‚Äôm an old soul). My ex of 4 years was a year older than me, my former boss (whom I asked for + received her Snapchat after I left the job) is 24, and a girl I met at the gym who I really like (asked for + got her phone number) is 27. Both of them are fricken adorable, and I love that they‚Äôre responsible women passionate about their jobs, with a better outlook of/priorities in life than the people I interact with in my age group.
Unfortunately recently when I‚Äôve tried to text them a little more ‚Äúflirtatiously‚Äù (later at night, asking about their day, etc) it‚Äôs not panning out. My former boss is super dry (she‚Äôs always been a shy type/responded decently to me flirting in person but she just lacks any interest over snap, never initiates a convo) and my gym crush used to text me a ton, but now literally only texts once a day at like the same time every day ü§£ (if I text back, she won‚Äôt respond til the next day). After attempting for about 5 days each with them I didn‚Äôt want to ‚Äúreward bad behavior‚Äù so I stopped texting, and they‚Äôre not gonna text me anyway, so it‚Äôs a lost cause.
I consider myself decently attractive, emotionally and mentally mature, good with holding a conversation, and I‚Äôve made them both laugh more than a few times (my former boss a bit more). Is me being younger really that much of a hangup? I‚Äôm not a jackass like some of my peers can be, so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a mental maturity gap.

It‚Äôs my birthday week, I took time out to get myself an Airbnb to relax because I‚Äôm moving to a new state a few days after my birthday. I invite him over, while we‚Äôre watching a YouTube video on his phone, he gets a snap from a girl (which has happened previously and it appears to be the same girl) and he also later gets a tinder notification saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs a match.‚Äù

I also think I am an interesting enough person (though maybe I struggle to convey that in my bios). Lastly, I am looking for a relationship not just looking for casual hookups.

Which I guess include social status

A confident nerd and a confident jock will have very different lives

The confident nerd can know he's confident and love himself all day but he probably won't be perceived that way because of his nerdiness

A Jock will be confident and get a lot of positive reinforcement because he is probably sporty and that's more stereotypically masculine and indicates that probably better than the nerd can when it comes to attracting women

And right now that's kind of how I see it because as much as I go on my depressive funds I know I'm pretty confident and I have tons of reinforcement in my personal life to back that up but at the moment I am still single


Of course not everybody is the same and people have different purposes but the whole confidence thing has always confused me because most people are already like that but not everybody is perceived and treated the same way

I've been in a room where I'm the only male and I can see the difference between how all the women treat me versus a room full of different men

The man who can at least master the art of the performance of masculinity usually does better than the guys who either forego it or can't do it

I hate machismo and I can't stand conflict and I have even stood quiet before and acted the opposite of what we will think of manly man does just to test the person

Something that's always been reinforced in my life is that is that it's not really the confidence per se but what the guy does with his social life

If a guy is average but can put himself around the right people who make them look good enough and can pull off a persona that could be perceived as a manly confidence then he will do better.

A confident nerd will probably still just be looked at as a nerd.

I am not a looker and probably get fitter might help, I am 5'7-5'8 and my weight is about 140 lbs.

I did try briefly here and there some dating apps, I did talk with some guys, between the classic no response and conversation that had faded away, nothing really came out of it.

I did have some crushes, school crush or someone that I think like but I have never made a move towards them because I know how I look and I know where I stand.
I think I am at least a bit of self-aware. 

Yes, probably my bad experiences in high school where I was made fun of have not helped my self esteem and also life experiences I had gone through have not helped either. (parents got sick, so focus have been towards them). 
Also not being financially stable.

Then I think, should I ""bother"" about being with someone? I mean, what's the point? 
I do read things here, the people I know are getting married, getting engaged and then there is me. 
That's why I am thinking maybe I am just doing everything wrong. 

I don't know. Is it really worth it? 
I just keep thinking if for some reason I might even find someone, it will be draining. I have to think about another person, have to take care of them, whatever thing he might want l do have to take the consideration and so on. 
I have to admit I like being lazy. I don't have to worry about anything, I don't have to worry about anything. If I want to be lazy and do nothing I can do that. (I admit I am good in this lol). 
Anyway, am I just used to be like this? 


Through the years I have, somehow, learn to manage myself.

This is my first time posting so I apologize for any mistakes I make. 

For a bit of backstory, I (24F) have been seeing ‚ÄúTheo‚Äù (25M) for 4 months now, expect it‚Äôs been almost all virtual due to the pandemic. We‚Äôve only met in person only once due to travel restrictions (he lives in Canada), but with the border opening up and both of us being fully vaccinated, I‚Äôm going to see him this week. Now Theo is extremely sweet and thoughtful and I like him a lot. I wouldn‚Äôt call him my boyfriend, but I believe things are headed in that direction.

The issue is that I have some abandonment issues and I‚Äôm not a very experienced dater. I‚Äôm unsure what to do in this situation. My period has started and I‚Äôm off to see Theo in two days and I‚Äôm staying with him for three. I‚Äôm worried that he won‚Äôt want me to come because I‚Äôm on period, so sex might be off the table. I‚Äôm just worried that I won‚Äôt want to have sex because I won‚Äôt feel my best but he still might want to (when he first came to visit, I was on my period and we still had sex). A friend told me that I should reschedule (not really an option because of work) because it‚Äôs too early in the relationship to have this kind of conflict, of him wanting to have sex and me saying no. 

I‚Äôm trying to be progressive and think that it‚Äôll be worth the visit to him even if we‚Äôre not having sex, but I have my doubts. Is this something I should communicate to him? Is it too soon to be honest about this particular insecurity? Should I reschedule?  Any other general dating advice?

We had a lot in common so I naturally messaged her after she had added me. We talked for a bit but our talks never went anywhere productive. It stayed like this for about 3 months; we'd message for a few minutes every other week, either through her initiating the texts or myself doing so, but she almost always left the conversation before it ever managed to take off. We'd reach a specific topic, for instance, where I'd ask what her opinion was, and I'd be left on seen. Despite me having developed a crush on her, I got sick of it at one point and I muted her posts in an attempt to refrain myself from wanting to text her again. 

One day, she messages me out of the blue. This time, we talk. For over an hour. I ask her out for a cup of coffee at the end of our talk and to my surprise, she agrees. We meet 5 days later for the first time ever, and something's off. She looks the same as her profile picture, but something's just... off. The energy of the girl in front of me and the energy of the girl I was trying to text for several months did not match whatsoever. While she was dry and downright inconsiderate with her texts, she was lively and full of energy in person. But that's not even the worst of it. Before our coffee could even arrive, she had already complimented me in so many ways I nearly blacked out on the spot. An hour into the date, after having learned a bit about my background and family members, she had already invited me to go on a trip with her next month, asked me to attend guitar classes with her (since music interest and especially guitar was something we had in common), told me she'd invite me over to her place to teach me how to cook, and lastly even though there's probably a few more I forgot, she asked me out for dinner tomorrow. At the end of our date, as we walked back to the bus station, she stopped us at several street food vendors and bought us some food (which we paid for separately), and she took a selfie with me, asked for my number and sent it to me. 

When I went back home, I was overfilled with so many emotions and I wasn't sure what to feel. Happy? Excited? Scared?  I didn't sleep a second that night. The next day, we went out to dinner and the date itself was just as wonderful as the first one. We finished dinner and walked around for an hour under the stars, before I walked her back to the bus station. She told me about her dreams and ambitions and wanted to know about mine, and eventually told me we should be the pillars of support in each others' lives. She even offered for me to call her whenever I wanted and we'd hang out at a spot she picked for us, calling it ""our spot"" from now on, the spot where we could vent and connect with each other. Noticing how happy she seemed at the end of the day, I thought it was my turn to ask her out, which I did. I asked her if she was free this day next week, to which she replied: ""I don't like setting plans that far ahead since I tend to disappear every now and then. I'll let you know when I'm free"". It sounded... off? Disappear? What kind of statement was that? But okay, I thought. We texted later that night and set a date that wasn't that far ahead (in 3 days rather than a week). I also didn't sleep that night. I was equally as happy as the first time, but something felt terribly off. You know when something feels like it's going too well, but your gut won't rest? Like you feel guilty because of how happy you are, thinking that there must be a catch somewhere that I have yet to notice.  When I mentioned my experience to my close friends that night and told them that this all felt too good to be true, I was called an idiot and asked to have better confidence in myself. But no, it didn't feel too good to be true because I felt out of her league (she was extremely gorgeous, to be fair, fairing much better than me in looks), but more so because it felt fake. I couldn't place my finger on why, but it didn't feel true. She was making me feel loved when she didn't even know me. Hell, the next day I realized she didn't even ask what my full name was, nor my damn family name. I couldn't for the life of me show this much interest in my damn best friend, let alone a complete stranger I literally met right this second. All throughout our 2 dates, I felt like I was trying my damn hardest to match her energy, and all I could think of was ""she'll lose interest in me at this pace, there's no way I could hold her interest when I can't be as excited as her"". I have low self esteem in general but this was different. It felt like I was living the life of someone in a 5 year old relationship, like I was placed in the shoes of a complete stranger and told to match the pace of this gorgeous girl who was seemingly into me all of a sudden.

Just as I was waiting for the other shoe to drop, I guess it finally did. She went dead silent on my texts. We had a date set in 3 days but most of my messages were left unread, or seen and ignored, or replied to after 8 hours without any explanation.

Yesterday was supposed to be our date and the text I had sent her the night before asking her to confirm what time suited her was ignored.

I was given a taste of what true love could have felt like, I was placed in the shoes of a random man who was so loved by this gorgeous girl, I was given so many promises and invites and then it was all taken away from me in an instant, as if I had woken up from a long dream. I know that the pain won't last and that I won't really miss someone I barely know, but I'll miss this feeling she made me feel, despite it having been fake in hindsight. 

I've read up on her actions online, and I've come across a few terms. ""Mosting"" and ""Love bombing"" stand out. I think ""Mosting"" fits my situation the best, but who the hell knows. For those unaware, ""Mosting"" is when someone showers you with so much love to the point of suffocation, and out of nowhere, they just disappear without any explanation. Who the hell knows what her goal was, what her intentions were, what she gained, why she disappeared. 

Will she text me again? It's possible. I'm not really sure how to respond in case she does. I guess at this point I want closure because I'm just curious. Whatever little ray of hope I had in a relationship with her has long since died, but if we ever met again, one last time, I want to make it all about telling her a piece of my mind. I'm no fucking tool.

Dear lovestruck strangers on the internet; if it feels too good to be true, in most situations, it most likely is. I'm not saying that one doesn't deserve something extra special that comes his way every once in a while, but be cautious.

I hope doesn't get too long D:

Some context first. I and this friend of mine \[F24\] have been out and about for the best part of a year now. We have a long history behind, but we got in touch after she had a rough breakup last year. So far it's been great, we get along really well and we're very responsible regarding Covid, so we can relax a bit with each other.

However, a couple of months back I told her I would be interested in pursuing something more, regardless of how informal or casual that'd be. She told me that she doesn't see me in a romantic way, but told me she'd be Okay with a FWB-type of thing *if the mood was right and it happened in a natural and spontaneous way* (highlight for later). I was perfectly OK with this as, yeah, maybe given our history and our current state (mental, emotional...) maybe it's not the best idea.

So, flash-forward a couple of months later, and... we talked yesterday because I was having a shitty time with this. Our relationship jumps from very touchy and tender to cold and back on a daily basis, and I'm riding the emotional rollercoaster of not knowing where we are. The relationship is very asymmetrical, I believe I put much more effort into it than she does, and after yesterday it is clear to me that any possibility of physical intimacy (not even sexual, just something like a tender touch) is just that, a possibility, something that may happen once in a while *if she wants,* due to this asymmetry as I probably always will want it. This is being very negative to my mental and emotional stability and asked her if we could have some... concretions, some baseline to step on to, on what is okay and what is not (I've always had this unfounded fear of being touchy).

And no, because that'd be a casual relationship and she doesn't want that. I see her logic there, if we talk a lot, meet thrice or more a week, and have regular physical and maybe sexual intimacy... Yeah, that would be a casual relationship. And she doesn't see me that way. The thing is, without the stability I'm not interested in pursuing the FWB thing, because I will lose my mind on the back-and-forths. However, I feel like right now I cannot be with her just as a friend either because it will take me back to these two-three months where I have been lying to myself and having a bad time.

So... what should I do? My friends and rational side of the brain tell me that the best idea would be to cut comms for a little while, until I cool down and the distance wears off the edges a bit, and then we can go back to simply being good friends again without the background noise. However, she is indeed a good friend, and I don't want to lose that even for some months.

&amp;#x200B;

PS: Some friends and my therapist have asked me why I kept on with the FWB idea for so long, so I will put it here. I am... not a very attractive guy, I broke up with my previous long-time gf 2 years ago, and have not been with anyone (casual, one night, or serious) since then. And as pathetic as it may be to say this out loud, I'm fucking starved of affection, especially physical. The day we talked two months back she was my first kiss in 2 years, and the first one to caress my chest too as we were watching a movie. The carrot in front of my face was just too tempting, and I ignored my better judgment. You can call it horny if you want, there's some component of it, but I'd say it's just that I feel so fucking lonely.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,945209,public,self,"Should I cut talking, or carry or but colder?

Some context: Let‚Äôs call him J (24 M). From his appearance, you would have never guessed that was the egotistical douchebag that he is. At first he seemed like the guy that is genuine, nerdy and has it all (pre-med and public Ivy League graduate). Turns out he‚Äôs a self proclaimed mama‚Äôs boy and serial monogamist despite only wanting hookups. He apparently has never experienced failure or rejection in his life.
 
As we‚Äôre chatting, J gets candid and tells me he wants a ‚Äúmeaningful hookup‚Äù, despite him saying he‚Äôs looking for friends on the app before we met in person (He ends up contradicting himself frequently and would lie to cover his ass). I did not want to pursue anything casual and told him I only wanted something serious. J ends up telling me that he‚Äôs fine with us being friends and proceeds to brag about how he cheated on his exes. To add to this, he tells me that his best friend has actively cheated on his girlfriend of 7 years on multiple occasions. My heart went out to that girl when he continues to tell me that she is actually good friends with J and the other guys in J‚Äôs friend group. J tells me that the whole friend group was willing to hide those indiscretions from the girlfriend since they think she‚Äôll end up marrying the best friend. I found it disgusting how proud he sounded from all of this (this was also among a number of red flags). After going home, I ended up unmatching with him on the app and deleting his number.

Me and my co-worker have known each other for about 10 months and get along really, really well with heaps of common interests and great banter and we just have fun the whole shift. I've liked him pretty much since he started at work but I never acted on my feelings cause he was in a relationship of 4 years. My work friend thought he was flirty with me and I also do, but I also just thought it was just his super friendly nature, as he gets along with pretty much everyone. He also never talked about his girlfriend with me, but always did with my other female work friends. We talked outside of work too, on messenger and instagram, talking about random things and sharing videos of our common interests (anime lol). 

But recently (1.5 months ago) he broke up with his girlfriend, which he never told me about, I heard about it from a work friend and he also left work and got a new job. Not knowing he broke up at the time, we actually hung out a few times, like got lunch, went to the movies and took our dogs for walks together, all in a friendly way. But I dont know if he is into me, or if its just me making it seem like he is? In my eyes he is still kind of flirty with me, like when we went to the beach with our work friends he asked me to put sunscreen on his back and I noticed him watching me a few times (also pretty sure I accidently flashed him, rip me). He has also gotten a bit more touchy aswell, like when I was driving back he kept touching my arm, and another time when we were at the park together he poked my stomach and squeeezed my thigh to see if im ticklish. He also always hugs me whenever we hang out when we greet and say bye to each other (again this could just be due to his friendly nature).

I dont know how long I should wait post his breakup to make any moves or wether I even should if he isn't actually into me and its just my imagination. I'm quite shy and not very confident, and have never been in a relationship so am not good at expressing my feelings nor acting upon them. Whereas he is confident and outgoing, and I feel like would have no trouble expressing it if he was into me. 

From everything I've said do you think theres a chance he's into me? Should I pursue him? Give me advice please.

Like many, I've had my trials and tribulations with achieving success lately with dating, but the last two people especially I've gone out on dates with wholeheartedly led me to believe they knew what they wanted and that the thing they liked about me was that I knew what I wanted, too, when the reality was that they ultimately did not.

Initially, we aligned completely on what we were looking for. We had enough dates and discussion for me to feel comfortable opening up. We talked about everything to get a good feel of whether or not we were compatible (even the physical aspects of it all.) In one instance, she told me she had put her profile on pause because she was confident that she was happy with who she found in me, and last indication, she was excited for our next plans together.

But then suddenly out of nowhere, something completely independent of me and us dating triggered these individuals to pull back sharply. In that latter case, she went to her sibling's wedding over the weekend and after some unusual silence from her, she disclosed that it put her in ""a weird place"" and she needed to prioritize her mental health, which she was willing to share with more in greater detail since it was nothing she had previously mentioned. In the other instance, she apologized for the withdrawn communication and vaguely alluded to how something happened that caused her the need to take a step back from dating to figure things out with the risk that I may no longer be single once she did (with the irony of that statement being that I probably will be single forever when these almost-relationships keep falling apart like this.)

I am completely empathetic to mental health and personal issues, but this stuff legit seems to come out of nowhere at the peak of when everything seems to be going really great and a little further along in the dating process that I can't help but feel slighted and misled by intentions. It happens beyond that early stage when you've now started to invest yourself and your emotions into the person, and have stopped seeking out other options -- the point where having ""expectations"" seems to have been given a bright, bold green light by the other person. I am so tired of being built up, only to be disappointed as usual. 

At this point, I don't think I can believe a word any person will ever tell me again when they say they ""know what they want,"" because I know by experience how that just isn't true.

1) The first stage is attraction right? Are you attracted to the person? 
If not, you say no, move on. If yes, that‚Äôs great! 
Problem is, they must be attracted to you also. This may be judged on height, weight, hair colour or anything. You cannot control this. 
It‚Äôs a shame many people base dating straight off looks as someone‚Äôs personality is way more important to me. 

2) You look at their interests. Say you‚Äôre an athletic individual and they don‚Äôt like sport, will that work? Probably not. Back to square one.
If you share common interests that‚Äôs brilliant! It‚Äôll give you conversation starters and things to do together. 
Problem is, how likely is it you‚Äôll share the same interests? For me I love sport and music. In particular this includes football, boxing and Dance tracks. How many girls find those topics fun? Very few. Do I want to pretend I‚Äôm interested in baking and art? Not massively. There‚Äôs no point in pretending to like something for the sake of dating as that will soon come crashing down. 

3) You assess their habits. Habits can be a massive dealbreaker, especially if living together. Drinking in moderation is perfectly acceptable to me as it‚Äôs how I live. I enjoy going for a few with friends once a week/fortnight. Smoking is unacceptable. I personally couldn‚Äôt date someone who does. 
Despite my love of festivals, I have never taken drugs and don‚Äôt want to. I don‚Äôt judge those who have but again, I don‚Äôt want a partner who will. 
Being unclean is an important topic. I attempt to maintain high levels of cleanliness and dress well. If someone can‚Äôt do these then it‚Äôs a no from me. 
The biggest one of all? Manners. Manners are the basics of life and if you haven‚Äôt learnt them at my age, that‚Äôs poor. It doesn‚Äôt cost anything to say please, excuse me or thank you.
Whilst looking for love I have realised I don‚Äôt want someone who doesn‚Äôt meet these expectations. It‚Äôs difficult as most people I meet can‚Äôt do it. Am I wrong for having these standards? Are they too high? I don‚Äôt think so. You shouldn‚Äôt just drop your standards for the sake of love. 

4) you assess their personality and lifestyle.
When focusing on finding a partner you must make these points a priority. I am neither an introvert or an extrovert. I like going out with some friends to music festivals, bars, sports events etc however, I also find it difficult to socialise with others sometimes. This isn‚Äôt due to who I am but instead how I choose to be. I don‚Äôt want to deal with people who are immature or wasting their lives away. I love to go out but I also love to stay in. A single life vs a life in a relationship are mega different as I‚Äôve discovered a lot more recently. 
I like to keep a more private life but I‚Äôm proud of it. I am gaining qualifications, have a promising career ahead within a great industry, have good financial savings, can drive and a pair of supportive parents. Compared to some of those around me I feel lucky with my life. I am not jealous of their poor choices. 
Problem with all that? Everyone is different. Some people don‚Äôt care about their future, some are experiencing tough times, some are at different points of their lives. Those differences all fine but it may mean they‚Äôre not right for you. 

5) You compare your future‚Äôs or desires
I am someone who wants a relationship where the person shares experiences with me. I want to go on dates with, to go shopping regularly with, to visit other countries with, to keep fit with etc. Even small things like stay in and watch a film whilst grabbing food or Sunday walks with the dogs. In the future I‚Äôd like a place of my own and to explore more of the world whilst progressing my career further.
The problem is that not everyone wants those things. Your goals or desires may be completely different to the person‚Äôs that you meet. 
You may want to do those things while they want the opposite. That won‚Äôt work and you wouldn‚Äôt be able to make it work. It would make you unhappy and you wouldn‚Äôt achieve what you want in life. 

My overall point is that dating can be so complex that it is very unlikely to work online. You may go on dates and may meet new people however, relationships will rarely work. I believe this is due to our urge to find someone. We give up on our standards and wants just to be with another person. 

Life can get lonely but during these times I will focus on improvement. That will make me the best version of myself, for myself. If I were to meet someone I could then share my own happiness and success with them. 
Focus on you and if you find the right ONE then congratulations.

If not, you say no, move on. If yes, that‚Äôs great! 
Problem is, they must be attracted to you also. This may be judged on height, weight, hair colour or anything. You cannot control this. 
It‚Äôs a shame many people base dating straight off looks as someone‚Äôs personality is way more important to me. 

2) You look at their interests. Say you‚Äôre an athletic individual and they don‚Äôt like sport, will that work? Probably not. Back to square one.
If you share common interests that‚Äôs brilliant! It‚Äôll give you conversation starters and things to do together. 
Problem is, how likely is it you‚Äôll share the same interests? For me I love sport and music. In particular this includes football, boxing and Dance tracks. How many girls find those topics fun? Very few. Do I want to pretend I‚Äôm interested in baking and art? Not massively. There‚Äôs no point in pretending to like something for the sake of dating as that will soon come crashing down. 

3) You assess their habits. Habits can be a massive dealbreaker, especially if living together. Drinking in moderation is perfectly acceptable to me as it‚Äôs how I live. I enjoy going for a few with friends once a week/fortnight. Smoking is unacceptable. I personally couldn‚Äôt date someone who does. 
Despite my love of festivals, I have never taken drugs and don‚Äôt want to. I don‚Äôt judge those who have but again, I don‚Äôt want a partner who will. 
Being unclean is an important topic. I attempt to maintain high levels of cleanliness and dress well. If someone can‚Äôt do these then it‚Äôs a no from me. 
The biggest one of all? Manners. Manners are the basics of life and if you haven‚Äôt learnt them at my age, that‚Äôs poor. It doesn‚Äôt cost anything to say please, excuse me or thank you.
Whilst looking for love I have realised I don‚Äôt want someone who doesn‚Äôt meet these expectations. It‚Äôs difficult as most people I meet can‚Äôt do it. Am I wrong for having these standards? Are they too high? I don‚Äôt think so. You shouldn‚Äôt just drop your standards for the sake of love. 

4) you assess their personality and lifestyle.
When focusing on finding a partner you must make these points a priority. I am neither an introvert or an extrovert. I like going out with some friends to music festivals, bars, sports events etc however, I also find it difficult to socialise with others sometimes. This isn‚Äôt due to who I am but instead how I choose to be. I don‚Äôt want to deal with people who are immature or wasting their lives away. I love to go out but I also love to stay in. A single life vs a life in a relationship are mega different as I‚Äôve discovered a lot more recently. 
I like to keep a more private life but I‚Äôm proud of it. I am gaining qualifications, have a promising career ahead within a great industry, have good financial savings, can drive and a pair of supportive parents. Compared to some of those around me I feel lucky with my life. I am not jealous of their poor choices. 
Problem with all that? Everyone is different. Some people don‚Äôt care about their future, some are experiencing tough times, some are at different points of their lives. Those differences all fine but it may mean they‚Äôre not right for you. 

5) You compare your future‚Äôs or desires
I am someone who wants a relationship where the person shares experiences with me. I want to go on dates with, to go shopping regularly with, to visit other countries with, to keep fit with etc. Even small things like stay in and watch a film whilst grabbing food or Sunday walks with the dogs. In the future I‚Äôd like a place of my own and to explore more of the world whilst progressing my career further.
The problem is that not everyone wants those things. Your goals or desires may be completely different to the person‚Äôs that you meet. 
You may want to do those things while they want the opposite. That won‚Äôt work and you wouldn‚Äôt be able to make it work. It would make you unhappy and you wouldn‚Äôt achieve what you want in life. 

My overall point is that dating can be so complex that it is very unlikely to work online. You may go on dates and may meet new people however, relationships will rarely work. I believe this is due to our urge to find someone. We give up on our standards and wants just to be with another person. 

Life can get lonely but during these times I will focus on improvement. That will make me the best version of myself, for myself. If I were to meet someone I could then share my own happiness and success with them. 
Focus on you and if you find the right ONE then congratulations.

I'll try and keep this as concise as possible, but I wanted to share a field report with you all after the insanely frustrating weekend I had.


Here's some context. I quit all of my dating apps near the end of summer 2020. I wasn't having much luck at all and with the pandemic going the way it was at that time I figured I would do my mental health a favor and take some time off. 


I spent the next 9 months or so focusing on myself. Got myself some fitness gear to use at home and developed a good consistent routine. I made an instagram to share pictures of new dishes and recipes I'd make since cooking is one of my favorite hobbies. I also got myself a new phone and some basic photography equipment and spent many hours staging some quality pictures of myself doing things I like. Basically, I spent the year trying to up my game for OLD. Finally, after the 4th of July I decided to boot up my profiles again.


Now I have to say, the effort I put in to revamping my profiles was definitely not for nothing. I went from maybe 1 match a month to 1 to 2 matches per week. Still kind of depressing considering how much work I felt like I put into advertising myself but a noticeable increase in activity. 


Anyways, after a few weeks on some apps and the usual rigamarole of breaking the ice with strangers I'm trying to set up dates with, I was somehow able to line up three dates in a row with women I'd matched with. This is without a doubt the most action I'd ever seen from my time on OLD so I was pretty stoked. My dates were set for Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. This was going to be my best week ever on OLD. 


I actually got the number of the girl I was supposed to meet on Thursday. Wednesday night we were texting to nail down the details, and our conversation ended with her saying she was excited to meet me tomorrow. The next day I show up at the spot we agreed to meet and thirty minutes later I realized I was being stood up. She never even bothered to let me know she wasn't interested anymore. Cool.

Then at noon on Friday, my 2nd date messages me saying something came up and that she couldn't make it tonight but that we should definitely reschedule because she still wanted to meet. Bummer, I thought, I was looking forward to seeing you tonight, but sure absolutely let's reschedule, so I messaged her back to say that was fine. Later that evening I noticed that she unmatched me. Cool, guess we won't be rescheduling,

My date on Saturday actually bothered to show up which was nice, but I definitely feel like I got catfished. I'm guessing her profile pictures were at least a year or more out of date. I was also somewhat shocked when she first opened her mouth because that's when I learned that she was a heavy smoker with stained yellow teeth. 30 minutes into our date she asked if she could step outside for a smoke. Overall the date was tolerable but I was pretty bummed about feeling like I was being catfished, and I wish I had known about her smoking habit too. Overall just not the person I thought I had matched with.


It's just incredibly frustrating. It feels like I spent a year trying to maximize my success on these apps and my reward is to get stood up, bailed on, and catfished. I know it's only been about a month since I rejoined these apps but now I'm questioning why I even bothered to sign up again. It feels like a complete waste of time and energy. I think this might be the final kick in the pants I needed to quit OLD and never look back.

I have been in therapy for 2 years and feel a lot better about myself, I have also by any objective standard grown a lot more physically attractive in the past couple of years.

A few months ago I started on again/off again dating someone for the first time in my life. I really like her and love spending time with her but when things get intimate it's very hard for me to 'switch on' physically. I spend an enormous amount of time when we're not together fantasising about touch, sex, intimacy, but when we're together I just feel so bad at it - like I am frozen in place and like the things I do aren't really having a positive impact. It feels like most women my age value these things even more than men do so I can't imagine how she must be feeling with all this (she may also be seeing other people in order to have these needs satisfied).

I'm not exclusive with this girl. Last week I found myself in a nightclub around 6am. I love clubs because for the most part I can be invisible, just a body in a crowd with not too much attention paid to me. But at 6am there're so many less people there, and I found myself being eyed by an incredibly attractive woman. She eventually said hello to me and we spoke for a little bit. I could tell that she wanted me to touch her, dance with her, push things in a physical way. But I felt so completely disconnected from my physical side.

We left the club around 8am but I could tell that the spark was gone, I could sense she had wanted something spontaneous and fun that I had been unable to provide.

Really, the only place I can be confident is in conversation: when there's some space between me and a woman and I can rely on my thoughts and articulation to have fun with someone, rather than my body.

I've discussed this with my therapist loads and we can't really seem to find a solution. He talks about early traumas involving touch - of which there are some, I suppose - and how I can use the strong relationships I do have, with my female friends primarily, to find a way to enjoy touch safely. But I don't tend to enjoy touch with my friends all that much, to be honest, and when I do it doesn't seem to translate at all into being more confident with touch in my romantic life.

I'm 23 years old in my final year of university and still haven't had a girlfriend to date.

Been on some dates since then but they never end well, my luck is something else. ( The last girl had an allergy attack and I had to take her to the hospital :/. The one before that had a panic attack due to being incredibly socially anxious). My dates ending up badly in ways you can't imagine is a meme among my friends at this point.

Appearance-wise I'm not much to look at. I'm an Indian immigrant to Canada, pretty short (5'7), and incredibly skinny. I look better in pictures so when girls see me in real life I can see their faces going ""'oh"". Mostly never get second dates. My only redeeming feature is a good face, which they find cute but most just want to adopt me as their soft cute friend. (ugh). They never see me in a romantic light.

I have tried OLD for three years with nothing but failures till now. Even 2 of my friends who came after me got girlfriends within the span of a few months while I feel like I have been trying forever at this point. My friends who are girls can't relate, they just say stuff like, ""the right one will come along"". Approaching random girls in parks only ends up in disinterest. It hasn't happened in 10 years, don't expect it to happen in the future. I signed up for a few clubs and associations at university so I'll try there too. But other than bars and clubs where do I meet new girls who aren't already taken.

I'm 23 years old in my final year of university and still haven't had a girlfriend to date. I just lost my V card last year, and even though it didn't end well with that girl I'm still incredibly grateful to her for helping me with that. But I haven't had any romantic interactions since. Been on some dates since then but they never end well, my luck is something else. ( The last girl had an allergy attack and I had to take her to the hospital :/. The one before that had a panic attack due to being incredibly socially anxious). My dates ending up badly in ways you can't imagine is a meme among my friends at this point.

Appearance-wise I'm not much to look at. I'm an Indian immigrant to Canada, pretty short (5'7), and incredibly skinny. I look better in pictures so when girls see me in real life I can see their faces going ""'oh"". Mostly never get second dates. My only redeeming feature is a good face, which they find cute but most just want to adopt me as their soft cute friend. (ugh). They never see me in a romantic light.

I have tried OLD for three years with nothing but failures till now. Even 2 of my friends who came after me got girlfriends within the span of a few months while I feel like I have been trying forever at this point. My friends who are girls can't relate, they just say stuff like, ""the right one will come along"". Approaching random girls in parks only ends up in disinterest. It hasn't happened in 10 years, don't expect it to happen in the future. I signed up for a few clubs and associations at university so I'll try there too. But other than bars and clubs where do I meet new girls who aren't already taken. It feels like my window is closing as everyone's settling down and already had many experiences with this aspect of life and I'm so green they immediately get turned off.

Dropped out of school, long term unemployed, debilitating anxiety and depression, still live with my parents. 

I'm done a lot better in terms of anxiety and depression now, atleast it doesn't stop me from doing the things I want to do as much.

I've also recently got a job.
Still can't drive or live on my own though.

I never used to think about dating a few years ago but now that I have a job and doing better in the mental health aspect it's starting to come into my mind.

I want to make some dating profiles now or do you guys think I should continue working on myself a little? I.e learning to drive, owning a home, going gym and taking some courses to improve my job aspect.
