The reason I opened with that is so people know I‚Äôm taking care of my business and not letting relationships completely take over. As I‚Äôm lucky in those areas, I‚Äôm not lucky in dating.

I‚Äôve asked out many girls since I‚Äôve been in highschool. I asked girls to date in middle school, which they all rejected me, but let‚Äôs focus on the present for now. I asked out a girl earlier this year. We talked every once in a while on Instagram, and then we started talking more. I introduced myself to her shortly after and she said ‚Äúomg hi‚Äù in a positive connotation. I would‚Äôve stopped and talked a bit, but she was on her way to do something, I was on my way to discuss plans for an upcoming performance with my friend so I said I‚Äôd talk to her later. The next day, I asked ‚ÄúHey I‚Äôm going to get pizza Wednesday. Wanna come?‚Äù and I got unfollowed. Keep in mind, these girls are my age, 15.

Next girl was a friend I knew for a long ass time. We made plans, she agreed to them, I asked if she was still down two days before, left on delivered, haven‚Äôt talked at all since.

The next girl was one I knew for the least amount of time. We texted here and there, and I asked her to go somewhere during our first convo, she said ‚Äúeh maybe‚Äù and I gave more detail on what I wanted to do. She left me on opened. We texted once since then, when was yesterday when I asked her to show support on my newest video and she said she liked it.

Today, I asked someone out, and it went the best out of all of them despite it being a rejection. I asked if she was free next week, she ‚Äúumm idk why? and when?‚Äù and I told her ‚ÄúJust anytime next week lmao, I was wondering if you wanted to hang out or anything ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚Äù
She asked if I was going to the choir banquet we‚Äôre having soon and she said she could hang out there but she doesn‚Äôt have much time any other time. Then she said ‚Äúi can‚Äôt go no where after school n also we‚Äôre just friends so i hope u don‚Äôt mean as a date‚Äù and I played along and said ‚ÄúYeah I‚Äôm just trying to meet more people lmao‚Äù and she said ‚Äúok just making sure lol‚Äù
I‚Äôm not mad, I‚Äôm actually quite glad she was direct about it, but it still gives me a reason to just stop trying to date haha.

We've been on four dates - we mostly see each other on the weekends. For context, we've both planned two of the dates. 

I thought (and got the impression he thought, too) that the first two dates went GREAT. We spent a lot of time together, conversation flowed nicely, and we were texting outside of the dates pretty frequently. On the third date, we had sex (I stayed over his place), and he went kind of cold after that; didn't talk to me the rest of the weekend. It then went sort of back to normal before the fourth date, and then again, cold after that. For the fourth date, we just went out to eat, and did not do anything after that. That was last weekend. On Monday, he asked when we would see each other again, but we didn't plan an explicit date. So, I checked in today (Thursday) to ask if he was still interested (in order to make a plan), and haven't heard back from him, or heard from him at all, all day. 

He's said things that indicate an interest in SOMETHING with me (wanting to show me his office, that he's not into casual sex anymore, that he couldn't 'rise to the occasion' on our second date due to nerves, etc.), but then the way he goes cold really makes me question everything.

I don't know if he's seeing anyone else, but I'd have to imagine he is, since we haven't defined anything yet. For the record, I haven't been seeing anyone else; I don't really like dating multiple people at once, even though I know I should

It was very passionate and the most intimate I have ever been with another person. We tell each other we love one another. She's now been home for a month and in another two weeks she's coming back to visit me for a week. Since she's been gone we have talked sporadically. Probably 4 or 5 times on the phone, of which I either called her or told her to call me when she was free. We've had maybe one or two texting conversations that go past quick surface level stuff. I've sent her music, articles, podcasts, etc hoping to have a real conversation, but she's either really slow to respond (1-2 days), doesn't engage them much, or says she'll look at it later when she's free and never gets around to it. She even sent me a quote she liked the other day and i sent back some thoughts on it to which she didn't respond. She does contact me several times a week out of the blue saying that she misses me, sending a song, nudes, or snapchat, but it never goes past surface level communication even when I try. 

I think part of this is likely due to the age difference. Also, she's introverted (not extremely though) so not naturally one to be talking all the time. I wasn't sure what to expect communication wise when she went back home, but it was more than this. I wouldn't care as much if she wasn't coming to visit in a couple weeks. It just feels strange going from spending all of our free time together for months, talking about being in love, crying together and having really passionate moments to minimal &amp; surface level communication.

I've been seeing this girl (not exclusively) for roughly about a month now. We've been on two dates, which were both awesome. The first date resulted in me staying over at her place for the night and getting brunch together the next day (no sex, which is fine with me). The second date we grabbed drinks and went back to her place. Made to to third-base this time. She's wanting to take things slow and I want to respect that (so still no sex). I initiated the invitation for both occasions, which is expected since I am the guy... no problem. 

When we're around eachother it just flows. It feels natural and there are no awkward moments. The problem is the time between dates. We both have demanding and busy jobs throughout the day so we don't text eachother much if ever. That's fine and dandy. In the evening, there's more downtime and I often find that we only exchange 1-3 text messages that really go nowhere. I'm in full understanding that some people simply may not like to text and by no means to I want a deep and philosophical conversation. A simple ""how was you day?"" would suffice tbh.

Being out of town for about 2 weeks due to work, I gave her a call on Monday to chat. The conversation went quite well. As for the days following, there wasn't really much going on between us other than a random text here and there. Actually slower back and forths than usual, and even that was already spare. I had a phone call with her today and it was ""Okay."" I was asking her how her week has been and asked what she had planned for the weekend. I mentioned to her that I'd actually be back in town next Friday and she said that was ""exciting"". I was hoping she would've said something like ""hey we should do something"". Nothing.

I went ahead and dropped in that we should get together and do something and she said didn't know what she had planned but is overall down. I just felt this weird vibe so I simply just told her to let me know since I didn't want to pressure her. That was the end of that. 

The call was drying up, so I simply said I'd let her go and wished her a good night.

With all of that said I DO like this girl. She's very smart and very down to earth. The pain point is I'm not feeling the ""drive"" from her. I don't know if it's all just a mental thing and I'm just in my own head, but it's coming off as disinterst. But when we're on a date, its a different story. So it's somewhat draining me mentally and emotionally and I thinking of backing off a little. By that I mean not text as much, possibly text her every other day. Not call. Then regarding the invite for the date, I left the ball in her court to let me know. I think that if she's truly intersted she will get back to me mid/next week. If I hear nothing I'm basically done. Thoughts? I'm not going to drop her, but I really do need to see ""effot"" lack for a better term. I hope I don't sound selfish saying that. 

I'd love to hear everyone's feedback and advise on this. 

tl:dr: I like this girl and we click so well in person. But the time between dates is a different story. I dont feel purseud as much as I'm pursing her.

If you would like to know my story, feel free to look through my previous posts on r/crushes. Long story short, I got rejected last April. We stopped texting/talking, but we‚Äôd always talk if we saw each other at church. I didn‚Äôt start going to her church until last fall so that‚Äôs when we actually started to see each other again.

I saw her on this past Easter Sunday and she asked if I would be interested in joining their youth team as a ‚Äúleader‚Äù. I told her I may be and she said she‚Äôd text me the info to join. She kept saying that if I didn‚Äôt want to it‚Äôs fine and she understands. She sent me the info and I submitted an application. A couple weeks after that I was sitting down waiting for the service to start and she walked up to me. That was weird cause she usually doesn‚Äôt seek me out; we usually only talk if we mutually see each other. We don‚Äôt walk up to the other. She was really excited that I was interested in joining the team and she said that she may join too. Once again she kept saying that there‚Äôs no pressure to join, but she thinks I‚Äôd be a good fit. 

Her social media habits have been weird too. She views my story within an hour of me posting them, even though she used to not view them at all. And on Tuesday she liked a post that I posted at the end of March. She rarely liked my posts before. It‚Äôs not like she didn‚Äôt see it back then, she‚Äôs on Instagram a lot. Yesterday after my first time at the youth service I posted something about it on my story and she replied asking if I went. She asked me a few questions about and she was happy that I went. When I told her that the kids were really friendly and cool, she said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so glad to hear that ü•∫‚Äù. This was the first time in probably like 6 months that she replied to one of my stories.

Why is she being so nice and reaching out so much all of a sudden? I was thinking that maybe she‚Äôs only being nice so I‚Äôd join the youth team, but she‚Äôs definitely not the type to be fake to someone just to help out her church. She‚Äôs the type to just ignore people if she doesn‚Äôt like them or want to be around them. I don‚Äôt think that she‚Äôs doing this because she likes me, but I just don‚Äôt know why she‚Äôs now so different. If she did like me, I‚Äôd gladly go out with her. But after being rejected already, I would only ask her out again if I was certain she liked me back.

There is little to no empathy for men that are struggling to meet women, find connections, find relationships etc They are immediately only given blunt 'advice' and 'solutions' that they didn't even ask for, why do men need just get over issues of depression, trauma, abuse, poor self-esteem etc and somehow we're all just wallowing in self-pity and need to just get over anything bad that ever happens to us?  


It's extremely depressing and frustrating. It's like we're not allowed to just feel like we're in serious emotional/mental pain because we live in a society and culture that practically forbids men from ever expressing anything other than anger. It doesn't matter how many years of rejection, humiliation, mental or physical abuse we go through, it doesn't matter how often we feel hurt and in pain, as men we just need to get over these feelings and deal with them in private(hence why therapy is the golden ticket reply to anything regarding men; seek help out of sight and mind because no one wants to deal with it)  


I've read countless threads and posts from men here that share their struggles when trying to connect and find romantic relationships and then they're nitpicked to hell and back on how they're actually just a terrible person and deserve to live and die alone because they sound bitter and defeated and unless they conform to societal standards of physical beauty and format their personality into a highly commodified, socially acceptable personality(always positive and smiling, never showing anything remotely negative, ultra confident) then they deserve to suffer forever.  


There's a time and place for constructive feedback and advice but generally men are dogpiled on whenever they just want to vent and express their hurt/negative feelings when it comes to dating.  


Most people here are extremely insensitive and not very understanding, and it's not just here, it's a general thing in life. We're forever taught that we're never good enough as we are, and if we can't conform to societal expectations of physical beauty then we need to simply stay in our lane

I think she has a superiority complex and I confronted her about it and she got super mad at me and she‚Äôs saying she just says and does these things because she‚Äôs ‚Äúcomfortable‚Äù with me. I need to know what to do because it really annoys me and there‚Äôs so much I can‚Äôt talk about with her because of how she‚Äôll react. Here are some things that make me think she does have a superiority complex:

- Always has to one-up me or people I know

Example: Whenever I mention any of the AP classes I‚Äôm taking like if I‚Äôm talking about homework or my grades or something that happened in class she immediately mentions how the classes Im taking are ‚Äúthe easiest APs‚Äù and that my school is ‚Äústupid‚Äù and her school is ‚Äúso much harder like it‚Äôs known to be super hard and my school is so much better than urs urs is so weird‚Äù

Example 2: When I mention the sports I like or the sport my sister does she always tells me that the sport she does is so much harder and my sports aren‚Äôt even sports and they suck.

Example 3: Whenever I mention anything that paints my school in a good light she shuts me down and tells me my school is stupid and weird and hers is so much better.

- Constantly puts me and people I know down

Example: My sister recently got offered an almost-full ride package at an Ivy league school to row crew for them and whenever I talk about it with my girlfriend b/c it excites me and makes me happy and proud for my sister my girlfriend ALWAYS shuts me down and says that rowing is the easiest sport and that it isn‚Äôt even a sport and my sister got in just b/c she rows and the school she‚Äôs going to sucks and that college is a scam and tells me not to talk about it. 

- She puts down any girl I‚Äôve ever been friends with or known or even interacted with. And she tells me that basically every girl that ever interacts with me is hitting on me. Early in our relationship she would CONSTANTLY question me about my female friends and would hyperfocus on one for a couple days and cry and make me show her my texts with them and tell me that they were hitting on me when they literally were not until I blocked them and then move on to the next one and so on and eventually I had blocked every single female friend I ever had. She also makes me tell her every single interaction I have with girls at school and when I tell her stuff even just that a girl was in my group she hyperfocuses on them and looks them up on instagram and compares herself to them and sometimes she says that they‚Äôre so much prettier than she is but other times she just straight up calls them ugly and pressures me into saying how they are so ugly like it‚Äôll be like: ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs so ugly look at the wrinkles on her skin she looks like a grandma‚Äù and i won‚Äôt say anything because even tho i‚Äôm not attracted to the girl i think its mean to call people ugly and she‚Äôll be like ‚Äúso do u not agree?‚Äù in a super combative voice and then ill literally be forced to agree with her and explain why the girl is ugly or else she gets super mad and sad.


- She ALWAYS has to be right and I can never be right. And she gets super defensive in arguments about stuff that literally doesn‚Äôt matter. 

Example: We sometimes used to talk about politics which is something I am really interested in and she would tell me her opinion and everything would be fine and then I‚Äôd start talking and explaining how I have a different opinion like really calmly explaining my different opinion and then she‚Äôll get super defensive super quickly and she usually ends up shutting me up and literally tells me to stop talking.

- She rarely shows interest in stuff I‚Äôm interested in and passionate about

Example: Sometimes I send her songs I really like and ask her to listen to them and she rarely actually listens to them like I can only recall ONE time when she listened to a song I sent her. Like she doesn‚Äôt even consider listening she just straight up says ‚ÄúNo‚Äù and moves on. Same goes with really anything else I want to show her like YouTube videos or instagram posts or movies I want to watch together. She shuts me down so quick she doesn‚Äôt even look up the movie that i ask her to watch with me she‚Äôs just like ‚ÄúNo‚Äù

I‚Äôm confused tho because I‚Äôm the only one she acts like this around and when she talks to other people about me she likes to brag about my successes (even exaggerates sometimes which im uncomfortable with) so my question is does she have a superiority complex? Is it possible to have a superiority complex over one person, that person being me? And what can I do about this?

I think the conversation was getting dry because we talked very intensely about anything and everything but English is his second language and he's not exactly fluent yet. He talked a lot, and didn't ask me many questions but I put that down to nerves because I'm an English teacher and also because we've been in lockdown for such a long time. He was stupidly hot, as in I couldn't stop thinking about kissing him, and I don't think that has ever happened to me on a date before. It felt really nice spending time with him and I wanted to see him again. 

However, when I decided to leave I said ""I really enjoyed this"" and he said ""me too"". I didn't ask for a second date because the times I've done this the guys have ghosted me or have said ""you seem like you want something different"" aka you seem desperate for a relationship. I told him instead ""I'll give you a text later, is that ok?"".


So later I texted him saying how much I enjoyed the date and checking he didn't get blown away in the crazy wind. He text back something funny and asked me too. We had a few texts back and forth but they were just one sentence whereas before the date we sent paragraphs. His last message was just ""great song :) "" to a link to a song. I left him on read because I was in work, I didn't know how to respond to that, and I thought it seemed like he was just responding out of courtesy.

He confided in me and let me know that he was getting a divorce and I felt horrible for his situation. I gave him my number and we talked about our High School Days and laughed over our high school memories. Fast forward, and I then gave him some advice about moving forward, after a divorce, and of course said that time will eventually heal his broken heart...to which he responded that a heart can't break if he was unhappy for years. He then went on to say that talking to me made him feel like his ""old self"" and so that tells me he may be a whole lot emotionally devastated than he is leading me to believe.

He also said he can't sleep most nights, but he slept really well after talking to me. :/

Anyway, we ended the conversation and the very next day he sent me a Facebook message that said he doesn't know where ""this"" is going, but talking to me made him feel so good. He further went on to say that he doesn't want anyone else and that we have a lot in common, etc 

I never flirted with him!!!!

I was just being nice!!!

So, I responded back that I am not ready or willing to get in a relationship and I am enjoying the independent and single life.

But, he keeps sending me messages! He tells me goodnight, sweet dreams and he also tells me good morning every day. It does NOTHING for me!!! I am not interested in the slightest.

Then he sends me photos of what he does for his job.

And then he sent me a series of selfies...

I am VERY short with my replies and don't respond right away...sometimes leave him on read for hours.

I seriously don't want him to think I am interested in any way and am just confused how he can be so into me over 1 conversation!!

How does that equate to ME being interested?!??!?

I was just being nice!!!!!!

How is he even smitten by me to the point where he is saying, ""I don't want anyone else?!""

He sounds obsessive already and we aren't even dating. Like, if we were, and we were to break up...he would be the type to be like, ""If I can't have you, no one will!""

I am so turned off!!!

There was nothing leading up to him feeling this way at all ....nothing!!!!

Guys! Seriously!!!! Don't be like this. Especially, after one phone conversation.

P.S. We live in different states. 

Any advice on how to let this guy down gently? He's still married!!! Which is also gross. I am not trying to flirt with a married man on too of everything else..

For the past almost 2 weeks now, there's been a new girl in town, about my age, doing volunteer work at the school. AFAIK, she just goes around looking for people who need help and doing things with them, which is basically what I did the first few weeks I worked there.

One day she came in and asked if I needed any help while I didn't have a class visiting, and I just let her hang out and talk story for like half an hour. We hit it off pretty good, and now she comes and hangs out with me almost every day.

Let me tell you, she's been nice to have around. She's always got a pretty smile on her face and seems to like hanging around me. Plus, we have a lot of common interests,  so there's plenty for us to talk about. And to top it all off, she's really pretty, and she has the cutest smile when I'm around her.

There's also been a couple days where I've come in and found a bowl of chocolate chip cookies with a card from her with hearts on it on my desk. I just think that's sweet.

Anyway, yesterday I asked her if she wanted to go out on a date this Saturday, and she said yes! I'm gonna pick her up around lunchtime and take her down to the beach to hang out and spend the day over there.

We spoke almost everyday on chat (replying to everything the other person would say) for 1.5 of those 2 years, called almost daily since the whole second lockdown thing (last six months or so). She took initiative during that time to meet up and call. Which i liked and got used to. But we both decided on no labels after telling each other that we weren't seeing other people (about 6 months into this situation). Now for me no labels means I get the freedom to date her without the burden of relationship expectations that I must meet. Without feeling like am not a good boyfriend for not doing certain things that am not comfortable with. For example, introducing her to my friends. I don't want to be forced into it. She did once drop a hint about how her flatmate asked whether I was her boyfriend and then reacted kinda surprised when she thought I said 'noo' which I didn't btw. I said 'ooh' as in 'wow thats a personal question'. Anyway, I still prefer it the way it is, however I found some other dudes login details on one of her streaming accounts. But the thing is she acts very 'hurt' when I mention other women in a secual context (even if they're from my past) and jokingly tells me 'you're not allowed to date other women'. Thats fine too, am not particularly interested in dating around. But her comments do end up stifling my flirty interactions with other women cause I think am doing her wrong somehow. She has login details of her other friends on her laptop as well but this guy seems similar to me from what i can tell by my stalking of him. But way more put together. Am basically a bum by comparison lol. Even a talk about stds we had recently, she said ""where could I even catch one from, you don't have one do you?"" Implying that am the only dick she been getting recently. Moreover, in the recent past she has explicitly said am the only guy she is talking to when I joked about her 'other men'. So, my questions are:

1. Is she in the wrong for making me feel a certain way about flirting with other women, while she is possibly getting dicked by this other dude?

2. Can I then flirt with other women without explicitly telling her am back in the game?

3. Am I being paranoid and he is either just a friend who let her borrow his email/password or a friend who just met her and they kept it platonic?

Then we were texting for a month, but she didn't have time to go to a second date, apparently because of uni work. When we went out finally, it was still nice but we went to a walk with really no private place so there was no opportunity for kissing, just hugs. It was also pretty difficult to me to initiate since I need some time to get to know people to be comfortable, and it was a whole month since I had last seen her. (I'm also pretty shy when initiating so this one is totally on me) 

Anyway, she never was a quick texter, but now it feels like she really isn't interested anymore, she texts like once a day. I told her to let me know when she has time, so far no call for another date. Should I just move on? I tested the waters tho, and texted really shitty with yes and no, and then she kept on texting and asking new questions to get the convo going. What should I do?
 She is also pretty often apologizing for not having the time... I feel like moving on, but she's just somehow too nice to skip if she's really interested, and just doesn't have the time.

One day while talking (I hadn't slept more than 2 hours a day in 5 days) one thing led to another and we had sex. It was really fun.

Before doing it, we were sensible enough to talk about not running the friendship. But it's still a line that's hard to cross.

And I really came out of my shell to explore things. He was supportive.

At first it was really good, like in that moment. My brain was happy and I thought it was a one time thingy. But he wanted to continue since we both liked it.  

The thing is, I'm not a no strings attached person. While the feelings for him is not there, I really like being friends with him. 

I don't know how to politely ask him to go back to being just friends. We used to talk almost everyday anyway. 

It's is also getting very distracting not because he is but because I need to work my ear to my career. He is understanding but still.

2. Because of my size (6‚Äô3 220lbs+) people are usually scared of how I look and either avoid me or cross the street to move away from me.

3. Most women I meet expect too much from my side, and when I expect any effort from their side they either ghost me or lash out, then ghost me. And when they find out about my lack of experience they view me as naive and innocent and avoid me at all costs.

I was morbidly obese, was still living with my parents, was battling depression, was jumping from one dead-end job to the next and just didn't feel like it was fair to unload that baggage onto a potential partner.

Since 2017, I've moved into my own place, worked hard to shed a ton of weight, established a career, and am overall much better off now than I was 5 years ago. That being said, I finally decided to emerge into the dating scene about two years ago.

I meet a girl through Reddit, we talked for a bit, we ended up going on a date, and stayed in touch for a while. I lost touch with her for a few months when I went into the military, but once I got home from basic training, we continued talking on and off until late last year. She didn't want to meet in person because of Covid. I finally reconnected with her through Facebook in March of this year, just as my unit was getting activated for a multi-month mission. I felt like during this time we were closer than ever. We talked almost every day, having increasingly wholesome discussions, and were making plans to get together when I got off orders. I understand this doesn't really sound like a formal relationship, but I didn't want to rush anything since she has been through immense emotional trauma and abuse. Then a couple weeks ago she started ghosting me and I couldn't understand why.

Last night I saw on Facebook that she began a relationship with someone else several days BEFORE she stopped talking to me. I was heartbroken. Here was a woman I spent the better part of 2 years trying to win over and she just abandons me completely.

So I turn to you for advice. I've got my life on track, but now I feel like I've put myself at a disadvantage by not prioritizing dating when I was younger. Part of me doesn't have regrets because I've seen too many people I know get pregnant fresh out of high school, bury themselves in debt, and then try to start a career and it almost never works in their favor. Plus, statistically speaking relationships started that young don't last. But at the same time, it's kind of pathetic to get serious about dating this late in life.

I've tried some of the dating sites (Hinge, Bumble, Tinder, Facebook Dating). I've matched with some people, but aside from some casual hook-ups, its never amounted to anything as far as long-term relationships go. I setup a Match profile today, as they cater more to serious relationships rather than hookups, so I'll see where that goes. I'm a strong 7 at best, but I feel like it shouldn't be as difficult as it seems to find love online.

TLDR 28 y/o. Never been in a serious relationship. Prioritized setting career trajectory ahead of dating. Feeling discouraged about find love this late in life. Feeling depressed about breakup. Trying to understand why she changed her mind. Looking for input

This is my first post on Reddit so please bear with me lol I‚Äôll try to be as detailed as possible. I (24F) have been dating my boyfriend (28M) now for about 9 months. He‚Äôs overall a great boyfriend compared to my past. Early on in the relationship we started talking about things that bother us and I brought up how I think it‚Äôs weird how frequently he spends the night at his girl best friends house (for some background on this: he had sex with her a few years ago when they were roommates but it was a mistake and they stayed friends. She ended up getting a place on her own and he frequently goes there to see the dogs they got together and he‚Äôll spend the night because it‚Äôs more convenient than driving 30 minutes home after work..his words) anyways he decided to compromise and wasn‚Äôt spending the night as often anymore. More time passes and we continue to have a great relationship, he told me how much he loves me and sees a future together, he met my daughter and my family, we started going on trips together, consistent dates, and all that good stuff. He started being sketchy a couple months ago so I went through his phone. There were half naked pictures of some girl and pictures that he took to send to her, and a screenshot of a flirty text message from another girl in his deleted folder but no text messages in his inbox. He admitted to deleting messages and entertaining other girls. He apologized and said he made a mistake. He also said that with temptation comes the truth and he realized he wanted to be with me instead of them. He claimed he never met up with them and basically turned them down. I forgave him and we continued the relationship. He was aware he‚Äôd have to prove his trust to me again and definitely tried but because I was a nervous wreck still it was hard for me to believe anything. He was patient with me being jealous, insecure, and obsessive. He was still spending the night at the best friends house but it really started to get to me after awhile. I expressed my concern again and told him it made me feel uncomfortable but he told me how convenient it was for him and said ‚Äú if it‚Äôs such a big deal than just break up with me then‚Äù so I dropped it. He spent the night again and at this point I‚Äôm angry and basically tell him we shouldn‚Äôt be together if he‚Äôs going to continue to disrespect me and how he could just come to my house or go home. We ended up talking through it and I told him at the end of the day it‚Äôs his life and his decision I just hope he‚Äôd choose to respect my boundaries. He said he wouldn‚Äôt intentionally plan to spend the night anymore or intend to but if it‚Äôs an emergency then chances are he will most likely spend the night again. The other night he called after work and said he was almost home. Something just didn‚Äôt feel right so I asked him if he was really home and he flipped out. He got really defensive and said I have to stop accusing him of things. I drove to the girls house in the morning and his car was there. He admitted to lying, obviously he was caught red handed. He said he lied because he knew I‚Äôd be upset and I‚Äôm in therapy so he didn‚Äôt want to make anything worse for me. He stands strong on how their relationship is completely platonic and it is simply for convenience and how he doesn‚Äôt want to spend the night at my house often because I live with my parents. Oh and it wasn‚Äôt an emergency he just didn‚Äôt feel like driving home. At this time I told him I need some space. I can‚Äôt even process or gather my thoughts and need some advice. 

Here are a couple other red flags that I‚Äôve noticed:
1. He used to comment on my body because I needed to be ‚Äúhumbled‚Äù (I‚Äôm a confident Leo) he‚Äôd say stuff like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to lie and say you have the best body‚Äù or ‚Äúif I had thicker thighs and bigger ass I‚Äôd be a real baddie‚Äù. I‚Äôm literally 5 foot and weigh 115 pounds I never thought there was anything wrong with my body until now. I told him to stop and he did. (Trying to control me by making me feel insecure)
2. He went through my phone when we first met and weren‚Äôt even official yet (he has trust issues)
3. Manipulative (excuses and reasoning for wrongdoing, making me question myself, apologies without change, making deals with me like he‚Äôll only stop spending the night as long as I quit vaping, gaslighting me when confronted with the truth, won‚Äôt change because he feels he does nothing wrong even though I‚Äôm hurt, power move comments like I‚Äôm willing to be patient with you after he fucked up..shouldn‚Äôt I be the patient one?)

Advice on whether or not this is a healthy relationship? Advice on moving forward should we choose to stay together?
