Most of the reason is because I wasn't in a place to date in high school and in college I've been so busy with work and school that I barely had time for a social life. So I'm just now looking for a relationship and I find myself really confused I guess. 

Because of Covid I've been mostly talking to people through dating apps and I met this guy that I had a video call with since he's not vaccinated yet. And he's really nice and kind of nerdy (which I like because so am I) and we're probably going to have another call soon. It sounds pretty good but I don't find myself super attracted to him? I mean I hear my friends and others talk about crushes they have on people they barely know or just met and I've never felt that. I think I had a huge crush on my best friend from high school but that's the closest I think I've been to having that feeling. 

So because of this, I kind of don't really understand all the hype around dating. People get so excited about meeting people and talking to them and all I feel is meh. Like I see it as meeting a new person and seeing how we get along and stuff but I don't have butterflies or get excited like I see other people doing. I know I want sex and I want to hold someones hand and kiss them, etc. I think about having that kind of intimacy with someone but I don't know how I would get there?

I told her I had no plans that night except finishing off the move and that I’ll send her the address on the day and she said, “Great, I’ll let you know :)”.

Was he just not interested in me in that way?

To me, this makes no sense. Every experience I have had dating has been different because each individual is different. Even though I have had similar experiences with different people, they were still very different people. It really concerns me that people could view entire genders as stereotypes or base their perceptions of them on a few experiences. I will say it's different to me if you've experienced actual trauma at the hands at the hands of someone, and I am not talking about that. But rather, things like being rejected for a few dates or ghosted and saying ""all women/men care about is looks"" or something. To me, that is incredibly unattractive because it comes off as bitter and I would think that you're not viewing people as actual people and just assuming what they'll do because of your past experiences.

Being new in town, I use dating apps both to meet new people, and if something romantic develops organically it would be a definite plus. 

However, my experience was that most guys I met, even if they say initially that they're happy with the idea of exploring friendship, they almost always treat things on the basis of romantic prospects. So they either like me and wouldn't settle for being just friends, or don't feel attracted to me enough so they don't explore friendship, regardless of the good basis we might have for it. That never bothered me though, since there wasn't so far anything too special for me to be annoyed for losing. I also appreciate that I'm meeting them within the dynamic of OLD, so I should expect that to an extent, even if my profile clearly communicated what I mentioned. 

Nonetheless, I met a guy with whom I clicked on multiple level. that has not happened with me for a long long time. Now I do want good friends, as much as I would like to find a partner. However, my learning experience with OLD makes my expectations sway to the romantic side. We met few times, and despite we did not get physical at all, the cues I received from his body language and how he looked and smiled at me fondly for ages each time were very clear that he was into me, which I can't usually miss, as I'm normally good at reading people. Over the few meetups we had, our conversations and activities would just keep going, and the meeting would last for hours and hours without us wanting it to end.  He was also always keen to secure the next meetup immediately. I haven't had that much fun in a while, which he mentioned several times as well expressing that he always had a lovely and great time. Reading those cues, I instinctly sent mirroring messages, mostly unintended through my body language, but without trying to push or initiate anything. I was simply having fun in a relaxed way. He then started to go silent for a few days until he contacted me over text to say that although he really enjoyed the time we have spent together and feels very comfortable around me, but due to a very troubled past relationship, he does not think that he is ready for a relationship and does not want to waste my time and lead me on. I mentioned that I'm not particularly looking for a relationship and wouldn't jump into one any time soon, although I felt attracted to him. I left it with him thanking him and wishing him good. He never replied to that. 

After processing that by talking to some friends. I can safely say that I haven't developed feelings for this person. However, the level of compatibility and the quality of the time we had together was amazing. I always had close male friends, and got on very well with them. But in this new place with the pandemic and lockdowns, I haven't managed to have that yet, and I do feel like it's something that I really want to have in my life. I would really like if I could check whether there's a possibility to switch whatever that I had with him into a friendship, but I don't feel like the way the conversation had ended has left room for me to check that possibility. Going through the events again, I find myself confused to whether he is open to the idea of being friends, or is it another case where it's either romance or nothing.

For those who beared to read all this, thank you, I would appreciate any comment or input.

We met about one month ago and have been on a few dates and have hung out at my place a few times as well. On the second date and all times after she's really pushed and insinuated wanting to have sex. In past relationships I was quick to do that without getting to know them sooner and it partly led to the downfall in those relationships, of course in my experience. I've told her each time that I'm not ready or that I want to get to know her more, but she still tries and makes some moves, and I wind up feeling horrible for denying her. I mean, I want to as well, I just know it'll lead to a greater emotional connection but I feel that connection will be incomplete. Through my time with her, or maybe just with regards to her, I'm not feeling ready for a relationship as much as I thought I was.

I also feel I've learned enough about her to make me not want to go further into a relationship with her, but maybe I'm wrong for that. For instance she wants someone to manage her life and that's not something I'm comfortable doing, such as managing her money. She has mentioned what she's into sexually and its not exactly something I'm wanting in that area. She also has some form of dissociation possibly where she likes to attend events for little kids where she feels she can act like a little kid (that's fine and all, but I was in a relationship before where that went way over the top and its not something I'm wanting to be involved with again). Unfortunately I've also found she has poor hygiene in general. Finally, she is still on some kind of speaking terms with her ex enough for him to still pay some of her bills or her owe him in that regard. To me these are all red flags/things I'm not comfortable with. I'm sure she likely has issues with things from me as well, not denying that.

I know this is just from my perspective and not her's but I'm looking for some advice on how to end things properly and not hurt her.

I will say that even though we've known each other about five years we did get married pretty quickly into the relationship.

To be honest she does NOT SUCK DICK!! We have tried counseling I even asked her if it made her uncomfortable she said no. I mean sore nothing traumatic happened in her past she said no because he pretty much tell each other everything. I made sure I was good and up the hygiene. She is very big on hygiene so if there was a problem I'm pretty sure she would tell me about it because she's very upfront. Great woman great personality very precise hard worker....

 Keep in mind he hasn't done it in the past two men that she was not married to him and even when we were friends she said I would not do that unless I am married well? Now she's married and doesn't do it LOL

I have never been on a date. I'm 21 and have social anxiety and depression. Not a single date with anyone. My last and only girlfriend was back in 9th grade and it lasted 4 weeks, we didn't even talk much and we hugged a couple of times. So I don't even really count that honestly.

-----Sob story-----
-Continued- But that relationship really screwed me up because she had suicidal issues and sometimes relied on me to convince her not to 'do it', not in an aggressive/manipulative way but a wanting advice on why she shouldn't 'do it'. I'm 13 at the time and my social anxiety was at its peak, and even translates over text. The anxiety and depression and this  whole story is something that I am dealing with on my own, with a therapist and with medication. And I am getting great practice at my job.
--------------------------

All of that ^ means I haven't even kissed a girl either. This brings me to now. I am at the best point in my life physically (I've started to actually show a teeny but of muscle) and mentally (can talk better with people-still anxious all the time but better then same time last year), but still have a great deal to improve upon(I'm trying to be positive). Anyway, she approached me at work and asked if I was single and gave me her number. She was temporarily working there and it was her last day so I guess she thought she'd take her shot. This was crazy to me, I thought I was suppose to make the first move but hey I ain't complaining. So we texted a bit that night. The next day (yesterday) we spoke for hours (texting) so it was slow, had to wait for her to respond and stuff, but it was fun and engaging. We transitioned half way through from texting on the phone to...texting...on Instagram.

Basically I wanna talk more to her but I wanna get through more conversation, maybe I'm trying to rush it too much, but she's super nice. There's so many questions I want to ask her. 

----The question-----
I wanna show her I can be confident, and that she doesn't need to make the first move everytime. Is it appropriate in this generation to ask to call her to talk instead of texting? (Does this count as a first date? Would I be expected to do something special like ask her out properly on this phone call? I have so many small questions that probably I need to find out as we go along.) I'd prefer this so I can get more comfortable with her in conversation without meeting in person just yet. 

Any advice in this question or in conversation etc. is much appreciated.
----------------------------

Plus sooooo many more questions relating to the first date, but I guess that would have to wait for later if I get to that part.

&amp;#x200B;

I went to a sports bar with a few friends a couple of days ago to watch a football game between Manchester United and Liverpool (Liverpool won 4-2, I'm a Liverpool fan btw). I'm a pretty big guy (201cm/6'7"" ; 120kg/260lbs) and I can consume large quantities of beer before getting drunk. My friends are also good drinkers but one of us wasn't drinking, so we ordered a beer tower (8 pints per tower) when we got there thinking it would last until the end of the game. The first half went by pretty well but we realised by halftime that we had almost finished the tower, so we decided we would need to order another one for the second half. We were also starting to get hungry, so I decided to order some chicken bites to share. The second beer tower arrived as the second half started, but by the 60th minute of the game, the food still hadn't arrived so I decided to go investigate.

A bit of info about the bar: it's a sports bar in the UK, and at the time of going, pubs and bars were only allowed to have people outdoors because of COVID. This means that inside is really calm and quiet and you don't have to shout to be heard. Customers are usually only allowed in to go to the bathroom, as you order everything on an app or with a waiter that comes to your table.

Back to the story. I walked up to the bar and spoke to the first person I saw behind the counter which happened to be this very pretty girl that I immediately took a liking to. I told her that I had ordered some food and I was wondering how much longer it would take to arrive. She immediately informed me that the kitchen was closed so they couldn't take any food orders and couldn't make any food because the chefs had already left. She then checked the app and the orders that had been received to see what had happened to my order. It turns out my order had been accepted and paid for, but for some reason, it hadn't been processed by the kitchen and therefore had not been made. I was starving when I heard this, so you can imagine my disappointment upon hearing that I would have to find another way to feed myself. I think she noticed this too and clearly felt sorry for me, so she offered me some bourbon biscuits (British chocolate biscuits, look them up if you don't know) which I laughed off thinking she was joking. To my surprise, she was genuine and got out a packet of bourbons from her bag and handed me the packet telling me to take some. Then to my even bigger surprise, she canceled and refunded my order and then offered me a free pint of my choosing. I was proper surprised by how nice she was being and gladly accepted the free pint. We started talking a bit while I slowly ate the bourbons (they are very hard to eat when you've had beer all evening), and chatted a bit about bartending and how we both enjoy it. Then at one point, Liverpool scored and half the bar erupted in joy while the other half slumped down in despair, as the game was all but over (4-2 with a couple of minutes left). Being behind the bar, she couldn't see the score so she asked me for it. When I told her, she was clearly disappointed so I asked semi-rhetorically if she was a United fan. When she replied she was a Liverpool fan, I dumbfoundedly told her that we were winning 4-2, not realising I had just ruined the prank her co-workers had been playing all night. Her face lit with joy upon hearing this and we spoke a bit about football.

When I finally finished my bourbons, she asked me if I was interested in some sweets to which I replied enthusiastically, my stomach still craving the food I had promised it by ordering chicken bites. She told me she would bring some sweets to my table when she took her break to go smoke. Understanding the cue to vacate the bar, I headed back to my table all joyous about how kind she had been to me and the nice conversation I had had with her. As I walked back to my table, the 2 neurons in my head started to connect and I realised she might have been flirting with me.

Now one thing to know about me is I am a very shy person and I am oblivious to any signals a woman might give me and am clueless about flirting. So whenever my brain tells me there is a chance someone was flirting with me, I brush it off as them being polite and I never make a move as I am petrified of misunderstanding the situation and coming off as a creep or worse.

&amp;#x200B;

When I got back to my table, the game was over, and there were only about 2 pints of beer left in the second beer tower. My friends all looked at me and one of them asked me where I had been for the past HALF HOUR. At this point, I had registered the conversation with the cute bartender as having lasted only 5 minutes, so the realisation that I had spent 30 minutes talking to her increased the likelihood that my brain was right and she WAS flirting with me. I immediately told my friends about the past half hour and the possible flirting with the bartender, hoping they would be able to tell me if she was or wasn't flirting with me. Upon hearing my tales, they all confirmed it was very likely to be flirting, which sent my heart racing and my mind into overdrive as I tried to process what had happened and what I was supposed to do next.

Luckily, I was interrupted in my thoughts by a hand tapping on my shoulder. When I turned around I was face to face with the person that sent my mind into panic mode. She smiled and gave me a half-opened pack of jelly cherries (sweets from Tesco) and told me to enjoy them. I was on autopilot when I thanked her and smiled back as she left to go smoke a cigarette.

When I turned back to my table, my friends all smiled at me and one of them said it was definitely flirting because she wouldn't give her own pack of sweets on top of bourbons, a free pint, and a refund to someone just because she was kind and polite. I tried to process the whole situation and as I slowly realised that they were probably correct and she was flirting with me, a huge grin appeared on my face. I got back to talking to my friends and socialising, but my brain was now trying to figure out what to do next and how to talk to her again. A few minutes later, two of my friends left to go home leaving just myself and another friend to finish the two remaining pints of beer before we left too. At one point I brought up the topic of speaking to her again, and mentioned that the best scenario I had come up with was to walk up to her and give her my number and say something along the lines of ""can I repay you for being so kind to me tonight by buying you a drink?"". He laughed at the cheesiness of that sentence and told me I should just be myself because that's who I was when she flirted with me and ask her for her number before leaving. This however was inconceivable for me because I had never successfully asked a girl for her number before and therefore any time I would ever ask a girl for her number would end up the same way: rejection. I continued to mull over the idea of asking for her number and tried to find the perfect way to do so, unsuccessfully.

When we finished the last drop of liquid courage, I realised that it was now or never and I couldn't spend the next decade thinking about how to ask for her number. My friend got up and said he had to use the bathroom, and realising I had to do the same, I followed him to the bathroom. When we walked out of there, I looked towards the bar and saw her in the corner. She saw me, we locked eyes and both smiled. She walked to the part of the bar that I would have to walk past to go out and continued smiling at me.

At that point, days, weeks, months, and years of experiences where I didn't have the courage to make a move, do the thing, talk to a girl, go on a roller coaster, jump off the highest diving board, talk in front of a crowd, dance in a party or club, introduce myself to new people, and so many other situations where I lacked the courage or the will to do something came flashing back at me.

I stopped in front of her and smiled. ""thanks for being so kind to me tonight"". She smiled back and said it was her pleasure. I paused as I tried to muster up the courage to ask for her number.

&amp;#x200B;

At that moment I realised it was now or never. I realised if I don't do this now, I probably won't get another opportunity to do so and I'll spend the next decade dreaming about ""what if"" and wondering what could have been. I realised that I can't keep waiting for things to happen to me. I realised I need to go out of my comfort zone and seek what I want. I realised that the worst that can happen is she says no. And that might sound like the end of the world, but let's be real for 5 seconds. Is it really the end? All that will happen is I'll walk out of there a better and more experienced version of myself. There won't be anyone there to mock me and humiliate me. No one will film it and post it on social media. The world doesn't care about me being rejected. No one cares about it. Everyone has their own problems to deal with. I realised that all the things I hear when I listen to David Goggins, Joe Rogan, Yes Theory, Jocko Willink, James Smith, and all these other people who share their story in the hopes of helping others improve their lives and become better versions of themselves are true.

It's all in the mind. All the barriers that would stop me from speaking to someone or asking for someone's number are in the mind. Nothing is actually stopping me from doing what I want and going outside of my comfort zone to seek a better life.

So I jumped into the unknown.

""Can I give you my number so that I can take you out for a drink to say thanks for tonight?""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The 2 seconds between the end of my question and her answer felt like time had frozen. My mind raced and jumped to all the possible scenarios that flashed in front of my eyes and each one seemed worse than the previous one.

And then I heard two words that sent my world crashing down on me and everything I thought I knew suddenly meant nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

""With pleasure""

If it weren't for the fact I was in public and I don't know how to do one, I would have done 15 backflips out of sheer joy and happiness. I felt like I could run the MOAB 240 in under 1 hour or benchpress a car. I felt so light that I started to worry I'd float off into the atmosphere.

&amp;#x200B;

I collected my thoughts as I came to the realisation that she did want me to give her my number. I took out a pen from my pocket and scribbled down the 11 digits of my phone number, making sure they were all correct and legible, before handing her the piece of paper with it. At that point, I realised that her coworkers had noticed the scene and had started teasing her about it. I chuckled to myself realising that she was probably also very nervous before I asked her. She took the piece of paper and put it somewhere safe as I thanked her and said my goodbyes.

When I walked out of there, I realised how important what I had just accomplished was for my personal growth and wellbeing. I was a new man. She texted me a little later and said she'd let me know when she's free when she gets her new rota.

All this to say, the only thing stopping you from getting out of your comfort zone is your mind. No matter what happens, you'll feel better and be prouder of yourself and learn to love yourself more if you push yourself and do the things you're scared of doing.

Obviously that means no to dating and I’m not trying to wait around and orbit to see if she would change her mind, but if she really liked me will she change her mind when I start dating other people? Not in a manipulative way. Like a “you never know what you got till it’s gone,” kind of thing? I’m also asking cause I’m a bit confused, when she said that, I said, “So no dating?”, and she said “Not right now because XYZ and it’s just not the right time and...” yadayadayada (you get the jist).

Hello. 

So there is this guy down my church, a popular church in central london. A year and a half ago, we were friends, but he was rather socially awkward, he has ADHD, I thought he would struggle in party situations so I didn't invite him but others, he found out, he started avoiding me, he was friendly about it though, I apologized, we got on and he confessed he liked me. I rejected him. But we got on after, I went away for work for a year and a bit. 

I went back 2 weeks ago, I saw him, he's lost a lot of weight, more sociable, more popular with women and very attractive. Etc. I was happy for him. But everytime I try to talk to him, he's friendly but says he needs to go or he needs to talk to someone else, smiles and leaves. He sees me in the distance at church and uses the back entrance. I don't understand, I was so friendly to him. 

I tried talking to his friend Tyrone about it. I asked if he was playing games or is still into me. He said ""Get over yourself. He falls in love with a different girl every 2 weeks, once he starts avoiding someone, that's it. I think it's because of the party thing. I dunno."". The thing is he actually gets invited to parties now. 

I see him everytime since and his eyes light up when he sees/ talks to this other girl like he did with me and she's taller/ way prettier than me. I dunno what to do about it. I asked his friend if he's seeing anyone. He said ""You and a dozen other women that knocked him back have asked that but yeah I think he's seeing that girl."".

It doesn't matter if you're creative, funny, a nice person, or even if you're quite good looking (if you don't happen to have the height/confidence). Women constantly complain they can't find a boyfriend who meets their criteria, but only 15% of men are over 6 feet and many of them are total dickheads whereas  my attractive, lovely, interesting friends can barely get a date. Of course, those men are going to ghost them and keep their options open when 90% of the interest goes to these 15% of guys.

I've met this one guy who seemed so nice and with whom I felt at least some chemistry. We've been seeing each other for about 2 months now. It was a little scary to start something new, but everything felt so natural that I even slept with him pretty soon (3rd date).

I have c-ptsd due to long domestic abuse I endured during childhood, so even though I go to therapy and it has helped a lot, it's been hard trying to let someone a little closer or try to trust them even a little bit. But I tried to work towards it and my therapist was so excited about this new guy and seemed to think he would be a great guy and worth trying to trust him. But it's a lot of work for me, since I get stressed when being physically or emotionally close to people and my emotions just get blocked automatically and it's just like a void.

We met again yesterday with this guy and at one point he asked how the dating game had been for me with other guys and I said that actually I'm not really seeing other guys anymore, because I didn't feel like it. Then came the speech. He said said that it's nice that we can just hang together and not take things too seriously, and that he would be ok with me seeing other guys because he's still talking to some other girls too. He said he wanted to make it clear to me so that I won't be expecting anything from him, because he can't promise anything, but he doesn't want me to feel used. We agreed that since I have made it clear and made it clear to him again that I don't want FWB type of thing, we should steer clear of too much non-platonic closeness, unless at some point we would feel there were some feelings developing.

This conversation didn't stop him from repeatedly trying to get things going and suggesting sex later the same night. I agreed eventually in the morning, because I guess I just wanted to feel some physical closeness in exchange from feeling so emotionally detached.

But after, I started feeling a little unwell. I had drank the last night so it is possible I just had a really bad hangover. It just came from nowhere after we had finished and I just tried to lay still and not move so that I wouldn't need to throw up. He kept cuddling me and all the touch and the warmth from his body made me feel even more sick. I ended up throwing up multiple times and I felt just horrible. He was trying to help and kept asking if I'm ok and kept bringing me water and offered to go to the store for me to get something if I wanted. I just wanted to be alone because to be unwell when someone else is around just stresses me out like hell because when I feel bad, I just feel the need to withdraw and do my own thing to manage (usually dissociating). So then I just asked him to go and he did.

I do think it's possible I felt so sick because I was upset. It's happened before that when I get upset and the feelings are blocked, I just throw up. I guess I feel disappointed that even though this guy seems like a good person, he doesn't have feelings for me, except sexual feelings I guess, and I just feel so empty. It was such a big thing for me to start trying to date again and now I just feel like i don't want to try that ever again with anybody. The fact that when I was feeling unwell, there was nothing I wanted more than be alone, made me think that I couldn't be in a relationship anyways. 

I just want to withdraw back to my own head, where it's not so hard. Or at least it's hard in a familiar way.

We had the exclusive chat really early on and got on like a house on fire. 

After a few weeks went by, I started to realise that he’d lied about little things, I.e his job title, where his hometown was, exaggerating his career success, country of birth etc. I found out through a LinkedIn suggestion but didn’t confront him. 

One weekend he had an ‘emergency’ and told me that his dad had a heart attack and bailed mid date. 

He told me that he was out of town taking care of his sick father. I drove past his house (it’s an apartment block on a main road on my way home from work) and saw his car outside. I confronted him and asked whether he was in town, he admitted he was and said that he was back temporarily. 

I ignored him for a few days and messaged him later in the week asking if everything he’d told me had been lies. He said he didn’t know what I was talking about but broke it off because I ignored him for days and blocked me. 

Two weeks later I found out I was pregnant. We’d been careful and I was on BC. It was a horrible shock and I cried for days straight. I messaged him and told him that I thought he had a right to know and that I hadn’t made my decision yet. Radio silence. Nothing for over 24 hours.

It kinda clicked that my love language is receiving gifts and that's how I wanted him to love me. It doesn't have to be expensive, I just like the idea of him coming up with something thoughtful to give me when he's away. I just want flowers or a nice desert or even a playlist that he put together. 

I really have no idea how to tell him though. With other love languages I guess its easier but it feels weird saying 'I feel kinda unloved right now, why don't you send me an exciting gift'. I don't know how to ask without seeming selfish. Pls help.

Another I had arrangements to meet on Thursday for dinner. Come Wednesday she has to cancel because somethings come up. No idea if she’ll ever let me know when she’s free, but we’re still talking at least so haven’t lost all hope I guess.

Last one started out good 2 days ago. She hasn’t texted anything lately except one yesterday saying she’s busy at her last day at work.
