At last, I accepted that isn't going to choose me at all, despite saying we are exclusive and all the love yous. So I am ready now to put a stop to this effort and begging as I have tried my best to keep the relationship.

Which I really appreciate for your time and support.

I have a friend who I have known for since I was born. We're are both 27 living in different cities.

We met four years ago and the connection felt electric. He contacted me on Facebook when I got back home and we have been great friends ever since then. 

I met him before the pandemic and when I returned, I felt a new connection towards him. It took me by shock, still does. I never expected to fall for him. 

He is amazing and brilliant. Yet, he tells me that I'm the brilliant one. He is so genuine. A beautiful soul. In my eyes, there's no one hotter than him. 

 For two years I brushed it off and treated him as a friend. This year to stop myself from feeling I didn't talk to him for 4 months. That didn't work. I wanted to remove the infatuation, physical attraction. I tried everything. It's crazy because I have other people who are good and are present and interesting. He always feels like destiny.
 I finally gave in and decided to tell him. I went into literal high. Singing and dancing

We always talked every night. Many nights till morning about absolutely nothing. 

I thought he felt the same and I told him. It was s very scary decision but I couldn't hold back. Him not knowing. I told him that when we're in the same city, and ready to date, I'd like to see how it'll be with me and him. I told him that this thought in my head of me and him, I can't keep out.

Turns out he doesn't think we'd work out or click. And he was worried that I'd be mad at him and he'd loose me. His words. 

I offered to forget everything. I said that we go back to before that stupid day.

He said he wants to talk to me after i get over this feeling as he doesn't want to hurt me. And I again acted normal with great. 

But he ghosted me for 5 days. It was the longest days. 
And now he is contacting me on instagram with really cute memes. Funny ones.

I just reply normally but haven't initiated any conversation.
I don't think I can go back to normal now. The five days hurt like hell.

I kinda want to tell him that I can't be his friend. Because being friends would mean watching him with someone else and being okay. I can't do that. I know it'll hurt me. He is a kind spirit. And I love him. Every second about his thought makes my whole body act happy. 

I fear I'll hurt him, if I tell him that I don't want to be just friends with him. That when I decided to tell him, it was a calculated decision. I tried for a year to get over him and a year before brushing that feeling off.

Now the thing is that I didn't really pay him as much attention because I never met him and honestly I was just busy with other life things.

He moved to another city for work and mentioned that he might have a trip my city for work and that if I was interested in meeting then he would let me know when he was coming into town - I said ""Yes sounds cool"". Now, a few days ago, he said that he's coming into my city in like 2 weeks and asked to meet for lunch and texted me at like 8pm saying ""Hope you're doing well, just wondering if \[date\] works fine for you for lunch."" I honestly was busy with a lot of stuff and forgot to reply (and didn't really think it was an issue), but then the next day around 5pm he texts me ""I'll take it that you're not interested, that's totally okay and I wish that you just said that. Best of luck going forward"". Like what? What changed now? Anyways I deleted him from my Instagram and everything but then when I started to look into him (his Linkedin and Facebook, etc) he seems like a very very smart guy (went to a top law and business school in the US, like Ivy) and has a job that pays very well. Most of his pictures are with his mom and brother on Facebook/Instagram. I think he might be a little socially awkward and might have not that many friends because his replies are always like he's responding to a work email (who even says ""Hope you're doing well"" in text?) And honestly, I was really taken aback by his reply saying ""Best of luck going forward"", he was kind of snobbish but nice at the same time? Did he kind of reject me, or did he honestly think that I rejected him? What does his reply even mean?

Now that I had more time to think about this, I think I would like to meet him, but I'm not sure how to take this - did he reject me or if I rejected him? Because that affects whether or not I should text him and try to reschedule this. I know he's in my city for a week so that should be enough time for us to meet.

tl;dr I met this guy through a dating app, he moved to a different city and was visiting my city again and asked to meet, but I forgot to reply to his message.

It was exhausting staying up until 3am, having to go to work during the day still because my ex was having another panic attack over nothing multiple times a week. It was exhausting being in a long distance relationship, driving 8 hours every weekend to see them since I worked somewhere else and couldn't get a job there when they never came to see me. It was exhausting having to deal with my love self harming if I brought up something I was unhappy with in the relationship. It was exhausting driving there for the weekend, and having to calm them down from panic attacks all weekend, then leaving. It was exhausting having to be talking or texting literally all the time while we were awake or they would get panic attacks. It was exhausting having to almost always prove that I truly did love them because it seemed like they were always looking for ""proof"" that I didn't love them.

I loved them more than the world, and that's why I did whatever I could to help them feel better and work through things, but it wore down my body and mind endlessly getting me sick and gaining weight, and me talking about this was just more ""proof"" about how I didn't care.

The advice was about dating and this girl I like. I was looking to get advice from friends when I made the story. The thing is, one person that reached out happens to be a stripper that Snapchat I got when I went to the club one time. It’s not that she’s a stripper that bothers me, it’s the fact that I was interested in hanging out with her at one point, actually a year ago. It never happened but my intention was to hang out with her in the past. So my question is should I feel guilty about receiving advice from someone that I tried getting with in the past? Is that a reason to feel bad? Please help.

Hello everyone, the reason I’m asking this because the girl I’m talking to wasn’t too fond of the idea that I replied to her. I tried explaining that it was just friendly advice and she had a boyfriend anyway. When the girl replied to my story and offered advice, it was one week after I met the girl I like on Tinder. So we were like only in the talking phase anyway. She wasn’t buying it but then eventually apologized and later admitted we weren’t claimed to each other so she didn’t have the right to get mad. But yet I still feel a lot of guilt for whatever reason. I guess cause I upset her and it wasn’t my intention. I also made it clear that since I met this girl, she’s been the only girl I’ve been talking to, I haven’t even explored talking to new people. I did stop messaging her after I replied once explaining my situation to her (the dancer). Am I wrong for feeling guilt or is it justified meaning she had a reason to be upset? And of course, had we been in a relationship or gotten very serious I wouldn’t even try to get multiple peoples perspectives on this subject. I would just keep it between us 2 to work out or I would only contact people close to such as close friends or family. But it was strictly just dating advice. Also I’d like to add that the dancer and I literally never talk, only time we communicated in the past was like 3 times and that was only to see when she was working. This was the first time we actually had a talk, like a normal chat other than when she was working and she came to me to try to help. I also said if she tried to pull anything more than advice I would of just said fuck off and block her. So what do you guys think, should I feel guilty?

If the roles were reversed and she was seeking advice and a guy she use to talk to offered to help, I wouldn’t mind because it’s only advice. If it was more than that then of course I’d be upset and she had the right to be upset too if my situation was like that but it wasn’t. Or if even she went to an ex or someone she hooked up with. Then maybe I might feel a little off about it. But if it’s just something like you guys tried getting together and whatever reason it just didn’t happen and just acquaintances, I wouldn’t care

He gave a time and meeting to meet today at 7 by a landmark, but he didn't say what we would be doing. He mentioned he knows a few places he can take me for drinks, and maybe dinner. I get the low effort vibe from him, but whatever. Anyway I send the last message yesterday at noon. I don't receive a response, and I don't hear anything from him all day today. Fine, whatever, I head on my commute home and go about my evening. 

And then at 6:42, he messages me to say he's running late. What? He doesn't speak to me for 29 hours after my last message and he expects me to still turn up? LIke what? I text back within a couple of minutes, that no since he didn't respond to my text, nor having heard from him all day, that I headed home after work. 

He calls me, and he's arguing with me. He's saying well he confirmed the time with me, and it doesn't matter that he didn't respond to my message or contact me all day. Apparently he sticks to his word, and I should have known he would. I'm like, you're a stranger and I know nothing about you, but you did leave me on read. The tone is unpleasant, he keeps shouting my name and talking over me, and I tell him I'm not interested in meeting him. He argues with me for five minutes, using a super aggressive and patronising tone saying that I am being unreasonable, that he's been travelling and that I should know that he meant what he said. OK? He says he will travel to where I am, and I tell him no. The tone that he's used is not for me. Whatever, I say, I tell him to have a nice evening, and I hang up to walk the rest of the distance to my home. 

By the time I get there, I see he's left me 4 missed calls. I pick up the 5th, and ask what's up. He's still using an incredibly aggressive and patronising tone towards me. He keeps talking over me, shouting my name. And eventually I just had enough, I told him again, you left me on read, for over 29 hours you ignored me and decided not to confirm. And now you want me to meet a man who acts like this. I mention the recent murder of a woman by a stranger in London and that I'm already on edge, that women live with this fear and I'm freaked out. He accuses me of screaming at him, I was like ""I'm calm, me talking to you is not screaming, you're being irrational"" - but it was another red flag that he labels anyone woman who can't be assed with his shit as screaming. Like he's called me a bunch of times after a silence for 29 hours without any solid plans or bookings in place, and now I'm being unreasonable because I've got a boundary. And he shouts at me, ""I'm calm, you're just screaming at me"". 

So he tells me to never contact him again (no shit) hangs up and blocks me.

Men have to go through dozens of not hundreds of women to find one compatible relationships all in favor of getting dumped a few months later for making one mistake. Women have to weed through all the fake people and men who just lie to get sex. 

Much of todays dating feels heavily influenced by social media and dating apps that it’s almost impossible to find genuine connections with people who want the same thing; COViD didn’t in this regard very much either. Instead of focusing on how we make each other feel, it’s about always finding the next best guy or the next best gal. Who makes the most money, who’s the best looking, who has a boat, who can give me this superficial social status perpetuated my social media. 

Worst of all is this idea that all we look for are red flags 🚩 instead of just trying to get know people. We focus so much of our attention on looking for the tiniest of reasons to leave someone instead of working through hard situations. 

Even if you do manage to maneuver through todays world of dating and find your love, studies show half of all marriages end in divorce in less than 10 years and then you go right back on the chopping block. 

All I’m trying to say is todays world is way to shallow. My parents got married after dating for 9 months back in the day and have been married for over 35 years now happy.

 I've been in this friend group for 4 years or so, and I feel great hanging out with them, but I started having something towards this girl I'll kindly refer to as A lol.
 
 A is super attractive, and I've been in the lucky position of noticing how she's kinda into me, even if it's just a little. Me and A flirted for like 3 months before the first time we made out. This event was before the pandemic, and  we ended up not speaking to each other for some time.

 We started speaking again, and the attraction returned at some point, so much so we kissed the first time we could meet each other. I'm really into her, like REALLY. For the first time in my life I have a hard time looking at other people and finding them appealing, because of how much my feelings for A distract me.

 What I haven't mentioned is the fact that her friend, B, was in the same circle of friends all of this time. B was always a nice person and a good friend (best friend of A, btw) and recently I found out B likes me.
 
 I don't like B the same way she likes me, but I don't want to hurt her. The thing is: A knows that B likes me, and when I asked a third friend about advice, they were really sure that A wasn't going to try anything because of B, so I should give up. Even if in the week before, A said to me in message she wanted to be with me again.

 B knows there is something going on between me and A, and she insists on hitting on me, probably because she thought I was flirting back when I was just trying to be nice. She caught me and A together for god's sake! That kinda pisses me off.

 The thing is, I'm definitely not certain that if I continued trying for an official relationship with A, this would work out, probably because I like her more than she likes me (she may like me, I think I l*ve her), and we would feel guilty about B. So, preserving their friendship and my sanity, I decided to slowly drift apart from the group. Did I make the right decision? I can definitely go back, this happened this week.

We're all barely adults, which is why I'm so inexperienced. A and B are girls, I'm a dude.

My biggest thing is I need clear interest shown, if I have to second guess it I’m already halfway out the door. When I like someone I want to talk to them, I want to see them, I want to connect. I want somebody on that same level. 

When it comes to texting - if you can go 24 hours without talking to me or responding, go even longer. When I’m seeing someone, especially early stages, regular texting is huge for me to continue to develop my attraction. I have a life too, but if it’s been a day of no contact, it’s not for me. 

Other standards are the usual - clean, respectful, kind etc. but I’m wondering if these 2 things are “too much”? 

I don’t demand it, and I’ll happily compromise, but if I’ve told them those things are important to me and they don’t make SOME effort, I’ll leave.

So this summer i went on a little Europe tour, and ended up meeting this pretty attractive guy local to that city. The first night we met we hung out in a group setting with his best friend and my best friend. Long story short that night we ended up making out. I didn't think much of him as a ""potential"" as i was living in the moment and enjoying the time. However the next day he asked to take me on a date, and i'm not gonna lie the date was amazing, we got on really well. My friend and I were leaving that country the next day and moving onto the next destination on our trip, so once again i didn't read much into it and just thought of the situation as casual, some good memories and maybe we'd keep in touch every now and then.

Well turns out from the time I left, him and I started naturally texting everyday non stop. The texts were flirty, fun, and we were really getting to know each other. My friend and I had decided to go back to his town for a couple days at the end of our trip as we didn't get enough of it the first time. (beautiful town with amazing beaches.) From the first time we met, until the time we had gone back to revisit it had been over a month of non stop texting everyday.

When we went back to visit, I ended up spending pretty much everyday together for about 5 days. He took me on romantic dates, went to the beach, etc. I felt really comfortable around him and really liked a lot of his qualities, the vibe we had in person was great. And I could tell he felt the same way with a genuine interest, I didn't really find any red flags. (We also never had sex, as that is not my thing and i told him that and he respected it.)

The problem was that i live on the other side of the world to him and my trip was coming to an end, he had told me that he never spoke to someone from a distance before and usually if he meets a girl that lives far away he'll just leave it, not even try to pursue it but told me with me it was different. Before I left he got me amazing gifts, a perfume with our initials engraved into it and he wrote a card and printed our pictures out, etc it was very thoughtful. He told me that he would come visit me where i live in a few months, and that he couldn't wait to see me again.

Well now the issue is, when i got back home we still had been texting everyday non stop since i met him i don't think there was a day where we weren't texting. That continued when i got back for about a month, and then started to drop off. It started to bother me, so I decided to communicate to him that i was confused by the change in his habits, and if he had lost interest he should say so. He reassured me that he didn't lose interest he very much likes me and that he is a really disorganized person and can never find the right time to text back, he forgets etc. I told him that i am not much of a texter either and that we can always just speak on the phone every now and then instead. (I dont think he likes talking on the phone much as he didn't say anything about this.) He promised to put more effort, and he did for a little while, and it fell off again. His best friend and my best friend were still in touch, and his friend also told me that he is just like that, and he will even take forever to respond to him too. So it made me feel better that he is like this with everyone even his friends, and just let it be.

Well lately, his texting habits have gotten worse, he always took a long time to respond but now the content of his texts has changed, he doesn't flirt anymore, doesn't send photos or voice notes like he used to, not much emojis, and ignores or skips over messages sometimes, where he used to reply to ever single little message even if he had nothing to say he'd still aknowledge it with an emoji or something.

Whats confusing is he will still initiate texting everyday, and the other day he did call me out of the blue and said he wanted to see me.

Can these signs indicate he's losing interest?? or could it just be his burnt out from all the texting, tired of it? Its hard to tell because this situation is long distance, normally I could tell right away if he was flaking on dates etc, but this is much more confusing for me. I am starting to overthink everything and don't want to self sabotage this over perceived thoughts based on texting. I know guys can fake it for the first few months, but I genuinely don't see what he could gain from it? (he's not love bombing or future faking btw, and has never tried to ""sext"" or ask for nudes or any stupid stuff like that guys usually do, it's always been just a genuine natural connection.)

I am moving to his country in a few months for school, but he was only recently made aware of that, and seemed excited about it but the texting habits haven't gotten better since learning that.

(his best friend also mentioned that he kept bringing up coming to visit me, and that he seemed like he saw something more with me in the future based on their conversations) but from my end it seems like either he's losing interest or he's getting lazy with the texting... or both?

Our friend Jason was there with us. He immediately said “Wow. She’s already telling you what to wear. What’s next? Is she gonna tell you you’re not allowed to hang out with us anymore?”

I was a bit taken aback by this. I’m definitely not the type of girl who’s ever tried to control my boyfriends. I honestly have. always thought I was a pretty laid back type of girlfriend. Plus why would I ever tel my boyfriends couldn’t out with his friends? We have a lot of the same friends.

I have this really i mean really close friend of mine, she's been there for me at my worst and so on and so on, we have been flirting, and when she was drunk, she kissed me. This was just a quick backstory of our relationship.
So before i met her one of my classmates was ""dating"" with her, they met once or twice nothing much tbh. He broke her heart, by canceling plans etc. She hates everybidy who doase drugs and he's that guy who doase drugs all the time, so after all the bullshit he did, she hated him and didn't want to date anybody, or at least that's what she said, before we were flirting and stuff. And now there's a halloween party coming up in like a month, where she's going, and she can bring one guest. So guess what she chose to bring that other guys, who she ""hates"" and saying stuff like maybe he changed kr something. (he was also sending dick picks to other guys, cheating and other kinds of nasty stuff) so can anybody tell me why do girls always choose the guy who will break her heart, and i don't and can't look at her like any other friend now so this friendship is over imo.

How do you not reveal to your partner, who you envision sharing a life with, that you shoot steroids into your ass 2x/week? For me, I view steroid use as a deal breaker. The last (and only) person I dated on them was controlling, jealous, and paranoid. He tried blowing up his ex’s house (the same night he asked me to see him after 6 years) and ultimately hung himself in his prison cell after getting caught. I do partially blame steroids with his behavior in our relationship. So I blew up on my current boyfriend last night, which he stated was only due to my ignorance. 

He has a child and is going to blame me for breaking the kids heart if I make this issue end us. Meanwhile I think it’s his fault for not revealing it sooner. To me that’s a first month before you proclaim your love to the person kinda thing. 

I’m worried about his long term health. At 33 he already has fucked up shoulder mobility and back issues as well as high blood pressure, but denies PEDs are at fault. 

I’m willing to learn more about steroid use - particularly the kinds he uses, as he doesn’t have the same issues as my ex, but he feels as though he can’t get over the fact that I judged him for his use and that I told him I lost respect for him because he’s selling himself to others as something he’s not.

Not too long ago I got out of a 2.5 year relationship that I had realized wasn’t great. It wasn’t terrible by any means but as sometimes these things do, it had simply run its course but with the realization that I don’t think I was truly in love with my SO, just, comfortable. Fast forward only a few months I try to put myself out there and after a few misses I meet this person who, about an hour or two into our first date, I’m floored. After that we go on a few more dates and I realize I’m becoming head over heels for this person, the next few dates are great, I get all giddy when we message and chat, I have crazy butterflies around them, that I didn’t have around my ex. I start planning just a few more dates over the next few weeks, things are feeling great, all until they message me one day saying they’re not feeling it and an old flame came back into their life. Hey, it happens, and I’m not necessarily the kind of person that fights for someone’s affection if it means competition (maybe I’m more of a people pleaser than I thought). So all of this only lasted, eh, a month? And I took it hard. Harder than I thought I would. I realized I fell too hard too fast, and for the life of me I can’t really understand why aside from just, high dopamine levels and such. I responded to them with just a simple reply and that was that.

The next few days and weeks however, following the rejection, were absolute Hell for me. Little things, I mean LITTLE things were reminding me of them, including bigger things like stuff we talked about. Sounds, sensations, songs. I got rid of everything I could but later as my therapist had said, it’s okay to remove things but instead of repressing the memories and emotions, you need to let yourself be sad. “It’s okay to be sad. Not being sad is the unhealthiest thing you could do to yourself at this point.” Okay. I’ll work with that. But it doesn’t necessarily help the random breakdowns I’ve had just standing in line at the store, or taking food out of my fridge.

But what I learned and am still struggling to figure out what to do with this information is that, instead of a romantic connection, I feel as though I suffered from this notion of “Limerence.” Not love, but obsessive infatuation. (But what is love if not that? Don’t answer that, I know lol). I didn’t have more time with this person to find out many flaws so my image of them was, not necessarily perfect but just, a good match/connection I hadn’t had in years. Putting a word to it has at least helped some of the healing process, but I find myself still pining over this person, yearning for contact or circumstances to be different but of course, only moving forward will heal such wounds. 

Has anyone else experienced this? And if so, what were some methods or tactics you used to get through this weird funk/period?

My question is- how can I grab his attention?
He's a country boy (I live in rural idaho) . I don't even know if I would ever want to be serious *although* if he showed some interest I might want to consider it.

I'm a pretty attractive girl , I'm very umm well voluptuous. Small but with junk in the right areas if ya know what I mean. 
What are some texts I can send him to get him thinking about me more?

I slid up and we immediately hit it off and within the first night of talking we exchange numbers and call the next day. Since we started talking, we have hung out 10 times over the course of about two and a half weeks. We cuddled and kissed the thirds time we hung out and went through all the motions of sex while dressed the last time I saw him (about a week ago). We facetime at least every other day for several hours. We aren't dating yet. I know this sounds like ""duh he's into you"" but I promise I'm getting somewhere. Since we have met, he's done/said a few things that i dont know how to interpret:

* He blocked me for half a day after an inoffensive joke I made over text (I promise it was so mild) then tried to play it off as if nothing happened
* He always tells me when he's horny or if he was during the day
* He insults me one minute then compliments me the next (I have never insulted his appearance out of principle I just don't do that to people)
* He randomly trauma dumps to me over text or while facetiming
* He will try to control me in random ways (like not cussing at him or he'll hang up)

It's been 3 years but I still think about this a lot. A lot has happened since this has occured. In spite of the amount of time that has stood between this event and the present era( about 3 years or so) I still think about this regularly. I am ashamed to admit this considering I should have been long over this and almost everyone involved with the exception of myself have moved on. 

So back in 2017 shortly after my Nana died, I came to meet a girl I had no idea would come to change many things for me, including my self esteem. This girl gave me hope that I can be loved and have a shot at life. I grew up with my mother who was very emotionally abusive and generally very difficult to live with. This has greatly impacted my self esteem and how I view myself. I have been asked out by girls since middle school. People have complimented me regarding my looks but I could never take them seriously considering I have such a damaged self esteem. 

Anyways this girl started flirting with me and trying to get my attention around the beginning of my sophomore year in HS. She was very beautiful and I thought she was waaay out of my league. I couldn't accept the fact that someone this beautiful could want anything to do with me. I believed everything my mom said to me and I still kind of do. Anyways come 2018, she starts flirting with me and making it obvious she liked me. Then a couple months after school starts in November she nervously confesses that she likes me. I tell her I like her too. I stop going to school and come back around Christmas break. She keeps trying to get my attention, puts her hand on my shoulder and keeps flirting with me. Needles to say she really liked me but I screwed it up. I got kicked out of school, and now she's with a new guy and wants nothing to do with me. 

TLDR: Girl really liked me and crushed on me for about a year. Self esteem issues got in the way and I cower and miss my shot. I could tell she was hurt by my actions and I am greatly sorry. I didn't mean to hurt her. I still miss her but I need to move on.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1022940,public,self,Was This My Fault?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pu6q6y/was_this_my_fault/,all_ads,6,,,

Let me explain why. 

It’s not that I can’t afford to it’s more that I see no logical reason why I would at this stage. The pros of staying just out ways the cons. 

If I were to move out then suddenly I’m a third of my wages goes down the drain. I can be saving that for a future deposit on a house and to live slightly above my means right now. Like treating myself which I could not do if I had to pay rent. 

I haven’t “settled down” yet I don’t know what you would call it but I’m kind of in a gap year but it’s gonna be about 3 years. I’ve just finished university a year ago and I’m looking to do a masters in the next few years. The course I want to go in is pretty competitive and they like people to have experience in the field, which I am actively getting. If I could to the masters tomorrow I could but I literally need to put in the work now to get on it. 

It’s not like I’m not independent. I do my own shopping and cook myself. Of course my mum picks me up things from time to time but do the majority of my own shopping. Also I pay rent which is of course much lower that what I would be paying normally. 

But is it a big turn off? I know it’s not ideal but the only advantage of moving out I see right now is it’s more attractive and I wouldn’t mind the freedom from my parents from time to time. Even though we get on.
