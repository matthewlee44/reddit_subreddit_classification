Can you not simply say: fuck it, I don't want to date guys anymore because of this.

1,o1d6wc,1623871694,Not capable of ROMANTIC LOVE !?,"Hey redditors!   


I have the weirdest question I have ever faced in regards to dating and relationships. Please share ALL your thoughts :)   


So, I (F36) met on a dating app a younger guy (M26). We seemed to hit it off, as we texted a lot, and had really good convos via text. Eventually we meet, it seems we both are satisfied by the meeting and would like to do it again. But right after, due to life and yes, COVID, the guy had to move away, and aside from texting sometimes, we pretty much agree to put whatever this is on hold, and maybe try again after, when he moves back to the city.

On one conversation he expressed how he is not ready for serious dating. Things have happened in his past relationships that have screwed him up, and he needs to work on his demons, which is why he can't have a serious relationship. 

Recently we chatted a little, and I love that he confides in me. I have a bad crush on this guy, anyway. And he told me all about some of these things that happened to him, as a way to explain why he doesn't date seriously. What really got me is that he expressed, very clearly, that he is incapable of feeling romantic love. Exactly like that. I felt sad for him, because it sucks to feel this way, and I had the impression the he was telling me to explain on one hand, but I was left with the doubt, what if he told me this to scare me away? Other subjects were discussed on our chat, but this one left like..... ""why are you telling me this?!""

I can ask him eventually. I do doubt he would say all that (which was really personal info) just to scare me away. But I can't shake the feeling off. And a part of me thinks I should take the hint, and make sure I only see him as a friend. Because the moment I catch feelings and he doesn't, this is really going to suck.

2,o1d95m,1623871857,Am i exaggerating?,"Hello everyone, please bare with me, it might be a longer read, i hope it doesn't bother to much.

I, 25, M have been working at this place for about half a year now. Everything is fine, I enjoy the work and the people around. Eventhough COVID has made people more distant, I find myself well adapted. 

I am not actively looking for but neither am i avoiding any kind of relationship with women. Eventhough i have never dated, had a GF or even had sex, I find myself getting into the ""just do it"" mentality and out of the ""what if?"" mentality about women and dating. I kind of feel ready for the bad stuff about dating and getting to know women. Eventhough it sucks being single.

Unlike before, this time I really don't know what to do as opposed to being scared about what could happen. 

This is where the workplace comes in, the trouble being, that I get mixed singals from my co-worker, 28 F. 
Our department is located in an open space with dedicated desk positions. (this might seem outdated in some places, but hey, this is central europe. It is not outdated if we do it, right?Anyways, i'm diverging) So I am sitting next to and in front of 2 of my coworkers most of the day. They know each other a bit longer and have even shared a single office for a longer time. I am ""the new dude"" and a part from my boss the only dude in less than 10 people.

Now to the mixed signals: very often when she laughs or smiles about something said in a discussion, she looks at me instead of anyone else We already have inside jokes and seem to have a lot in common, both personally and interests-wise. But sometimes, when we are alone at the office (being the only singles often are the last ones in and so the last ones out) we barely talk, eventhough when there are still coworkers we talk normally.
She even went on one or another smoke break with me eventhough she doesn't smoke. (that could be to escape the badly cooled offices and get some fresh air but still)

Since she is a coworker, sitting right next to me i really wouldn't want to misread those signals because i still have 1 ¬Ω years of training time at the job and i don't want there to be a strange ambiance around the office, especially since other coworkers are quite chatty in not necessarily a good way and i do share a good part of my work with her.


Am I exaggerating? Should I just not give a damn about the work ambiance? Is this normal women behaviour? Am i to desperate?
I have no clue. Help would be appreciated.

 so we met at 18, seniors in HS and at that point i was the only girl that really showed him any attention or interest that he also found attractive so there was the ""honeymoon"" stage for a year. so he said things like ""I know for sure I am going to marry you""

fast forward to sopho yr of college, we are both 20. he goes to college 2 hrs away from me. i completely went psycho for NO reason and this caused arguments, more unhappy times than happy ones. yes in hindsight he had given me 0 reasons to not trust him but yep i grew suspicious and lost my crap. projected a lot of past trauma into the relationship. still he was patient. wanted to work things out. of course reflecting on everything i realize that i was stupid and will never ever make a huge deal out of something small like that.

fast forward to yesterday. we still text everyday, mainly just gm/gn texts, recap of the day text at night, try to call at least once a week, he is home for the summer, but its mostly me that initiates the plans. yes we had a heart-to-heart, he did say that he wanted to stay in a relationship with me and wanted to work things out. his mom said to him ""u know its not the end of the world if u guys take a break"" and while he agrees yes, its not, he told me that if we can work on it together theres no reason to take one. i asked him where he sees us 10 yrs from now he says ""hopefully with a family""

i am really really scared that we wont be able to get to that happy again because of those stupid arguments i provoked. i dont know what to do

Yet when i see women i like look off always under 25. When I match or see some older women auto swipe left, just dont find them attractive, not interested to start my dating life with some older women whos had 3 kids etc haha, well not their fault i didnt date when young but still put me in a predicament now.

I just feel like well may as well jump of a bridge. In terms of dating, have to concede fact that there never will be any dating life for me, not sure I even want one. Wish I tried dating when i was young and good looking coulda had fun, to busy just hanging with friends, having fun, getting drunk, some casual flings etc. Now im like wow im this creepy old ugly bloke with a fetish for younger women, and with lockdown no friends, and my age, no parties, my looks, no dating....Honestly finding it hard to even motivate myself to do anything.

Seen a few of my mates, even ones with kids, split up during lockdown as well so may be effecting not only the singles.

He mentioned that he's currently emotionally unavailable due to his job since he travels a lot, but wouldn't mind considering something down the line. We'd been talking on social media and everything seemed to be going great. Got along well, similar sense of humor, sending each other pics and memes, compliments, etc. He even mentioned coming back to visit soon so we could really meet up and get to know each other for the first time. 

One day out of the blue he started being nonchalant, opening my messages and not responding, responding with one word answers, etc. I figured he must've been tired and just gave him some space, since he mentioned how tired his job made him. I eventually decided to confront him and ask what was wrong, to which he eventually, after beating around the bush a bit, responded that he was worried I might be a catfish or that we wouldn't get along in person. Part of me thinks he was just trying to find an excuse to stop talking to me since he was so busy and maybe didn't see long distance working out. I'm not sure why he'd think I'm a catfish since I had sent him several live snapchat photos, so I assumed he might've been implying that he was expecting me to look less attractive irl than my photos, which was pretty insulting tbh. We were getting along great via messaging so idk why he was expecting something completely different when we met up. Even then, we'd find that out once we met up, right? He never really explained himself and just ended up blocking me. I'm not sure what I did to make him think these things or act that way so suddenly.

It took my nearly a year to work on myself again :) while I did put in a lot of time and effort by working on my inner self , in this one year I didn't date anyone or have any flings as I wanted undivided attention to myself 
Nonetheless  after getting over all this , I did try.online dating again ( literally had 3 matches in months) and tbh I did try hooking up for a online but that never worked for me either and I haven't ever done.this before and all I received was rejection  or being ghosted and I also genuinely  tried dating but filled with rejection  again :) Nonetheless  I started thinking eat was going on and till date , I can't figure it out 
I wouldn't say am.the best looking guy nor the worst looking guy tbh , I have decent appearance and take care of myself well considering the fact I suffer from anxiety . 

Nonetheless  I have been Optimistic about dating or just hooking up , but nothing seems to be working and office I'm showing since of giving up as it's making me tired üò´

All I want is someone  to grow with , build something  with and compliment  each other and make memories and share intimacy in a relationship  and nothing more , I have no reservations against any culture and am really open minded but unfortunately I face a lot of racist experiences  in dating in Germany ( am an south Asian here ) people markwt themselves as.open minded here but their actions proves they are so full of shit 

While if it's just hooking up I'd like to build a friendship over it and share some intimate  and sensual moments , of course only with consent and have fun like the rest 

But nothing is really happening  and it's making me frustrated and thinking if am not desirable 

What do I do? 

I am.1.78m tall , a bit overweight by 8 kgs due to my anxiety , I am working on it by cycling as it keeps me calm and helps me reduce as.well 
I'm 28 year old guy

The apps themselves have been a pain/disappointment/source of stress. In-person chemistry is important to me, so I really wish I could meet people in a more natural way, but as a straight-passing queer girl, that's not really an option.

Finally had my first date with a girl (I am also a girl), and I did enjoy the conversation and think she was really cute. However I wouldn't necessarily be that bummed if we never saw each other again. I'm like semi-dreading our next date and I don't even know why. Possibly because she planned something *really long,* and that makes me nervous since I have limited social energy until I know someone better.

Is this just overall dating exhaustion/anxiety, or if it's my age (30s), I don't have that teen energy maybe? Do I push through this feeling and give things a chance when I date or am I just not that into it?

44,o1icvx,1623885172,Women won't someone who does not open up like themself?,"Hi everyone,

I  am a man and I had a discussion a few days ago with a friend of mine.   We talked about dating and I told her, I meet a girl and she told me a  lot of personal problems after 60minutes talking. Like her father died,  she hates her roommate, her mothers annoys her etc. You see a lot of  stuff. I almost did not talk about myself.

Firstly  because I dont like it if someone says negative things and to add some negative stuff from my side. I feel worse after that, but thats just me. And  secondly because I just wanted to listen and I did not have the  intention to discuss things about myself, if she had asked I would have  answered (more or less but not as deep as her).

I  dont know why but the girl and I never met again. I had the impression  we had a good connection but it I guess it was just me. So I told that  story my friend. And she told me, that a lot of women dont like it when a  boy is just listening because then he is like her psychologist, she is  confused because now I (or the man in generell) knows so much stuff  about her and she does not know nothing about him, and its getting even  worse, she told me in some cases the girl could get mad at the guy  because she opened up to him and told him so much stuff that he now has  the ""power"". She also stated like when I dont open up we cant have a  connection.

To be honest, I was  quite shocked about her thoughts. Because I did not think about this,  especially not the power thing (keep in mind, my friend is always  talking about being submissive and dominat). I just wanne be equal with  my partner thats it, i dont wanne dominate someone and I dont wanne be  dominated. I always thought, if she wanne talkes about that and i am  listening she feels better and thats it.

So  she told me, because I was just listening that I should open up more to  creat a connection between me and her. Is this really the case?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o1icvx/women_wont_someone_who_does_not_open_up_like/
45,o1imko,1623885964,Dating app profile ADVICE for those who wanna hear it:,"And disclaimer, this is just MY sole opinion as I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs obvious but needs to be said nonetheless. But I will say that I‚Äôm a mid 20s something female and am on the apps for a relationship , not just hooking up.

So onto the advice:

1. Put your career/job in it. It makes a difference. I personally am looking for someone who has their shit together and typically swipe LEFT if the person doesn‚Äôt have a career/job listed even if I like other things about their profile simply because I don‚Äôt wanna waste my time. 

2. I see it as a negative not to list your age or ‚Äúhide‚Äù it. Left swipe. It‚Äôs deceiving and red flaggy. What are you hiding it for? They‚Äôre gonna find out when they see you in person.

3. THE MORE PICS THE BETTERüëè A guy that looks cute in 1 pic and unrecognizable in his second? Swipe left. Don‚Äôt wanna waste my time.

4. Don‚Äôt leave your bio blank!!! I‚Äôve seen this SOO MANY times. I could like everything about your profile and if I see that you didn‚Äôt put in the effort to type one sentence or something about yourself then it‚Äôs a swipe left for me. Most people can look good on paper and take the right pics but it‚Äôs their personality that‚Äôs lacking. I like it when there‚Äôs a joke or something sweet written down there to really seal the deal.

5. Take off those sunglasses.... I shouldn‚Äôt have to say this. There are way too many people who have sunglasses on ALLL of their pics. Am I supposed to guess what your face looks like? Just post a real pic so you can stand a real chance.

6. Snapchat filtered selfies... with the Snapchat caption going across it. Honey baby what! is you doing. 

7. And while we‚Äôre on the topic of Snapchat, I will 10000% swipe left if you make it clear to me that you use Snapchat, such as listing it in your bio. Again, this is my opinion but we all know Snapchat‚Äôs rep and it typically means you‚Äôre still a kid. No thanks.

8. No weirdly angled body shots... I understand that you work out and get them gains and wanna show it off, but this just tells me that you‚Äôre only into hooking up (could be the case for most!) and need attention. Posting a full sized normal pic can also get the point across that you work out and are fit. 

9. Memes or inspiring/love-related quotes... Why? Just why? Pics only. I don‚Äôt care that you find spongebob memes funny, that‚Äôs not gonna make me wanna swipe right",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o1imko/dating_app_profile_advice_for_those_who_wanna/

47,o1iukh,1623886627,Mixed signals,"Hi Reddit,

I matched with a girl on hinge and we were talking around a week. Things go well. We mutually express interest in meeting. One night we were both out and decided let‚Äôs meet. We met each other‚Äôs friends and everything and drank together. It went great. Good conversation but she is definitely shy and so am I. We are both attracted to each other. Her friends told my friend she likes me a lot. The night ended, kept texting the next few days (very spaced out texts from both of us).

Shortly after, I finally set up a real date with her. The whole time the conversation felt great, but I didn‚Äôt really escalate past some back touches lol. No kissing. We are together for like 4 hours, great convo but not necessarily romantic. Part of me thinks she is super closed off and shy (same vibes as the first night out), but part of me didn‚Äôt want to go for a kiss because maybe she‚Äôs just not interested. She even invited to something (that I couldn‚Äôt go to). She mentioned I was great company and I asked in person if we could do something again (she said yes). 

I text her after saying how great a time I had. Now, we typically take a lot of time to text back, but she didn‚Äôt say anything for quite a while‚Ä¶. 5 hours? She finally said ‚ÄúI hope you made it back ok!‚Äù And that‚Äôs it. I responded. Then I didn‚Äôt hear from her for a day. Finally I double text her and she gives a decent response. Nothing to insinuate disinterest, but nothing to start a conversation. I haven‚Äôt responded.

I really don‚Äôt know where to go from here. I‚Äôve only had one girlfriend and I‚Äôm 25 so I‚Äôm super inexperienced. So don‚Äôt text her until I want to set up a date?

It‚Äôs been a while since I dated, the last person that I haven‚Äôt seeing was an ex and we are very much hung up on each other sexually but not relationship wise as we are both in two separate stages in our lives and I just believe that he needs someone that‚Äôs more around his age as I need someone around mine. 

Anyways, this guy reached out to me that is two years older than me and as far as I‚Äôm concerned him and I hit it off quite well but because I was still/still am seeing my ex even though I know nothing is coming out of it, I decided to proceed going on this mini date with this other person. We had fun at least that‚Äôs what he claims and I feel like it was mutual but he wouldn‚Äôt stop mentioning his ex girlfriend, he says they‚Äôve been broken up for a while now but they are super close and still hang out everyday and he occasionally sleeps over at her apartment and all the stuff. like I do think this guy is good looking, smart and I would like to proceed something with him but I feel as though his ex girlfriend will get in the way of that and it‚Äôs kind of like a dealbreaker for me because I don‚Äôt wanna already mention it when I‚Äôve only just met despite talking to each other for like months now (as friends) and I‚Äôm not really the type of person to tell him who he can and can‚Äôt be friends with because it‚Äôs super unfair and I know that I wouldn‚Äôt like it to be done to me but it makes me super uncomfortable knowing that they are very close still. Do I just kind of ‚Äúdismiss us‚Äù or wait it out until something actually happens between us and then mention it to him as like a dealbreaker, I have no idea‚Ä¶

They were together for almost 3 years, and he even said to me that he doesn‚Äôt want to hurt her which also was kind of like suspicious to me and plus when he drove an hour to see me, he turned off his location which I assumed he was sharing with his ex girlfriend as well and he didn‚Äôt turn it on until he went back home so that‚Äôs also a huge red flag to me (I only checked location to see how close he was)

And he also confronted me that he didn‚Äôt like when I would open up his messages and not respond for a few hours, and that he would be petty enough to do the same back to me even though it doesn‚Äôt affect me at all.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o1j4lb/interested_in_a_guy_24_who_still_has_a_deep_bond/

Personally, I would pay for the first date, for sure, and probably the next couple, but I would hope after that we would split and pay for ourselves? I recently dated a girl who was 26, and over a 6 week period, she paid once I think. I was short on cash, in between jobs, but she would still, when asked where to go for food, be like ""that korean bbq place!"" (the one that cost me a min of $80!) 

One time, I mentioned needing to be careful about money, so she agreed on Chipotle (she was a fast food snob and would basically not go to any of them, but she would go to chipotle)...she sent me a text with what she wanted and I thought, ""she knows I am broke and have no income really, she will order a burrito."" She orders that, then adds chips and queso and a bottled drink. I remember seeing the $30 bill after I got my burrito and thinking, this seems really unfair to me. Then again, she was pretty old-fashioned. Once said she would not consider a dinner a date unless the man was paying for it all. Wanted to get married and be a stay-at-home wife and eventually stay-at-home mom. It was definitely stressful financially. Anyone else find the financial stuff stressful sometimes if one partner is all about the other paying for it all?

I suspect this sort of thing (all of the above) is not the norm these days? God, I hope not. Lol.

Is this ever a make or break issue for any of you? Would it make you think less of a guy who didn't pay all the time or most of the time? I always wonder.

What do you all think? I figure if a woman has a job, and with the way things are today, I would hope after a couple of dates, paying for ourselves would be the general vibe.

We both really liked each other and I think under different circumstances we'd be in a relationship right now, which was something we had both discussed trying but neither of us are really ready for one and I'm moving to a city 4 hours away in a couple of months. But we also agreed that we couldn't really go back to casual as we'd already crossed boundaries and would inevitably cross them again and so we aren't even talking anymore. For some reason, I am really struggling to get over this girl that I never even dated.

I don't want doing this to send some kind of message and of course wont do it if they offer some kind of alternative. i just feel its a good public, interactive place where not all attention is on each other, doing an activity, you can talk, and its naturally time limited so the date doesn't drag on. it being my work just makes me hesitate.

70,o1kdri,1623891390,Nervous about first relationship,"I am f19 and have never been in a relationship. I've had a few opportunities but was either too naive to realize that the other person liked me or did not see the potential for a good relationship. I feel like I am too old to have never even kissed a guy let alone date one, so I feel extra anxious about getting into any kind of relationship. I have never had a boyfriend, even in elementary school, so I feel completely inept and clueless when it comes to dating. I am pretty shy and reserved, so I am worried that I won't give off inviting vibes. 

I've gone on a few dates but I can never break the touch barrier, so it feels more like hanging out with a friend. I recently went on a first date with a guy I met on bumble(I know, probably not the best for someone who has never been in a relationship) and I really like him. He seems to be genuine and respectful and is also looking for a relationship. I'm sure that he has dated before, and I am scared to tell him that I'm completely inexperienced. I also don't want to move so slowly that he loses interest.

He is planning a picnic date for us(ow my heart) and I am scared he is going to try to kiss me. I really want to kiss him, but I don't know how I won't explode. I don't know if I should tell him beforehand that I've never kissed anyone, or if I should wait till afterwards. 

I've been texting him for a while and he is the first guy I have seen as good potential relationship material, but I am so scared to even get in a relationship even though I really, really want to. I've struggled with intimacy my whole life and am slowly become more affectionate towards friends and family, but I still don't know how to show him I am interested in being more than just friends. 

I'm not really worried about never being able to find anyone, I'm more worried about never being able to initiate a relationship. I feel like I am at the age where it is more common for relationships to be casual and without labels, but I don't want that. I'm trying to get over my hesitancy to kiss someone that isn't an official partner as I am realizing that it is a bit more complex than high school relationships.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o1kdri/nervous_about_first_relationship/

I'm very focused on my career and starting to think about settling down and getting ready for a family and I've fell like all I really come across on apps is people looking for a hookup or people who seem far more interested in partying than in settling down (this is not to say to say everyone who uses these dating apps is looking for hookups or not worth a relationship or isn't focused on a career/family/school it's just that the ratio of people I'm not interested in to people I would consider for a date is tediously high). I'm tired of swiping through profiles or starting conversations with people only to realize a few messages in that they're not my type. 

I've heard about luxury matchmaking services and I thought going through some of these (as someone in the databases, I'm doing somewhat well in my career but I'm still pretty early in it) and it seems like a potentially good option. It seems more likely to have men on it that are more similar to me and what I'm looking for in a relationship (career oriented, ambitious, looking to settle down, etc.). Has anyone had any experience with any of these services? Are they legit and do they actually match you up with people or do you just sit in the databases indefinitely? A lot of them charge $100+ for consultations for the databases to see if you can be added which I'd have no problem paying if I'll be seriously considered but I don't want to go through the trouble only to get lost in a database.

Girl that works the line at my local Chipotle seems interested in me. Only thing is, we only literally have like, 30 seconds to communicate in the damn line. Frustratingly short amount of time. I've never asked anybody on a date without at least like, a minute or two of conversation first, and ""Hi! Nice day right? Let's go do stuff on a date, extra chicken please"" just doesn't sound very appealing to me, lol.

I'd be lying if I said the added pressure of her entire team being within earshot, the people in line next to me waiting for their chance to order, and the fact I'm totally putting her on the spot- wasn't a factor in my confusion about how to take action here. She seems a little shy as well. Not much, but I'm concerned that putting her on the spot even if she wanted to say yes, would just be way too much pressure, and kinda put a big, self-conscious, ""STOP"" sign on the whole thing.

So! I need some help. Creative solutions, anecdotes, speculation, philosophical analysis, whatever you've got. ...Oh, except two things: A. ""Just do it"" comments without direction, or consideration (if it's ""just do it"" but prefaced with a thoughtful analysis, then it's okay. But ""Just shoot your shot because YOLO"" won't be doing me any favors here) and B. Anything surreptitious, or ""smooth."" Something like ""slipping"" her my number etc. is in my opinion, cowardly- I wouldn't be able to do something like that and call myself a Man... Not to mention if I were her?

I consider myself thoughtful and try to come up with original openers and questions to matches I get connected with.  Sometimes its tough as many leave profiles with not much details to work with and to add on that their responses don't help either. 

What makes me the most angry is when the girls have to make the first move and the best they could come up with is just ""Hi how are you"". It really strikes my nerve cuz I know a girl would never respond back to me if I did the same.   Its like I have to be Shakespeare to get a back an forth going and it just drains me.  

I end up deleting matches I feel are not going anywhere or taking too long to respond back to me because I lack the patience to wait to see if its going to get better and makes it easier for me to forget about them, out of sight out of mind.  I just don't like looking back and seeing how I am getting disrespected.

Our last hangout was amazing, and he started holding my hand in public which we didn‚Äôt do before (for me, holding hands seems more intimate than sex for some reason). We were talking about our plans for the summer, and I mentioned an event I was excited for about 2 months from now and casually said he should come along, and he said he‚Äôd definitely want to go. 

He‚Äôs not much of a texter, which at first was giving me anxiety, but I‚Äôve come to accept it since our in person connection is so great. We don‚Äôt text everyday but he does reach out first after a couple of days to ask how I‚Äôm doing. So I haven‚Äôt been too worried about it lately, until I saw that he added a couple pictures recently to his tinder profile (yes I was creeping, bad I know). Should I be worried about this? Should I have the ‚Äútalk‚Äù soon to figure out what his intentions are? Should I keep going as usual and maybe wait another month or so for the talk? Maybe I should just call it quits before this causes me more anxiety?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o1m7pf/update_to_tinder_profile_after_6_dates/
99,o1m9j1,1623897248,how long is too long for someone to reply to a snap/message?,"i'm back with my neurotic overthinking

this guy (23) i'm (24) talking to takes a couple of hours usually to respond to snaps but sometimes he will respond more quickly- it's gotten to the point that i know about when to expect a response. (it's really more like one prolonged conversation, not sending sporadic snaps and responding to those). 

i know that he's home right now visiting with family and that we are juust starting to talk again after a break in talking. but i do see sometimes that he is active in between responses (views my story or is active on map)

do i literally just have too much free time on my hands and am stressing over nothing?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o1m9j1/how_long_is_too_long_for_someone_to_reply_to_a/
