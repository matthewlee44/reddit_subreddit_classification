5,phunfw,1630772734,F the Spark,"There's a book written by Logan Ury called ""[How not to Die Alone](https://www.npr.org/2021/02/08/965397828/how-to-fall-in-love-according-to-hinges-relationship-scientist)""  She's a behavioural scientist for Hinge and comes at it from a very data-centric point of view.  One of her central theories is **Fuck the Spark**.

These are some of the myths she talks about in the book:

&gt;Myth #1: When you meet the right person, you’ll feel instant fireworks.

&gt;Myth #2: The spark is always a good thing.

&gt;Myth #3: If you have a spark, the relationship is viable.

([if you want to read more of the section talking about this, click here](https://www.menshealth.com/sex-women/a35365989/how-to-not-die-alone-logan-ury-excerpt/))

Here's a small blurb from the above link that we hear commonly on this sub. 

&gt;**Some people are just really good at making a lot of people feel a spark. Maybe they’re extremely attractive. Perhaps they’re best-in-class flirts. Sometimes the presence of a spark is more an indication of how charming someone is—or how narcissistic—and less a sign of a shared connection.** I learned the hard way with Burning Man Brian. He made me (and plenty of others) feel the spark, and I tried desperately to convert that initial excitement into a relationship.

Because relationships are such a wide net of people, circumstances, and experiences, it's really easy to selectively sample from populations that fit into agreeing with her thesis.  This flys against the commonly said thing ""*It's either Fuck yes or fuck no*"" (people love their fucks)

Do you agree with this?  Do you think it's worth reconsidering this point of view about ""the spark""?  

For me, while I agree with the entire premiss, I haven't really needed to wait for something to develop.  I can't think of anything from fling to relationship that ever developed after long enough time of waiting for something to develop.  When I met my partner on the first night, there were plenty of sparks on both sides.  Perhaps this only works in situations where you interact with someone regularity (i.e. at work, in a friend group, etc.) rather than someone on a first date.  

At the bare minimum, I still believe there should be something of attraction there on the first date and if everything else seems okay to good, you should probably give it a more realistic shot.  That's how I tended to approach first dates and why I was asking for a second date more often than not.",datingoverthirty,t5_34cyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/phunfw/f_the_spark/
