1,r4rfef,1638175086,Indian Guy 21 here......need help. People who understand Indian dating scene and girls are encouraged to help.,"Guys can suggest but the post is directed to girls who use instagram.
I am a prefinal year college student who has a crush on this final year girl. I am 50 percent sure that there's no one in her life.
The problem is, I have never seen her in real life and only follow her on Instagram. I would love to approach her in real but she's in final sem and those guys rarely come to college(even when it is open, and as of now college is indefinitely closed due to covid).
She doesn't follow me on instagram which isn't very rude coz she doesn't follow any other junior as well.
She has a second public account where she posts a lot of her writings and reels related to books. She loves to read books and has a proper shelf full of them. There's some great views that I admire her for. 
One of the few people I know who aren't faking things.
I don't want to regret later that I couldn't approach her and covid is making it really hard(I've been quite lonely).
I once replied to a story of her public account with a 3 line experience of mine and she replied with a simple haha. That's the only interaction.
So here's my question:
1. Should I DM her and approach her that way, clearly writing why I chose to dm instead of meeting? I have been planning to write a poem in my own handwriting explaining why I admire her? I want to advocate for the word admire because crushes are just admirations, that's not love. I don't want to fake any compliments on her appearance based just on her instagram, I didn't fall for her appearance. 
Note- Poem is only because she writes and read literature. Tell me if it's a bad idea.
2. Things I shouldn't tell her in my dm, if I do message her.
3. I don't want to hurt her or cause any harm(and also not to get in trouble myself). I've seen what some of our indian fellows do to women on instagram (once had the pleasure of using my mother's insta, which she never used. There were atleast 5 extremely random guys sending her requests and all. I don't want to be that). I also don't want to come out as creep. Suggestions pls.
4. Any other suggestions that you would like to provide from your side.
Note- I think I am as old as her.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r4rfef/indian_guy_21_hereneed_help_people_who_understand/
2,r4rh41,1638175280,So many questions???,"I‚Äôm a guy in my mid 30‚Äôs, to say I‚Äôve been out of the scene for a minute would be an understatement. I got clean in 2016, my life was pretty messy prior to that point and to varying degrees so were my relationships. When I decided to pull my shit together my focus was my health, number one followed by my career. Outside of those two goals I set everything else on the back burner. I did all of the normal things that life basically consists of; family, friends, hobbies. Pursuing a relationship was put on hiatus indefinitely until I was ‚Äúin a better place‚Äù.

I‚Äôve actually been in a good place for some time now. I didn‚Äôt turn into a full blown monk either. I did spend time with some ex‚Äôs occasionally who understood and some online (nsa) flings. That being said, here‚Äôs what feels like my dilemma. 

So, I‚Äôve gotten incredibly used to this very independent lifestyle and I haven‚Äôt been emotionally available for a long time on any intimate level. My whole adult life up to 5 years ago was infected by drugs and alcohol so this person I am today is still pretty new to me. I‚Äôve become a better son, brother, friend and human being in general. I‚Äôm very comfortable and content but my plan was always to hopefully settle down with someone special to me. 

So the catch is I do have a date with a woman I like very much and have known for a while but outside of small talk we have never really had a real conversation so I know her but not really at all. I don‚Äôt have any problems talking, joking or carrying a conversation. It‚Äôs that all the relationships in my past always went incredibly fast. Is it weird to put it out there that I want things to move slowly? Should I even bring it up? 

When I‚Äôve been around her, there has been chemistry and we have friends in common. Some of those friends know me well, so I‚Äôm inclined to think she knows a thing or two about me and not that it‚Äôs some giant secret anyway. I just don‚Äôt want one thing to lead to another and then I get awkward and distant. I know I‚Äôm overthinking things a bit but it‚Äôs largely to do with me wanting this to work out. I know she‚Äôs been interested for a while and same for me. I‚Äôm afraid if I bring it up that my vulnerability might scare her away. Idk, for me, finally with self-awareness knows the importance on taking things slow for it to work out long term. Things were way simpler when I drank and didn‚Äôt really give a f. Any thoughts ?

3,r4ri9p,1638175419,"Ladies, does a guy liking you more than you like them affect the way you look at him over time ?","So, I (26M) was dating a BEAUTIFUL girl (24F) who matched with me on Bumble. I mean she‚Äôs a 9 on a bad day, and I‚Äôm a 7.5/8 at best. I was questioning whether she was out of my league. She was head over heels for me once we first started talking. (She liked me WAYY more than I liked her at first)She expressed how much she liked me and that she doesn‚Äôt usually date. I said cool and we started taking it slow. We would FaceTime nightly, go get drinks, and see each other a good amount the first month. Her communication skills we‚Äôre the best but I thought nothing of it. The sex was AMAZING ! I mean, we would fuck like rabbits. She even was bragging to her friends about our sex. Mind you, we‚Äôve only been talking for about 3 weeks up to this point. Then Hurricane Ida came and things took a turn for the worse. We had to split for the evacuation and communicated daily. I even drove 400 miles to see her during our separate evacuations. When I got there, all we did was have nonstop sex for the 2 days I was there. Then, we started having arguments about small things. She told me she was starting to feel uncomfortable by how fast we were moving. I took a note and said we can slow things down once we get back from evacuation. At this point, we‚Äôre really into each other but I like her more than she likes me now. The tables have turned 

Well, once we got back from being evacuated, I realized she changed. We stopped FaceTiming, texting became dull, and we stopped having sex. I brought it up and she said that she was uncomfortable with the way I was handling the relationship because she‚Äôs never moved that fast. Then, I basically became the guy who was chasing her. I told her I loved her and I wanted to be with her forever. I became attached. She obviously didn‚Äôt have the same feelings I had for her. At this point we‚Äôve been talking for 6 weeks and then we basically stopped all the fun things we did once we first started. An argument led to me not talking to her for a month. 

Then being the guy that I am (I‚Äôm an intense lover), I sent her a ‚ÄúI miss you text‚Äù after my birthday. I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about her. She hit me back saying she missed me too and thought I found someone else. We agreed to try things again but after about a week of texting again, she‚Äôs been back to the same shit. Saying we should link up but once the day comes, she ghosts me. Terrible communication skills and fake love.

I told her tonight that if she didn‚Äôt want to do it anymore lmk, and she said we should end it.

&amp;#x200B;

Dated a few girls, was hooking up with the one, but then thought I found ""the one"" in early August. We casually dated for about 2 months, nothing official, no sex. After a couple dates she revealed she was very recently single, and vented about her ex's a lot. I told her to take a break, let the thing with her ex's cool off, then maybe we can try again. She spilled her guts out, saying she's not used to ""mature emotionally available men"". And that her ex bf's were ""depressed alcoholics"". She asked for another chance and I gave it to her. We went out one more time and it was awkward as can be. She texted me a couple days later something like ""you're a great guy and deserve somebody special but let's be friends hee-hee."" I was like wtf is she serious???

&amp;#x200B;

So I move on to another girl, we go out to dinner a week later. She's a nervous wreck on the date. I figure it's just first date nerves so I ask her out again, she says yes. She's out of town that weekend. Weekend after we plan to go out, she calls me sick (she sounded sick) and we don't go. Weekend after I have to work. I try to reschedule again, but at this point my cell towers are DOWN and Im on the backup 3g network. I don't hear from her for over a week. New cell towers are up and Im back on 5g. I text her like ""if you didn't want to go out again that's fine, but don't have me pay for tickets when you know you're not going"". She texts back 15 seconds later ""ummmm I haven't heard from you in a week I thought we were going"". Turns out my texts weren't all sending on 3g. Now it's been like 5 weeks since our first date. I just give up with this girl.

&amp;#x200B;

So I go out with another girl. First date goes pretty well, she texts me when she gets home like ""thank you for the good time we should do it again"". But I have plans all thanksgiving week, and work 12 hour shifts all weekend. So next weekend would be TWO weeks since the first date and I can already feel momentum dying. I'll ask her out, she will say yes, and it will be weird seeing each others faces again after such a long layoff.

The people whom we call sexy despite or aside from the raw facts of their appearance are those whose features and manner suggest and an unusual ability to fulfil the underlying emotion purpose of love making.

The way they respond to a joke, their curve of an eyebrow, their way of holding hands, the way they look into our eyes convey in and unconsciously understood but hugely eloquent language that one is in the presence of a kindly Being who is liable to understand our broken and confused aspects. To help us over our loneliness and submerge our sadness and reassure us our basic legitimacy and worth.

9,r4s9na,1638178670,Messy situation,"I met a guy I was dating casually for about 3 weeks before I fucked up epically. I got blackout drunk and hooked up with a guy who later turned out to be a friend from a guy I was dating. We both weren't aware they knew eachother.

I was a mess and disgusted with myself. Guy I was dating reached out a few days after that happened with a pasive aggresive message to let me know he knows everything. He acted like everything was fine and like it isn't a big deal but we haven't talked in a month after that. I knew he was hurt by my actions.

A month later, I randomly ran into him while I was out with my friends. He was excited to see me and I decided to apologize in person and to tell him my side of a story - that I was blackout drunk and didn't have any control over my behaviour and that I feel terrible about it still. He was kinda mad at first and irritated that I'm even mentioning it but eventually accepted my apology and said that we weren't official or anything so he practically doesn't have a right to be mad about it but that it did kinda hurt him. Long story short, we ended up making out and he slept over at my place. We haven't heard in 2 weeks after that and I saw on social media that he went out of town to visit his mom. I thought it was over between us and that he just used me for sex one last time, so I decided to move on from this mess.

But on Saturday afternoon, he reached out and told me he came back to our town and that he would like to hang out with me if I'm free. He came over at my place and I said to him i didn't expect we would hear from each other again. He asked me why did I think that and said he wanted to reach out earlier but he isn't big on texting so he waited to come back so we could talk in person. We cuddled and watched movies and it was really a beautiful evening.

My question is - do you think he's genuine or just using me for sex and affection? When I'm with him I don't get bad vibes but my friends are telling me to be careful. Him and I have a great chemistry and I think that is why it's so hard to get away from eachother.

17,r4u1ne,1638186104,"I was ""the worst date ever"", and now I have a crush on her","So... I have a crush on this girl, who I completely rejected in college.  
Story is, my sister set me up with her friend ten years ago. My family is religious, conservative and Asian, and at the time I found my sister a total kiss-ass and hated being in the same college as her. I was trying to rebel, hung out with a douchey crowd and did a lot of stupid stuff. This is not an excuse, but an explanation. So when she set me up with this prim-and-proper looking girl, I messed around the whole date, so my family would leave me TF alone in future.  It was bad.   


Well, this summer this friend came for a visit with my sister. I met her again on a group hike my sister had organised. I was pretty smitten at first sight, tbh. I had forgotten about her, but she hasn't, when I introduced myself she was like, ""Oh, I know you, my worst date ever. lol "" She wasn't hostile or anything, she roasted me a few times, mostly around stuff to do with that stupid date. The other thing is, my brother-in-laws friend was really into her and they flirted a lot. He even invited her to stay at his place in another city for ""sightseeing"".   
She stayed a week and we ran into each other a few times. She is just really cool and sweet, and she got along with my parents, who generally don't like anyone new. She also isn't religious or conservative, which I still don't like. Sometimes I felt like she was flirting with me, but she also said, she wasn't interested in dating, because she was newly single. We also had this really long conversation over a bbq, and I really think we would work well together.  
Because of the BIL friend situation, I didn't make any moves, he was also invited to most of the stuff. Also felt a bit insecure, tbh, I have had quite a few rejections from white girls.   


Today I heard that apparantely nothing happened between BIL Friend and her, even when she stayed with him for a couple of days. We have been exchanging some texts and photos from her stay, but not much else. But I just can't stop thinking about her and everytime I am on a dating app, I can't stop comparing. On the other hand, I don't know how it would work, she lives pretty far away and with COVID and all that, what's the point, right?

20,r4uoos,1638188533,Men: here's the top 10 most common reasons why she doesn't reply on dating apps (according to research),"**So, we did some research, and based on a sample size of 319 women, aged 18 to 54, here are the most common reasons why heterosexual women don't reply to men on dating apps - in order:**

1. The man became overly sexual too quickly
2. Man asked for their number too quickly
3. Uninteresting first message
4. The man asked for a date too quickly
5. Conversation became dull
6. More interested in their other matches
7. Felt unsafe to meet in real life
8. Became too busy with work / life etc.
9. Changed their mind having seen his profile again
10. Stopped using the dating app

**Methodology**

We ran a survey on anonymous panel base platform, PollFish. The question we posed was, *With 1 being the most, and 10 being the least, what are the most common reasons you don't reply to men?* with these reasons as options.

Women then ranked from 1 to 10, the most common reasons. We also shuffled the answers to avoid any kind of selection bias.

**Sampling**

Mostly even age splits across four groups: 18-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54. We used a qualifying question, *""Which of the following best describes you?""* and then gave five options to choose from:

* *Single, straight, and not using dating apps*
* *Single, straight, and using dating apps* ***(qualifying answer)***
* *In a relationship, straight, and not using dating apps*
* *In a relationship, straight, and using dating apps*
* *None of the above*

Note - Pollfish only collect results from those who qualify. Those who did not qualify were not able to take the survey. We targeted the survey at women living in the United Kingdom, aged 18 to 54, with mostly even age group split, but some bias towards the 25 - 34 group.

**Where to go from here?**

* Avoid getting sexual too quickly
* Avoid asking for digits too early
* Make sure your first message is perhaps a light-hearted question about their profile (rather than ""hi"", ""hey"", ""how are you"")
* Don't push for a date too quickly
* Be interesting eg. don't go into ""interview mode"" for example, try switching between questions and then statements, such as *""How did you get into \[job\]?"", ""Ah fair. Must be challenging. I love my job tbh - really passionate bout \[x\]. But not as passionate as I am about winning at Command and Conquer Generals""*
* BE FUNNY (in another study, we found the overwhelming majority of women want you to make 'em laugh)
* Have a decent profile - ideally get some pro photos taken, spell check, and BE UNIQUE",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r4uoos/men_heres_the_top_10_most_common_reasons_why_she/

I didnt think much of it and a few weeks went by and she texts me to ask me something about black friday because she knows that I used to work in retail, definitely something she could have easily looked up online.

At that time it was pretty rough for me but I managed to overcome the feelings quickly and now everything is back to normal, like it never happened (except that it's still a bit weird and we are sitting right next to each other)

Anyway, fast forward to now, I started to date another girl at work and I'm completely in love with her and we already had a few dates and last weekend we made out and cuddled and everything is just awesome when we're together and I think that she got the same romantic feelings for me, as I do for her.

Now to the question:
We are not in a relationship right now, but would you guys tell her if the question of past relationships/affairs arises?

Don't get me wrong, I would NOT tell her proactively if she doesn't ask  because that would be inappropriate but generally speaking I want to be as honest as possible and not make a big deal out of it. On the other hand, I don't want her to think bad of me or that I'm fucking everyone in the office.

So it takes more effort than usual to hook up with a girl if you are not super attractive. Which is fair.

But it is the same everywhere. Even on Tinder. If I show my location in, let‚Äôs say Paris, I get a decent amount of matches but if it is somewhere in Turkey, rock bottom. Zero matches. So Tinder is off the table too.

I know that I‚Äôm an interesting, fun and easy to talk to person, my first dates usually end on something like ‚ÄúI had so much fun, let‚Äôs do this again‚Äù and we do so. I also usually have long lasting relationships with people I‚Äôve met. So I have confidence in myself.

But it is the first interaction what makes things a bit difficult for me. You see, I‚Äôm not that attractive, so I need to be interesting. But in order to show that I‚Äôm interesting, I need to talk. BUT, in order to talk, I need to get their attention first. It is easy to do on Instagram or Twitter because people directly see my thoughts and they can have a good guess of what kind of a person I am. But it is hard otherwise.

I don‚Äôt want to wait for someone to approach me, I want to be the one who approaches. I want to initiate. Can you give me some advice?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r4v1mw/hooking_up_in_a_conservative_country/
24,r4v3c0,1638189987,Ghosted?,"So there's this guy. Let's call him Fred. Fred and I met a few years back at a bar/restaurant where we were mutually having dinner with friends. He walks in, our eyes lock instantly. We exchange numbers and spent the rest of the night drinking/dancing/talking. I ended up driving Fred home and he asked if he could call me the next day. We kissed and I was on cloud 9.

The next day he called and said he had a great time and asked me out. But come the day of the date, Fred was MIA. I decided to call him, and he said he was with family and completely forgot about our date. I was pissed, but Fred insisted we reschedule and texted me all night.

I didn't hear from Fred again. Not until a few weeks later when I got a ""You up?"" text at 1am. I didn't answer, and felt disappointed. I blocked him. I eventually met a different guy and we ended up dating for 5 years.

Cut to my breakup. I was feeling low and reconnected with Fred. He initiated sexting right away, which I was wary about at first since I know I'm not the only girl he's talking to like that (he has a player reputation and I know for a fact he adds random girls on social media) but then I got into it. I was so into the fantasy of this guy for years from one night of bliss and possibility. I also needed an ego boost after my breakup. So I indulged. This carried on for months, and about two weeks ago we finally decided to meet up. I thought I wanted some fun because he was hot and I was lonely.

I got to his house and we started kissing right away. I suggested getting drinks, so he got ready to go. Just before leaving, he asked if I minded if he took some cocaine. I was totally taken off guard because he had not said anything, and I didn't suspect him to be a user. He snorted a line before I could even answer. I drove us to the bar and we were there for about an hour or so.

When we got back, we started getting more intimate. We had sexted about numerous things, but me wanting him to be dominate was one of them. The guy is also really strong, so that mixed with cocaine made him extra aggressive. He took my neck in his hand firmly, but it actually kind of hurt. He reached down my blouse to pinch my nipple, which was too hard and hurt as well. He reached down and jammed his fingers inside me without warning which was also too hard. I'm new to BDSM, but I'm not sure this is how it's supposed to be. I told him to go easier.

We then got to a point where I asked if he had a condom. His answer was no. I thought WTF? We had sexted about him ""cumming inside"" but at this point I don't know him and he doesn't know me. I don't know where his penis has been. I told him I want to be safe. He said no, you're right and just said we would have sex next time. We proceeded to watch tv/make out/ cuddle for 7 hours while he snorted cocaine the rest of the night until around 7 am. I had to go home at this point. He walked me to my car and told me to text him when I got home. He kissed me a few more times and said he had a lot of fun/asked if I did too and that he would talk to me later.

I texted him when I got home, but no reply. I shrugged it off that he was just sleeping. But three days went by and nothing. I decided to snap him, which he opened right away but didn't say anything. I didn't think much of it, because he was working and he never snaps back while he's working. But when the weekend came, which is when he snaps/texts me, I heard nothing. It's been 2 weeks now and I haven't gotten a single text or snap from this guy. My friends think he's just pissed because I didn't give it up. But he seemed fine and understood my position when we were together. Not to say he didn't still try, but he didn't seem that upset.

What gives? Why would he say things like ""next time"" and ""text me when you're home"" or ""I'll call you"" if he doesn't mean it? He didn't have to say that. He could have just been like ""I had fun. Drive safe. "" and ended it at that? I'm very confused and it's messing with my ego. We have a lot of chemistry and I was excited to start something with him. Thoughts?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r4v3c0/ghosted/

27,r4vex5,1638191093,How to ‚Äúbreak up‚Äù when you‚Äôve never been official?,"Happy Monday Redditors! I am looking for some advice regarding a sticky situation I‚Äôve found myself in. 

Back story: In 2018 I started a new job. My coworker and I (only 2 in our department) formed a friendly bond. Both of us were married to other people, but we had a good work relationship. No funny business happened. 
Fast Forward to 2021‚Ä¶.we each split from our respective spouses (due to Covid, family issues, it was different for each of us) but remained good friends. My divorce is now final, his is not. 
Long story short: he wants me to be his girlfriend. We‚Äôve hung out outside of work (downtown with friends, work parties, kids activities etc). When he first asked me I was going through my divorce and told him I cared about him, but that I wasn‚Äôt ready to date him. So we continued to see each other outside of work in mostly group settings. He kissed me a couple of times which wasn‚Äôt horrible. 
Not that I‚Äôm out of my divorce fog I‚Äôve done a little OLD‚Ä¶.but the situation with my ‚Äúfriend‚Äù has gradually increased in awkwardness. He wants to introduce me to his family. He wants his kids to start hanging out with us. He wants to be official. 
He‚Äôs a great guy but there‚Äôs so many red flags. His ex is extremely volatile. She will show up at his place demanding to know who he is dating now. She even pulled a knife on him at one point. He also smokes weed literally ALL day. There‚Äôs some other factors too and when I add them all up‚Ä¶.I can‚Äôt be in a relationship with him. 
I‚Äôve stopped hanging out with him outside of work. I‚Äôve stopped responding to the ‚Äúhey beautiful‚Äù messages. I‚Äôve done everything except for telling him‚Ä¶.and this is where I‚Äôm stuck. 
I‚Äôm stupid for even getting remotely involved with a coworker. Should I do the ‚Äúit‚Äôs not you, it‚Äôs me‚Äù speech and deal with him at work? Look for another job? He‚Äôs hanging onto something that can never be‚Ä¶.

28,r4vgbm,1638191220,"Dating a guy who gives off mixed signals, am I over thinking this?","I've been dating a guy for over a month now, been on a few dates and each of them have gone really well. Conversation flows well, we have a good laugh, very comfortable around each other etc etc. 2nd date he made it known he was looking for a relationship, and he also asked me if that's what I was looking for. I said yes in a round-about way, but I would want it to naturally flow towards that etc. I'm not wanting to put so much pressure on it to completely fail as it mucked up my mental health before. 

So, getting to the issue at hand. He's not the best at texting, not the worst either. At the start there would be gaps of a few hours and what not, sometimes up to a day etc, so I grew used to it and it didn't overly bother me. Now, it's a different story, and after each date he will just not message for days after I send him a text, one of which is not intense and not dull either, but then once the texts do come back in he's game for organising something again...

Now when we are with each other, he is incredibly sweet and kind. Always complimentary, and I often find him staring at me or looking in to my eyes when he thinks I'm not watching. He makes comments/suggestions about us doing things in the future, whether it be planning some activities or actually travelling together to see different places. I'm up for all of it. He'll say certain things that implies that he's all in with this, or make small comments that would indicate he is really in to me, but then the above texting issue has slowly been eating away at my self esteem. I get that's something I need to work on 100%, and I am as I've been going to therapy for previous events that have happened in my life that have had an impact on who I am and my mental health.   


When he's with me, he will use his phone. Always apologises for it, but won't hesitate in texting whoever he is texting back. And I think that's what bothers me lol. I get that the texts could be for work, family or friends - and possibly even another date given we are not exclusive, but I openly watch him do this yet I'll go days without one after a date.. 

I don't know if i'm looking too far in to this or if my concerns are legit enough to maybe either have a hard hitting conversation with him where I just openly talk about how i'm feeling and also admit my feelings for him, or maybe accept that it might be better cutting my losses and moving on.

I just let it go and told her I'm now happy to try the friends thing (I really didn't know what else to say).

Eventually one of the nights we are supposed to hang out with other coworkers, everyone else bails. I ask her if she wants to hang out one on one and she says sure.

Throughout the night I felt like she might have been sending signals - nudging closer to me at the bar, applying lipstick and lipgloss right in front of me.

40,r4wj03,1638194654,My [M26] Perception of my Lack of Success is Getting in the Way and Affecting my Self Esteem. How do I Frame This Better for Myself?,"Since covid started back in early 2020 my social life disappeared. Now at the end of 2021 I'm trying to put something together and I'm totally flopping at it and I feel awful.

I did have some good connections beforehand. Throughout university I had some ultimately transient but still relatively good times with people I liked. Mostly hookups or short flings, but I did have one bond that's managed to survive it all, although he's now at the opposite end of the country with his boyfriend and consequently we're no longer spending intimate time together.

I spent my virginal teenage years beating myself up incessantly about this kind of stuff. I was always the bullied, quiet kid who could barely string a sentence together and it resulted in a very lonely childhood and adolescence which, despite having experience since then, I still feel bitter about for being a late-bloomer, for missing out on those early relationships. I worry I might be emotionally stunted because of it, not fully able to express myself in relationships as an adult. 

And so now that I've been in this position of isolation thanks to covid, and now that I've tried to put myself out there and haven't had any luck, these feelings of frustration and bitterness are at the forefront of my mind. I feel like a virgin all over again!!

Having confided in the small number of people I know who I can trust with this stuff, they've made supportive and encouraging noises but the biggest thing in my way is the profound sense of shame I feel at my lack of success, especially compared with them. Several of my friends have been getting into things for the past few months, and I'm falling behind them. I know it's not helpful to compare yourself to others but I can't help it, how else am I supposed to know what's realistic to achieve? I've been going out with friends, downloaded dating apps, even been to a house party last month, but so far there's just zero interest. I feel like I'm doing the right things - being out there in the world, focusing on developing a good personality and making connections in general, trying to be flirty if I notice interest, but I'm drawing blanks every time!

The impact on my self esteem feels tremendous. I feel like on some level I'm supposed to feel ashamed, because on some level it is reflective of my value to others. I feel that it is indicative of my social worth - if nobody is willing to sleep with me when most of my peers are able to get it, what does that say about me? It must imply some level of undesirability and untrustworthiness. I get that on one level it's luck of the draw and different people want different things but surely the totality of my lack of success says something right? It's not just that I didn't pull this or that person, but the totality of it. Why is it so difficult for me? I'm trying to put myself out there but I'm running into a wall no matter what I do. Surely it is easier for other people? It certainly looks easier, things seem to Just Happen to others simply due to circumstances they're in, while I'm pushing and pushing and pushing and getting nowhere.

I want to feel wanted, trusted, and sexy, and instead I feel unwanted, untrustworthy, and very unsexy, and very ashamed of myself for it. Because there is a disconnect between my desire and my ability to meet it, I feel like it means my desire is not that of a good-looking confident person who can believe in themselves and know they're able to get what they want, it's the desire of a pathetic useless virgin who watches too much porn and cries themselves to sleep while wondering what a kiss feels like. It disgusts me. I remember what it was like to *really* be in that position and I never ever want to feel like that kind of lowly person ever again.

Clearly I can't bring good vibes to something if I'm feeling like this, and even if I just deal with it by getting laid, another dry spell could bring it all up again!

(its a 60km drive to the other city so we go to the movies etc when we are there. Like  a whole day of hanging out together ) and we like to walk around shops and well pretty much look at whats ""trendy"" now.

Ooook sooo there is this shop that we always visit  that sells clothes and a really cute girl works there. there is always like 5-6  girls working there at the same time and when you get in  the one that doesnt have a customer atm will approach you and try to ""help"" you.

We went there yesterday and that cute girl was already helping some customers  so another girl came up to ask and to assist my friend (he was buying jeans). 

While he was in changing room I was browsing trough the store. That cute girl I was talking about looked at me  smiled and said Hey  ,whats up. She remembered us from before.

Basically we talked about nothing lol hows work, I see its busy  yeah etc. Now I dont even know her name or anything  this was the first time we talked that it wasnt her assisting us.   


Ive been single for 2.5 years now. I went trough a hard breakup that hurt me really bad. Ive been focusing on my self all this time , got new hobbies, new friends, better job, new car, lookin for my own place now,ive been working out so im in better shape now at 29 than I ever was haha and I would like to try to start datin again.

I have no problem talkin to and meeting girls but I just dont know how to turn that random talk into flirting /asking them out. I didnt have to date since I was 22 and my last ex gf came to me when I wasnt lookin for one. so Im ooout of the game.

Ive read that you shouldnt ask girls out at their place of work which I believe is true but there are exceptions. How would you guys proceed with this ? I dont actually have a plan but Im thinking of approaching her  just asking for her name etc. to get to know her a little better and see if she is even single.

Any advice is welcome.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r4xpnd/hey_guys_lookin_for_an_advice_how_to_ask_this/

49,r4y9vz,1638199800,Girl expressed interest in me on several occasions but now feels flakey. Getting frustrated.,"Honestly, I have no idea what I've done wrong here.

She is my friend's roommate. I was in an unstable relationship back in september when she first texted me and asked if I wanted to meet up. She knew I had a GF but also knew it was unstable. I told her I couldn't, but explained how I had plans to end my relationship soon and that if I was single I would be up for meeting her. I know this sounds bad. 

A month later she came up to me at a party talking and flirting for a bit before heading back to her group. At this point I had still not been able to break up, but that never really came up. I wasn't flirting back or suggesting anything, just being friendly back.

A couple of weeks after my relationship ended, I texted her. Chatted for about an hour before asking her out, and she agreed to that and told me she was looking forward to it, as did I. Turns out we had been to the same party that weekend but missed each other, and I'll quote her reply; *aww, too bad we didn't run into each other.* She had caught a cold at this point so we couldn't set up a date for us to meet. Almost a week passes and I reach out to her asking when she is free, but told me she had a very busy week. Another week passes and I ask again if she's free anytime this coming week, but she's again busy every night. I get that she is busier than I am, but come on, no free days in two weeks? I get that I might not be her top priority since we haven't been on a date yet, and that's fine - I get it, but it does feel a little disappointing none the less. If she changed her mind about meeting up, I just wish she'd tell me, I'm not sure asking her that is a good idea, but what do I know. 

At this point I am starting to feel bad about asking the same question over and over. So instead of just ending with a ""let me know when you're free"", I asked if she had any free days coming up in the coming two weeks or so. I asked in a way friendlier and less passive aggressive way though. No reply to that yet, but we'll see. Not sure it was a good idea to ask that in hindsight. If she finds a day, then great. If she can't come up with a day, I think I'll just give up. I know we will run into each other occasionally, so will be interesting to see how that plays out.

I don't really know what I want to get from this post, mainly just venting, but there's not a flair for that. But any advice is always welcome.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r4y9vz/girl_expressed_interest_in_me_on_several/

What's even worse is, I know that I'm doing better then most men around here who have have close to zero experience with woman. I'm good looking and have an interesting life and I'd say I have a decent experience with woman (10-15). I've done most of the sexual things, but never sex. Anytime I start dating someone, I lose them right before getting to sex.

Currently I don't wanna get into a relationship, just want to date around. The problem has always been logistics, I don't have a place so I have to wait for them to call me over or book a room. I got to that point with a few girls and every time we stopped dating at this point.

I have this crippling anxiety about it, and it's not like I have a fear of society or friend's pressure, it's more in my head. I'm so fucking anxious and actually angry at myself for not having it. I also have fear of not being good at it, since most of the girls I've met and will meet have had it and will notice I haven't... This anger and frustration is just making it worse and i feel like I'm chasing sex and because of that I don't ever get it.... I feel like I'd be at peace and have so much relief once I have it...

During that time the conversation was flowing and we ended up walking around, doing different activities, checking out different shops, dinner, etc. At some point, we found ourselves holding hands and at the end of the night making out. The conversations and making out continued back at her place. No PIV sex occurred though as she wasn‚Äôt ready to do so which I respected.

But the friend told me he felt bad that I didn‚Äôt invite him directly. And that he was really fond of me but I don‚Äôt text him enough or give him enough attention. Anyway. I called X over to my best friends house for a house party on Saturday. He came, but so did his friend and the girl, and another one of their friends. Now, X is super social and really worked the room. Made friends with and charmed everyone. However, wasn‚Äôt really spending a lot of time with me. The third friend spent the night hitting on me though. And kissed me before he left. Messy. 

At the door when I went to see him out, he said.. can I show you a magic trick? And kissed me. I didn‚Äôt know what to do. I mentioned it to X. And he‚Äôs been weird with me since.

After the party.. I texted him to say- the next time we meet, can it just be the two of us please? And he replied saying ‚Äúoh ok‚Äù.

Edit/follow up‚Ä¶I texted him about it. I told him it was weird and that I wanted to talk to him about it. He said why do you want to talk to me about this? With what perspective do you want to have this conversation? 

So I said look I called you there because I wanted to chill with you. You. Not your friend. And that thing with your friend was just‚Ä¶.. weird. And I felt weird. And I don‚Äôt know why I wanted to talk to you about it.

His only response was - well what am I supposed to say?

When I may show these people my art it freaks them out most of the time or they may say I give a negative image on women body's making them feel like they should look like this artwork for example, iv noticed alot of these women who have mentioned this though do not do art and I personally do think they take it too seriously for the fact that at the end of the day it's just digital art which isn't exactly supposed to be realistic one bit.
Overall digital art paints a negative image on the way people may see me and locks away my love life pushing people away, this may all be since to me not finding the right person but is there anyway I can improve on this?

After 5 months, (not from my influence, I didn‚Äôt really care) she decided to stop smoking weed. I believe that this was a large reason why we went separate ways, because WOW did her personality ever change after. She starting to just be more frustrated with the little things, constantly criticize me, and became manipulative, and because of this and some other reasons, we broke up and both new it was going nowhere for months before. My now girlfriend, we‚Äôve been dating for 16 months. I truly believe this is what real love feels like, I love everything about her. A couple nights ago, (she has some pretty serious anxiety) she told me she was gonna start using edibles to calm her anxiety down(never used weed until this point). And last night, she had taken one and kinda went off on a tangent. She shouted out to me all energetically about how she wants to move in together and how we‚Äôre gonna get married one day, but then brought up that they make her less horny so she doesn‚Äôt want to play around in the bedroom (we do it the same amount as most young couples, quite frequently). I do think I‚Äôm probably overthinking it, but this just makes me think of how this affected my last relationship so much.

76,r51wjf,1638209769,I [27M] asked out my crush [25F] and she said no. Is there anything I can do to make things less awkward?," We've been classmates and hung out for maybe a month and a half now. Circumstances weren't ideal, but a little over a week ago I decided to sack up and during a night out clubbing, I pulled her off to the side to ask her out on a date. She said no, and despite making out and some relative intimacy, she said she valued friendship above a relationship among some other explanation for her no which I don't remember apart from falling into the broader ""it's no you, it's me"" category. I do recall telling her that she didn't owe me an explanation, but she was insistent in wanting to give me one.

A few days later, we had lunch together which went fine. I wanted to take the opportunity to clear the air and address things up front, but I ended up chickening out and followed her lead in pretending nothing happened. However, there definitely seemed to be some unspoken tension - which I get, the genie can't be put back in the bottle. Since then, texting and such has dropped off a bit and she tries to turn what could be 1:1 hanging out into group activities, which I can empathize with given the circumstances.

Despite still feeling the sting of rejection, I really do value our friendship. I'm cursed with overthinking, so on one hand, I feel as if I should follow her lead and pretend nothing happened. However, I also feel this has the consequence of things having a perpetual awkwardness whenever we're together and inhibits our ability to actually hang out as friends. On the other hand, I want to rip off the proverbial band aid and acknowledge the feelings (and that I can keep them in check, maybe), that no one is at fault, and reaffirm our friendship and any respect for any boundaries that have been set. I see doing so as a way to address the elephant in the room, remove the cloud hanging above our relationship, and would allow us to move forward without lingering doubts and such.

I would appreciate if you internet strangers could lend me your perspective if I'm overthinking or forcing things or if having a frank conversation would be beneficial. Please do be frank and pull me from the brink if it seems I'm leaning toward the former.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r51wjf/i_27m_asked_out_my_crush_25f_and_she_said_no_is/

I met them on a dating app and have met all three in person so far and I can't decide on who I want to keep seeing.


Is it wrong of me to talk to all three of them? Even though nothing is official yet I can't help but feel like I'm being dishonest or betraying them..


I haven't talked to any of them about exclusivity yet, tbh it's too soon as I've only been on one date with each of them so far. Should I just pick one right now or keep seeing all three until I can get a better feeling of our compatibility?


I'm torn because all three are amazing women and each have qualities I would want in a partner, and all three have expressed interest in seeing me again.
I know I will have to choose at some point and that means breaking it off with two of them and that's gonna suck.


I don't even know what to ask specifically, should I keep seeing all three and if so, how tf am I gonna balance everything? Should I tell all three that I'm seeing/ talking to others at the same time in the interest of transparency? 


I feel like maybe I should date each one a couple more times to see, but that's a lot of time, money, effort, and could be emotionally draining..

Now he will NOT stop texting me. Asking me out. Telling me I‚Äôm beautiful. Saying he has always fancied me. I‚Äôm not interested, and don‚Äôt feel I ever did anything to make it seem I was. He is aware I‚Äôm seeing someone, as I‚Äôve brought the guy into the bar a few times. His texts are making me uncomfortable. I‚Äôve left all of them unanswered. 

I feel like I need to text him back saying I‚Äôm not interested, but I don‚Äôt know how to phrase things where I‚Äôm not hurting his feelings, and also so I can go back there. I‚Äôm also just always afraid of the backlash from rejecting a guy.

So we have been together for almost two years now and most of that time it has been a LDR for us, we see each other once a month for a weekend and sometimes it has been more than 2 months not seeing each other. It‚Äôs not ideal and we would both like to see each other more. I‚Äôm not concerned about him cheating or anything like that, it‚Äôs not in his character.

I‚Äôm going to also add here that he earns significantly more than me and is definitely able to afford being more generous. He certainly is generous with treating himself.
