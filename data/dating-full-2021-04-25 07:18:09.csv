I'm rather shy and introverted, but most usually I can get along with anyone if I have to. While I don't really have friends or a social circle anymore on the account that I moved a few states away into a city during the worst time to be around people in modern history. So, because of that I've been shut in and a homebody this whole time. I've enjoyed it since I don't need to be around people. Although, I've wanted to try dating again.

The glaring problem is I can't meet anyone... I'm no bar crawler or go getter, so I usually keep to myself when out and about. Besides, I'd rather leave everyone else alone and they leave me alone whenever I'm in public.

I just can't see any places conducive to meeting the type of person I'm hoping to meet. I've tried guessing where that type of person would be, but at best I could say they'd be at home...

We’re 9 years apart and I don’t notice the age difference. 34m, 25f. We get along like a house on fire, always laughing together. He tells me regularly ‘I laugh so much with you’, I know his friends, his family know about me but we haven’t been able to meet due to Covid. He used to call his parents every Sunday but since we’ve been dating, it’s become less and less. We normally see each other a few times a week, sometimes less or more depending on our schedule. He invites me to all the 'big' things in his life, for example, we were going to go to his medical ball together (he would've been seen with me in front of other girls if there is anything nefarious). When we drive or hangout in different areas together, he likes to look up the prices of houses. He's also said in front of me how cute kids are and that he can't wait to do that one day. Signs to me he's testing my reaction and seeing if I want that as well.

A few months into dating, he asked to make sure that we’re not seeing other people. He isn’t into casual sex and I think exclusivity is important to him. A few months ago I was anxious about what we were - he hadn’t asked me to be his girlfriend and I thought this is something that he would’ve wanted to do. He’s traditional, wanting something serious such as marriage/family. We had a few talks about the direction of our relationship, he said there were a few things he was a bit concerned about, a few things we maybe didn’t have in common (he’s very risk-averse and overthinks everything).

He’s studying so after that conversation he said he would decide at the end of his exams, his exams have finished now. He went away recently with some of his University friends, he was unsure of whether to go (seemed like he wanted to be with me, haha) and wanted to see me before he left. I’ve felt good about everything between us post-exams as I had a feeling he was going to slowly contact me less and less and try and see me less - due to his uncertainty.

One night on the phone, I told him that I wasn’t quite sure whether continuing to have sex with him was a wise idea as we aren’t boyfriend/girlfriend. He was confused that I said it was casual. I said ‘well, we aren’t in a relationship’ and he said ‘you are my girlfriend’ I’m certain he went onto say ’I thought we’ve known this since we started dating’ so I then asked him ‘well if I was to meet a new friend of yours that I haven’t met, would you introduce me as your girlfriend? And he said yes. Unfortunately, he has to repeat his exams so I may not be able to see him for a while, I do need to clarify that he actually meant this.I just wonder why he had this hesitancy a few times when we had the discussion a few months back though? There was even a point where I suggested we should end things because he wasn't so sure and he agreed. Maybe this is natural though and a reflection of his risk-averse attitude about things. There were just some uncertainties on his part. He said he could've been overthinking it. As a result, it sort of made me more anxious and I suggested we should end it.

He said it’ll be good to have a proper chat about things as we’ve both been putting things off, as so he said.

I got to his house, he said yes I have been his girlfriend all along and he doesn't know why I would think otherwise. He said that he feels it’s not going to work because of our age gap and he claims we're very different people. I personally do not see this as I feel like we share the same values, we're compatible in a lot of areas etc. He told me that he finds me beautiful, loves my sense of humour and that we get along and have fun together. I did mention that we handle conflict differently but our only arguments have been over text/call and since that's such a poor form of communication - it's hard to tell.

He started to cry (this is the most emotion I've seen from him), saying he won't be able to cook me any more dinners and our memories shared together. He then went back and forth and said he doesn't know if he's making the right decision, that he will never find someone like me, I am out of his league etc. He said maybe he's just one big idiot after all and he's made a stupid decision. I was calm in my response and he said ""why don't you get angry? this is making it more difficult"" in a somewhat cute way. He just kept saying that lately everything has been solidified in his brain that it's probably the most responsible decision. He asked me if I thought he was being unreasonable.

Now I feel like since we've been arguing quite a bit the past few weeks and he's been stressed, possibly his decision is skewed. I hadn't seen him in 2 or 3 weeks due to exams and I asked whether maybe we just got cold feet because of us not seeing each other. I remember months ago he said he sometimes questions us in absence.

We spent over 4 hours talking and it was like he didn't want me to leave nor did I. He then asked if we should go to dinner together. He finally walked me to my car and he couldn't stop crying.

Something in me decided to message him the other morning after I left:Me - Morning 📷 I don’t know if messaging you is the best idea, but I hope you haven’t woken up too sad. If you ever want to catch up on neutral grounds, a coffee or lunch, don’t hesitate - I still consider you a friend. Even under these circumstances, it was nice to see you last night and I am saddened I won’t be able to have more of them with you. That’s all 📷Him - Morning! I was in two minds as to whether to message you with the same sentiment 📷 I feel very much the same. Like you say it’s always nice seeing you, and it’s hard for me to think we won’t be sharing more moments together. I really hope you’re feeling ok today 📷 Enjoy the rest of your weekend 📷Me - Aw, well if you’re keen to catch up in a week to come or a few months, let me know. I’m trying to not make this any harder for us but it is difficult. I didn’t react with anger because that’s genuinely not how I feel about us. I miss you, enjoy your morning eggs 📷Him - Will do 📷 miss you too, at least you can have your eggs with olive oil today 📷Me - These thoughts are best discussed in person but I’m not sure if that can happen and they’re weighing heavy on me. I do think we could work through the issues as I feel there are more positives than negatives. I am aware that the past few weeks have been pretty nasty for the both of us but I’ve been particularly harsh on you. If I don’t hear back from you, I will, of course, assume you do not feel the same way and will accept your decision.Him - I thought I did explain that although the last month or so has been really difficult, it hasn’t been the main reason why I reached the decision I did. Of course I’m always really happy to talk to you about anything though, so if you still want to talk things through naturally I’m happy to do that 📷He went onto say that he hates that he's upset me and that it's all really difficult for him but he **thinks** it's all for the best.

We caught up and went to the beach together. We had a good time, he just feels at the moment he thinks it’s the best decision, although he isn’t fully confident he’s doing the right thing. He said maybe in a year it’ll make more sense and we realise we’re fit for each other. He said that he told his mother we broke up and she got really angry. Something was quite odd, he told me his friend (who I know) broke up with his girlfriend but they’re back together. We then went back to his for a cup of tea and we talked a bit more. He admitted that he does get in his head a lot and could be overthinking things. Said again that he's scared he's going to lose someone amazing but feels it's the right decision **right now**. Again, I feel because I've been arguing with him over text lately and he feels overwhelmed. When I left, he said he wants to see me again in a week or 2.

We spoke on the phone and I told him it’s really painful catching up with him and I don’t want to feel like an option to him or being left on the back burner, he said that wasn’t his intention and he would never do that as he has too much respect for me. He said it was hard catching up with me recently as well. He said he agreed to catching up because he felt like it was something I wanted. We spoke a bit more and he said that if he has a change of heart in the future, he won’t just sit on it. He’ll tell me. He told me he hopes I know how beautiful I actually am.

He ended up calling/messaging me over Christmas and NYE. I do feel like I am the one who predominately initiates contact with him first, I’ve been sending him sort of lengthy messages and he claims he’s overwhelmed by it. Recently we’ve been having an hour or so conversations when we usually would never have that as he was never one to speak on the phone. He expressed doubts about our break up as per usual and said he’s probably one big idiot after all. He told me he’s been on 2 dates with 2 girls as I asked, said he’s sort of interested but it hasn’t gone anywhere. I was quite upset and he assured me he wants to stay single for a while, he also said it’s not like he even wants a relationship with them. He said to give me some context that there were girls before we met that he was interested but it didn’t go anywhere. I was quite offended because he went on dates with girls that he basically broke up with me for. He broke up with me over an age gap but then went on dates with girls my age? Makes no sense. He said it’s all really regrettable and then told me that it's not that he wants a relationship with these people and said they’re just friends he wanted to get to know better. He said he wishes I could see his phone. Near the end of the phone call, he got teary about the fact he thinks I'm so sweet and don't deserve this.

He said over a month ago that a catch up would be good to clear the air. He also wouldn’t directly answer the question when I asked if he just sees me as a friend. I’ve decided to pull back, but it seems like he wants to catch up. At the start of this month, he offered to call about something, I think he was sort of surprised by that as I usually am jumping at any chance for us to speak on the phone. He sent me a message about the date/time tba (which I didn't respond to) and then he sent me a follow up message about a week later saying “Morning, when works this week for you?” with a smiley face. He then said whenever is fine, to choose a day/evening and let him know. He then said he hopes my mother is doing okay. This was 2 weeks ago and I didn't responded. He sent me another message 2 weeks later saying he hadn’t heard from me in a while, was wondering how I am and asked if my mother is okay. I replied and I was friendly, but brief. He replied and said a few things and then said ‘we never caught up in the end, let me know if you would still like to’ we talked a bit more and then I told him that I feel he just wants to catch up to free himself from guilt and that we can only catch up if we both feel it’s best for us to be together. He responded with saying that he understands and he didn’t think it would still be really difficult but he understands and there is a bit of truth in wanting to free himself but he thought it would be healthy in general. Apologised for the pain he’s caused me and wished me all the best. I told him that I just felt him talking about clearing the air was ominous and I just wanted to have dinner with him and not talk about us. He said that he understands how that could have caused it and apologies and said it’s the furthest from how he wanted to make me feel. I didn't respond and that was 3 weeks ago now. For my birthday, I never received a text from him and I didn’t receive anything over easter either. I haven’t heard from him since and in 2 weeks, that would be 3 months that have gone by.

As all couples do but I do love him, what type of love? I'm not sure.

He really has helped with many many things and I am so grateful for him coming onto my life.

The issue is lately... I find him very annoying. Please please guys dont hate on me. I'm just saying my feelings.

I think it got to that point because of many frustrations that built up.

I do not look forward to our moments spent together  anymore (in an LDR so, calls and texts.) When I try to be positive, he by default is negative.

When something doesnt go our way in a surprise he makes for me. He gets mad and when I say it is okay! He says, ""No baby. It is not."" Even when I dont even mind. Be mind so much that it seems like I'd have to mind.

He doesnt mean to be toxic, I'm sure. He means well, but, it always seems to make things worst the way he takes things. He has been through a lot and he treasures me a ton.

Today was our date night and we played a video game. He has NO CLUE how to play it and I try to teach him but he just doesn't get it. I understand to an extent.... their is a barrier between us by how he dowsnt know English as his first language. 

I tell him over and over. He takes long to get it or does not get it at all. Then despite my battle plans, he bolts out and fights randomly. He is not even that good at fighting yet. I'm trying to tech him but... he isnt open to learning it seems.


I try to kept happy and everything for him and me. Bit, we both are having a hard time in life and that is what makes it worst. Maybe I grew some resentment. . 

Then if I take beyond 10 minutes to text him back he gets horribly worried. Thinking I'm hurt or upset at him.


He beats himself up so much and I cannot help him, he doesnt listen to me when he thinks he 'disappointed' me when let's say for example, internet but off so no movie night. He would say like it's his fault and so forth.

I am young, I'm supposed to be free and happy and though I like, want out instill adore him but something is just not right... he wants to better himself only for me but he should do it for himself.... relationships shouldn't work like that.

I also feel kinda trapped like, I would break him if I left. He is so attached to me...

My life is just beginning to get up, I am gaining friends I adore, getting to be more independent and move for school which I dreamed for years. Then having free time... I wont have any free time cause that is his time. And his time with me is no longer fun.

I dreamed to be a streamer... but no. Can't really with him needing my attention. I wanted to live life to the fullest (life for me, not pulling any other guys into it)

But yes, I'm at this point where I love him and know he is sweet but he irritates me. Everything I found cute and romantic from him upsets me.

Life is looking up in so many ways.... is he bringing me down? That's not the main question of this post. I just want view and opinions on this matter.

And maybe ways to restore the relationship? Not sure.

Thank you for reading, this was not meant to be rude but kinda venting. Have a great night or day!

DATE 1 - We went for a walk and hit it off immediately. He asked for a second date before the first date even ended.

DATE 2 - Great second dinner date at his place.

CANCELLATION - We’d arranged a third date but when it came around it cancelled in the morning and said that he was sick. 

DATE 3 - Rescheduled when he was better. Another great date, again, arranging another one before the date even ended. 

DATE 4 - Another good date. 

CANCELLATION - On our next date he cancelled the morning of, because he had an eye infection. I asked him to send me a picture of it (he knows I love gore) and he did immediately. 

DATE 5 -  We ended up sleeping together after dinner and made to decision to only see each other. 

DATE 6 - Last night we went went for drinks at a local bar. He asked me to watch his phone whilst he went to the bathroom but said ‘actually watch it’, which I thought was strange. I just assumed that he was joking. Shortly after, his brother texts him and says that there is a family emergency. We drive back to his place and he calls his brother, who tells him that his father has had a heart attack. His family live 3+ hours away so he immediately begins to pack a bag. He drops me home and drives off to be with his family.

Prior to this message the date was going really well and we’d been almost falling out of our chairs laughing at each others stories

My question is, is it just pure bad luck that these things have cropped up when we had plans or is there more to this and if there is more to it, what could his agenda possibly be?

However, we've always had rough patches every so often. And when I say rough, I mean ROUGH. Yelling, crying, (him) name calling, then making up the same night.
Long story short, I wish I hadn't, but I put up with it. By the time we'd been together about 6 months, I'd tried and faltered and failed in about 8 attempts to break up with him. And then I got pregnant. To be honest, it's a miracle it didn't happen sooner. We'd used condoms like 3 times TOTAL and I was being a stupid horny teenager, but alas, I decided to keep the baby. A while later, our daughter J is born. She's my whole world, and for a while, things seemed okay. And then we figured we had more issues. J is almost 8 months old. Bf still lives with his mom, and my current living situation is not safe for a mobile baby. And so, we've begun looking for places to rent together. And then things got worse. We began to fight more. He calls me evil and treats me like a child. Just today, we had an argument concerning my coping mechanism of walking away from arguments for a few minutes to calm down so I don't say something horrible. He doesn't want me to drink, he doesn't want me to be on my phone so much, he doesn't want me to have guy friends, he doesn't want me to sleep in till noon. He's controlling and immature and selfish and then projects it all on to me.
I want so badly to break up. I'd gladly do 50/50 custody.
I'd happily coparent if I didn't have this lingering fear in the back of my mind that he'd try to get more than 50% custody of J through a court order because of my living situation.
Right now, his version of the plan involves us moving in, me being a stay at home mom and getting a WFH job if I can, and enjoying life to the fullest. My version includes a part where I get the job and then move into a studio apartment or with my sister when she gets her own place.
In hindsight, I see the red flags were going off like flashing lights in my eyes. I don't regret my daughter, but I wish I'd broken up with him before I'd gotten pregnant. I wish I could just cut him out of my life because of how undeniably toxic he is. I love him, but I hate him just as much. 
I need to stick it out for a little longer, I HAVE to. It's all for J. I just don't know how much longer I can keep up with this.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,735795,public,self,"I hate my boyfriend, but I'm scared to leave him",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/my3zel/i_hate_my_boyfriend_but_im_scared_to_leave_him/,all_ads,6,,,,

I'm 31 years old and i broke up with my previous girlfriend like 4 years ago. I'm currently just working on my grain growing farm and i don't really go out at all.

2 years later had some problems with my debit card and i went into bank to sort it out. There was this beautiful girl behind desk that was extremely nice to me. Well tbh its their job to be nice and i was too afraid of making any move because first of all she was working and i don't even know if she had boyfriend. Atleast she didnt have ring.

Bit later that year after i bought the farm and i was making bank account for my farm i met this same girl behind the desk. I went to her and she guided me to other room, where there was senior bank advisor or what ever since its not important. On our way there she tried to make some small talk to me and she clumsily just wanted me to know that she owns farm and she grows mostly oats. Like i was 95% sure she was intrested in me but we were already at the advisors door so i just went in and filled forms for the bank account.

On my way out she had his hands full of work because there was some people there in line so i just greeted her and left the bank.

Fast forward to this day i found her image in magazine about new farmers and about their farms.

With some detective work. Should i just message her in instagram since i have no idea where i could meet her in real life.

however, we used to be part of a slightly bigger group of people, six to be exact, and ever since we’ve met in that group i knew that this girl would be the only one worthy of my attention and time. nevertheless, everyone in our friend group was pretty much going crazy over her as she was always in the spotlight and had that very specific extroverted main character energy that everyone praised her for, and i was the quietest, most aloof one that they didn’t really like hanging out with. i quickly got jealous that she was getting all the attention, so i began initiating indirect conflicts between the members of our group so they’d eventually break up.

it really worked and i got rid of the burden of the group, without anyone blaming me, but when i thought about the true reason why i had done that, i think it wasn’t because i felt lonely and wanted the spotlight, but because i wanted to be the only one to talk to this girl and have her close to me. i despised the idea of her having any other friends or talking to someone else than me. as bad as it might sound, i wanted to be in HER spotlight, i wanted her to pay attention to me and me only. anyways, once the group broke up, we began getting closer, hanging out lots, etc.

whenever we went out and she had her phone with her i would always sneak peeks at whoever she was talking to, and always questioned her about the friends she had made, who she was chatting with (she had a very messy breakup after her ex cheated on her with an underage girl lol, and i was there for her and helped her through that terrible period of time), because naturally she had sought new relationships and connections after no longer having a boyfriend (they had been together for one year and a few months), and i began getting obsessed with knowing everything about everyone she talked to and whenever i got the chance i would encourage her to stop talking to them and talk to me only.

she agreed to cutting off some people that i had suggested her to cut off (not necessarily because i was jealous, more like because they were straight up creepy and predatory), and well, we started hanging out more and more. at some point, she had confessed to me, as in she confessed that she had romantic feelings for me, and i told her that i feel the same about her. when faced with taking a certain approach in this situation, i didn’t know what to do, i didn’t know if i actually liked her or i was just obsessed with the idea of being her only friend, so i told her that we should withhold our feelings and stay friends because a relationship between the two of us wouldn’t end well. she took my word for it and we kept being friends.

the thing is that i hate and love her greatly at the same
time. sometimes i dream about being in a relationship with her, sometimes i dream about us being the best of friends, and sometimes i dream about straight up humiliating and dehumanizing her in the worst ways possible. i always think about all of her flaws: she’s irresponsible, childish, extremely loud, narcissistic, egoistical, overly sensitive and emotional, dramatic, exasperating, demanding and tiresome, and try to think of a way in which i could fix her, but i’m pretty sure i’ve tried it all, and simply can’t do that. i hate her flaws, i hate the way she behaves and talks with people who aren’t me, or when it’s not just the two of us, and i hate that i’ve tried everything to help her overcome her shortcomings and it was all ineffective.

as much as i despise her weaknesses, she’s different with me, she’s caring, gentle and mature, and also knows me and my reactions so well, which is truly comforting. i get mad when i know she’s talking to other people, she has friends other than me or compliments someone else. once we were walking around a park and we saw some acquaintances of hers and she simply said “i don’t know them that well, but they seem really nice!”, and i got angry because of her assumption. not to mention the one time when she sent me a guy’s IG profile and said “he seems so cool” or something like that. it took a while to convince her not to talk to him.

these days we’ve been going out daily, just spending eight hours a day talking, walking and joking around, gossiping, listening to music and ranking our favorite artists, albums and songs, and just chatting about the most insignificant of things, and she’s been getting really flirty, flirtier than last summer when she liked me. for the reference, she says things like “you look so pretty today, i really have the most gorgeous best friend”, “i bet your [you know] is real good”, “your next significant other will be so lucky i’m so jealous of them”, “haha what if we kissed”, “no don’t worry about them, nobody is hotter than you”, and she says “i love you” a lot. i’m equally flirty, so i don’t know how to think of this. 

i have no idea if i want a relationship with her, i’m attracted to her psychical appearance a lot and consider her gorgeous, but at the same time i despise her? and i’m obsessed with the idea of having her all to myself, but i can’t tell if it’s in a platonic or romantic way. i don’t want for her to talk about herself, i don’t care about what she has to say, what she goes through, and even though i comfort her all the time about everything, i actually couldn’t care less. i just want her to listen to me and think of me as the best and only person she’ll ever talk to. it sounds like shit once written in this context, but i need advice, i guess? thank you lots for reading!",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,735828,public,self,advice needed. obsessed in a romantic or platonic way?,0,[],0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/my4cji/advice_needed_obsessed_in_a_romantic_or_platonic/,all_ads,6,,,,

I’ve reflected on the relationship over the last 3 weeks and have realised a lot of the problems so the first main one is the fact my parents are quite strict so like we can’t stay over at each other house and like even travelling the world my parents would most likely say no and we both are the type of people that love backpacking ect, so he told me he felt really held back by this and like he’s starting his life now but there’s still people holding him back( my parents), which I completely understand tbh especially since his parents are like high school sweethearts and also travelled the world young. Then the second reason is I could be toxic sometimes and had unhealthy mechanism  and he gave me chances before but I didn’t change before because I was only trying to change because of him and this time I want to change for me as well and I’ve genuinely made great changes so far and people have commented on it. Also in this time apart I have got diagnosed with complex ptsd which explains a lot of what I was doing which obviously doesn’t excuse my behaviours but I’m going to be getting therapy and like I feel like I am making a lot of progress and that combined with therapy will really help me and he doesn’t know this because we’re in no contact right now. Another thing that makes me believe that it could work this time is that I’m moving away from home and away from that toxic environment in a month( he doesn’t know this either) and this will make my parents not really a problem and my moods won’t change that drastically because the cause of my massive mood swings were usually to do with something at home.  I’ve started meditation and journaling which has helped me massively control my impulses and help my communication even my relationship with my parents have got slightly better as I am more calm with them when they say/ do  something toxic.  

But yeah our relationship was an amazing one like a week before he broke up with me he was saying how he was going to marry me ect and like we got on so well and went through so much together more than many other couples and he genuinely treated me amazingly. We both said we still loved each other and always will we still want to be friends and like the breakup wasn’t messy it was upsetting but we left on good terms. We broke no contact once and it was really confusing because there was so many mixed signals and we met up again( for closure as at this point we both thought we were fully done with the relationship) and I explained some things to him and he left my house and said I need to think about this more ( as In getting back together) but then when we got home he messaged me saying stuff like I think we got a bit too caught up in this stuff and he was like I want to be your friends and how he loves me so so much and I was confused because he said he was going to think about us getting back together, we reinstated the no contact rule for exactly a month but I still don’t know how he feels 

But anyways after this and the reflecting and therapy I’ve gotten past the stage of the breakup that I’m crying everyday and can’t do anything, I still miss him so much and want him back, but it’s hard because I know I have put him through a lot and a lot of it is my fault but I know for a fact this time if we tried again we would work and these problems would be significantly better but it’s just he needs to see that as well or we won’t work out. I just want him to be happy and best case scenario he’s happy with me but if it’s not with me that’s okay as long as he is. I just want to try my best now to try to make it work because I’m the future I don’t want to look back and regret it because our relationship was 100% worth saving. But also I’m so confused because was no contact a mistake? Will he completely get over me in that time? Like it’s like I’m in a limbo and don’t know if I should move on or try wait for him, but then he could also be out there completely living his life and moving on completely and I see some of his posts on social media and it seems his living his life and how could he get over a relationship that fast, idk it just makes me question things I’ve never had to question like if he ever really loved me.

I recently met a guy who I thought was wonderful,  we went on a date and I was very excited about him, but that completely flopped.

One of my (favourite, the kind that when he walks in we start insulting each other) customers found out I was talking to that guy (long story on how, I never involve my customers with my personal lives) and he came in on Friday to buy some motor oil from me. He asked me how all that was going and I responded  ""I swear I'm going to die alone"".

He told me he was probably intimidated,  because I seemed like a catch. I asked why he'd think that and he said guys get intimidated by independent and manly women like me, which I asked what that meant.

I own a house, a pick up truck, a snowmobile and have a dog. I do my own oil changes and tire rotations. I know how to pull a trailer and launch a boat. My dress attire consists of steel toe boots, jeans, leggins and sweaters, or flannel. I don't do my hair and make-up (I actually just think I look dumb with ny hair and makeup all done up). I work at a repair shop for transports. I'm not afraid to get my hands dirty, when the guys are busy I usually move tires around for them or do other menial tasks they don't have time for. Apparently I can have quite the mouth on me,  I can throw dirtier jokes than my male coworkers. My hobbies include fishing and snowmobiling,  quadding, boating. 

My customer said there's nothing wrong with that but I'll have a hard time finding a man that can handle a woman that doesn't need him. His girlfriend is a lot like me (she's another one of my favourite customers) and went thru the same thing before they met.

People pin women being bothered over men liking pics of girls to insecurity which it is to an extent but it has some layers to it and this is my VERY HONEST personal theory

1. women can shoot their shot with likes and easily get a dm out of it afterwards, so they assume it can happen to the s/o or the guy they are dating
2. the principle of it is the accessibility of the person he liked, if it's a celebrity or someone half famous living in a different country, that's out of reach. But someone from the same city that is not famous is accessible.
3. Why I think instagram likes should be taken more seriously than your man watching porn...

As a woman who enjoys watching porn, my purpose of it is to learn something new or get off and what ive learnt from the perspective of the male gaze is that men perceive sex as just the act itself and not about the person. Watching porn is already an objectifying act towards the actors in it, liking an insta pic however, is approving the woman's request to validate her thirst trap. The bottom line of an insta like starts from being quite an endearing form of interaction similar to how we get swayed by our s/o in the beginning of the relationship, they make us feel beautiful and appreciated.

4. What do women do when we breakup or are trying to get over someone? We often try to ""level up"" by pampering ourselves again and displaying it to the public. This is what we call ""peacocking"" but this is not the peacock world, in the human patriarchal world the peacocking is a role left to the woman. Posting pics is one form of peacocking and sending signals for compliments because desirability politics is systematic and our contribution to it is inevitable in someways. This does not mean women post solely for male attention since using our ""looks"" on social media can often gather consumers for ur brand; unfortunately due to pretty privilege people will pay attention to someones independent business just because they're pretty and have a lot of followers . So in my mind, your s/o validating women's ""peacocking"" signal can be perceived as a form of disrespect.

5. Other women can see your s/o liking other women's posts. It is often a feeling of embarrassment that your s/o has wandering eyes

6. If we were to sit next to our s/o and scroll in from of them, liking every thirst trap of a man that looks nothing like him, say men with beards and he has the inability to grow one, or men with bodies built like an nfl player and he doesn't go gym, they would probably not be bothered. Women we aren't built the same, especially those who believe in monogamy. Society has made it seem like it must be women doing the waiting and men do the chasing so they cannot connect the dots of disrespect when their thumbs are slipping on every woman's insta pic.

7. Remember that one guy in high school who used to ask for hugs from everyone that every girl thought was slimy, but somehow he was able to get some action from girls in other schools because they didn't know that we know he is slimy? your s/o constantly liking insta posts of girls gives off the same vibe.

8. We get likes consecutively or from the same guy often and sometimes think, ""this dude again?"" We think to ourselves, what if I picked the ""this dude again?"" guy to another woman as my s/o? That is embarrassing.

A lot of it comes from mixed emotions of embarrassment, insecurity (I have to admit) and the s/o not making us not feel secure enough in a monogamous relationship. This feeling should be validated by your partner if you feel a way about him liking women's pictures. if they can't stop at your request, there's a chance those wandering thumbs will to turn into wandering eyes which might not be far off from a cream pie.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,736245,public,nsfw,My DETAILED BREAKDOWN on why women don't like their s/o liking girls insta pictures,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/my9im1/my_detailed_breakdown_on_why_women_dont_like/,promo_adult_nsfw,3,,,,

We weren't talking that consistently for the first month but after that we were. He wanted to go on a date with me while I wanted to call first before meeting up in person but ultimately he didn't wanna call cus he wasn't comfortable/ didn't want to put expectations before meeting. I wasn't comfortable meeting cus of covid and all the cases so I told him let's meet when things calm down. Anyways, we still text sometimes and have a streak on snap (think I'm the only girl he's talking to rn cus he doesn't seem like the f boy type and barely follows girls on social) but it just hit me this morning that maybe I'm scared of meeting him cus what if I like him? We have a lot of the same core values and take relationships very seriously. He seems to have a lot of the qualities I like in a guy. 

I know that sounds bizarre to say cus isn't liking someone the point and goal of dating/meeting people. But idk why this just hit me right now. I feel like I've been using covid as a cover up for what I deeply feel inside and what's preventing me from meeting him. 

I have been in two relationship before. First  one was 2 years and he cheated. My second one was about a year ago (lasted 7 months) and I just had higher standards+expectations than he did for the relationship. I also had some trust issues with him cus I would see repeated behavior from how my first ex was. So I broke things off. 

So yeah here I am.. this guy seems great but I'm afraid of liking him, getting my hopes up and invested just to be let down again and lose the person. I mentally can't handle heartbreak just cus I have other things to focus on like my career+heartbreak puts me in a very low spot I never want to go through again. I have already opened up to him about some of my past and so has he. He knows I have some trust issues. A part of me feels like if I'm afraid of liking someone maybe I'm just not ready to date yet?

The ideal partner would be a feminine, metrosexual guy who you would share hobbies, literature and general life viewpoints that better relate to the modern woman i.e. he does your makeup, your hair, paints your nails, wears lingerie (look it up, it's quite common) and he is very much in touch with pop culture, celebrities, women fashion (he can even give you tips on your dresscode) loves broidery, women's movement, cats and knowlegeable about periods and feminine higiene.

I use that situation to make a comment when she looked at me and I said ""It seems like they are trying to kill us, what did they throw on our heads?"". She starts laughing and smiling and answers ""Seems like it's water"". And she starts conversation from there saying how she got late for the last bus now she's gonna lose her friend because she's impatient and we both laugh. She's asking me where I'm from, where do I live and we exchange some basic info about ourselves and I ask her where's she going to and she says she's going to campus. 

In the meantime bus arrives, she's constantly flirting, playing with her hair and smiling, asking me questions about me, bear in mind I didn't introduce myself, nor did I ask for her name, and while we are standing in a bus we talk about our favourites places to sit and she says she takes this line often but doesn't like sitting and asks me for my name and my surname and how old I am, do I know a certain person from my city, she's texting her friend in the meantime  she's still flirting with me, I'm showing confident body language and our conversation flows naturally. She asks me where do I exit and I say at city centre and asks me where I'm going, I say I'm going to my training session and she asks me what I'm training, I say I'm just working out going to the gym. 

After few moments of silence she tells me suddenly that she's exiting at city centre as well and she's changed her mind with her friend about going to campus. I'm like, this girl is showing all signs of attraction and I'm gonna ask her if she's interested in hanging out after we exit the bus. 

We exit and her friend calls her and tells her where she's waiting for her and we go into same direction, and I ask her since we are in the same neighborhood we should organize hanging out sometime and maybe you should give me your number, and she responds, I'm not very social person and I don't give out my number to someone I don't know very well. During our whole conversation she didn't move her hands from touching her hair constantly and was making eye contact and smiling. We keep walking for 5 more minutes and she tells me that this friend is the only person she hangs out with and it happens only few times a year because she's studying here and they are usually apart.

Here's how the story goes: me (24 female) is dating for a few dates with this really cool guy (25) I met online.

Background: I have done the online dating before but last time a ""relationship"" came out of it that ended fast again because I noticed I was just used for the lonely nights/weekends. So I am kinda careful. Because sometimes I am just naive. And I know people usually date multiple people and not always want something serious. That's fine...that's online dating...

Anyway this guy is SO my type but I am holding back with developing any feelings because he told me he is not looking for a relationship right now. Because he is too busy for that. I got busy too, but I could manage a relationship... I would be ready for it but I thought ""Hey let's try this casual dating too"" (bc the guy is cute and we are in a similar life situation, maybe casual dating is a good choice then??)

Before our first date we called and had so much to talk. We were vibing! I liked that we have the same humor (he laughes at my jokes!! YEY) and were interested in each others lifes (I think he is such an interesting person). He seems like a honest and straightforward kind of guy which was sooo refreshing. He knows what he wants and compliments me in things nobody has told me before.

First date was a walk in the park, we talked for hours and he wanted to see me again. Second date we had dinner at his, I slept with him, since then we meet once a week or every second week (depends on how busy we are) We talk a lot still when we meet in person, sometimes he calls me but he is not much of a message person. Which is fine.

But he told me again ""I just want something casual"" because he is too busy with his job and studies (which he told me from date #1). I made myself busy too these days but still I could make the time for a person I am interested in to check on them and ask how they are. But I don't want to text or call too much because he doesn't want that responsibility to always be in touch - therefore ""casual dating"".

But what can I do to not get hurt from things and how to do the ""casual"" dating right? I guess one big difference to a relationship is that you are not constantly in contact or feel the need to meet often? But that doesn't have to mean he is not enough interested in me to WANT to see me?

So I wanna start by saying that I have zero experience with dating. I know that texting online will not improve my dating skills and that I gotta talk to women irl (Im a straight guy btw). I only feel comfortable talking flirty with women that are in an environment where I spent a lot of time daily, for example at work.  The problem is, there are no women in production. There are in the offices and a couple of them may walk by once in a while, but most of them are taken/ married so I wouldn't wanna be that guy who hits on married women. At the same time, my colleagues who are married are drooling all over the women who come out of the offices and I can tell by the way they look at me, that they probably think I am like those guys. Like if a female goes to the toilet they literally wait until the door opens so they can look at her again which is disgusting (especially considering those guys are married).

Before the lockdown I used to go to the gym daily, but most of the ones I saw often were already in a relationship. I also have a problem with small talk and talking to strangers in general. In fact when I go to the gym I don't talk at all, just go there to do my workout. I did catch a couple of girls looking, one of them was probably single because I've never seen her with anyone. The thing is, everyone there knows that I don't talk and every time I talk with a female they look at me as if they are seeing a ghost or something. Not that I care but it is annoying af.

You may say that I should start by making friends who may know somebody because a lotta people find others through contacts. But the thing is, I don't want to start talking to the guys there just because I wanna find a girlfriend.

Now there is a new lockdown taking place here, and I see that on Fridays and weekends people still hangout, be it friends or couples because they still have contacts. But I feel like I am trapped in a hole somewhere. 

I go to a park to workout because gyms are closed and there are some chicks there, but just like the gym I can't tell if they are with some of the guys there or not. And talking to random females while I am not that talkative with other people can make me look creepy, or at least that is how I feel, like a creep.

I am becoming frustrated with this dating process and want to take myself off the apps and not pursue anything for a while.

will call Will on vacation. 

Coincidentally went on one date with his roommate before Will and I slept together on our first date, and so the roommate and I stopped talking, obvi (I didn’t know they knew each other until I met the roommate — I feel kind of bad for hopping into bed with Will; the roommate reminded me too much of my ex and I was pretty drunk the night I slept with Will. It was definitely an impulse decision. Roommate and I had only gone on one, admittedly amazing, first date so I don’t feel *that* bad, though roommate seems the sweeter of the two — my ex was very charming / appeared sweet so I guess I got spooked). They’re still roommates even post-vacation so not sure if that’s relevant to this story or not but I thought I’d throw that detail in there. 

Will and I got along well but I don’t think either of us really sees the other as long term potential, though for me that’s mostly because of the circumstances / the timing. It takes me a long time to evaluate someone for an LTR and I didn’t get enough data to rule him out, but I also didn’t get enough data to change my interest from platonic to romantic. I like his interests and his demeanor. We would message a little every evening but, to me, it was nothing too emotionally intimate so I found the conversation quite dry. I think he mostly was reaching out to keep me in his back pocket for when he had time to meet up again, though it was me who initiated the 3rd and final up “hang out” in his hotel room ;)

Anyway, that was probably a month ago or so now. I work remotely, so my plans were to go to NY, and I told him as much. I always knew he was going to LA, though he is technically based in SF. We definitely never planned to meet up again and I think we wanted it to stay a nice memory. We haven’t messaged since he got on the plane. 

Well, one thing in my life led to another and I actually ended up in SF the past few weeks, and I’m now out in LA, close to his neighborhood, very briefly, to see a friend who’s also briefly in town that I haven’t seen in over a year. I’ve been busy this weekend seeing her and her kid that was born before the pandemic / meeting some of her friends while here. Since I am very busy with work this week I’ll just stay here until I have time to make the drive back up to SF and finish my business of finding an apartment there/seeing family (probably next Saturday). 

The thing is, I’m thinking of reaching out after my deadline to this guy just to say hi? I’m not really interested in hooking up again tbh. And idk if he would be either anyway. Let’s just say that out of curiosity / uncertainty about what to do I did a quick test on Tinder by limiting age and location parameters and I’m all but 100% certain that he swiped left on me (and never reached out via text). I have gold and he never appeared in my likes and I definitely purposely swiped left until he was like the only person left in the neighborhood lol. If i hadn’t done that I probably would have blithely reached out but now I don’t know. I’m a very gregarious person by nature, and I like making friends. but I don’t have much experience in dating / hooking up after being in a relationship for a long time/ that was my only sexual experience. I don’t know if there’s certain etiquette or boundaries I would be crossing by reaching out. To me, he’s just an acquaintance who I have happened to sleep with. If we hadn’t slept together I would 100% ask if he’s free for coffee and not feel a thing if he was “too busy” or didn’t reply. But because we’ve had sex I don’t know how to act or feel. 

TLDR: slept with this guy. He seems completely uninterested, but for some reason I still want to meet up to chat over coffee. Would it be weird to reach out? Am I being delusional? I would like to be friends but I don’t know if that ship has sailed or if he’s even interested in friendship with me. If we hadn’t slept together I would 100% reach out and say hi.

I am 21F and I’ve never been in a real relationship, so I have no real idea what I’m doing and could use advice.

I am a lesbian. This means that even though I live in a larger city, my pool of potential partners is pretty small, and identifying them in the wild is exceptionally difficult, so I’m relying on dating apps.

I do not want children, and I’m mildly on the autism spectrum. Because, of course, this had to get more complicated.

Finding a lesbian who does not want children, that I am compatible with (does not infantilize me, does not claim I need to “get over” my sensory issues, etc.) and I am preferably attracted to? That seems like an impossible task, and I am getting slightly frustrated.

I feel like it’s not unreasonable to have standards that go beyond my absolute dealbreakers. But finding someone who even meets those? That seems like one in a million.

So the other day I went on a date with an old co-worker of mine. She showed high interest and I had a great time. The date itself went great but as the title says I made a few mistakes. First major mistake I feel I made was that I didn't go for the kiss after our first date ended. The stupid mask make things awkward where instead of just going for the kiss, I have to be like ""Take your mask off"" first and it just kinda got to me and I got nervous. I sent her a text the next morning saying I had a good time and she responded positively. Second mistake I feel I made was when I texted the day after our date, I told her to let me know when she's back from her trip so we can make plans at a bar I wanted to meet at again. On the surface it doesn't seem bad but generally whenever I tell anyone ""Let me know"" usually they don't get back to me regardless if its platonic or dating (just a people thing since most people don't like initiating plans). Usually I don't have issues with these things but quarantine has made me really isolated for the past year so I've become more socially awkward and I haven't been dating a lot during the pandemic so I got nervous.

It's partly my fault because I'm out of mental energy to try and keep a conversation going when I have nothing to build upon and the girl often isn't giving any effort. Probably because most of the girls have far more matches and have far less energy for the same reason that I don't. 

I also blame my self because of my nerves. I get anxious to meet someone and am afraid it won't go well. It also doesn't help that I mostly match with people who are 2 hours away. 

I'm not sure what my point is. But I think I'm realizing I should just take a break. I'd love a relationship. But I don't have the energy to force something with someone whom I don't belong with.

 I've definitely come up with many excuses and blamed society. Or dating apps or what ever else. But I do take responsibly for a lot of it. I could have met a few girls that I had chemistry with. But I just can't gather enough energy to meet them. 

I think it may be best for me to just sit back and not try so much. Let the process be more natural. And just meet people purely as friends.

1.1. do you know right away if you want to be with that person for the rest of your life or are you in a relationship with them and only after a while you start to develop serious feelings or start to see the future with them?

2. if you have had thoughts of breaking up does it 100% mean the relationship won’t last? you like the person they like you, you respect each other, everything is okay but you have had thoughts of breaking up. not because you don’t like the person or they don’t like you or they treat you badly but because MAYBE it’s just a bad phase or you are not sure YET. 
(my answer to this is - NO it doesnt mean that but what are your thoughts?)

3. is having sex rarely a dealbreaker? let’s say you love the person so much, they are everything you have ever wanted in a person, you see a future with them, you want to have kids with them, you want to marry them BUT the only problem is - their sex drive is lower than yours. they think having sex once a week is enough but for you it’s not. what would you do?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,736599,public,self,can you develop serious feelings if you havent developed them yet?

She is very attractive, has a great personality, and doesn't give across an ""easy"" vibe, so logically speaking she should have no problems whatsoever. But for some reason almost every guy she has dated has ended things after they slept together. And no, it wasn't just ""top 10%"" guys, she's shown me pictures and some of these guys should have considered themselves lucky that she even glanced in their direction. I reckon it's just down to bad luck. 

Anyway, so we met up for drinks the other night and she told me that she has a new dating strategy which she calls ""male reparations"". Basically she'll go on dating apps and match with guys who appear wealthy, whether that be because of their job, outfits, or the locations or their pictures. She'll then send them a bunch of flirty messages to tease them and turn them on, and initiate a date. It's always somewhere fancy and expensive, but they agree to it because a) they can afford it, and b) the teasing leads them to think that the date will result in sex. She then shows up to the date dressed to the nines and looking amazing, and flirts with them hardcore, but won't kiss them or anything. Then after they've finished eating, she pretends that she needs to use ""the bathroom"", leaves, and blocks them on all platforms.

Her justification for doing this is that after years of being degraded and used for sex by men, and being made to feel like she was worthy of nothing other than her body, she wants them to know how horrible it feels. They lied to her, lead her on and used her to get what they wanted, so now she's doing the same to them. She says it's fair and a ""balancing of the scales"". She also said it makes her feel empowered and has helped her to gain her confidence back.

What are your thoughts on this? Personally I don't think it's that bad seeing as at least she's not putting anyone in danger. And if it makes her feel better about herself, after years of being made to feel worthless by men, then I'm in favour of that. I also think that seeing as so many men lie and manipulate women to get what they want, yet it's so normalised and they almost always get away with it, what's the problem with a woman doing a bit of manipulation to get something for herself for once? However, I can also see why people would be bothered by my friend's strategy, or think it's petty.

There is this girl at work who began to sit across from me on my breaks at work. I started talking to her and before i knew it we would/could talk about just about anything. She would ask me what my weekend plans were/ i would ask her

She would also ask me what i was doing after work. She took a genuine interest in my life/school/ family. Would get excited when we had something in common

Very awkward and shy when she would first sit across from me. Only started the convo 40% of the time. Other times she would just sit there and look at me until i said something. Would always blush/smile. 

If my break was 15 minutes or so she wouldn’t leave until i got up and left. Seemed to genially enjoy talking to me. Applied the rule that if i were talking to another dude i would be uncomfterbal here with this type of silent behavior but seemingly just enjoying my presence. 

There is no way she is interested in me as she is a 9/10 in my eyes and im maybe a 3 at best. She is athletic i am not. 

I am genially friendly and a lot of people like to great me when they see me. Talk for 3-5 minutes. But usually don’t take breaks with them. When ever someone would great me i would try to include her in the convo as i know she is shy but she would only smile at look at them then get on her phone until i was done. Really cant figure this out. 

Seemed to get slightly annoyed if someone took my attention away from her. Or if she saw me talking to another cute girl on the sales floor she would turn around and flip her hair and i think intentionally made me see her walk away.  

Another thing i truly cant figure out is when i would be sitting down talking with her. On quite a few occasions she would speak so softly i couldn’t hear her and i would ask her to repeat herself 3-4 times until i would just go with it and act like i heard her. Really confused as to why she wouldn’t speak up. 

After about 6 months of talking at work i asked for her number and texted her the next day. We texted for about 2 days then i asked her on a date. She said she couldnt because of covid and a household family member had health issues. I took this as a rejection and told her i wouldnt talk to her anymore. She then said she really liked our relationship and i didnt have to do that. Why would she say relationship not friendship if she rejected me? I told her i would think about it and she insisted. We talked the next day at work like normal. That night i texted her saying i needed space to get over my feelings for her. She said she understood. The next time i saw her she looked really sad and almost like she was about to cry. I felt really bad by cutting her off, i realized i should make amends and the next time i saw her i approached and she told me she no longer wanted to speak to me. Now when i see her she still looks sad and takes her breaks byherslef. I dont know what to do as i really enjoy taking to her. Any ideas on what went wrong? Also is there any way i can fix this as i really liked her and enjoyed talking to her. 

I did ivite her to a real public place and the more i think about it she seems to take weird and extra precautions at work

She also seems very very shy from what I can tell and doesnt like talking to many people. 

We texted alot on the first two days. I sent her a message on the third to which she didnt respond. Then i texted her the next day and we resumed texting where i asked her out via text 

To add on to this if she wasnt interested romantically but she liked me as a friend. Why wouldnt she tell me that instead of making up an excuse?
