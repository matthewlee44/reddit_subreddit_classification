1,psavx9,1632196373,Went on two dates with a girl thought things were going great. She very suddenly pulled back.,"Matched with a girl on a dating app, for the second time. First time things kind of died off but this second time we really hit it off and we both remembered each other. The first date we went on a walk for 3 hours so things obviously went great. We had a ton in common and things went smoothly. Texted me right after she’d like to do something again soon. Texting me things that clearly show she sees a future with me, examples being saying she wished she meet me a long time ago and talking about how we could work together in a relationship (love language/personality types). Got a second date scheduled and basically texted non stop for the next couple days. 

We went out to dinner for the second date. I unfortunately got into traffic that google maps couldn’t predict and was about 10 minutes late. Because of this I was a little rattled when I pick her up so things were slightly awkward and I apologized. At dinner we talk for almost 3 hours, a lot of things come up; family, substance use, faith, politics. We were different on some of these things but there is not one thing I can point to that’s a definite red flag to her at least to my understanding. She also was very aggressive about paying the check, I tried very hard to pay but she got the check before I could. We go for a little drive afterwords conversations is going great except I think I was using swear words more than her liking. I eventually drop her off, I wanted to kiss her but there were a lot of people around and someone behind me waiting, so no kiss.

I texted her late that night, thanking her for a good night. She replies and says thanks and that she had fun, I then reply saying we should do something again soon and she says something to the extent if she has time because it’s going to be a busy semester. I basically just say I get it, let me know if you want to do anything sometime. I was very taken back. I have never had someone show so much interest in my on a dating app and never had a first date go so well. I noticed the next day that she deleted her dating account, didn’t deleted our conversation but got rid of her whole account. 

The next day I get a call from a friend. Tells me he was at a networking event and runs into someone and comes up that he is good friends with her roommate. He was over at their place and apparently he said she seems like a gold digger and was all excited about a date she was going on because the guy made a lot of money. He wasn’t sure but he thought the person she was going on a date with had a different profession than me. 

I’m just really lost on this. The way she was talking to me and her response times would led me to think she would have a hard time balancing that with different people. I also don’t know how much weight to put into this random guy and the gold digging because it is obvious she comes from money and even payed the bill. 

Anyone have any thoughts on what could be happening and if it’s a good idea to reach out to her again? (it’s only been 3 days). I’m just very frustrated because I can’t come up with a reason and I liked her a lot so it’s troubling me. 

My best guesses:
-Was coming on too strong and realized she wasn’t ready for a relationship and freaked out.
-She really is seeing someone else and decided she likes them better. 

TLDR;
Went on two dates with a girl and thought things were going amazing. Texts me that she thinks she may be too “busy” to do something again.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/psavx9/went_on_two_dates_with_a_girl_thought_things_were/

6,psb37m,1632197139,How do I (23M) proceed with gf’s (22F) parents who keep trying to end our relationship?,"TL;DR:
I met a girl from a wealthy family and fell in love. Now, I think her parents are trying to end our relationship. Should I try to work it out? 

A year ago I met a girl on Hinge. 
We got into texting and FaceTime (because COVID-19) for a few weeks. I knew nothing about her except that she was very intelligent and had interest in literature and activism, which was refreshing because my southern town is a tourist destination where girls just want to party and hookup. We finally planned to meet and so she invited me to hangout at her family’s place. 

Turns out, her family has a multimillion dollar house on the beach with an elevator, pool, tennis court and they have homes in Europe. Our hangout ends up being a dinner with her parents grilling the shit out of me. I absolutely choke up on questions about my parents (my father is an illegal immigrant, and their relationship is ending because of domestic violence) and about my current school situation (I had dropped out because of finances that semester, paying my own way through school). I ended up lying because I was really nervous (to the point of puking) and caught off guard by this. 

Her mom later realizes that what I had said at dinner wasn’t adding up and concludes that I am just a pathological liar who her daughter met online. We still end up going on dates and becoming exclusive but her mother disapproves and refuses to talk to me when I would come over. It even got to the point of her not letting her daughter come over to my apartment. 

Fast forward to today. My girlfriend is finishing her senior year at a college a couple hours away. I have gone up there half a dozen times to see her, which her mom doesn’t like, but doesn’t seem to raise a fuss. My gf has fall break next week and had planned to come stay with me for a few days. Out of the blue, her mom booked a flight from Europe back to the beach house and says they need to work on my gf’s law school applications and that because of that she won’t have time to stay with me at all. 

A few months ago, we started discussing moving to the same city where she ultimately decides to go to law school next fall and potentially moving in together. I initially thought it was a crazy idea because of her mom, but I agreed that I could pull it off because I landed a really good remote programming job with a startup so moving wouldn’t be an issue. 

Now, after discussing her mom coming back to the US, my gf is shying away at the idea of us moving forward for the long term. She told me last night, “let’s just continue this relationship until one of us feels like not continuing it anymore.”

My question is, how do I proceed? I feel like I am more invested than she is. I’ve been the one to go to her house, to pick her up for dates and drive hours away to visit, lots of times,  which has required both money and taking time off work. I feel frustrated because I’ve put in a year of effort and care. 

Do I cut it off now? Or do I find a way to continue?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/psb37m/how_do_i_23m_proceed_with_gfs_22f_parents_who/
7,psbb5g,1632198024,What's with the double standard in interracial relationships?,"OP - 19 years old, HBCU student (currently on semester break), victim of whitewash accusations

Throughout my whole life, people within my family and from my school years have always thrown whitewash accusations at me in one way or another. It's not because I'm out-of-touch when it comes to Black culture or anything (I know my culture and history very well), but it's mainly because of the way I sound. People say 'I speak ""properly"" - many people assume I'm British, even - and that I don't speak in slang nor broken English.' As you can imagine, I've been ostracized by the majority of my Black peers and finding Black friends is very challenging, especially when all it takes is speaking only a couple of words before the mocking and whitewashed accusations are thrown at me. This has also made dating within my race very challenging. 

I have had two girlfriends, both white, and I've been met with a lot of criticism from my ostracizers and within my family. It happened so frequently it became a shameful thing for me to talk about my girlfriend nonetheless hang out with her without receiving dirty looks from people. Even with me not being in a relationship, the fact that mostly white women found me dateable still had me up for a lot of criticizing. However, I notice whenever Black women date white men there's no whitewash accusations thrown their way. No criticism. No ostracizing. Nothing compared to if a Black man were to do the same thing, and I've seen many examples to know this. Even in movies when the Black woman dates a white man, I don't see anybody saying ""Oh, she should of went for a brother!"" or ""There was no Black man who wanted her?"" as they would if the roles were revered. It often makes me question, if some Black women love talking down on a Black man for talking white, being good in school, and being interested in white movies and video games like Star Wars, what do they see in dating a white man? Do they essentially see the same qualities that they've ostracized me for? Or, is it because it's inherently ""white qualities"" in a white man rather than a Black man? The same goes for nerdy Black women who date and marry outside of their race. I'm not saying I'm happy for them or they shouldn't be together (before some of y'all start putting words in my mouth), I'm just trying to find out why this double standard exists. I can only assume its a Black masculinity thing.

I've googled this question and looked up I dunno how many YouTube videos only to find mostly Black women saying we \[Black men\] ""pass down"" all the nerdy or in-our-league Black women in our lives. That's a hasty generalization, and considering I'm a pretty open minded person I don't consider that accusation to be pointed at me. They also say its because we have the same poor hygiene as any other stereotypical nerd. Again, hasty generalization. I take care of my hygiene and presentation so it's not that either. Others say it's because we try so hard to be Black we're not honest with ourselves. Again, another hasty generalization. I don't try to be anything other than myself. I want to find someone who accepts me for the person I am and not someone who I have to wear a fake mask around constantly. To sum this up, a lot of it is just hasty generalizations.

I do want to date, marry, and start a family with a Black woman one day. I really do. This lines up with not only my goal but also my mom. In her words, she would always say, ""I want you to date a strong, Black woman! No Latinos, and definitely no light skin girls! I'm talking about a dark skin woman!"" But that's going to be a challenging think to do based on my experiences. As you've read at the top, I'm an HBCU student. I'm not fortunate to have been on campus (thanks to covid), but when I do can I expect these things to be different? I'm going to be surrounded by Black excellence, shouldn't I expect a change in mindset from where I'm originally from?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/psbb5g/whats_with_the_double_standard_in_interracial/

16,psbvnh,1632200360,Anyone else just feel too strange?,"Hello! Gay 17/M “kissless virgin” here looking to start dating. This is gonna be a pretty disjointed post so I’ll try to separate each section.

1. Social anxiety/no understanding of dating dynamics 

2. Life philosophy and goals are too strange to be relatable to other people 


I’m both looking for personal experiences and advice for my specific situation. I’ll start with the social anxiety part:

1.
So I’m in a pretty uniquely fucked situation socially. I haven’t had any friends since 6th grade, and I’ve been in online school since due to social anxiety causing other medical issues. This means I went from ages 12-15 without talking to anyone my age, or without talking to anyone one-on-one without my mom present. She would usually take over the situation whenever I started blundering, so I never really got outside of my comfort zone until recently. My main source of income is from my small tarantula breeding business which has allowed me to interact with customers and other breeders, so I’ve been able to break out of my comfort zone and handle myself pretty well in social situations by constantly pushing myself  in the past two years, but unfortunately these situations don’t really help when it comes to dating. I have absolutely no idea how to act. I’ve never called someone outside of store associates or family so I’m worried about how it’ll go. I guess I’m looking for a basic rundown on unwritten rules you’d give to two toddlers who speak English fluently looking to go on a pretend date for their kindergarten social interaction class.

Q: what are some fundamental (maybe obvious) unwritten rules of dating? 

Q:how often do you typically talk to someone before and after a date, if it went well?

Q:how can an emotionally underdeveloped person understand the nuances of a relationship? E.G I’m the type of person to ask “are we boyfriends now” like a child, or “do you still like me,” things like that.


2.
The other issue I’m getting is just being too unrelatabe and strange. I’ve been an anti-natalist and anti-theist/satanist since I was a child. My main goal in life is to travel and explore, I have no interest in a typical career or stability in any form. I’m looking for an open relationship, I have the strange upbringing as I’ve mentioned, and my hobbies are ultra strange and borderline creepy. (Taxidermy &amp; preservation, entomology, tarantula keeping (I have over 90, sometimes thousands) body modification, occult &amp;oddities, I collect my own toenail shavings, dozens more, just a fuckin weirdo) anyone else feel this way? I’ve downloaded a few dating apps just to see what’s up without interacting, and everyone seems so well adjusted. They have “normal” hobbies, work standard jobs, they’re looking to settle down with someone and a couple dogs, or maybe even adopt a child. Have you ever gained a connection with someone only to be turned down after they discover your hobbies and interests? How do those of you with alternative lifestyles deal with dating/relationships?  

Q:Have you ever gained a connection with someone only to lose it after they discover more of your hobbies/interests?

Q: how do those of you with alternative lifestyles deal with dating and relationships? 

Q:how do you bring up more obscure/extreme life philosophies tactfully?

Q: do you feel as though most people you’ve interacted with have been willing to cut some slack, or is it really just that one in a billion chance that someone will reciprocate interest? 


I have a genuine interest in other people and want someone to share my life with, but I just feel too strange. I know a lot of people on here say they wish they were gay because it’d be so much easier to find dates, and I feel like that’s true for hookups, but finding someone you connect with in a much smaller pool of people just seems so hard.

19,psc6vw,1632201602,Need some feedback on how a date went.,"Went on a coffee date (1st ever coffee date. I usually like to do something more active like top golf or bowling; to me that’s more fun and a better way to meet somebody on a date) with a person that seemed pretty interesting. 

Got there early. She arrived a bit early too. Told her where I was; maybe it’s just me but her eyes told me she was not into it from the get go. We greeted each other, I went in for the quick side hug. She looked to not have wanted one; maybe it’s just me. She also seemed a bit nervous at the start.

Conversation starts with the general things; work, upbringing, goals, grad school. She’s smiling, I’m smiling. She’s a nice person, but felt we may have too much of a different upbringing; (shows she watches, places she’s been, music she listens too). I get her to laugh several times. Don’t think it was ever an organic lol laugh. She did seem to blush several times, turning red.

Eventually, it’s getting hard for me to continue to bring up topics. she didn’t really bring up any ones herself to ask me unless it was a counter question to something I said. I’d say about 3/4 of the way through I take out some notecards I made that have questions and icebreakers on them. She didn’t seemed dazed by that, I play it off, explain why I had them, she laughs.

Conversation continues; at this point I’m just trying to keep it going with no lull. At some point I apologize because I forgot something I was gonna bring up. Throughout she was using her phone a little, but did apologize for it, explained why.

At some point we were showing each other photos of our dogs. That’s when I noticed she had like 80+ notifications on a dating app.

The end to me was pretty odd. She ends it saying she needs to go get grad work done., it’s getting late. We both remark that we had a good time talking. I’m the one that asked for her number at this point. We say goodbye at our table; she exits one way, I the other. It felt off to me since it seemed she was in a rush walking away.

I sent a text later just saying I had a great time, apologized for being a bit nervous, asked if she was down for something more active next time, and if not , that That’s ok too. Let her know the work she does is pretty noble and left it at that.

The date lasted 1 hour and a half of just speaking. Didn’t feel like time flew by but it didn’t feel like it was dragging the entire time either. Gut feeling is that I’ll be ghosted and there will be no second date and I’m ok with that.

When I later officially asked her out, she provided an excuse and didn't try to reschedule, but she still kept messaging me first.","Title, basically. I should also add that she's kind of shy, at least that's what I could gather from what she's told me in past conversations. I've never seen her in person, only through social media, but we've video called a couple of times so a catfish scenario is impossible. 

So yeah, we were talking one day (2 weeks ago) and a particular activity was brought up, so I hypothetically asked her if she was interested in going with me. She expressed excitement in her response and said she'd love to, and I guess I got a little excited as well and officially asked her out 3 days later. She gave me an excuse (a believable one I guess) but she didn't try to reschedule. She still kept messaging me first but neither of us brought it up again, since I'm pretty certain the ball is in her court now and I did all I was supposed to do. 

I've asked her what she was up to a couple of times since and all I ever get is ""not much, chilling at home"". A few days ago I guess I got tired of this going nowhere so I killed the conversation we were having and left her on ""seen"", and she hasn't messaged me since.

23,pscifa,1632202967,How to Interpret Signals," Hello,

Just to preface, I am a guy who is looking for different viewpoints on my current situation. I am trying to be as careful as possible so that I am not in a position to be flamed for being controversial as I am very new to this kind of thing.

So I'm a freshman in college and recently I've been able to find a group of friends. Lately I've noticed there are signals that I have noted that I'm being super careful not to misinterpret.

25,pscl65,1632203308,How to Interpret Signals," Hello,

Just to preface, I am a guy who is looking for different viewpoints on my current situation. I am trying to be as careful as possible so that I am not in a position to be flamed for being controversial as I am very new to this kind of thing.

So I'm a freshman in college and recently I've been able to find a group of friends. Lately I've noticed there are signals that I have noted that I'm being super careful not to misinterpret. So recently this friend group planned to go to a school hosted movie as a group and some people weren't able to make it so it turned out to be a girl and her roommate but then her roommate got a headache and had to go back to their dorm leaving just me and this girl at the movie. For me this was the loudest sign I could look for but the reason I'm still unsure is that the few times our group has met up (granted we're barely a month in and I don't make friends as quickly as this may lead you to think) the girl I'm talking about hasn't really seemed interested in getting to know me to a point that I would think that both of us would be super comfortable with each other.

Again I just want to mention that if any of this is triggering anyone in any way other than ""omg this guy is soooo dense"" please please let me know so I can fix it. Another thing is that I have never been in a relationship before nor do I know anyone who has been so I seriously am in the dark. Any help/advice is much appreciated.

26,psco9z,1632203700,Would it be weird to ask for feedback post rejection?,"Especially after dates you felt went really well. Or even after multiple dates with a specific person.

27,psctcr,1632204290,Advice to the people who have no luck on dating apps,"Backstory: Throughout my twenties I have met every girlfriend of mine in person, it was not that difficult as I was young and fairly attractive and had plenty of friends. Eventually I moved away from my hometown, I was older and had zero friends, no connections and I stuck out like a sore thumb so my only option became OLD. For the first year I struggled hard with getting matches, securing dates and executing flawlessly on the date, I found myself obsessively consuming content on the subject of dating through books, podcasts, seminars etc. I took what I have learned and put it into practice and I ended up averaging 10 matches a day, with a high rate of dates until I eventually met my wife. Here is what worked for me, I hope it works for you!

This is for Tinder and Hinge; it can apply to other apps if needed.

PICTURES: I see so many people here saying that they feel they are attractive and have posted updated pictures and got them professionally done. This is great, but are your pictures telling a story? Are they too professional? First of all, please do not ever post selfies of yourself inside of your home or in the mirror, this could drive away a lot of people, as it did for me. Make sure you have photos of yourself outdoors, with friends, with your mom maybe? and doing an activity you love. This shows you have a social life and you do have your own interests, it also can be a common interest that boots up a conversation. Next with photos, what is your brand? In the marketing world, establishing a brand is essential in attracting a customer base. It is the same with dating, what image are you portraying and how is it received by the end consumer? If all of your photos are of you in a basic white t-shirt, it gives off a ""average person"" vibe and it makes you blend in with thousands of other profiles. You need to niche down and find your lane and stop shooting so broad. WHO ARE YOU?  Kickass Rockstar guy with a leather jacket and a bunch of piercings? Entrepreneur with a suit and gold watch? Maybe the mellow surfer gal or guy who lives in surf shorts? either way, express yourself through your clothing and photos, it gives off confidence and shows that you know who you are. I urge you to brand yourself into a niche market. It also attracts your ideal person with common taste and lifestyle.

CAPTIONS: C'mon yall, stop taking this so seriously. You don't have to list all of your favorite movies in chronological order with a synopsis on why you liked each one. Keep it simple, keep it funny, keep it honest. I usually just put a few stats - my height, hometown and interests along with a funny joke. That's enough. Don't overthink it, you wanna give off the vibe that you don't take OLD too seriously.

WHEN YOU MATCH: Do not be to eager, wait a little bit. I know it sounds shallow and like a game, but it shows you're desperate and women especially hate desperation, they can sense it a mile away. Wait a little bit, and try to make a joke from something on their profile, show that you're intelligent enough to read a profile thoroughly and come up with a witty joke. A simple hey does not make you stand out among the hundreds of other ""heys"". Try to connect on something quickly and build up some rapport, this is around the time you can start building up to the date proposal. Also make sure the proposal goes with the flow, seems natural and keep it light, there is no need to even call it a date. And this is to the men: stop being horny and eager, be a gentlemen please. And to women: a thoughtful compliment to a man will stay with him for years.

ON THE DATE: Well you did it, you're on a date with someone! Congratulate yourself for putting in the work. Have fun and enjoy yourself. Do not hope that they will like you, hope that you will like them. You got it from here, be yourself, the one that's meant for you will love every bit of that.

Last note: If you are finding yourself feeling worthless based on dating apps, you don't need a partner, you need therapy. Do not seek validation from strangers on the internet, be confident in who you are and do not let anyone shatter that.

Or can they show love differently than how they’d like to receive it. I am in a new relationship and I don’t really want him to ask to take a quiz. 

I would have to guess and say his LL is acts of service, since it seems most guys are, but also because he does things like: tidy my house before he leaves, does my dishwasher without being asked, likes to cook for me. I’d also say he likes physical touch.

34,psdshn,1632208813,Is my GF justified for saying she can’t kiss or sleep with me anymore? Am I right to be mad at her?,"First 3 months she was SO sexually and romantically into me. Wanted lots of sex, complimented me sexually and physically a lot, couldn’t stop kissing me and always talked about how hard it was to stop kissing me, how she misses my lips, etc. 

Just 2 months later, after I’d pressed her several times over the decreasing sex and kissing, she said “I’m attracted to your spirit. I’m no longer sexually or romantically attracted. I’m physically attracted, but when we kiss, I don’t want more. What if I can’t ever kiss you or have sex with you again? I’m not feeling sexual lately and I don’t know if it’s you or just period. I’ve not dated many people like you have. I don’t know what’s going on with me but it makes me so mad at myself that I can’t give you what I want. Maybe I just need to date other people and see if it confirms my feelings for you or not. But you deserve better.” 

My thoughts: 

The thing about not dating much is BS - she was indeed out of dating from 22-39 (15 year marriage then 2 years off), but has now been with like 5-6 guys (including me) in the past 2 years and been on tons of other dating app dates. And a *committed* relationship means you don’t just decide “oh, I’m not as attracted to you as I was, so I’m gonna go see if I’m more attracted to someone else.” That’s not commitment. She got a skin infection on her face that looked pretty bad for a while - I didn’t just say “sorry, not attracted anymore.” She has some scars and I didn’t say that either once she revealed them a few weeks in. And people who are committed don’t dump their partner if the person gains 15 pounds or starts getting wrinkles. Also, I’d understand being less attracted. But going from OBSESSED with someone and unable to keep your hands, lips, and eyes off them to saying you can never kiss or have sex again? Come on. 

I don’t feel this was fair of her. This loss of attraction also happened right after the honeymoon phase. I don’t think it’s fair to jump ship just because the person turns out to be a bit different than the idealized version you created of them during honeymoon. 

Am I right that she’s being unfair and uncommitted, or is she fair for naturally losing attraction (not her fault) and deciding she can’t kiss or make love or maybe even be with me anymore? Is she simply being honest about feelings she can’t control and I should be understanding? Or should I be pissed and feel betrayed?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/psdshn/is_my_gf_justified_for_saying_she_cant_kiss_or/

36,psdt13,1632208883,How would you go about communicating to someone that you’d like them to make more initiative if they show their interest in other ways?,"I’m especially talking those who seem to have more of a passive or reserved personality.  

In my case, the last person (M 25) I (F 23) was casually seeing would text me everyday and initiate conversations or keep them going whenever they fell.  And compliment my photos on stories on snap.  He even admitted to nerves after our first date.  But I always initiated meeting up.  Ofc he’d enthusiastically agree and make concrete plans with me.  Even pick up the tab when I offered to split. 

Not initiating meetings and overall not taking charge would personally confuse me overall about his interest.  And it isn’t one of those “if he wanted to he would” obvious cases.  Because I’d feel like if he was some sporadic texter or convos were one sided, I could easily ghost and move on.  But him initiating convos and engaging in asking q’s and others signs made me feel there’s a chance he’s as interested and I can’t ghost like that.  We mutually agreed to take a break due to unrelated life circumstances.  

But basically I’m wondering in the future, be it with someone else or if he and I pick up again, how to handle cases like this and communicate with them that we want equal initiate and effort.  For me, I think I prefer both of us equally taking the lead.  Because I like having control but also like feeling like it’s equal energy-that the relationship, long or short term, is a product of two partners both working together as a team to build it.  And those who are direct/straightforward and still take charge initiating and making moves-their interest is one where you’re always clear where you stand and have no doubt.  For me, situations where the person is passive and reserved like the guy in the above scenario, are cases where I also believe in not expecting people to be mind readers and at least communicating our preferences/expectations to follow before deciding they aren’t worth our time and energy.  I also think those who are passive/reserved ought to know they come across as not that into the other person because assuming it’s a pattern, not only are we possibly doing a favor for people they may date  down the line.  But if they ever have to wonder why people like me, who know what we want and won’t stick around for less, lose interest they can get a clue.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/psdt13/how_would_you_go_about_communicating_to_someone/

But if I stop looking and I don't get what I want, won't I just end up more desperate?

39,pse2ql,1632210209,Maybe it's the byproduct of Covid or maybe this is just a normal current state of Meeting/Connecting from a Digital Kick-off,"Thanks to Covid I've finally thrown in, have both the big ones, Tinder &amp; Bumble downloaded this year like others. 

I'm not someone who carries on digitally with someone I don't actually know or yet to have met. A few pictures a blurb or so doesn't tell me if I'll connect. For me meeting someone is the only way to tell if there's connection because I get the full effect of someone - mannerisms, personality and energy - and then determining if we both want to pursue getting to know one another deeper, whatever that is or may be. I don't rush anything or go in with high expectations especially when meeting online/apps; just open with a level of genuine curiosity... 

After having built a connection, then texting and messaging makes more sense to me because I have an idea of who the person is and their cadence or context in how/what they write; I rather not have a very long winded back and forth because personally, I can't decipher vibe nor spark without having met and spent some time talking - only commonality and initial interest is what I can glean via messaging someone new. That's a baseline. But I mostly encounter the opposite, seems the norm is endless mesaging rather than using an app to plan to meet and get to know one another somewhere in the real world. 

It's the in-person conversations that are great when they go off on tangents in depth and there's real dialogue with someone new you're into (and that is what gets me into them) so that you can create anticipation for what may be... but, even then another hurdle, there's got to be a level of deep interaction, picking up on conversational cues to delve into things to truly understand someone. This doesn't happen with basic small talk type of conversations... you know the type I mean like work, travel and going out drinking etc aren't topics that tell me a whole lot or much about someone on their own, it's more nuanced than that. Maybe I'm wrong but liking travel or liking having a night out somewhere nice or hanging out with friends is common.... Work can be a layered conversational piece but only to an extent. Other things to discuss where someone says something different is usually a pivot point in a conversation that can evolve and tell you a lot about that person, but a simple ok and brushing past like some factoid doesn't carry onward a conversation. Alternatively barely mentioning something that the other than asks or comments on only for you to brush past it doesn't help create much dialogue or let them know you want to be there. It just shows a  lack of interest and so doesn't make the other person bother trying to continue to navigate a conversational piece that would allow you to get insight into them. So, it all just devolves into shallow chatter at a point, initial interest feigns. I don't know. Maybe it's Covid throwing some of us off our respective game, some of us have lost our social skills. 

Idk maybe it's just me, pretty faces are everywhere (that saying they are a dime a dozen, at least in my city) they are no rarity but past that what's between their ears is intriguing... it's what you get to when you show initial interest and have that time together to talk to learn about one another... however you manage to get to that point, if you do. Lately I feel like most people's conversational skills are limited when connecting through apps. I give what I get, I can only dive into things if you're interested in it... the old adage conversation takes two isn't full context, conversation takes two with ability to ask probing questions, understand someone, have some world views or unique opinions is what it should be... 

Dialogue takes enthusiasm and interest from both parties otherwise it is just benign small talk. Been having far too much of that lately, some online then some of those leading to IRL. Then again maybe it's just me, maybe it's just those I've had interactions with this way, maybe they just simply are engaging in these shallow conversations out of sheer boredom or as a distraction from life.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pse2ql/maybe_its_the_byproduct_of_covid_or_maybe_this_is/

First of all, I am terrible with noticing men are checking me out. I’ve had friends and family tell me, guys check me out a bunch of times. They’re obviously looking when I’m not cause I look their way and see nothing. The few times men have come straight to me to say their intentions, they’re always perves, I may not be experienced but I know a perve when I see one. 

Another thing is, I find it difficult going to a bar and looking at a man and saying, oh he’s hot I’ll go for him. I honestly don’t perceive people as hot, I only start seeing men as hot after I get to know them. Personality is huge for me. I actually don’t find actors or models hot, which according to my friends is weird. 

I also, don’t wear makeup. I’m a bit of a tom boy, and I fear that’s a huge turn off for men. Sure, men say they want a girlfriend who is into the same things they are, but how many actually mean it? I don’t know, I just feel like I have to change who I am completely in order to find someone. And I just don’t know if that’s right. I’m also not romantic or sensitive, which sucks because women are expected to be. 

Lastly, after spending 24 years on my own I honestly don’t know how to invest my time in someone else. I fear that if I ever do find someone, I’ll be very selfish with my time. I’m an introvert, so I like being alone for long periods of time. I really don’t want to do this to someone else. Dating someone is something you have to take seriously, and I just fear I wouldn’t be able to keep up with a boyfriend that is clingy. Clingy to me is seeing them everyday and keeping in touch every hour of the day. 

I know this kinda deviated from my first question, but does anyone got some advice? Or am I just not made for relationships?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/psfgku/how_to_tell_guys_im_interested/
51,psfjeb,1632217816,Girlfriend found me back on Tinder,"I met this girl on Tinder about 3 months ago.  We started dating and she asked me why I unmatched her.  I told her I had deleted the app.  I remember how she smiled.  We have been together ever since.  Seeing each other regularyly.  

We were in my car the other day.  I was driving and had my phone on to navigate with GPS.  While I was driving there was Tinder push notification that came across the screen.  

She was in the passenger seat and asked “what is that!”  She seemed rather upset.  I told her how I have a nervous habit of browsing online dating profiles.  I do it when I am idle.  Like waiting in line at a drive through.  

This is the truth.  I haven’t messaged anyone on the ap.  I just do it to see how I match with.  What should I do?

64,pshg8r,1632226294,"DAE feel like dating advice doesn't really work if you're really ""special""?","Hello there,

I feel like dating advice surely works for most people, let's say 9 out of 10. If you fit well beneath the common bell curves (height, weight, beauty, finance, lifestyle, whatever-wise) you'll find someone because you can choose out of a pool of people that are into you. For some, it might take a while because they might lean to the sides of the belly curves but they will still do fine.

But if you are ""special"" in some regards, let's say obese (which you can work on) or have an astounding facial asymmetry (which you can't really work on besides surgery) or are abnormally short or tall (can't fix it), most of the dating advice won't work because you just don't have enough people who would be attracted to you in the first place anyway.

I am slowly realizing that the reason why I've never had a relationship is because the pool of men who are into my type are really rare (just a side note: I'm a super petite, flat women who happens to be a WOC living in Europe). Somehow realizing this calms me down because now I feel like I know the reason and I know that it might take a few more years and meeting hundreds or thousands of men to find the one who is attracted to me and vice versa.

It’s been a month, and I feel like I’m going backwards, not forwards.  I tried all the great unhealthy options and they didn’t work. Getting blackout drunk with friends, casual sex, swiping on apps til I get a blister. Some genius is gonna tell me I just need to let time pass but I’m crawling out of my skin and time is standing still.  

Fuck you T.  

It would be easier is you weren’t so god damn gorgeous. I used to be able to just stare at your face for hours. You could go on and on about some reality show you watched and I would sit there hypnotized, watching every little expression on your beautiful face. You’d put on a tight dress I could talk you into wearing and I’d take you to the most outrageously expensive restaurant I could find. And now I have a phone full of pictures of you that I use to make myself cry.  

It would be easier if I didn’t agree to let you go. I could have given up on what I want from life and given you what you wanted and we’d still be together.  

It would be easier if you didn’t treat me so good. The way you could look at me and instantly know what I’m feeling, where every other person says I have a poker face. The way I could have the most difficult conversation with you without fear. The way you would let me go on about whatever boring thing I was excited about that day.

And then we hit that one dead end that I couldn’t fix - that I don’t want to fix - that you blame me for not fixing even tho it was your choice too.  

I need you so bad. Fuck you. I never want to speak to you again. Please call me. I will break down when I see your face again. I still wanna be friends. I’ll never forgive you.

I never used Tinder. The only time I ever scrolled left and right was during one night with friends and I was using one of their's phone. It was one of the most despressing things ever. I mean, literally, why would I want to post myself on an app and say whatever on my description so people could swipe me left and right?   
The problem that I'm facing is that this type of instant hookups makes me look at people in a different way. As in I'm looking at them and I see how cheap they ""sell"" themselves and for what? For a few drops of dopamine that will not supply the need for oxytocine and serotonine. 

I could be wrong, since I'm a demisexual and I do seek deep bondings with the people i surround myself with, but isn't that what we all do, subconciously? To bond? To matter? To change each other lives in a positive, or even meaningful way? 

***Absolutely no judge for people who do otherwise,*** but what's in it for you? In a world where you can have sex with anyone on an app, isn't the person with whom you cannot have sex more ""desirable""? In a world where you can see anyone naked on instagram, isn't the one that isn't naked that you want to see naked the most? 

I remember when I first fell in love as a child with a schoolmate. I fell in love with her because she said Hi and smiled to me during break time. I wasn't looking for a relationship or anything, it just **magically and naturally** happened. And I wasn't looking for a friend, I just got one. And I got to say, this type of relationship aren't quite possible lately. 

Am I thinking in a wrong way?  Sorry if I offeneded anyone, I'm just trying to get to the bottom of this so I'll push the feeling of loneliness away.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/psj47k/need_an_opinion_on_this_regarding_the_modern/

87,psjc1q,1632232900,“Lower your standards” isn’t really helpful advice unless you’re a woman,"Most guys already have pretty low standards that they look for in a partner. Guys are simple. We want to be attracted to a girl, and for her to not be mean. Not even, be nice, just not be mean to us. That’s pretty much the bar you have to meet for a guy to be interested in you. It’s incredibly low for women.

And let’s all be honest with ourselves women have a lot higher standards when it comes to dating. Anyone that says otherwise is either delusional and refuses to acknowledge that women have some aspect of life easier than men. 

If you’re unable to find a partner as a woman, if you even slightly lower your standards to find someone. Then you’ll find a guy that’s maybe not an 8/10 but he might be a 6 or a 7 with a good job, that’s emotionally available and attentive and possesses the other qualities you look for in a guy, and likely this guy is dying to be with you.

For men, if you’re lowering standards your then dating women you’re not attracted to which becomes a mess for everyone. Either that or you’re dating someone you know who’s treating you wrong. There’s not really a gradient to men’s dating standards as there is for women.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/psjc1q/lower_your_standards_isnt_really_helpful_advice/

89,psjrqo,1632234261,Why are so many people comfortable with cheating on their partners,"
To put it out there I know everyone cheats. Men and women both, everyone is capable of it. My rant is aimed more towards men because of a particular story that I had heard from my ex. 

My ex boyfriend used to be married, he told me a lot about his ex and the things that went down with them. He told me that he cheated on her at one point in their relationship. So me being the naturally curious person that I am I wanted to know how it happened, the chain of events that led him to cheat on her and he told me

He said he met this girl as the store that he was working at, he said she was incredibly beautiful and had taken to him. So after seeing her a couple times they eventually exchanged numbers. After talking for a little bit they agreed to meet up and after a few times hanging out they eventually had sex a couple times. They way he described it, how fluent all of this happened it honestly blew my mind. He was obviously attracted to her, he knew what he could possibly get from her and he got it. He went out of his way for this girl, did things that I can’t even wrap my head around like going to a bar and staying up for 24 hours to be around her. 

What’s even more baffling was that his friends were cheering him on. They encouraged him to have sec with this girl. He even told me that one of his friends at the time was constantly cheating on his wife and was cheating on his wife around the same time he meet this girl. But all his friends were telling him he should do it. His ex wasn’t the best person but I don’t think anyone should get cheated on. 

It’s just the principle of it all, it was too easy, it’s like for some guys this isn’t their own subculture. It’s honestly gross and I can never look at him the same after that. His reasoning for cheating was because him and his wife at the time were living in separate states and she wasn’t giving anything to him. I somewhat understand your needs not being met by your partner but I don’t understand cheating, I can’t grasp surrounding yourself with people who are okay with your actions and even partake themselves. 

I was disgusted, still am, hearing this. The excitement in his voice, he was proud of what he had done. He told the story in great detail, even thought it had been a couple years since this happened. I’ve lost all hope in long term relationship and marriage. I’ve lost all faith, knowing something like this could happen in the shadows and you wouldn’t even know it. This story haunts me, I’ve lost all faith in relationships.

92,psk2df,1632235129,Asked a girl on a date bit feel still I have a chance,"So recently I asked a girl that is also a good mate of mine put to dinner once the lockdowns ease. 

For a bit of context she had broken up with a short term relationship a few months prior. 

So anyway I asked her to dinner and she confessed that it was really sweet but she wasn't into dating accross the board period, she proceeded to ask that she hoped it wouldn't change our friendship, and me being who I am said of course it won't.

 Not long after we decided to have a phone call chat for a good hour and a bit about our lives and listened to her problems and all that. 

But a day or so after the phonecall and asking her to a date I couldn't shake off the feeling that I still could most definitely have a chance but I gotta wait a bit. Normally when I have asked a girl on a date and they have said no, any sort of romantic interest goes away instantly but this time around I for some reason still have this feeling that I have a chance with her despite her saying she wasn't interested in a dinner date. In one hand I feel like a total creep for thinking that but in the other hand I feel I should pursue this and try again later on so I don't later on regret for not remotely trying.

99,psl22i,1632238045,Appropriate Birthday Gift Options When Dating for 4 Month,"Hi!

So I’ve (29F) been exclusively dating someone (30M) for about 4 months. 

His birthday is in 3 weeks and I want to get him an appropriate amount of gift(s). 

One of my love languages is gift giving - it’s how I show I care for someone. Typically I’d buy a ton of things and wrap them but given that we’ve been together only 4 months (and not in an official relationship) I want to keep it appropriate. 

He has been looking for a specific pair of shoes but hasn’t had luck finding them. So I search for a day and found and bought them (~$120). 

I was also considering gifting him 2 concert tickets ($30/each) to a band I know he likes so he can take a friend. We had discussed buying the tickets prior but I have another show the same night so I can’t make it. 

Outside of that I’m struggling on what to gift or do. I don’t want to it to be too much but I want to show him that I care about him. 

Any advice is welcome :)",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/psl22i/appropriate_birthday_gift_options_when_dating_for/
