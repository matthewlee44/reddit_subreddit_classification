      "Just want some feedback So went on about 5 dates with a cute guy who approached me at work. Second date he kissed me. All the dates after that always included some light make out sessions. He's a really sweet guy and a gentleman. Was always asking to spend more time with me (which was a bit hard due to my schedule) and we texted every single day. He started asking me to hang out at his place after work (which is late at night). I turned him down the first two times because I was concerned that be might be expecting sex which I wasn't ready for at this stage. However I eventually texted him one night and said if the offer still stands I'd love to come over. I went and we had a really good night watching shows, cuddling, making out. At one point I asked what he's looking for and he said he'd just like to see where it goes. And then asked the same question. (I'm not good with words at all) but I said something along the lines of not being in a rush, I'd love to see where it goes too and we can take our time, but didn't want to be too casual. (what I was trying to say was that I didn't want to have casual sex but I don't think I got that across properly). He said ok and the rest of the night still went well. In fact the cuddling was even better. He walked me out, kissed me goodbye and gave me multiple warnings about the road before I left lol. However the next two days he barely said two words and I had to initiate most of the convo. He finally sent me a message saying he's not sure what he wants at this time and he knows I'm looking for something serious, and doesn't want to play games with me. However if it's what I want he'd love to be friends still. I messaged back saying I love his honesty but that's not quite what I meant. He said he's confused and I then sent him a message asking him to meet up to talk and so far he hasn't answered. Was that him taking the nice way out? Or just my bad communication? Cuz if he is still interested in carrying on what we had going I'd love that. However if he's not feeling anything and wants to cut his losses I'm ok with that. I'd rather it's done now\n",

I do feel very sexual and I am so very grateful of my body and looks, but I have always had a weird relationship with my sexuality and the idea of “giving” myself to another person. So it was my first relationship, lasted for about three years (we kissed after 8 months, had intimate relations 1,5 years into it). It was very deep in a superficial way I seem to think now, he saw me (he a friend of my cousin, M27) and decided/pursued the relationship and I was naive, and said yes eventually because he was persistent (he is not a bad man, but I would not have been with him if he had accepted my no’s). I think we both had issues and allowed our comfortabilities and codependency to trap us. We didn’t communicate well, I had no idea what I was doing (growing up with not much knowledge of how to be a girl ?) after trust issues from both parts, we decided to end the relationship. I then found out I was pregnant, he wanted the kids  but was still supportive when I decided to abort. We both have been civil since the break-up (rarely get I miss you texts) he is usually toxic, but he stopped after a while and now he is in a relationship and acting very respectful towards me (we move in the same circles).

      "Staying with someone after a broken engagement? Should I  30 ) stay with my boyfriend  30 ) of 4 years after this? We planned to be engaged sometime post thanksgiving of this year ( we decided on an engagement party this weekend after thanksgiving) and the time and location of the proposal and the large after-party were going to be a surprise for me. We had been discussing this for a year and my parents and all my family members were told that an engagement was coming in november. My bf and I are both indian (I'm from an extremely conservative religious family even tho I'm not myself) and engagements are something that is discussed with the family and approval is absolutely needed. Everything was set and I had given my bf an engagement party guest list for my side so he could invite them and we had gone ring shopping multiple times so he knew exactly what I wanted. I bought 2 gowns for this event and was giddy for literally months. I was so excited for this moment and I felt like I had been ready to move our relationship forward because I knew he was the one. I loved him so much. ALso,we had just gotten a dog together and had been co-parenting for a couple of months. We dont live together (because of my ultra-conservative family) but live a short walk away from eachother. We had discussed getting married  in 2 years with a long engagement. Throughout the past at least 6 months- I would verify with him NUMEROUS times to ensure that an engagement was actually happening and I wasnt just getting my hopes up. I finally sensed he was getting cold feet a couple of weeks before and confronted him and of course- he tells me he's not ready and its not,me it's him. I HAD to call each and every single person of my friends on my list and tell them that the party was off because it took him until the last second to even cancel it and took him even longer to muster up an apology text to any of them. He had to reimburse multiple flights tickets because people from all over the country were flying into manhattan for this. It was beyond humiliating for me to have to deal with this and he claims to still want to be with me but married  could be years down the line with no timeline given. I just need some sort of a commitment from him- I'm not trying to wait forever and I've made that clear. He's killed all hopes and dreams that I had about a proposal and I'm trying not to care about that because in the end- a happy engagement and married  is more important than any party but it truly is devastating and humiliating. I have never had a birthday party or any event where people actually did anything for me so this stung even more to have any hope of that crushed. My friends all hate him now and dont want anything to do with him anymore and give me attitude for even staying with him. I dont even know how I feel. How should I even move forward? Would you stay with a man who did this to you? I feel like I've been left at the altar and it wasn't even a wedding. Im just devastated and I dont know how to be hopeful anymore.\n",

I use several dating apps as it isn’t easy to meet people IRL where I live (covid, I work mostly alone, not many men my age in my immediate area etc). I have found that most men who match me on apps and even pursue meeting up with me eventually reveal that they are primarily interested in sex. I am wondering if this is the norm for men in their mid to late twenties or early thirties? Or could it be something I am doing that attracts this type of man?

We’ve been having challenges scheduling our second date as we are both really busy and have been transparent with what’s been making us busy. Last Monday he asked for Wednesday but I wasn’t free so I said Tuesday or Thursday? He said that both those days would be hard but he’ll try. Tuesday comes and I didn’t hear from him so at 5pm I ask if I’ll be seeing him that night. He apologizes for not messaging me earlier and says that he can’t. Asks if there’s another day I would be free. I said Thursday I’m still available and Friday might work but I wasn’t sure at that time. Thursday comes and he messaged me a huge paragraph in the morning that he won’t be able to make it for today but essentially wants me to know he’s still interested and that we should aim for Friday or the weekend if I have the time. I said “I hope Friday will work!” And he hearted the message and told me he hopes I have a good day and I hearted that message. Friday comes and nothing. I felt I reached out already and this time he should. Or perhaps he was thinking the weekend instead since he said Friday or the weekend. It just wasn’t clear but I made other plans and let it go.

We split everything and activities/food are really expensive in the city which I need to get better at budgeting for. I haven't moved out because I don't think I can afford an apartment, save money, and have money for fun at my current income. My question is do I tell him why I don't want to go on vacation anymore?

      "I am not someone that uses social media. I was raised largely without internet, and only started using it freely a few months before college. Throughout highschool and college I didn't care about dating. This wasn't for lack of girl 's interest in me, or my lack of attraction to them, I just had a very deep seated superiority complex and felt like every girl  I met was beneath me. I've also always been very utilitarian, and thought dating/dances were a waste of time and money. I've been in only one short relationship at the start of college nearly 4 years ago, but really it was more of an experiment than a relationship (doesn't that sound fun).\n",
      "\n",
      "&amp;nbsp;\n",
      "\n",
      "I tried OLD once or twice for not more than a day or two during college out of curiosity, and was quickly disinterested for reasons everyone is well aware of (and maybe some lesser known) which I'll detail below. But, in the last month I've been giving OLD a more serious look, both because I'm now ready to invest in a relationship and as an informal research project.[2][3]\n",
      "\n",
      "&amp;nbsp;\n",
      "\n",
      "When I look at the dating pool as the set of all women (in my case) fulfilling age and language criteria, I realize that the set pretty much only gets smaller as time goes on.  People die, and are taken. The only way for it to grow is through divorce /break ups. Now, I'm not a believer in the traditional stereotype of a \"soul mate,\" but even if I were, \"the one\" for each of us is someone who (presumably) already exists somewhere on this planet. Online Dating should theoretically be capable of helping us all find that person at least as fast as, if not significantly faster than, traditional dating.\n",
      "\n",
      "&amp;nbsp;\n",
      "\n",
      "Why do I care? Well, first of all, obviously, I'd like a better option to use myself. I can only imagine most women similar to me are not on OLD. Second of all, there's a collection of macroscopic problems that I think humanity doesn't realize is holding us back, and I believe our inelegant dating \"system\" is one of them. If you're familiar with the concept of keystone habits, a habit that tends to affect many if not all other habits in your life (like exercise), recognize that a relationship is possibly the greatest keystone out there as it has potential to create and destroy other keystone habits. I think a drastic improvement to the way we find relationships has the potential to percolate into every aspect of human development.\n",

      "## Why OLD doesn't work\n",
      "Some of these are obvious and well worn, some I may have missed, and hopefully some are new to you\n",
      "\n",
      "1. OLD by it's nature attracts mostly people that are tired, desperate, lonely, lazy, self absorbed, and/or horny (though some may hide these well)\n",
      "2. Frequent misrepresentation, both intentional and unintentional [4]\n",
      "3. Even those in it for the long haul aren't in it for the long haul (they'll probably dump the app within a week)\n",
      "4. Instant gratification is a plague. OLD apps profit off of addiction same as most highly profitable mobile apps. By virtue of addiction it's increasingly impossible to settle on someone the longer you use the service as a craving forms for seeing more profiles and more fantasizing. Actually investing in someone threatens to take away that addiction to fantasizing and breeds fear that maybe you could have lived a better fantasy.\n",
      "5. No accountability. No community.\n",
      "6. Inherently \"pump and dump.\" Users join the service with the intent to get rid of it as soon as possible, and the platform wants to extract as much money in that time as possible.\n",
      "7. Company gains nothing from you getting what you want out of the service\n",
      "8. Has very little coverage of the dating pool, and coverage is intermittent (the \"one\" could have joined and left last week and you'd never know it)\n",
      "9. Impressions are wildly inaccurate, even just seeing a video with audio rather than a still image of the person drives up the chances of you liking them significantly (who'd have thought animation and emotion was important?). There's often a mismatch between writing voice and speaking voice as well (as is certainly the case for me)\n",
      "10. Virtually no feedback whatsoever (you're lack of success could literally be due to one poorly worded line in your bio)\n",
      "11. No relativity. We like to see progress. People are so bad at writing bios they can't really give you a good picture of whether their life is on an upward trend of improvement, which is usually more important than where they're at in the moment. Someone may be \"in the negative\" in terms of how successful they are overall, but if they're on an upward trend a healthy relationship can help accelerate that progress. Instead, OLD keeps people chained to hoping that someone will come along and reverse their descent.\n",
      "12. Does little to nothing to prevent or expose \"Black Swans\" (things you don't know that you don't know which hit you out of the blue, commonly including debt levels, kids ren, polyamory, medical conditions, etc.). Sometimes people tell you about these, sometimes they don't... and there's no way for you to warn others if they didn't.\n",
      "13. Someone you've unmatched with can make profile updates, and on top of that will hopefully be a different person in 6 months. You'll never know unless you reset your matches or make a new profile\n",
      "14. Oriented more towards restrictions than setting baseline expectations. The way information is presented tends to make people seem immovable on things that might merely be preferences or learned behaviors that are subject to change.\n",
      "15. Many seem to have adopted a \"hell yes/no\" mentality and OLD's binary decisions fuel this (IMO it has it's merits in person, but not when operating on the skewed/incomplete view that OLD presents)\n",
      "16. OLD does such an inadequate job of superficial filtration on such an inadequate subset of the dating pool that we ourselves are forced to become algorithmic filters and invariably spend most of our time filtering rather than giving each person serious consideration\n",
      "17. Most OLD only allows photo's of/containing you with no coverings like helmets. Good in some sense, but if you're, say, into Motocross, or want to show off photos of pottery you made, they'll remove the photos. Generally the way around this would be to link an Instagram... assuming the service allows that and you have one (I don't, and won't)\n",
      "18. Merely signing up opens you (and bots) to all profiles in the service.\n",
      "19. Very transactional and inorganic 30 . Profits off of hope (as many successful ventures do) 30 . Doesn't do a good job of teasing out how self aware people are. (In my observations, relationships can thrive despite not sharing all the same interests, but don't thrive when there's mismatched levels of self awareness) 30 . Some apps save profiles that could potentially be a good match in their exclusive club behind a pay wall (assuming those are real profiles)[5]\n",

      "\n",
      "I believe most people have dating a little backwards. If you wan't to get fit, you don't go to an amusement park. Most long term investments in life are hard before they're fun. So it perplexes me why people insist on \"having lots of fun\" (or some emotional equivalent) being their criteria for pursuing a relationship. Feeling a \"spark\" is overrated; though, fire is a good symbol for a lot of relationships. It's intense, consumes a lot of energy, and burns till there's nothing left or until something suffocates it.\n",
      "\n",
      "&amp;nbsp;\n",

Start off with the negatives, the baggage, and the challenges Instead of using your SO as a way to satisfy an emotional craving or trying to gauge whether they're successful enough, fun enough, and attractive enough. We should be trying to gauge whether or not we can be an effective team together, not whether we're good enough for each other (and yes, health and attraction play a part in being a healthy team). Having a \"Whole greater than the sum of it's parts\" mentality over a \"Missing piece\" mentality. Seems to me, from my limited life and internet experience, that most people get to the point where they're jaded dating veterans in their 30 's and 40 's or higher before they start off with the baggage to avoid wasting each other's time. (I'd rather start while I'm young, thank you)\n",
      "\n",
      "&amp;nbsp;\n",
      "\n",
      "From my observations, virtually anyone can open up to be a fun, relaxed, spontaneous, etc. kind of person if you both have a good foundation. So the \"are we having enough fun\" metric is foolish.\n",

      "&amp;nbsp;\n",
      "\n",
      "A lot of my thinking lately is influenced in part by the books \"The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People\" and \"Atomic Habits.\" 7HOHEP talks about how, as virtuous as some of the following centers may seem, it's detrimental to live a life centered on family, spouse, kids ren, career, self, enemies, friends, role models, etc. rather than being centered on principle. Doing so is often like using another boat as an anchor in a storm. Atomic Habits addresses the fact that one reason so many people fail to change habits is because they are focused on outcomes rather than identity. The difference between \"I'm going to exercise today\" because \"I want to lose 50lbs\" vs \"I'm an athlete and that's what I do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "&amp;nbsp;\n",
      "\n",
      "One thing they jointly made me realize is that most people I know live almost exclusively outcome centered lives regardless of how centered they are on family, spouse, etc. Being outcome centered is the true opposite of being Principle centered. What was the outcome of that date? Was it fun enough? Did they contribute enough? Do I feel cheated? Was I bored? Did I get enough material to show off on social media? Did I get enough approval from friends and family?\n",
      "\n",
      "&amp;nbsp;\n",
      "\n",
      "You're only going to be an effective team, or at the very least a happy individual, if you know what your Principles are (past a vague \"don't be mean\" mentality), and if your principles mostly match up. Then in the dating scenario, the quality of the date is measured by how honest, attentive, etc. you were, regardless of how \"well\" it went. Good outcomes tend to flow naturally from good principles, but even when they don't you're not distressed because you followed your principles and that's the stick you measure with.\n",

      "&amp;nbsp;\n",
      "\n",

      "5. Mitigate bots with more than just 2fa \n",
      "6. Give users complete control over their information\n",

      "\n",
      "&amp;nbsp;\n",
      "\n",
      "## How do we get there?\n",
      "##### Open Source and Free\n",
      "For the sake of all humanity, we need an open source application that is completely free. Not \"freemium.\" Not \"sign up so we can sell your data.\" **Free**! It needs to be viewed more like a public park or utility that everyone has access to in order to become ubiquitous.\n",
      "\n",
      "&amp;nbsp;\n",
      "\n",
      "Frankly, OLD feels scummy. The ways they make money is the second largest motivator in my mind for dumping them, and a large part of why many people never invest in them in the first place. A lot of people aren't committed to OLD and are stuck in a state of \"testing the waters.\" In order for a good alternative to be ubiquitous it's going to have to be free and not make users feel insecure about what information they put into the service or like they're being taken advantage of for money.\n",
      "\n",
      "&amp;nbsp;\n",
      "\n",
      "##### Anti-On-Demand\n",
      "As stated, it also shouldn't be habit forming or time consuming. Trimming down matches is one way to do that. But there's a better solution. One that initially may or may not seem appealing, but not only will it work, it will also make it possible for something with such an enormous user base to be open source and free.\n",
      "\n",
      "&amp;nbsp;\n",
      "\n",
      "Servers, storage, and bandwidth aren't cheap when you have a huge user base. By using a primarily serverless architecture, minimizing how much user data is stored, and following a weekly schedule for updating matches en masse, we should be able to minimize costs (from preliminary investigation on what tool chain to use, Blazor WASM with Azure Functions looks very promising if you're curious).\n",
      "\n",
      "&amp;nbsp;\n",
      "\n",
      "Updates only happening at set intervals has several other effects too. First, it makes the act of logging on and seeing matches more of an occasion than a pastime. Second, in the context of habit prevention, it aids in distancing the cue and craving from the reward. Third, it's not only more respectful of people's time, but also drastically increases the chances of users being available simultaneously since it coalesces people into a tighter time frame. Last, it shifts the general feel from an always-on mentality to a project mentality. This does thwart feedback somewhat considering you'd have to wait a week to see what effects your profile changes had, but I'd argue it prevents manic profile tweaking without giving changes enough time to stew and would make users more intentional and committed to profile completion.\n",
      "\n",
      "&amp;nbsp;\n",
      "\n",
      "##### Variable Barriers to Entry\n",
      "In order to mitigate bot/uncommitted contacts, no one would get access to all the profiles on the site simply by signing up. There would be various communities[6] with stipulations attached to them. E.g. I join the writers community and college football community, which means in order for anyone to see my messaging info or like me they'd have to, say, write me a memoir and tell me their favorite team (each community would have a selection of criteria to choose from).\n",
      "\n",
      "&amp;nbsp;\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to the community aspect, another barrier which could be one of the main draws of the service would be a \"give and get\" functionality. If you make your photos blurred, everyone else's photos will be blurred. If you make your age private everyone else's will be private. If you don't have a photo you don't get to see photos. If you want to see someone's bio you'll have to fill out yours first.\n",
      "\n",
      "&amp;nbsp;\n",
      "\n",
      "Another potential barrier to entry is requiring a 30  day waiting period after making a profile before you can participate. This could be reduced or eliminated with friend endorsements.\n",
      "\n",
      "&amp;nbsp;\n",
      "\n",
      "##### Semi-automatic\n",
      "In an effort to further abate us becoming algorithmic filtering machines, a good service should have some date scheduling functionality and a basic visual calendar. It should be commitment based. You'd tell it what times you absolutely cannot have a date, and give it one block of guaranteed availability and it will try to work with that (among other preferences and optional tweaks). There would be a combination of request-based and automatic scheduling, and the scheduler would, for example, take into account favorite dating locations and try to schedule multiple consecutive dates with minimized travel (this is drastically oversimplified for brevity, this will be quite a complex feature). Most likely, the scheduler would not show you anything about the person you're going on a date with (or at the least have a very reduced view), and have no option to reschedule[7]. Flaking out or getting antsy is a common problem, and I think having a bit of mystery will make people more inclined not to do that (FOMO).\n",
      "\n",
      "&amp;nbsp;\n",
      "\n",
      "Ideally, busy professionals and people that just generally don't care to waste time on the service should be able to spend a week or two setting up their profile and start having dates show up on their calendar; allowing use of the service almost without intervention.\n",
      "\n",
      "&amp;nbsp;\n",
      "\n",
      "Going with the theme of accountability, and the fact that the intent of OLD is indeed to go on dates, users would be able to see before liking someone how many dates someone has canceled or not shown up to. And after going on a date would be prompted to record that info.[8][9]\n",
      "\n",
      "&amp;nbsp;\n",
      "\n",
      "##### More comprehensive profile information and control\n",
      "A wider variety of data, such as: your reading list, bands and podcasts you listen to, youtube subscriptions, discord servers, places you've lived, favorite dating locations/events/activities, what room temperature you prefer, what kind of driver you are, and much more should optionally be part of your profile just as much as the standard hobbies/interests, schooling, and demographic information. And not only available, but recorded over time (so you could, for example, see if the person you fancy is currently listening to a band you used to listen to and vice versa). Data items could be both built-in (like demographic info) as well as be user generated submissions to communities. Everyone in the community would vote for which data items they think are most relevant and the top ones would then be available to attach to your profile if you are part of that community.\n",
      "\n",
      "&amp;nbsp;\n",
      "\n",
      "An integral part of the vision involves every data item having user managed settings for whether it's: publicly visible, private to different levels, manually requested/revealed, stored only locally, and backed up remotely. For example, maybe I'd like my Twitter revealed to anyone that likes me, my Instagram revealed to anyone I match with, and my phone number only revealed upon request if I confirm it.

That's why when you go on a date you usually have a pre-established non-rejection exit strategy, like picking someone up afterwards. It puts bounds on the date, and closes the loop.

      "\n",
      "- Blind dates. You don't know anything about your match (except that you got matched).

      "\n",
      "- Doing away with Like/Dislike. You can only friend people. You go through and friend, say 30  people (notice the discrete number) and have either group hang outs, a speed dating session, or a set amount of  days to message each other (all three are discrete time chunks, closed loops). Then you signify which people you'd like to go on a date with. For each person that signifies the same by the deadline, the automated scheduling will schedule dates for two or more weeks in the future to give it some space. Which people you end up meeting again would be a surprise.\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "#### Beyond dating\n",
      "An important part of tearing down the \"what's in it for me\" mentality encouraged by OLD is establishing some more permanence to profiles outside of just dating. Naturally, if profiles exist outside of the dating context the service would need relationship statuses (like Facebook). As for whether these should be publicly visible, I suppose it's best to leave that up to the user as with all other data items, but it would be necessary for scheduling. In some ways this changes the service to be more like a standard social network, but my vision for it has key distinctions. Most notably, social networks are predisposed towards mob/elitist mentality and tribalism, and we want to avoid that.\n",
      "\n",
      "&amp;nbsp;\n",
      "\n",
      "Rather than a service where you mindlessly scroll through endless content, reading and reacting for everyone to see, the social network aspect of the site will be more oriented towards individuals. Users would have a limited number of posts in their feed, and these would primarily be posts about different relationship scenarios[10] (mostly originating from profiles they've closely matched, or highly popular scenarios). Fore example, \"your SO just turned the AC on right after you turned it off, what do you do?\" Given that the site objective isn't building a social network, I'm not sure whether you'd have friends or not and be able to see and compare their reactions (over-comparison is another thing we'd like to avoid), but you'd certainly not be able to see the general public's reactions (remember, data conservation, bounds, non-habit-forming, anti-mob). You would, however, be able to see matches' and likes'  reactions after you'd answered yourself, which is in line with the site's objectives and \"give and get\" policy.\n",
      "\n",
      "&amp;nbsp;\n",
      "\n",
      "This feature may seem passably interesting, but it's actually quite important both in and outside of dating. Even after you're long off the market, you can still log on and find important questions you may not have considered that can prepare you mentally for the real thing. For example, maybe you are having a kids  soon and never considered how you're going to manage getting enough sleep. After seeing the question and considering, you realize you need to plan for baby-watching shifts so you and you're SO can alternate sleeping. Seeing other's answers may give you even further considerations.\n",
      "\n",
      "&amp;nbsp;\n",
      "\n",
      " Note that the relevance of posts to an individual would largely be assessed by relationship status, so we would need more granularity than Facebook has. Such as recently single, just married , expecting, etc., and that in combination with whether or not they're currently looking to be in a relationship or off the market (recently single and not looking would naturally get different content than recently single and looking, for example).\n",
      "\n",
      "&amp;nbsp;\n",
      "\n",
      "Mentorship, in my mind, is another important thing that current OLD lacks. Some may currently use reddit and other social media for advice, but these have the same lack of exposure problem as OLD. Surrounding typical OLD you hear a lot from those that are unsuccessful, but when someone actually is successful most tend to just disappear and move on with their (now much busier) lives. A better service might feature their story, and  graduate those with long term relationships to a mentorship role. The service, in effect, would have its own 'influencers' or pseudo-dating-coaches. Users could browse and follow successful relationships and read their stories, and even potentially sign up for group sessions with those mentors (whether in-person or online) or message them personally for advice or questions. The mentors themselves would of course decide whether they want to be a part of this and there would be no money in it for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "&amp;nbsp;\n",
      "\n",
      "##### Kairos\n",
      "OLD doesn't do enough to take your life's timeline into account. Sure, you may live in New York, and that distance from L.A. might be a deal breaker for \"the one.\" As much as we'd like to think we'd do anything for the right person, the fact is that you probably wouldn't make long distance work unless you at least already had a well established relationship. But it's possible that the person is considering, or in the process of, moving. Or will soon be on vacation or business near you. Or might be open to moving depending on the place.\n",
      "\n",
      "&amp;nbsp;\n",
      "\n",
      "There are two features I have in mind to address this that go hand in hand. One, a heat map of your matches, with the temperature based on match percentage. Two, the ability to drop pins on the map to signify either places you're considering moving to, places you frequently travel to, places you have relatives, or more. This, for one, addresses the problem of people always changing their location on OLD. Mostly they do this to explore, and pin dropping on the heat map where they have a higher concentration of matches should satisfy that itch. For two, the heat map could actually influence moving decisions. Since this is a community building service, after all, you could potentially extend the heat map to include communities and not just matches, and find a place you'd like to move to.\n",
      "\n",
      "&amp;nbsp;\n",
      "\n",
      "Another aspect of Kairos we've already covered is more granular relationship status. Further than just considering what has recently happened and what you're ready for, a good service should take into account your timeline expectations. I.e  I may be someone looking for long term, but I may still expect to get married  pretty quickly; conversely, I may want a short term relationship of several months before getting serious, followed by a long term before married . Those recently single may be immediately ready to get back out there, or they may want to wait a few months. So, there should be expected durations attached to statuses along with Q&amp;A oriented towards timeline. We could potentially also take into account how long people expect to stay at their job, how long they expect it will be before they want kids ren, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "&amp;nbsp;\n",
      "\n",
      "Last, I had considered whether or not there might be an elegant way to track the 5 health aspects in a way that isn't tedious and requiring constant updates, so people could get a better idea of what kind of life progress their potential matches are making and whether they're on similar enough pathways. But that actually already exists in the form of communities and tracking data items over time (e.g, someone may be in weight-loss, therapy, investment, etc. communities).\n",

We leaned on eachother in hard times and cheered eachother on as we put in our best efforts to get everything we wanted out of life.

You only want to do something when you feel like it, you want to be free in case you get a better offer, and you do not care that I may have something else going on.  Listen, I don't need for someone to pencil me in and book me out a month in advance.  But if you cannot even commit a day or even a few hours before for a coffee or lunch date, then I don't know what to tell you.

If you suddenly want to get lunch on my day off immediately, guess what?  I am in work out clothes and possibly knee deep scrubbing the shower.

      "\n",
      "1) I am generally unwanted. It’s fine, it’s just what I am. Plenty of evidence to support this statement. My odds have not been good at all apparently.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Women don’t owe me anything. That’s the way the world works. We all live in our own worlds and we only involve other people in our worlds if we choose to let them in. We don’t owe anybody an entrance into our world. Except kids ren probably unless you want to be that hardcore about this “I’m free!” shit. But this is the reality. So don’t expect women to give two shits about any struggle you have. They have no reason to. You aren’t a part of their world and they don’t want to let you in if they don’t want to. And they are well within their rights there.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Dating is not fair. There’s no system to regulate dating to keep it fair or anything like that. It’s the wild west. You may be completely screwed. That is possible and if you are there is no protection. Good luck.\n",
      "\n",
      "4) Dating is complicated. There’s a lot of different types of men and women out there and as individuals they can each be into anything they want to be into. Trying to understand and control the process, short of basic things like having good hygiene, are likely to have very limited influence over your outcome. You can subscribe to any philosophy you choose but there’s no guarantee it will be right and anything generalized and simple almost certainly is not.\n",
      "\n",
      "5) Feeling entitled is not cool and will not be appreciated by anyone. Nothing I do or am earns me a date or anything. Another reason to avoid getting too excited about the “better yourself” frame of mind. There’s a fine line between thinking like that and feeling entitled about your “successes” while bettering yourself. You may or may not be a commodity but no one is compelled by anything to necessarily see any value or worth in what you are selling unless they happen to feel that way. And they’ll know if they do. Just because a friend or family member does doesn’t mean anyone else will.\n",

      "So when you put all this together, if trying really hard doing the basics for a reasonable amount of time didn’t work at all, it may just be best to stop trying hard, keep meeting new people, but stop caring so much about dating. Just be open to it if you run into a good match. But start to figure out how to be okay being single the rest of your life in case you have to. One way or another that’s the correct approach that falls in line with all of this and factors in the reality that at a certain point the fatigue kicks in\n",

      "First date-check So, I recently signed up for a matchmaking service (kinda on the expensive side) and had a first date with a lady they set me up with. At first it was awkward for a few minutes but then things opened up. It felt good to laugh and interact with a lady in that setting. Towards the end she said she didn’t know about any romantic feelings but wanted to explore and exchange numbers and at the very least try friends. I agreed. I’m hoping things continue to progress and am proud for stepping outside my confront zone. Best of luck to all!!\n",

Used to hooking up with girl  at parties was satisfactory and having short flings with girl  that came out on the weekends with me was kind of standard. Now that I’m in my 30 ’s, I’ve been trying work on establishing an ltr, but I can’t seem to really get anything serious going. In my mind, seeing someone once or twice a week is generally all my time allows for. Many of the women Ik and find still work bartending or non-standard shift jobs, so there’s literally no time that my free time and there’s overlap.

      "The Hidden Man I am a man who is 30  years old and definitely not your every day kind of person. Not one day in my life. I am posting this because of the person I am and a needs be of a hidden identity. My past is kind of dark and my viewpoint of life is incredibly esoteric and maybe even almost a kind of depth and darkness I think only a very special woman could handle. But at the same time, a kind of light. \n",

I can speak poetry with my lips and I can speak quickly and deeply like the devil himself. I have a kind of charm about me that to say the least is almost, spiritual. If you can think of the Phantom of the Opera, It is me in some regards. I sing also. I am a man who is totally in love with life, to a very specific channeling of worshipping the universe in a way that is mystic. I am a loner and a zeitgeist. A hidden king and a hidden prince. I am unlike any person you will meet. I am realizing that my love and sex and lust are not capable of being expressed with any simple woman. My depth of personality, my nature, my darkness needs to be with someone who is as of the same mystique. I am like a man who is of the same sort as both the devil and Christ in some regards. But I don't want to be. It was who I was created as. Who I am becoming. I have studied Christianity, the occult, and psychology deeply. I love Carl Jung and I love the aspects of spirituality that are real. Meaning and saying, I have the same experiences in the mind as mystics from generations past. I am actually speaking rationally, and have done a great deal of research on these topics and what kind of people experience it. I am a writer like Walt Whitman, and he himself was mystical in his understanding of the world.\n",
